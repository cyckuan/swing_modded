PROTESTER: AIRLINE SECURITY POLICY TARGETS BLACKS

<P>
   Manuel Gray entered Sky Harbor International Airport's Terminal
4 in a suit and tie and a crisply pressed white shirt, holding a
designer garment bag and matching carry-on.
</P>
<P>
   A social worker who stands 6-foot-4 and has impeccable posture
and a shaved head, Gray passed smoothly through the airport's X-ray
checkpoint.
</P>
<P>
   He's also Black.
</P>
<P>
   And he says that's the main reason a Southwest Airlines employee
pulled him and a friend, also African-American, out of line at the
boarding gate and announced that she needed to search their
luggage.
</P>
<P>
   Right there. On the counter top. In front of all the other
passengers in the terminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``She pulled out all my underwear and toiletries,'' said Gray, a
father of three who coaches YMCA youth leagues and volunteers at
his daughters' school.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been so humiliated,'' he said of the February 1997
incident. ``I'm the ultimate clean-cut guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he watched dozens of people get boarding passes. No
one else was searched, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray claims he is a victim of ``racial profiling,'' in which
minorities are said to be targeted because of the color of their
skin.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, Gray took his protest back to the scene of his
embarrassment, picketing with three others outside Terminal 4 with
signs with such messages as ``Southwest Airlines supports consumer
racism.''
</P>
<P>
   He also has a lawsuit pending against the airline in U.S.
District Court in Phoenix seeking $15 million in damages for
emotional distress, discrimination, harassment and other related
claims.
</P>
<P>
   His is part of a growing wave of complaints about the so-called
profiling practice.
</P>
<P>
   With airline security tightening amid terrorist bombings and the
TWA Flight 800 crash, minorities are feeling the squeeze at the
airport, according to news reports in such media outlets as ``USA
Today'' and ``CNN''.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Laurence Boze, a Black lawyer and past president of
the National Bar Association, complained when his luggage was
searched in front of other travelers at Baltimore/Washington
International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   A US Airways gate agent reportedly told him he was detained
because he fit a profile designed to increase security at airports.
</P>
<P>
   Civil liberties groups have reported a rise in complaints from
Arab Americans and Black passengers saying they were targeted for
airport luggage searches, news reports say.
</P>
<P>
   When members of President Clinton's race panel discussed racial
profiling by law enforcement officials, moderator and Harvard Law
School Professor Charles J. Ogletree Jr. told of his experience
traveling the world as a Black man.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had been stopped numerous times by airport drug
enforcement officers who suspected him of drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Courts have said that race can be among the factors used in
determining whether a suspect should be questioned, but several
panelists suggested that can result in discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   After Gray was searched last year at Sky Harbor, he demanded to
know why he was searched. Through his questioning of the female
airline employee, he learned that he fit a profile set by the
Federal Aviation Administration, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She basically told us we paid in cash, we looked suspicious,
and we were African-American,'' said Gray, 39.
</P>
<P>
   Southwest Airline officials could not be reached for comment
Saturday at their corporate office in Dallas. Other airline and
airport employees, however, said race is not a criterion used to
determine whether to search a passenger.
</P>
<P>
   Airline employees are prohibited from disclosing the criteria.
But employees and news reports point to several red flags: paying
with cash, buying a one-way ticket, purchasing a ticket within 48
hours of a departure time and booking a flight with no connections.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, a targeted individual fits at least two of the criteria
in order for a search, one airport employee said.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said he paid for his $39 ticket with cash, although he
booked the round-trip flight two weeks in advance.
</P>
<P>
   If people are going to be targeted based on the profile of a
terrorist bomber, then Blacks should be left alone, Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, they should be pulling over people who look like
Timothy McVeigh,'' he said, referring to the man sentenced to die
for the Oklahoma City bombing.
</P>
<P>
   But two White passengers said that they or friends had been
pulled out of lines in the past year to be searched. They said they
had purchased last-minute tickets or had paid in cash.
</P>
<P>
   Gray felt his treatment went beyond mere security measures.
</P>
<P>
   A former prison and juvenile corrections detention officer, Gray
said the incident left him depressed and withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like this had ever happened to me before,'' he said.
``So when this happened to me, it shook my confidence in this
country to the foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the incident, he spent months just ``going to work and
coming straight back home'' because he felt so humiliated, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped socializing, withdrew from his children and wife and
started drinking more alcohol.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he said, he pulled himself out of his depression and
decided to start protesting at the airport to educate others. &QL;

MLS TOOK EASY WAY OUT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL HOLLEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Twenty-thousand dollars could solve a few household
problems, no? That's an impressive pile of loot, especially if you
happened to wake up one day to find that crisp stack of green
suddenly bulging from your bank account. Or missing from it. Wave
around cash like that and you could buy yourself into many options.
</P>
<P>
   But $20,000 is not enough to buy you out of one thing:
insincerity. Last time we checked, insincerity didn't have a price
tag.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Gorter obviously doesn't understand that, even though he
is $20,000 poorer than he was this time last week. Gorter, a New
England Revolution midfielder, came to town with a reputation as a
creative playmaker. Apparently he is not as skilled with his choice
of words. Or maybe he is, as long as the person he is talking to
isn't wearing dark skin.
</P>
<P>
   During a Revolution practice last week, Gorter got into an
argument with teammate David Nakhid and eventually called him a
``black (expletive).'' The men then exchanged punches before being
separated. Nakhid is a black man from Trinidad and Tobago. Gorter
is a white man from Holland. The Revolution quickly alerted Major
League Soccer about the incident, and 48 hours later, Gorter was
ordered to pay the largest fine in league history ($20,000). He
also was suspended for two games and told to issue a public apology
to Nakhid.
</P>
<P>
   And that was it. So now everyone is supposed to move on and
maybe pay attention to the league's conference finals. All
consciences are supposed to be clear. Maybe someone can dig into
their record crates, find an extended remix of ``We Are The
World,'' and arrange for a group shot of the Revolution holding
hands.
</P>
<P>
   How foolish. How incomplete. How typical of well-intentioned
people who truly cannot grasp their ignorance.
</P>
<P>
   You can start with the act itself. Many Revolution players can
tell you that there has always been tension between Gorter and
Nakhid. Apparently, Gorter had been upset with his teammate, also a
midfielder, for not switching to sweeper early in the season when
it was obvious defensive help was needed. So Gorter played the
position for a while, unhappily. It is possible that Gorter
believed his teammate to be selfish, regardless of his complexion.
But the fact that he felt it necessary to put ``black'' in front of
his insult makes him at least color-struck, if not a racist.
</P>
<P>
   For those wondering, Gorter did not use the n-word but he did
use an obscenity that refers to female anatomy. His vocabulary is
his business. But if his true problem with his teammate was that he
thought he was a jerk, why not say that? Here's one reason: That
wasn't the only problem. And that's something the MLS should have
considered.
</P>
<P>
   But after all the proper words from the league, the fine, and
the prepared apology from Gorter, guess what still hasn't happened?
Gorter still hasn't apologized personally to Nakhid. According to
Nakhid, the men have not spoken since the incident. That's why I
say forget the apology, especially if Gorter doesn't know what he
is apologizing for. If he truly meant what he said, it would be
smarter for the league to confront the problem rather than bury it
under $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   I would like to see the Revolution and the league set up a
televised press conference in a section of Boston where Caribbean
people live, maybe in Mattapan where Nakhid eats and gets his hair
cut. Invite the community. Then ask Gorter to repeat what he said
to Nakhid and ask him why he said it. And then allow the public to
ask both parties questions.
</P>
<P>
   Risky? No doubt. The league would have to provide a virtual
security army. But at least Gorter would truly be accountable for
his words (he certainly isn't accountable now). This session would
not heal him, of course. Racism and its byproducts travel through
bodies like a raging virus. But the result would be more lasting
than a flimsy apology. The result, in fact, could educate people on
the worldwide epidemic of hate and supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Such a forum could happen if the MLS were interested in change.
But the league followed a connect-the-dots grid to dealing with the
problem. Act quickly. Impose a fine. Issue a public statement. All
of that happened, but what didn't happen was a lengthy discussion
with Nakhid and his representatives. Nakhid's agent and lawyer are
based in Los Angeles and said they needed more time to travel
across the country. The league didn't get it; it should have. There
should have been no deadlines on finding the truth. But the league
had to get this incident out of the news so the soccer public could
focus on the games.
</P>
<P>
   After all its failings, the MLS still has a chance to do
something right. It can take Gorter's $20,000 and turn it into a
scholarship fund for a Caribbean student. And when it came time for
presenting the check, Gorter could hand over the money and explain
to the student why his $20,000 was going to someone else's fund
rather than to his own bank account. If that happened, the
Revolution midfielder might be on his way to understanding the true
meaning of a personal revolution.

RANGER REMARKS SIMPLY PRICELESS 
</HEADLINE>
 NOTEBOOK-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a mind-boggling development, right up there with
man biting dog, Dewey defeating Truman, the Titanic missing the
iceberg.
</P>
<P>
   Someone has accused the Bruins of being generous, bank-breaking
spendthrifts! Quick, call the cops!
</P>
<P>
   After the Bruins' final exhibition game against the Rangers in
Hartford a week ago, New York general manager Neil Smith railed
about Harry Sinden to the New York media.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, who to that point had been unable to sign center Manny
Malhotra, the club's first-round pick (No. 7 overall) in the June
draft, was furious that the Bruins had, in Smith's mind, screwed up
the entry-level system with their signings of first-round picks
Sergei Samsonov and Joe Thornton a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boston coughed up bonuses on Thornton and Samsonov and now the
floodgates are open,'' said Smith, who is against giving players
individual bonuses. ``The Bruins ruined it for everybody because
they paid Samsonov and Thornton all that money. Now, we're all
fighting tooth and nail with every high-level player.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden was both incredulous and amused, considering the Bruins'
longstanding (and not necessarily accurate) reputation for being
cheap. So, the Boston president/GM replied to Smith via fax
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote him a letter and asked his forgiveness,'' said Sinden.
``I really did. I hoped he could find a small place in his heart to
forgive me. I said, `Having set such an exemplary reputation as to
do with players' salaries, to upset you over this aspect of the
business is really bothering me.' From now on, before we do
anything like that or before we ever behave like that again, we'll
call him first.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinden's tongue-in-cheek response reflects the irony of the
situation. Smith's Rangers have one of the highest payrolls in the
league, which ownership told him to cut. In the past, that club has
overpaid for some over-the-hill free agents and absorbed some
less-than-worthwhile contracts. So the pot calling the kettle black
was worth more than a few guffaws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is funny,'' said Sinden. ``He couldn't get his player
signed so he had to turn somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, at the 11th hour, the Rangers did sign Malhotra,
giving him slightly more than Samsonov's package.
</P>
<P>
   When a Newsday reporter asked Sinden if it was the right
decision to keep Thornton up last year rather than send him back to
juniors, the Bruins' boss didn't miss a beat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, ``we probably should have checked with the
Rangers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Russian defenseman  &UR; Maxim Galanov  &LR; was snagged in the waiver
draft by Pittsburgh a week ago. One minute he was a Ranger on the
way to the first tee at the club's golf outing in Westchester
County, the next minute, he was an ex-Ranger. ``I'm not a good
golfer,'' said Galanov ... Straight man  &UR; Ron MacLean &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who cohosts
``Coaches Corner'' on CBC's ``Hockey Night in Canada'' with former
Bruin coach  &UR; Don Cherry &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said Cherry's personality makes him
think of a close relative. ``He reminds me of my mother,'' MacLean
said. ``Same blue eyes, same temper. My Mom probably thinks I'm
giving her a knock by saying she reminds me of Don, but I get a big
joy out of people like that. I'm glad somebody vents and feels free
to do it. I would hate us all to be too plastic.'' ... Bruins
forward  &UR; Ted Donato  &LR; set up a goal in his only exhibition game,
last Sunday against the Rangers. Do-nato, who had a good first half
last year and a rocky second half that led him to ask for a trade,
was walking out of Hartford Civic Center after the game and was
told that after just two practices he looked to be in midseason
form. ``Geez,'' he joked, ``did I look that bad?'' ... Give  &UR; Steve
Leach  &LR; credit for perseverance. The former Bruin forward had neck
surgery in March and was bought out by Carolina in the offseason.
He went to the Senators as a free agent and was impressive enough
in training camp to win a job. ``There was a big question mark
hanging over my career for a while there,'' said Leach, 32. ``I had
to wait and see how it was going to heal up. I knew how I would
have to feel to play again and that moment came at one point in the
summer. I knew then that I'd be playing again.'' ... Defenseman
 &UR; Stan Neckar  &LR; was the last of the Ottawa free agents to agree to
terms, but that doesn't mean he liked the pact. In fact, he hates
it. ``I'm not happy with it at all,'' said Neckar. ``But I came to
Ottawa to play hockey, not just sit around. I'm happy I can play
hockey again. I'm happy I'm going to be back with the team.''
Neckar will make $700,000 US this season, some $300,000 less than
he wanted. He could collect $75,000-$100,000 more in bonuses. The
22-year-old, who has a history of knee problems, played a total of
just 65 games in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For the second season in a row, the NHL has sent teams to start
the year in Japan. And for the second season in a row, lots of
people who had to travel that far are not happy about it. ``It's
ridiculous,'' said Sharks center  &UR; Bernie Nicholls &LR; . ``A fast start
is so important to having a good year, and we're traveling 10-11
hours, flying across the world to play two games in a city that
we'll never, ever see again. You tell me this makes any sense. It's
just another example of Western teams getting shafted. They say
that one day we'll see two New York teams going over there to play
_ yeah, sure, not in my lifetime.'' Nicholls's point is well taken.
The Bruins set themselves up very well last season by going 6-2-0
on their first trip of the year in October. Sharks coach  &UR; Darryl
Sutter  &LR; was even more pointed about the journey: He said it
wouldn't be a bad idea for the Sharks and Flames, coached by his
brother  &UR; Brian &LR; , &UR;  &LR; to go to Hawaii, spend the time on the beach, and
tell the league they'd gone to Japan and split the games.
Reportedly, the league then told Sutter to button his lip. Sutter
is one of the few NHLers who have experience in Japan. He started
his pro hockey career there, from August 1978 to February 1979, and
became rather fluent in the language. He played for a team in
Iwakura, not far from Sapporo, before coming home to join the
Blackhawks' farm team in New Brunswick and working his way up to
the NHL ... Kings coach  &UR; Larry Robinson  &LR; said during the offseason
that he considered not returning for the fourth and final year of
his contract. `` &UR; Cal Ripken  &LR; had that (consecutive games) record
going for so long and then decided enough was enough,'' said
Robinson. ``He finally just said, `I'm going to sit this game out.'
In my case, there's going to come a time when enough is enough.
There have been a lot of sacrifices made by this organization to
build a good team. They made a big commitment to me when I first
came here because I had never coached before. They saw enough in me
to make a commitment to hire me for four years to work with the
young kids for the future and I thought I owed it to them to also
make that commitment. That's why I kind of changed my mind and
decided to stick it out.'' ... The Penguins petitioned the league
to allow them to retain the rights to retired superstar  &UR; Mario
Lemieux &LR;  without having to protect him in the waiver draft. ``Mario
hasn't signed his voluntary retirement papers, and this would have
been our fourth draft with us having to protect him,'' said
Pittsburgh GM  &UR; Craig Patrick &LR; . ``We just thought it was unfair so
we appealed to the league and they made a deal with the Players
Association which allowed him to be exempt from the draft.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Islanders star  &UR; Zigmund Palffy  &LR; is in a contract
dispute, but this time it appears more serious, as Palffy has
requested a trade. There have been reports that the Islanders
offered to sell his rights for $20 million-$25 million. Palffy's
agent,  &UR; Paul Kraus &LR; , &UR;  &LR; said talks with team president  &UR; David Seldin
 &LR; have yielded nothing. ``It's like negotiating with oatmeal,'' said
Kraus. ``There's no point, there's no point at all. It's not going
to happen. We've asked for a trade.'' Palffy, who has scored better
than 40 goals each of the last three seasons, is seeking a
three-year deal worth $6.8 million a year. The Isles reportedly
have countered with $4 million, $4.25 million, and $4.5 million.
Palffy remains at home in Slovakia, training with 15- and
16-year-old junior players ...  &UR; Pat Falloon &LR; , who was San Jose's
first choice (No. 2 overall behind  &UR; Eric Lindros &LR; ) in the 1991
draft, is hoping to revitalize his career in Edmonton. Falloon, 26,
who has played for the Sharks, Flyers, and Senators, went shopping
for a new team in the offseason when it was clear Ottawa had no
room for him. So far, it has worked out well with the Oilers. ``I
had some ups and downs,'' said Falloon. ``Some really good times
and some really tough times. Last year was tough for me. After
being traded from Philadelphia to Ottawa it was the toughest time
of my career. I was getting the opportunity to play, I was playing
quite a bit in Ottawa and just didn't score goals. Talk about being
snakebit. That was the toughest stretch I went through in my
career.'' His futility resulted in a stretch of eight goals in 58
games ... Once  &UR; Marty McSorley's  &LR; playing days are over, he might
have a career as an actor. He made his debut in the 1997 film ``Con
Air,'' which starred  &UR; Nicolas Cage &LR; . McSorley's part was, well,
small. And he got killed. He played a pilot who was flying a group
of violent criminals to a new prison but met with a violent end
himself. ``It was a great experience, a lot of fun,'' said
McSorley, who has shed plenty of blood for real as an enforcer
during his NHL career, which is entering its 16th year. The Oilers
defenseman was selected for the part after getting to know producer
 &UR; Jerry Bruckheimer  &LR; during his days with the Kings ... 105 days to
the All-Star Game.

Padres again dominate with stubborn pitching
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
SAN DIEGO _ Believe it or not, these are the Atlanta Braves gasping
for life before your very eyes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego Padres all but pulled the plug Saturday with a 4-1
gut-check victory before a rowdy crowd of 62,779 at Qualcomm
Stadium. The Braves are not quite dead, but it wouldn't be a bad
idea to start notifying their next of kin.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres have a commanding 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven
National League Championship Series and are just one victory shy of
winning their first NL pennant since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could ask for a better situation,'' Padres
manager Bruce Bochy said.
</P>
<P>
   Who said these guys can go only as far as Kevin Brown's mighty
right arm can take them? It doesn't seem to matter who the Padres
trot out to the mound; they just keep shutting down the opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was Sterling Hitchcock's turn to play enforcer. He
didn't have top-notch command, but his effort was good enough to
keep a lid on the Braves' offense.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock, who battled control problems most of the game,
scattered three hits in five innings and worked around five walks
for his second upset victory of the postseason. After beating Randy
Johnson and the Astros in the decisive game of the Division Series,
Hitchcock was ready for the challenge of facing Greg Maddux, who
couldn't overcome two fifth-inning runs and had no luck in
reversing the Braves' fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their pitching was just better than ours again,'' said Maddux,
who allowed five hits before being lifted for a pinch hitter with
the bases loaded in the sixth inning. ``We're down, but we're not
out.''
</P>
<P>
   A little optimism never hurt anyone, but the Braves will need
divine intervention from the baseball gods to dig themselves out of
this hole.
</P>
<P>
   Only two teams _ the current Padres and the 1995 Braves _ have
held 3-0 leads in the NLCS, and no team in the history of baseball
has overcome a 3-0 deficit in any best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely do (believe the Braves can still win the
series),'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We can win two here and
go back to our place. We could make it very interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should tackle a couple of smaller chores first:
getting hits and scoring runs. The Braves had only eight hits
Saturday, and they are hitting a weak .200 in the series. Their
combined run production in the three games? Three.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've shut us down completely,'' Cox said. ``We have good
matchups going into situations, and we can't smell a hit. Their
pitching is awfully strong, but we really have to hit in the
clutch. We can't leave the bases loaded every inning without doing
some damage.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves loaded the bases three times Saturday and came up
empty every time. The most crucial instance was in the sixth inning
when Hitchcock issued a leadoff walk to Andres Galarraga, prompting
Bochy to summon former Astros righthander Donne Wall from the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Wall allowed a single to Andruw Jones and intentionally walked
pinch hitter Ryan Klesko after catcher Eddie Perez had put down a
sacrifice bunt. Klesko's walk loaded the bases, and then Wall got
tough. He struck out pinch hitters Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn
to escape the jam.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Wall) was outstanding,'' Padres pitching coach Dave Stewart
said. ``He's been that way for us all year. I'll tell you what;
he's going to be a part of this staff as long as I'm coaching
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock retired five of the first six batters he faced, but
got himself into trouble by walking Tony Graffanino _ a .211 hitter
in the regular season _ to lead off the third inning. Graffanino
moved to second on a sacrifice bunt by Maddux and scored on Walt
Weiss' single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Great defensive plays by Padres reserves John Vander Wal and Jim
Leyritz prevented the Braves from scoring in the third. Weiss tried
to score from second on Chipper Jones' two-out single to left, but
Vander Wal made a perfect throw to the plate, and Leyritz held on
to the ball despite a collision with Weiss.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock reached on a one-out single in the fifth and scored on
Steve Finley's double into the left-field gap. Then Ken Caminiti
singled up the middle after Maddux had intentionally walked
eight-time batting champion Tony Gwynn to score Finley.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres added two runs in the eighth _ as if closer Trevor
Hoffman needed any insurance _ to end any hopes of the Braves
staging a comeback. Hoffman struck out three of the five batters he
faced and pushed the Braves one step closer to elimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the playoffs,'' Braves center fielder Andruw Jones
said. ``Anything can happen, but we have to make some things
happen, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Braves, they're running out of time.

COOL MADDUX GETS PADRES HOT AT WRONG TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO - Mr. Cool, lost his cool.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the Atlanta Braves, the epitome of the
never-let'em-see-you-sweat corporate outfit, are just one game away
from starting their winter vacations far earlier than they ever
envisioned.
</P>
<P>
   Why, oh, why did Greg Maddux ever poke a stick into San Diego's
sleepy dugout in the bottom of the fourth inning? Maddux was the
losing pitcher in San Diego's 4-1 victory Saturday afternoon. His
National League Championship Series record is a very mortal 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, as composed as they come in this game, let Jim Leyritz
of all people, get under his skin in the bottom of the fourth
inning. Maddux became so agitated with Leyritz, he wound up
plunking him with the next pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made a habit of getting under people's skin,'' Leyritz
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before he stepped into the batter's box that inning, Leyritz
requested home-plate umpire Tom Hallion to check the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wiped under his cap and went to his mouth,'' Leyritz said
of Maddux. ``I just wanted the ball checked. Apparently, he took
offense to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux's very first pitch to Leyritz sailed high and tight and
smacked him in the left shoulder. The two exchanged words, mostly
unprintable ones, as Leyritz walked toward first base.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux, a four-time Cy Young Award winner, insisted the pitch
simply got away from him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to come in and it got away,'' Maddux said. ``I don't
care what (Leyritz) says. He didn't call the pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   This is a guy who could consistently hit a dime, anywhere you
place it, from 60-feet, 6 inches away. He had just retired seven
consecutive Padres when Leyritz stepped to the plate with two outs
and nobody on base at the time. John Vander Wal was due up next.
</P>
<P>
   An even more startling statistic: Maddux has hit a
preposterously tiny 0.01 percent _ and that's rounding up _ of the
11,517 batters he's faced in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nolan Ryan in his day, Maddux takes exception when an
opposing batter, especially one with a big mouth like Leyritz,
questions his actions. Ryan routinely hit batters if they asked for
the ball to be checked for possible cheating.
</P>
<P>
   The potential damage from hitting Leyritz was minimal.
Basically, Maddux let pride overtake his usually stoic and
deliberate manner.
</P>
<P>
   The wild and raucous crowd's volume level had come down a few
decibels. The Padres were slowly being put to sleep by Maddux's
pinpoint control and ever-effective changing of speeds.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Maddux had the Padres exactly where he wanted them,
especially considering he also had a 1-0 lead at the time and had
nearly set down the entire lineup in order before Leyritz's
prodding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hit me it kind of ignited us,'' Leyritz said. ``It
excited us. We're a close team here. I know he did it on purpose.
If it had been during the regular season I wouldn't have been able
to finish the game. I'd have been at the mound.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, Vander Wal struck out looking and Maddux
needed only four pitches to put him away. You could almost sense
Maddux saying, ``All right, I'll hit this big mouth and get out of
the inning with Vander Wal. No big deal and maybe it'll shut this
guy up.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Maddux wasn't counting on the Padres banding together.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great time for it to happen to us,'' said San Diego
center fielder Steve Finley. ``Anytime you get any extra incentive,
you take it.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego came up the next inning and scored twice, taking the
lead for good. Both runs scored after two outs. After each RBI hit
Maddux could be seen cussing and muttering to himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leyritz came into the dugout screaming,'' said Padres third
baseman Ken Caminiti, whose fifth-inning single scored Finley with
the go-ahead run. ``I liked it. It lit me up. I think it got us
going.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux can deny he hit Leyritz on purpose until the end of time.
The reality is that Maddux let his ego and pride get in the way of
what could have been Atlanta's turnaround game in this series.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't the same Maddux and these certainly are not the same
Atlanta Braves, who are definitely perspiring right about now. &QL;

SKIP AWAY BEATEN BY LONG SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
 CLUB-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There's no such thing as a sure thing in horse
racing. In fact, there's no such thing as two sure things.
Saturday's $1 million Jockey Club Gold Cup, the highlight of
Breeders' Cup Preview Day at Belmont Park, provided more evidence
as 34-1 shot ($70 to win) Wagon Limit blew past superstars
Gentlemen and Skip Away to triumph.
</P>
<P>
   The conditions for a monumental upset were in place. The track,
officially labeled sloppy, was actually wet/fast and most of the
winners had shown early speed along the rail. When the gates opened
for the Gold Cup, Jerry Bailey, aboard prohibitive 1-5 favorite
Skip Away, and Corey Nakatani, aboard 2-1 second choice Gentlemen,
acted as if they were in a two-horse race, going head-to-head from
the outset. Meanwhile, Robbie Davis and Wagon Limit, who had won
one of nine races this year, were biding their time.
</P>
<P>
   Gentlemen, who was on the inside, began to get away from Skip
Away turning for home and for an instant looked like a winner.
However, Wagon Limit came storming down the stretch to tally by 5
1/2 lengths in 2:003/5 for 1 1/4 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we'd get a piece of the purse, especially with the
track the way he likes it,'' said Allen Jerkens, Wagon Limit's
trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Jerkens, a Hall of Famer who twice engineered upsets of
Secretariat in 1973 (with Onion and Prove Out), had once again
spotted one of his charges perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skip Away did not run the way he has been running for some
reason,'' said Jerkens. ``Gentlemen had to do a lot to put away
Skip Away and that left it open for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away, who had won the previous two Gold Cups, came in
riding a nine-race winning streak. He missed a chance to pass Cigar
in all-time earnings as the $110,000 for third left him at
$9,616,360 to Cigar's $9,999,815. Skip Away will get a last chance
to break the record in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs
Nov. 7. After that, the presumptive Horse of the Year, despite the
loss, will be retired to stud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He usually is smoking through the lane, but today he just
galloped home,'' said Bailey. ``He didn't run his race. He's
handled a wet track before. I can't blame the loss on the track.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have put away the horse that is the one to beat, it's
real tough to get caught like we did and lose the race,'' said
Nakatani. ``I didn't want to give up any ground, but he started to
get in the deep going of the track. I couldn't move him out and the
winner just sat in a great spot and made his run.''
</P>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, who trains Skip Away, checked him out after the race
and the big gray was doing well. ``He's very sound, but we found a
little filing in his leg,'' said Hine. ``At the moment, he's not
lame. We'll just have to wait and see. He might have jammed himself
a little in the race. Right now, he's walking fine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This injury is cosmetic, believe me,'' said Jim Hunt, the
attending veterinarian. ``It looks a lot worse than it is. He
should be all right in a few days.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Groom is Red, owned by Rick Pitino's Celtics Pride Stable
and trained by Nick Zito, came out of the clouds with Corey
Nakatani aboard to take the $400,000 Champagne Stakes for
2-year-old colts.
</P>
<P>
   Running against the grain of the track, which had favored speed
all day, The Groom is Red came from last to prevail by 2 3/4
lengths in 1:424/5 for 11/16 miles. Pitino was on hand and led the
horse into the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   The Groom is Red, who was more than 15 lengths behind down the
backstretch, was 6-1 and returned $15.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was way out in the back, I was a bit nervous,'' said
Pitino. ``But to see him coming around the way he did was
unbelievable. It was such an exciting moment. All I can say is that
I'm a very lucky man and I'm having a great ride.''
</P>
<P>
   Zito indicated that The Groom is Red, who has won three in a
row, would start next in the $1 million Breeders' Cup Juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharp Cat ran her season record to 4 for 4 with an easy tally in
the $400,000 Beldame Stakes for fillies and mares. Ridden by
Nakatani, Sharp Cat simply ran away from her opponents, scoring by
11 lengths in 1:461/5 for 1 1/8 miles. Off at 2-5, Sharp Cat,
trained by Wally Dollase, returned $2.90 ... There was an upset in
the $400,000 Frizette Stakes for 2-year-old fillies as Confessional
defeated 2-5 choice Things Change. Ridden by Jerry Bailey,
Confessional romped to a 10 1/2-length victory in 1:424/5 for 11/16
miles. Off at 6-1, Confessional, trained by Bill Mott, paid $14.40
... Buck's Boy, the 7-5 pick ($4.90 to win), went wire to wire over
1 1/2 miles to capture the $500,000 Turf Classic by 3 lengths under
Shane Sellers. Trained by Noel Hickey, Buck's Boy prevailed by a
comfortable margin despite Sellers dropping his whip in midstretch.

NBA LOCKOUT GIVES NHL A HEAD START  
 BUT HOCKEY SAYS IT WON'T BE A VULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lockout? What NBA lockout?
</P>
<P>
   The NHL season opens in Phoenix tonight, and Shawn Hunter said
it will be business as usual for his Coyotes, who are trying to
skate their way into the Valley's heart.
</P>
<P>
   The hockey players undoubtedly will enjoy being the only active
pro sport tenants at America West Arena, where the team landed
three seasons ago after emigrating from Winnipeg, Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's Phoenix Suns won't be around to steal their thunder.
</P>
<P>
   But fans like Sheila Howard, who regularly attends Suns and
Coyotes games, will feel the pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I'll have some place to go watch (sports),'' Howard
said. ``I may not have my Suns, but I know I'll have my Coyotes.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, the Coyotes president, said, ``We might fill an
entertainment void for some people, and by that, I mean we might
win over some Suns fans who haven't been to a Coyotes game before.
But we're certainly not counting on it.''
</P>
<P>
   No NBA can only help the NHL, right? Like it or not, isn't it
perfect timing for a Canadian-born sport that still is trying to
establish itself in many U.S. markets, still has to explain its
quirky rules to first-time fans, and long has been considered No. 4
among the four major professional sports?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, no question about it,'' superstar center Mike Modano of
the Dallas Stars said. ``You hate to see a work stoppage in any
sport, but how can it not help the NHL? You'd just naturally assume
we're going to attract a lot more fans this year if there's no
NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter emphasized that the Coyotes will not try to profit from
the NBA's misfortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're plowing ahead without even thinking about the NBA,'' he
said. ``Their situation isn't a positive for us. If anything, it
can have a negative impact on us and the other teams because it's a
potential black eye for all the pro sports.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope each year more and more people will get a chance to
see us, and that's probably the greatest challenge. But we're still
only 2{ years old. We have very high expectations to be a leader
quickly, but sometimes you have to practice a little bit of
patience.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman indicated the league has no plans
to do anything different. There will be no massive marketing
campaign, no tactically increased advertising revenues, no extra
hawking of NHL merchandise, no parading star players around cities
that house both NHL and NBA franchises.
</P>
<P>
   According to Bettman, the NHL is fine the way it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a great game that, when people pay attention to it, we
think sells itself,'' Bettman said. ``We are just going to continue
to do our own thing. We think labor unrest is bad for all the
sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Coyotes' season ticket holder William K. Smith of Phoenix can't
believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's really the case, then they're totally missing the
boat,'' Smith said. ``They have a tremendous opportunity here to
market the game like never before. I'm not saying they have to act
like a vulture and pick on the bones of the NBA, but for heaven's
sake, don't they realize what they're missing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, some hockey markets really could use the extra
attention. Especially the new cities like Carolina and Nashville,
which I'm not sure are ready for the NHL. I'm not worried about
Phoenix. This is a great hockey town, going all the way back to
1967 with the old Phoenix Roadrunners. But come on, Bettman can't
really be serious when he says they're going to do nothing?''
</P>
<P>
   Teemu Selanne, a star forward for the Mighty Ducks of Anaheim,
agrees with Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember when we had our lockout (in 1994-95), a lot of
hockey fans went to basketball. I think this is a chance for hockey
to show to other fans that we have a great sport, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of fans out there that still haven't been
reached.''
</P>
<P>
   Marketing research by the Coyotes a year ago is proof. Surveys
showed that 30 percent of all fans who went to a Coyotes game at
America West Arena were attending their first NHL game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's an exciting, very positive statistic,'' Hunter said.
``It tells us we're still in the phase of introducing ourselves to
the marketplace. We're trying to grow our fan base one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes enjoyed an 85 percent season ticket renewal rate
after last season and this year will continue programs designed to
make the team a greater part of the community. The Coyotes:
</P>
<P>
   Sponsor a popular weeklong street hockey event in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   Conduct frequent ice hockey clinics and make countless
appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Hold their annual Family Carnival in the spring, which drew a
crowd of almost 50,000 last season.
</P>
<P>
   Pleased fans by not raising ticket prices for this season's
games.
</P>
<P>
   Hunter, a former executive vice president of the NBA's Denver
Nuggets and before that, a corporate account executive for the
NBA's Minnesota Timberwolves, agrees with Bettman's tack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can never allow external forces we can't control affect how
we control our own business and how we market it.''
</P>
<P>
   NHL players, however, from superstars Modano and teammate Brett
Hull, to Selanne and teammate Paul Kariya, said hockey is losing
out if it doesn't act fast and gain whatever it can by entering a
season without any head-to-head competition with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good opportunity for us,'' Kariya said. ``The NBA
has done exceptionally well in the past five, six years, and we had
a lot of momentum going for us until we had our lockout. We were
really gaining, I think, but then we lost it. Maybe this will bring
back that momentum we had.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes' Jeremy Roenick, though, said the NHL/NBA lockout
connection may be overblown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lockout's not going to affect us,'' Roenick said. ``Our
sport, I think is doing just fine. Sure, it's not great for them.
But how does it help us?''
</P>
<P>
   Hunter only can think of one way it could help the Coyotes,
whether the NBA season is canceled or not. It has to do with 4,300
sight-obstructed seats for Coyotes' games at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be a nice season to have full-court hockey,'' he
said. &QL;

UCONN WINS, BUT LOSES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STORRS, Conn. _ When can you consider a victory over a ranked
opponent a loss? When you lose your star quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   That's what happened to the University of Connecticut Saturday
as it upended Hofstra, 40-18, at soggy Memorial Stadium for its
fourth victory in five games. It was billed as a matchup between
Division 1-AA powers, Hofstra (13th) and UConn (25th) each ranked
in the national polls. Both had record-setting quarterbacks, and
Shane Stafford and Giovanni Carmazzi were supposed to have a
shootout.
</P>
<P>
   But the mood of the 4,476 on hand turned as dark as the clouds
that hovered over the stadium as Stafford exited with a broken
right collarbone and damaged shoulder late in the first period.
</P>
<P>
   However, the loss of Stafford had a profound effect on his
teammates, who took their game to another level.
</P>
<P>
   The injury sparked a 24-point outburst in the second quarter
that put the game away. ``I thought a lot of people played well,''
said UConn (4-1) coach Skip Holtz. ``Not just the offense. The
defense kept Hofstra out of the red zone.''
</P>
<P>
   The Flying Dutchmen piled up a lot of yards, but interceptions
by Percy Price, Jordan Younger, Eric Younger, and Ron Gamble killed
any chance of a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford's replacement, sophomore Brian Hoffman (9 for 17, 141
yards, 1 TD) did a solid job, directing the Huskies to a 31-6
halftime advantage.
</P>
<P>
   But it got close. Carmazzi (30 for 53, 306 yards) hit Charlie
Adams with a 46-yard TD strike to cut UConn's lead to 4.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hoffman drove the Huskies on a nine-play, 66-yard drive
capped by a 1-yard plunge by Chad Martin to give UConn a
comfortable margin. After Jordan Younger's 24-yard TD interception
return, Mike Burton finished off Hofstra before the half ended by
scoring on an 8-yard pass from Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brian did a pretty good job. He missed a few reads, but he
really hasn't had enough reps in practice,'' said Holtz of his
sophomore quarterback from Orlando, Fla. ``We didn't see any point
to putting him in the pocket, we ran a pretty basic game.''
</P>
<P>
   Hofstra worked its run-and-shoot, which averages 40 points per
game, in the second half, but the defense held. The Dutchmen's
final two drives ended with interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tough loss and we have no excuses,'' said Hofstra coach
Joe Gardi. ``UConn whipped us in just about every category. We were
outcoached and outplayed.''
</P>
<P>
   But what was impressive was that UConn did it without Stafford.
How good is he? Just 24 hours earlier he was named to UConn's 100th
anniversary all-time team. The honor is deserved. Stafford was on a
pace to complete his collegiate career ranked in the top two on
UConn's all-time list in practically every QB category. Breaking
records has been the usual for Stafford, who broke most of the
marks set by Kerry Collins at the Wilson School in West Lawn, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Stafford, who started 34 straight games, was hurt late in the
first quarter. After rolling to the left on a play-action pass, he
was pounded as he waited until the last possible moment to toss a
46-yard completion to Carl Bond that set up a field goal and gave
the Huskies a 10-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Stafford gave UConn its first points when he connected
on a 45-yard strike to John Fitzsimmoms. It was the 30th straight
game Stafford completed a pass of 35 yards or longer and the 17th
straight game he had a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctors are saying it will be 4-6 weeks before he is
back,'' said Holtz. ``Shane says two weeks. Of course I'm going to
go with what the doctors say, but I'm not going to bet against
Shane.''

LAW WORK FOR COUNTY ATTORNEY, SHERIFF TAKES BACK SEAT TO FEUD

<P>
   Rick doesn't like the way Joe runs his jails.
</P>
<P>
   Joe says Rick is just jealous because people like him better.
</P>
<P>
   Joe is mad because he thinks Rick snitched on him to Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   Rick is upset because Joe accused him of being a lousy lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes in the political sand-kicking between the
Valley's two top law officers, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and County
Attorney Richard Romley.
</P>
<P>
   For five years they've been at each other's throats, publicly
and privately sabotaging one another with venomous determination.
But the feud boiled over last week following recent clashes over
the arrest of a hairdresser, a postal worker pepper-spraying a dog,
and a plan to bust people who steal off-road vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Those are the latest episodes in a soap-operatic feud between
two elected officials who not only wield tremendous power but also
are among Arizona's most influential politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio, a former Drug Enforcement Administration special agent
turned travel agent, won election after his predecessor was accused
of badly botching an investigation into the massacre of nine people
at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   Romley, an Arizona native and ex-Marine who lost both legs above
the knee in Vietnam, first took office as county attorney nearly 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Both are aggressive crime fighters and savvy politicians who are
adept at using the media.
</P>
<P>
   Both grant that the public is the big loser in their fight.
</P>
<P>
   But neither will back down.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the sheriff sat in his downtown Phoenix office and
erupted at the mention of Romley.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's jealousy!'' Arpaio said loudly. ``The polls always have
me at an 80 or 90 percent approval rating. The polls don't even
show he is respected by the voters!''
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks away, on another day, Romley countered: ``Joe takes
everything personally. But also, I'm not sure Joe understands the
law or knows a great deal about law enforcement. When was his last
major case?
</P>
<P>
   ``What he has are gimmicks: pink underwear.''
</P>
<P>
   Other law-enforcement officials want no part of this fight,
declining to be quoted. Privately, however, they say Arpaio vs.
Romley is a big, embarrassing distraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're obsessed with each other,'' said one top law officer.
``They can't even be in the same room together. . . . The problem
is, they don't trust each other.''
</P>
<P>
   One example: Arpaio, who has been besieged with death threats in
the past year, asked Attorney General Grant Woods to investigate
rather than Romley, who would normally take the case.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from isolated cases, insiders say the conflict has not
deterred sheriff's deputies and county prosecutors from cooperating
to catch and convict criminals.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Mary Rose Wilcox said Arpaio and Romley have great
staffs, and the bosses' quibbling doesn't filter into day-to-day
work.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both really good people,'' Wilcox added. ``It's sad
that they can't seem to get along. But it doesn't seem to effect
their work.'' &QL; 
BONES OF CONTENTION
</P>
<P>
   Flash points between Romley and Arpaio have ranged from trivial
to serious:
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the sheriff announced he was going to ``surround the
county'' with roadblocks and search vehicles for drugs. Romley
publicly denounced the plan as unconstitutional, forcing the Arpaio
to back off.
</P>
<P>
   _In 1996, Romley called for a state audit of the sheriff's Jail
Enhancement Fund based on allegations of inappropriate spending.
Among other things, Romley said Arpaio should not have used $39,000
for private legal counsel to sue the Board of Supervisors over his
budget.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio suggests that Romley ratted on him to the U.S. Justice
Department, prompting a two-year investigation of alleged inmate
abuse and civil-rights violations in Maricopa County jails. That
case ended this year with a settlement between Arpaio and the U.S.
Attor ney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   Romley believes Arpaio's inves tigators bungled the probe into
the 1996 death of jail inmate Scott Norberg. Arpaio accuses Romley
of delaying resolution of an investiga tion into Norberg's death.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff claims that an inves tigative staff at Romley's
office constitutes a force of ``secret po lice.'' But Romley said
his investi gators do such work as looking into actions by other
law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   He also says Romley endangered law officers with critical
comments in a radio interview during a 1996 riot in the Tent City
jail.
</P>
<P>
   _Romley criticized Arpaio after the case of military impostor
David Michael Pecard, who had deserted the Army and was arrested in
1996 after conning his way into the Sheriff's Office. Charges
against Pecard were dismissed because sher iff's officers violated
his civil rights in Tent City by eavesdropping on phone
conversations with his lawyer. &QL; 
Petty issues
</P>
<P>
   While those disputes involve major issues, the conflicts have
grown increasingly petty.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, after Arpaio and a top aide got into a fight
with an intoxicated hairdresser, the sher iff said he couldn't rely
on Romley for ``fair and impartial prosecu tion.'' He tried to get
the county attorney to withdraw, but Romley refused.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Arpaio announced plans to pull over off-road vehicles
in an effort to stop a spree of theft. Romley's office promptly
declared the idea unconstitutional: ``The answer is no,'' said
spokesman Bill FitzGerald. ``You can't just pull over vehicles for
random searches.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley also irked the sheriff by refusing to file animal-cruelty
charges against mailman Wayne Bates for using pepper spray on a
fenced dog. Arpaio, who had used Bates' arrest as an opportunity to
publicize his pet-protecting posse, was livid.
</P>
<P>
   So was his publicity director, Lisa Allen. ``This man Romley!''
she fumed. ``He won't prosecute Bates because it will make Sheriff
Arpaio look good. But he'll take cases . . . where he hopes Sheriff
Arpaio will look like a big creep.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at his office, Romley sighed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This dog case, I mean _ Let it go, Joe! Yes, I think the
mailman overreacted, but to put him in jail? Come on.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the conflict seems to involve a question of allegiance.
``The county attorney is supposed to be my attorney,'' Arpaio says.
``But he has been unethical and is always critical of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Last March, Arpaio's office filed a state Bar complaint against
Rom ley, accusing him of a ``blatant conflict of interest'' because
he continually spoke out against sher iff's employees.
</P>
<P>
   Romley, whose credits include the AzScam political-corruption
sting and his order to release four Tucson men falsely accused of
the Buddhist temple murders, said he is confident the complaint
will be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not his personal attorney. I have an obligation to speak
out when I see problems, and he's trying to muzzle me with this,
and I refuse to be,'' Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the dispute arises from problems in the Maricopa County
jail system.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio says Romley publicly un dercut him during the riots two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was being interviewed on KTAR during the riot, and he
couldn't even wait until after the riot to get me,'' Arpaio said.
``. . . I think it's almost criminal what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley's explanation: ``I was on the radio, and when they asked
me about the situation I said we in law enforcement have been
concerned about the jails. I wasn't trying to make it more
difficult for the sheriff, just to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley said he believes the riot was started ``by a guard who
overreacted with a prisoner.''
</P>
<P>
   Aide Barnett Lotstein added: ``The guard pepper sprayed a guy
who was on the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the sheriff's complaints about Romley's legal work,
Romley said, ``We are the people's lawyer, not Joe Arpaio's lawyer.
He doesn't understand the role of the county attorney. I don't work
for him. I work for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   While the sheriff and prosecutors shoot it out, other law
officers steer clear of cross fire.
</P>
<P>
   One, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``As long as Joe
is in there you will see problems between his outfit and other
agencies: He just marches to a different drummer.''
</P>
<P>
   Another noted that Romley wields considerable power. ``Every
agency wants to have a good working relationship with Romley's
office. I can't imagine them fooling with our lower-level cases.
But if they are angry at you, they could scrutinize reports to
death, nitpick them to the nth degree, beyond what is reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio and Romley agree on one thing: The 1996 death of inmate
Norberg marked the end of their cordiality. A drug user who was
arrested for assault, Norberg suffocated during a scuffle with
guards in the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the relationship with Joe began to break with the
issue of brutality in the jails,'' Romley said. ``I was getting a
dozen letters a week with specific examples of brutality. We had
video tapes. I prosecuted several of his detention officers. Then,
with the Norberg incident, the problems elevated to a new level.
</P>
<P>
   ``His investigation co-mingled a criminal investigation with an
internal investigation, and was poorly done.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arpaio aide Jack MacIntyre said there was no mixing of
internal and a criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investigation wasn't either of those things,'' MacIntyre
said. ``It was what we call a `critical incident investigation.'
There was no indication of criminal conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley had refused to close the Norberg investigation until a
$30 million civil suit filed by family members was resolved. Last
week, with the case still pending, he decided to open a criminal
investigation of detention officers. Arpaio was outraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why in two and a half years has not one of my employees been
cleared in the Norberg case?'' asked the sheriff. ``How long must
this take?''
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio also suspects Romley of treachery in the 1995 jail
investigation by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't trust him,'' Arpaio said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking dramatically toward the ceiling, he added, ``Now, who
asked the Justice Department to come in?'' The sheriff shrugged,
then smiled knowingly.
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre said, ``When the Department of Justice looked at the
jails there was supposed to be an attorney-client relationship
between Romley's office and us. But Romley handed out copies of
that report like a deck of cards.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, Jesus H. Christ!'' Arpaio said, jumping up and
thrusting his arms into the air. ``Romley has his own secret police
force! He has 60 of his own investigators! He even changed their
badges so it says Maricopa County Attorney's Police Force.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley said he has investigators to follow up on police work _
and to investigate law enforcement agencies, including the
Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not above the law, and every time I raise an issue that
perhaps he doesn't like, he says it's just a pissing match,''
Romley said.
</P>
<P>
   Romley said he's getting weary of Arpaio's anger, ``his hunger
for publicity,'' his charges. But not especially surprised, because
there were hints early on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago I got a flavor of what it would be like with Joe
when he wanted to surround the county with law officers and stop
every third car and look for drugs,'' Romley said. ``It definitely
would have violated the Constitution. I told him he couldn't do it,
and he got very mad.''
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre said ``the tragedy of this thing'' is that relations
between the two agencies are so bad that the public is being poorly
served.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the threat of prosecution being dangled over detention
officers in the Norberg case, with investigators being smeared by
Romley, it does nothing for a sense of trust between the two
offices,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Romley insists that most business between the two agencies is
going on very well. But he also said he won't back down in the face
of an angry Arpaio.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Joe exceeds or misuses his power I'm going to call him on
it,'' Romley said. ``Joe is not going to bully me.'' &QL;

FROGS' PAST DEFEATS JUST FADE TO BLACK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ All I want for Christmas, Coach Fran, is my
own black shirt.
</P>
<P>
   You know, one of those black jerseys that turns Frogs into
princes.
</P>
<P>
   Or losers into winners. Yeah, that's even better.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be the shirts, right? How else to explain the
phenomenon of TCU being 4-1 as you wake up on this bright and sunny
fall Sunday morning?
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, rub your eyes and read it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four-and-one!''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, they're still celebrating in College Station and the road
from Dallas to Austin is bathed in an orange glow, but nobody in
college football is any happier today _ or any more joyously
stunned _ than the folks in Frogland.
</P>
<P>
   Last night's 21-10 victory over Fresno State at Amon Carter
Stadium quadrupled the Frogs' victory total over last season.
</P>
<P>
   That's right, quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   ``You couldn't sit around and think we were going to be 4-and-1
at this point in time,'' first-year Frogs coach Dennis Franchione
admitted with a rueful grin, after the Frogs had rallied in the
fourth quarter to defeat the visiting Bulldogs. ``But I believe it
now.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is a lot mental.''
</P>
<P>
   That's where the black shirts come in, of course. It's a mental
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line TCU supporters still cringe at the idea of the Frogs
wearing black jerseys and leggings with their purple pants. Why,
it's a complete break with tradition, they sputter.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly.
</P>
<P>
   It ain't 1950 any more, sports fans. Frogs' football tradition
hasn't been much to brag about since the 1984 season went spiraling
down that cesspool of scandal and NCAA gumshoes.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last year? It was a 1-10 disaster, you may recall.
Saturday after Saturday, after another late-game collapse, poor Pat
Sullivan would wander off into the night, mumbling about his team
just having to learn how to win.
</P>
<P>
   What the Frogs needed was someone who could first teach them how
to compete until the clock read 0:00.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing is, I don't talk to them a lot about
winning,'' Franchione said. ``I don't put pressure on them about
that. I talk to them about playing hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guys know that if don't play our guts out, if we don't
play hard on every play, we're just another ballclub. Right now,
we're doing that as well as anyone in the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Franchione, a proven master at turning programs around,
understood immediately that his first challenge at TCU was to work
on his players' heads and hearts before he worried about blocking
schemes or their times in the 40.
</P>
<P>
   He brings the ability to motivate, to deal with problems, to
recognize what needs to be said and to say it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty obvious when I got here that the team had a low
confidence level and low self-esteem,'' Franchione said. ``I told
them that the most important player in a football game is the next
one. That's the motto we live by.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've kind of quit looking at the scoreboard and just
played. We talk a lot about passion, now, how you have to have a
deep emotional feeling, a thirst for something. How bad do you want
to be 4-and-1?''
</P>
<P>
   Bad enough to shrug off the kind of bad breaks and letdowns that
would have buried last season's team.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs trailed, 10-7, as the final period began last night,
but this TCU team has made a habit of making the fourth quarter its
own this season. Instead of panicking or just flat quitting, as
they surely would have a year ago, the Frogs found a way to win.
</P>
<P>
   LaDainian Tomlinson took an option pitch from quarterback
Patrick Batteaux, the converted wide receiver, cut inside two
Fresno State defenders and raced 33 yards for the go-ahead
touchdown on the Frogs' first drive of the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On fourth-and-three, mind you.
</P>
<P>
   Will miracles never cease?
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, cornerback Kendrick Patterson scooped up a fumble
by Fresno State tight end Scott Thompson _ replays showed he
probably should have been ruled down _ and returned it 29 yards for
the clinching TD.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the kinds of plays that always seemed to go against
the Frogs over the past 20 years, give or take a decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   If there was a disappointment, it was that the Frogs continue to
play in relative anonymity. Only 28,013 fans showed up, despite a
conveniently early 6:05 kickoff, the third consecutive home crowd
under 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, it may take a while to make believers out of all the
skeptics. Cynicism tends to pile up after a while, like leaves gone
long unraked.
</P>
<P>
   But believe. The Frogs are 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   There's a rumor that Coach Fran even has a black shirt that'll
fit you, too.

FOR HULL, DEFENSE IS ANOTHER GOAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Brett Hull gained a souvenir in his first regular
season-game with the Stars.
</P>
<P>
   Not a bucket full of hats for scoring three times. Not even a
puck from his first goal with his new team.
</P>
<P>
   No, Hull's souvenir was something he's just as soon do without.
He sported a big red gash on his chin, courtesy of a high stick
late in the second period that took three or four stitches to
close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a part of the game I like,'' Hull said. ``I have a
hard enough time looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock disagreed. Even though the
15th-leading goal scorer in NHL history did not put the puck in the
net, and even though he got the cut on the chin, Hitchcock said
Hull looked very good in the Stars' 4-1 victory last night against
the Buffalo Sabres at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some really good things,'' Hitchcock said.
</P>
<P>
   Like playing defense.
</P>
<P>
   That's a must in Hitchcock's system, and when the Stars signed
Hull to a big-money, free-agent contract some wondered if Hull
would buy into it.
</P>
<P>
   Although he didn't fly all over the ice hitting people, Hull
ably handled that part of the game. He blocked a shot and had two
takeaways, including one in the Stars' defense zone when he hustled
back and took the puck from Miroslav Satan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brett Hull can play both ways,'' Hitchcock said. ``He's very
capable. He knows when he has to come back, and he knows how to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   No big deal, Hull said. Defense? Of course I play defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way the game is now,'' he said. ``You've got to
play defense to create more chances offensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Where Hull earns the big bucks, though, is on offense. And while
he didn't score, there's nothing wrong with that part of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Hull took six shots, the most on the team. A couple of them were
slap shots right on goal, but they were stopped by Dominik Hasek.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had lots of chances, and couldn't buy one,'' he said. ``I'm
always trying hard to get one, but they don't always go in.''
</P>
<P>
   He did get an assist, though, when linemate Mike Modano scored
off a rebound from one of Hull's shots.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been his best play of the night involved neither
offense nor defense, but rather acting skills. Hull went down after
minimal contact in front of the net _ some might have called it
taking a dive _ midway through the second period, drawing a penalty
and a power play. Pat Verbeek converted with a goal that made it
2-0.

KLEMIC MAKES FAST WORK OF VILLANOVA 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Move over 'Nova. Make room for Dave Klemic.
</P>
<P>
   Klemic, the Northeastern wide receiver who is a blur to
defenders, caught three touchdown passes Saturday, equaling the
Huskies career mark with 19. And he's only a sophomore.
</P>
<P>
   Klemic's heroics, plus some great plays by linebackers Brian
Hayden and Zach Falconer, tackle Pat Auguste, and defensive backs
Jabari Powell and Andre Dixon, highlighted the Huskies' eighth
straight home victory, over No. 11 Villanova, 28-17.
</P>
<P>
   All the Huskies' 28 points at rainy Parsons Field came in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Klemic, the slim (6 feet, 171 pounds) and bubbly player from
Somers Point, N.J., smiled and said, ``Hey, those were neat passes.
I just had to be there to catch them.'' Klemic grabbed two from
Fred Vallett and one from Jason Quinlan in tying Jeremy Gobeil
(1990-1993), on the Huskies' all-time list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klemic never ceases to amaze me,'' said NU coach Barry Gallup.
``He just gets the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   New England hasn't been kind to Villanova (3-3) this season.
Last Saturday, ranked fourth nationally, the Wildcats visited
Orono, Maine, and were shocked, 44-10. You can believe they are not
looking forward to visiting UMass-Amherst next Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a very important game for us,'' said Gallup. ``We
lost close conference games to William and Mary (24-21) and
Delaware (27-20) and now we're 2-2 in the Atlantic 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing good football. The guys are focused and they are
not in awe of any opponent. I feel when you believe in yourself you
play better, and we as a team certainly believe we can beat any
opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``And, believe me, Villanova is a very good team with good
coaching and talented players. But we're improving too. We were
missing some key people and still got the job done.''
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies (4-2) scored 43 seconds into the second when
redshirt freshman L.J. McKanas of Saugus scored from the 2 to cap a
seven-play, 36-yard drive. Joe Connolly's point-after try was wide
right. The drive started when Hayden recovered a 'Nova fumble and
returned it 22 yards to the Wildcat 36.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies got a major break moments later when Auguste tipped
and intercepted a 'Nova pass and returned it to the 23. On the
first play from scrimmage, Quinlan tossed a 23-yard pass to the
streaking Klemic in the right corner of the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Then Quinlan hit Klemic for a 2-point conversion and a 14-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies made it 21-0 at 11:47 when Vallett and Klemic hooked
up on a 72-yard play. The defenders just couldn't cope with
Klemic's speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Klemic gives us a dimension you have to have to win a big
game,'' said Gallup. ``He's a big-play player.''
</P>
<P>
   Villanova finally scored at 13:03 when Chris Boden tossed a
short over-the-middle pass to impressive Brian Westwood, and he
scooted to a 37-yard scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   On the first play from scrimmage following the 'Nova kickoff
Vallett lobbed a 33-yard pass to the streaking Klemic for another
score, and NU was ahead, 28-7. Said Vallett, ``Dave makes you feel
comfortable. Just throw it in his direction and he'll catch it.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey Hannon hit a 41-yard field goal at 14:41 for Villanova.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats showed poise in the third quarter when they put
together a 13-play, 92-yard drive that ended with a 6-yard pass
from Boden to Murle Sango. Boden connected on 26- and 20-yard
passes on the drive. That cut NU's margin to 28-17, but that's how
it stayed.

BAYLOR RALLIES, HOLDS OFF KANSAS, 31-24
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ Baylor continued this year's theme of fantastic
finishes. Only this time, it was the Bears who pulled victory from
the jaws of defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Looking sluggish while trailing throughout most of the second
half, Baylor rallied for 17 unanswered points in the fourth quarter
to eke past the Kansas Jayhawks, 31-24, last night before 31,271 at
Floyd Casey Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor tailback Darrell Bush snapped a 24-all tie when he
scooted into the end zone from the 1-yard line with 49 seconds
remaining to cap a huge comeback by the Bears (2-3, 1-2 Big 12).
</P>
<P>
   Kansas (2-4, 0-4) had one last shot, and eventually moved to the
Baylor 35. But Nikia Codie intercepted Zac Wegner's pass at the
2-yard line with 21 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came alive right there at the end,'' Baylor coach Dave
Roberts said. ``The effort was incredible, and I'm very proud of
the kids to win this game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked to the guys and we told them this game was going to
be just like last week and the week before, and to let's just get
it to the last four minutes. We made a play when we had to do it,
and our defense made a play when they had to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor dropped a 31-29 decision at Texas Tech last week. Two
weeks ago, the Bears lost an 18-16 heartbreaker at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed this win,'' Bears split end Morris Anderson said.
``We can't afford to lose any more games.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush rushed for 133 yards on 24 carries. Besides his winning
touchdown, Bush set the four-play, 90-yard winning drive in motion
when, on first down from his 10, he ran 70 electrifying yards
before being chased out of bounds at the Kansas 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been running that play throughout the whole game, and
we were being patient about it,'' Bush said. ``Then in the last
minute of the ballgame it opened up for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get up field as fast as I could, and then I looked
around and saw (Kansas defensive back Jahmal Wright.) So, I just
ran out of bounds because I didn't want to waste any more energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Termaine Fulton snagged a 27-yard touchdown from Wegner with
2:19 left in the third quarter as the Jayhawks rolled to a 24-14
lead. But the Bears found some spark in the fourth quarter, and
sent Kansas home pondering that final-quarter collapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really a tough one,'' Kansas coach Terry Allen said.
``I don't really know what to say, except I think we let Baylor off
the hook.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit the two big plays in the fourth quarter, and that was
really disappointing.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor quarterback Jermaine Alfred, starting his first game of
the season, fired a 19-yard TD to Derek Lagway as the Bears got
within 24-21 with 13:47 remaining in the game. Matt Bryant's
42-yard field goal with 3:50 left tied it at 24.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Bears' last-second theatrics, which Baylor hopes
to repeat next week when they play host to Texas A&AMP;M. Yesterday,
the Aggies upset No. 2 Nebraska, 28-21.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys to get used to this feeling, because we're
going to do it against next week,'' said Anderson, who caught five
passes for a career-high 147 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Rubin gave Baylor a 7-0 lead when he picked up a fumble
by Kansas punter Matt Tyler and raced 27 yards to score late in the
first quarter. After Roberts replaced Alfred with Odell James
midway through the second quarter, the momentum went the Jayhawks'
way.
</P>
<P>
   Touchdowns by Wegner and Mitch Bowles pushed Kansas ahead 14-7.
But the Bears knotted it early in the third quarter when Alfred
found Anderson for a 35-yard TD.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boosts our ego a lot,'' Bush said. ``Tonight, we're going
to go out and have a good time.''

TOCCHET IS COYOTES' MAGIC INGREDIENT  
 WARRIOR STABILIZES TEAM CHEMISTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This is what you need to know about the impact Rick
Tocchet has on the Coyotes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, he scribbled a note on the team chalkboard inside the
locker room, inviting anyone who was interested to jot down their
names and join him at his house later that night to watch ``Monday
Night'' ``Football''.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, over the next couple hours, the list began to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Q'' _ defenseman Deron Quint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rat'' _ center Cliff Ronning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Izzy'' _ left wing Brad Isbister.
</P>
<P>
   The RSVPs kept rolling in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kong'' _ right wing Jim Cummins.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gus'' _ left wing Greg Adams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Erkel'' _ defenseman Jyrki Lumme.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, every age group, personality, nationality, bank
account and social status seemed to be represented.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oley'' _ defenseman Oleg Tverdovsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``JR'' _ center Jeremy Roenick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walt'' _ left wing Keith Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   And a dozen others.
</P>
<P>
   Who said the Coyotes have no chemistry or team unity? Who said
they are a bunch of individuals running around in their own select
cliques? Who said they can't all just get along?
</P>
<P>
   Actually, a lot of the Coyotes said it themselves each of the
past two seasons. Privately, it was one of their biggest
complaints. But slowly, those concerns faded like a cheap dashboard
during the Arizona summer.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of the credit has to go to Tocchet, the 34-year-old
warrior who is entering his second season in Phoenix. Everyone
agreed a change was needed and that they had to do it together. But
Tocchet, perhaps more than anyone, took the bull by the horns and
ran it headfirst into the boards.
</P>
<P>
   Little things, like inviting the team over to his house to watch
a football game _ and everyone showing up _ have made a world of
difference for the Coyotes as they prepare to open the 1998-99 NHL
season today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things like that can go a long
</P>
<P>
   way,'' Tocchet said. ``I just remember my first eight years in
Philadelphia, we had a real close team, and we were real
successful. Same thing in Pittsburgh. We were a very close team,
and we won a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everybody's got to love each other, but
everybody's got to have respect for each other, and when you have
that, it brings good team chemistry.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet was one of the first players to openly criticize the
club for not having much of it. After the Coyotes were eliminated
last season in the opening round of the playoffs for the third
straight year and the 11th time in 13 trips to the postseason, he
questioned the leadership in the dressing room.
</P>
<P>
   Many, including Tkachuk, the team's captain, perceived that as a
direct knock on Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know Walt was (mad) about it, but I had a long talk with
him, and I laid it out on the line to him,'' Tocchet said. ``What I
told him I meant was, one guy can't do it alone. Leadership isn't
just one guy. It takes everybody. Everybody's got to help each
other and be there for each other.''
</P>
<P>
   After 14 NHL seasons, which also included stops in Los Angeles,
Boston and Washington, Tocchet has always been there for his
teammates. Whoever they happen to be. Wherever they happen to hail
from. Whenever they happen to need it.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't afraid to pull a player aside and tell them what he
thinks. He's done it with Mario Lemieux. He's done it with Wayne
Gretzky. He's done it with Roenick and Tkachuk.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest thing with Toc is he just wants to win,'' Coyotes
defenseman Gerald Diduck said. ``But it's not so much just the game
he wants to win, he wants to win every single, one-on-one battle
that he has, no matter what it is. Whether it's having to put your
head down after a two-minute shift and backcheck, you see him and
he's doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet isn't alone, of course. He looked around the locker room
and said others are just as committed and intent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dally Drake is the same way. So is JR and Walt and Teppo
Numminen,'' Tocchet said. ``We all talk about it. We all believe in
the same things. Most of the guys in this room do. And as good as
it is now, it's only going to get better. Actually, it got a lot
better last year after Christmas.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet credits the coaching staff of Jim Schoenfeld and
assistants John Tortorella and Gordie Roberts for allowing the
players to air their opinions and offer feedback, whether it's on
the ice or off. During a recent practice, for instance, Schoenfeld
stopped the workout and circled the group for some dialogue about
the power play.
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet quickly chirped in and had everyone's full attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a good relationship with a guy like Oleg
(Tverdovsky),'' Tocchet said, ``and I tell him, `You have to have
input. Don't be afraid to talk. You're a big part of the power
play. You're the quarterback out there. You have to tell people
what to do sometimes.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What I try to do with a guy like Oley or guys like Izzy or
Doaner (Shane Doan) is tell them there's nothing that says you have
to be a rookie or a first-year player or a young guy. . . . I'm not
a big believer in telling a guy, `You gotta do it this way because
I've won the Stanley Cup.' That doesn't mean you know everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, although it's worth pointing out that Tocchet is the
only player on the Coyotes' roster to have ever hoisted Lord
Stanley's holy grail over his head. In addition o 909 NHL games,
385 goals, 821 points and 2,626 penalty minutes, the seventh most
in league history, the man has clout.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't stop during the off-season, either. He joined the
likes of Isbister and Roenick in the Los Angeles area this past
summer by participating in the much-publicized off-ice training
program of T.R. Goodman for the second consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of Rick Tocchet,'' teammate Cliff Ronning said,
``I think of the true professional athlete, from his training to
his desire to win to his leadership.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet doesn't wear a letter on his chest, designating him as a
captain or an assistant. He doesn't have to. And he doesn't
necessarily want to. Tkachuk is the captain. Roenick and Numminen
are the assistants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just here to help,'' said Tocchet, ``I don't know how much
longer I've got left, and the main thing is I want to play at a
high level. Mike Keenan was good at getting guys to a different
level. That's what Shoney's doing right now. That's what this
team's got to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, you have to pound that into yourself and into the
team. If there's a guy who's not willing to do that, and he's just
constantly going against what the team is trying to do, then
something's got to be done about it. I've jumped in a guy's face
before about it. And I'll do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tocchet has a hunch he won't feel the need to do that this
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are a lot better around here, trust me,'' he said. ``A
lot better.'' &QL;

FROGS WIN, AGAIN, IN FOURTH QUARTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TERRANCE HARRIS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Where the TCU Horned Frogs faltered a year
ago they are excelling this season _ the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs were again wielding their fourth-quarter magic last
night as they rallied behind two final-period touchdowns to upend
Fresno State, 21-10, before 28,013 spectators in Amon Carter
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In a stretch of four consecutive home games, TCU has played
down-to-the-wire football in each outing, winning the first three.
The Frogs, 1-10 last season, are 2-0 in the Western Athletic
Conference and 4-1 overall.
</P>
<P>
   Fresno State slipped to 1-4 overall and 1-1 in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``This just shows we really want to win; we're never going to
give up,'' said tailback LaDainian Tomlinson, who finished with a
team-high 113 yards, which included a 33-yard fourth-quarter
touchdown. ``It just comes down to you have to play the fourth
quarter.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was fitting after a stifling TCU defensive effort most of
the night that a bone-jarring hit by safety Reggie Hunt on Fresno
State tight end Scott Thompson caused a fumble that cornerback
Kendrick Patterson scooped and bolted 29 yards for what would prove
the game-sealing touchdown with 6:36 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   While Fresno State quarterback Billy Volek was successful in
puncturing the Frogs' blitzing attack with short slant passes
throughout, TCU stuffed the Bulldogs' running game. Jaime Kimbrough
and three other Bulldogs rushers were held to a combined 32 yards
on 35 attempts by a TCU front led by defensive end Aaron Schobel
and middle linebacker Joseph Phipps.
</P>
<P>
   The Frogs' only glaring defensive breakdown came during the
first quarter when a short slant pass from Volek to receiver Atnaf
Harris went for a 47-yard touchdown after cornerback Greg Walls
slipped trying to make the tackle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had one missed tackle that cost us some points, but other
than that, I thought they played well,'' said first-year TCU coach
Dennis Franchione, who has guided TCU to its first three-game
winning streak since 1995. ``We played the run well, like we've
pretty much done all year, and we forced them to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Frogs' offense, though sometimes inconsistent, continued
to show improvement and poise. Tomlinson's 33-yard touchdown run
came on a fourth-and-three option pitch from quarterback Patrick
Batteaux.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson, who played the entire second half in place of an
injured Basil Mitchell, took the perfectly timed pitch from
Batteaux and scooted past the entire Fresno State defense to help
TCU gain a 14-10 lead with 12:09 left.
</P>
<P>
   TCU, which is 4-0 this season when it rushes for 240 yards or
more, finished with 242 yards on the ground and 338 yards of total
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the defense plays as well as it did, it gives you a
chance to be persistent,'' Franchione said. ``In the fourth
quarter, I thought we took it to them physically up front.''
</P>
<P>
   But TCU's offense wasn't entirely smooth as consecutive
turnovers by Batteaux nearly put the Frogs in a hole. But only
Dante Marsh's interception resulted in points when Fresno State
kicker Jeff Hanna converted a 37-yard field to snap a 7-7 tie from
the first half.
</P>
<P>
   One series earlier, Batteaux fumbled the ball on a keeper at the
TCU 40. But a defensive stand pushed the Bulldogs backward 5 yards
on the first two plays and forced them to punt on fourth down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at myself, because it was my mistakes which could
have hurt us,'' said Batteaux, who finished 9-of-17 passing for 96
yards and one interception while rushing for 72 yards and the
second-quarter touchdown. ``I take the blame. It's something I have
to work on and get corrected.''

HERNANDEZ SENDS YANKEES PAST INDIANS, 4-0, TIES ALCS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By JOHNNY PAUL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Perhaps no player in this American League
Championship Series grasps the concept of survival as does
right-hander Orlando Hernandez.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that one quality made ``El Duque'' the New York Yankees'
best candidate to start last night's critical scenario in Game 4 at
Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who along with seven others spent three days floating
aboard a raft during their December 1997 defection from Cuba,
pitched the Yankees to a 4-0 victory against the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who pitched seven scoreless innings, emerged as the
primary reason the Yankees tied the best-of-seven series at two
games apiece. Hernandez, who today celebrates his 29th birthday,
recorded six strikeouts and surrendered only three hits and two
walks during his gutsy 115-pitch appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pressure prior to the game,'' said Hernandez, who
escaped first- and sixth-inning hazards unscathed to earn the
victory. ``It was a big game, and I knew we were in a must-win
situation. I felt pressure, but I had no fear. I've been through
many difficult times on and off the field in my life, and I knew
I'd be able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Jim Thome emerged as Hernandez's victim du jour
during the Indians' best scoring threats with two runners aboard in
both at-bats. Hernandez induced an inning-ending fly ball from
Thome that right fielder Paul O'Neill caught on the warning track
during the first inning, and he recorded the final out of the sixth
inning after Thome swung and missed on a 3-2 changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody jumped off the bench on that one,'' Yankees manager
Joe Torre said. ``Striking out Thome was huge. That was probably
the at-bat of the night for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the Yankees will enter Game 5 this afternoon with their
ace, left-hander David Wells, scheduled to pitch and 20-game winner
David Cone ready for Game 6 Tuesday in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the biggest game of the year for us,'' said O'Neill,
whose first-inning home run off right-hander Dwight Gooden gave the
Yankees a 1-0 lead. ``We were playing for our lives out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, who during Game 2 of the Indians' Division Series with
the Boston Red Sox threw only 22 pitches before being ejected,
displayed the effects of inactivity throughout the Yankees' two-run
fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden issued consecutive walks to O'Neill and center fielder
Bernie Williams before surrendering a run-scoring, ground-rule
double to designated hitter Chili Davis. First baseman Tino
Martinez later delivered a sacrifice fly that scored Williams from
third and gave the Yankees a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Indians manager Mike Hargrove removed Gooden with two outs in
the fifth inning, and that ensured the right-hander of becoming the
only pitcher in the major leagues to make nine postseason starts
without a victory.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez earned his first in his first postseason appearance _
and in a game the Yankees could not afford to lose. The Yankees
would have faced elimination today with a loss last night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him at brunch today, and he asked me how I was
feeling,'' Torre said. ``I knew that was the first indication that
he was OK. He was very relaxed, very determined, and he was a
little reluctant to give me the ball when I went out there in the
eighth inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Mike Stanton, though, pitched a scoreless eighth
inning, and right-hander Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth for
the save in Hernandez's gem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was very good,'' Hargrove said. ``I don't know
that he missed any spots all night long. He threw the ball well and
made the pitches when he had to make them. He made some tough 3-2
pitches to get some of our big hitters out in some key
situations.''

   Kansas State shows &QL; 
Colorado right stuff
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
BOULDER, Colo. _ The purple-clad Kansas State fans who flocked to
Colorado's Folsom Field on Saturday had a reason to rejoice. Their
team successfully made the jump to Division I-A.
</P>
<P>
   After feasting on the downtrodden (Northern Illinois, Indiana
State, Northeast Louisiana) and semi-downtrodden (Texas), the
fifth-ranked Wildcats increased their record to 5-0 by beating
Colorado, an alleged heavyweight, 16-9.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State played stout defense and had the benefit of
Colorado's basic ineptitude in gaining the victory on a gorgeous,
60-degree evening in the Rockies. It was the first KSU victory in
Boulder since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   The loss was the first of the season for Colorado, which had
gained a No. 14 ranking after opening with five consecutive
victories.
</P>
<P>
   After falling behind 16-0, the Buffaloes came back with nine
points _ a touchdown and a field goal _ in the final 5:42. Kansas
State, trying to hold its seven-point lead, was forced to punt from
its 32-yard line with 37 seconds showing, but the Wildcats got a
gift first down when Colorado was penalized for having too many
players on the field.
</P>
<P>
   The game represented a new world for Kansas State, which had
outscored its previous four opponents by a total of 249-21. On a
night when star quarterback Michael Bishop put up mortal numbers
(19 yards rushing, 148 passing), the Wildcats relied on kicker
Martin Gramatica (three field goals) and a defense that sacked
Colorado quarterback Mike Moschetti five times.
</P>
<P>
   Moschetti was dreadful until the fourth quarter, when he
completed 10 of 18 passes for 117 yards and led the Buffaloes on
their two scoring drives.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is such a thing as an ugly win, you witnessed one
today,'' Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado's first series ended with punter Nick Pietsch, in his
own end zone, trying to run, finding no room and then booting the
ball into the stands. As a result, Kansas State took possession at
the Colorado 22. Seven plays later, the Wildcats got a 30-yard
field goal from Gramatica for a 3-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado wasn't able to cross midfield until five minutes were
gone in the second quarter. Moschetti hit Andy Peeke, coming out of
the backfield, for a 43-yard gain to the KSU 47. But disaster
struck the Buffaloes two plays later as Moschetti fumbled the snap,
Kansas State's Darren Howard winding up with the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Set up at midfield, Bishop threw deep on first down and found
Aaron Lockett for 44 yards. The Wildcats were in the end zone three
plays later, fullback Brian Goolsby going in from two yards out.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 13-0 late in the third quarter, Colorado gained some
life when Ben Kelly intercepted a Bishop pass. The play gave the
Buffaloes the ball at the Kansas State 39.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Cherrington blasted up the middle for 12 yards on first
down, but the drive stalled, leaving Colorado with a
fourth-and-five at the Kansas State 23. Moschetti threw incomplete
into the end zone on the fourth-down play.
</P>
<P>
   After Gramatica's 41-yard field goal made it 16-0, Colorado got
another break, a fumble by KSU running back Eric Hickson at his own
36, and actually did something with it. With 5:42 left in the game,
Moschetti threw five yards to Marcus Stiggers for the touchdown.
The two-point conversion attempt failed.
</P>
<P>
   On Colorado's next series, Moschetti again moved his team down
the field, this time coming away with Jeremy Aldrich's 20-yard
field goal with 1:46 remaining.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of an onside kick, Aldrich attempted, in CU coach Rick
Neuheisel's words, to ``kangaroo one down inside,'' and wound up
lofting the ball out of bounds. Kansas State took over at its 35
but did nothing with the opportunity, forcing James Garcia's punt.
</P>
<P>
   When the punt went into the end zone, Colorado apparently was
set up at its 20 with time enough to move down the field. But the
chance quickly went out the window when the Buffaloes were called
for having too many men on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to make a play and put Ben Kelly in for the punt
return,'' Neuheisel said, ``and we had 11 guys on the field.
(Special teams coach) Bobby (Hauck) thought, because we put Ben in
and not Roman (Hollowell), we only had 10 guys on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out we had 12 guys on the field at an inopportune
time. Whether it would have made a difference, no one can tell, but
I expect to hear about it. It certainly wasn't the way we want a
game to end.''

SMITH SAVES UMASS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GREENIDGE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; AMHERST, Mass. _ The University of Massachusetts, ranked 24th
nationally among Division 1-AA programs, was ahead by 16 points,
28-12, just 12 seconds into the fourth quarter Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   One might have considered that the game was over, but one would
have been wrong.
</P>
<P>
   It took a slight tip by Minuteman safety Brian Smith on a pass
over the middle into the end zone to Dukes wide receiver Marc
Bacote with 58 seconds left, causing the ball to fall incomplete,
that gave the Minutemen the Atlantic 10 win before 14,202 at Alumni
Field.
</P>
<P>
   Had James Madison's Greg Maddox completed that 2-point
conversion pass, it would have tied the game. Bacote was his third
option on the play, with wide receiver Ernest Payton, who had a
James Madison record 13 catches (for 155 yards) on the day, the
first option. But UMass wisely had him surrounded.
</P>
<P>
   UMass (4-1, 2-0) didn't play well, but came away with the 28-26
win, its fourth in a row. And James Madison (1-5, 0-3), playing
perhaps its best game of the season, was ahead, 12-7, at halftime,
but gave up 14 points in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UMass tailback Marcel Shipp dashed for 190 yards on 24 carries,
including a 12-yard touchdown jaunt. ``We knew he was shifty, but
we couldn't wrap him up,'' said James Madison free safety Tony
Booth.
</P>
<P>
   The huge factor, though, was the conversion pass attempt to tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we got a break when they were running the play and
we saw their set,'' said UMass first-year coach Mark Whipple. ``And
then Brian Smith, our most solid player on defense, our most
consistent player, had a tip on the pass to give us the win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Minutemen had some difficulties _ among them two missed
field goals. One was on the first series, after UMass recovered a
fumble, but the 40-yard attempt by Matt Murphy was wide left. And
then there was a 37-yarder with 2:55 to play, again wide left,
after UMass had a first down on the James Madison 12 earlier in the
series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We put pressure on Murphy all week,'' Whipple said. ``Two
missed field goals, that's hard to look at. We need a guy who is
going to come in and make big kicks.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the failed field goal, though, UMass right tackle Mim
Hill had an unsportsmanlike penalty called against him, and the
15-yard infraction brought the ball back to the James Madison 23.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one reason why you don't get into coaching,'' said
Whipple, who stresses that his team has to become more intense in
practice with first-team offense against first-team defense. ``That
could have cost us the game. That was a foolish penalty.''
</P>
<P>
   James Madison had the game's last two touchdowns, on a 4-yard
pass to tight end Craig Akins with 5:36 left, and then a 9-yard
scamper around the left end by tailback Delvin Joyce with 58
seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   UMass won, although it lacked spunk, especially in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a way to win and that's the important thing,''
Whipple said. ``I did a poor job of getting the kids prepared and
maybe we'll learn from that. We were up 16 points, but that's just
two possessions, and I think that because we were home, some of our
players might have felt that we could lie down.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel a lot better with this win than our loss to
Delaware, but it wasn't as good as our other wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Whipple credited JMU.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give credit to them,'' he said, ``but we didn't
have that eye of the tiger feeling. Our offensive line didn't come
out of the huddle like we wanted to play, and on defense we missed
a lot of tackles. But we found a way to win, showing a lot of
character in our kids.''

MINE SHAFT MAY HOLD CLUE TO AMTRAK DERAILMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Teams of lawmen descended 160 feet into a desert mine shaft
Saturday looking for dead bodies, stolen cars and evidence from the
1995 sabotage of an Amtrak passenger train.
</P>
<P>
   After a day's work in foothills north of Buckeye, the haul
included two stolen vehicles and a bunch of junk.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI agents, Department of Public Safety officers and
Maricopa County Sheriff's detectives planned to resume their
subterranean quest _ dubbed Operation Hells Gate _ this morning,
based on unrelated tips from informants.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Ray Churay said investigators are trying to
determine if an off-road vehicle that was yanked from the mine by a
crane Saturday is linked to the Amtrak derailment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel one of the vehicles may be associated with the
derailment,'' said Churay, who's in charge of the FBI's Phoenix
office. ``Intelligence developed during the year leads us to
believe that there may be evidence in the mine.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort took place in scrubby foothills about a mile north of
Interstate 10 at Miller Road. It was made treacherous by conditions
in the mine and the discovery of two dynamite sticks. Investigators
did not know whether the explosives were dropped into the shaft in
an effort to destroy evidence, or left from old mining operations.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment of the Sunset Limited took place three years ago
Friday about 40 miles southwest of Phoenix. One man died and 78
were injured.
</P>
<P>
   After the train jackknifed into Quail Springs Wash,
investigators found several anti-government notes signed by ``Sons
of the Gestapo.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was one of the most intensive law-enforcement
probes on record, with FBI agents and sheriff's deputies
interviewing hundreds of people and tracking thousands of leads.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators today suspect that the Gestapo letter was a ruse
designed to mislead them. Although the motive remains unknown, they
have pursued theories that the sabotage was done by someone with a
grudge against the railroad or emergency workers with a hero
complex.
</P>
<P>
   Several suspects were identified over the past three years. No
arrests have been made, but federal authorities say the Amtrak case
remains a top priority.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, the FBI announced that reward offers in the case
have been raised to $320,000. Guadalupe Gonzalez, special agent in
charge for Arizona, said he hopes the additional $200,000 will
encourage someone to step forward with information on the
saboteurs.
</P>
<P>
   The off-road vehicle discovered Saturday _ known as a sand rail
_ is a sort of dune buggy with roll bars. Agents would not say how
it might be connected with the case, but it is common for crime
scene investigators to take tire prints.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Amtrak crash, however, dozens of emergency
vehicles entered the area before it was secured.
</P>
<P>
   Churay declined to say what other evidence agents are hoping to
find in the mine shaft.
</P>
<P>
   DPS Officer Andy Vidaure said investigators in an auto-theft
task force learned of the 800-foot-deep pit from a confidential
informant who said that up to six stolen vehicles and two bodies
had been dumped there.
</P>
<P>
   He said that tip came about nine months ago, but retrieving
evidence was not considered worth the cost and danger until
additional tips surfaced involving Amtrak and homicide victims.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Dave Moyer of the Sheriff's Office said investigators
were told one of the corpses would be found in the trunk of a
stolen Mustang. He said investigators apparently do not know the
identities of the deceased, how they ended up in the mine or who
was responsible.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's lead apparently came independent of the DPS probe, and
Vidaure said there is no indication that the automobile thieves and
Amtrak terrorists are linked. But those two agencies joined forces
with sheriff's homicide and mountain rescue deputies for Saturday's
search.
</P>
<P>
   The mine, abandoned years ago, is on state land in an area
crisscrossed with vehicle trails. Investigators said trash has been
dumped into the hole along with crime evidence, and it is plain
that hundreds of people are familiar with the mine.
</P>
<P>
   Deputies wearing headlamps lowered themselves into the vertical
shaft with rappelling ropes to a point where eight vehicles were
clogged. A crane was used to haul out evidence. The deputies were
retrieved by about 20 officers who formed a sort of tug-o'-war team
to pull the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   Work was suspended Saturday evening after the crane's cable
broke while reeling in the Mustang. Officials said they intend to
remove the rest of the cars today, then descend 640 feet more to
check for evidence at the bottom. &QL;

   Baylor scores last-minute TD to outlast Kansas 31-24 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; By NEIL HOHLFELD &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
WACO _ Two also-rans from the North and South divisions of the Big
12 Conference got together Saturday night at Floyd Casey Stadium
for what likely was both teams' last chance for a victory until
sometime in November.
</P>
<P>
   Despite sloppy play for three quarters, Baylor didn't let the
opportunity slip away. Trailing 24-21 with less than four minutes
to play, the Bears scored 10 points in the late going to beat
Kansas 31-24.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Darrell Bush, who had been held to 54 yards on 21
carries before the final drive, broke loose for a 70-yard scamper
that moved the ball to the Jayhawks' 20-yard line. Bush carried
four times for 79 yards on the final drive, including a one-yard
run with 49 seconds left that lifted Baylor to the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jermaine Alfred, making his first start of the
season in place of Odell James, completed 15 of 29 passes for 288
yards, including 127 in the fourth quarter. Kansas seemed in
control of the game with a 24-14 lead entering the final quarter,
but the Jayhawks couldn't stop Alfred, wide receiver Morris
Anderson or Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is, the fun's in winning,'' Baylor coach Dave
Roberts said. ``We seem to play better in the second half for some
reason. The way we hung in there tonight and fought, it's something
to be very proud of.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the next month, things will get harder for Baylor (2-3, 1-2
Big 12) and Kansas (2-4, 0-4). Baylor's next four games are against
Texas A&AMP;M, Texas, Notre Dame and Kansas State, meaning its next
sniff of a victory likely will be Nov. 14 against Oklahoma. Kansas
plays Nebraska, Colorado and Kansas State, so its next chance for a
win probably won't be until Nov. 7 against North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Baylor's come-from-behind victory was important.
After upsetting North Carolina State 33-30 on Sept. 19, the Bears
lost by two points to Colorado and two points to Texas Tech.
Another close loss at home to a lesser foe could have spun the
Bears' season downward.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some really tough teams coming up, particularly next
week,'' Roberts said. ``That's a team (Texas A&AMP;M) that just beat
Nebraska, so it's not going to get any easier. Tonight, we hung
tough when we had to and made the plays at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson caught five passes for 147 yards, including receptions
of 39 and 49 yards in the final quarter. Those grabs set up Derek
Lagway's 19-yard touchdown run to pull Baylor to within 24-21 early
in the fourth quarter. With 3:50 left in the game, Matt Bryant's
42-yard field goal tied it at 24.
</P>
<P>
   Overtime seemed imminent when Baylor took over at its 10-yard
line with 2:26 left in the game. But Bush hit a big hole up the
middle, veered to his right and raced to the Kansas 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This boosts our egos a lot,'' said Bush, who finished with 133
yards on 24 carries. ``To be able to come from behind like we did
feels good after losing like we have lately.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter, Kansas looked every bit like a team that
was incapable of winning no matter the opponent. The Jayhawks ran
12 plays without a first down. Of those 12 plays, five were
incomplete passes by quarterback Zac Wegner and four were rushing
plays that resulted in negative yards. Kansas had three yards of
total offense.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas even failed at the old one-two-three-kick routine. After
a drive stalled at their 39 late in the first quarter, the Jayhawks
handed Baylor its first touchdown of the game. Punter Matt Tyler
dropped the deep snap, and Clifton Rubin picked up the ball and ran
27 yards into the end zone with 1:08 left in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The second quarter was a different matter for Kansas. Led by
Mitch Bowles, a 5-8, 190-pound reserve running back, the Jayhawks
gained 203 yards in the quarter and scored twice within a
four-minute span to go ahead 14-7.
</P>
<P>
   Wegner, who was 12-of-33 for 254 yards, dumped a pass to Bowles,
who raced 62 yards to the Baylor four. Before that play, Kansas had
run 14 plays that had resulted in an incomplete pass or negative
rushing yards and 10 plays with positive yardage.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it wasn't easy for the Jayhawks to score their first
touchdown. A pass-interference call on Rodney Smith on a third-down
play kept Kansas' drive going, and Wegner went in from the one to
tie it with 3:52 left.
</P>
<P>
   On their final first-half drive, the Jayhawks moved the ball 74
yards in less than two minutes, with Bowles carrying 32 yards to
set up his one-yard touchdown run with 11 seconds left in the half.
</P>
<P>
   Baylor tied the game at 14 with a sharp opening second-half
drive behind Alfred, who threw 35 yards to Anderson on
third-and-nine for the touchdown. The rest of the quarter belonged
to Kansas, though.
</P>
<P>
   The Jayhawks got a 42-yard field goal from Joe Garcia to go
ahead 17-14 with 8:48 left and increased their lead to 24-14 on a
27-yard scoring pass from Wegner to Termaine Fulton late in the
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But Alfred and Bush saved the best for last, and the Bears were
able to win a close game to give themselves a boost heading into
the most difficult portion of their schedule.

UNH LACKS FINISH AGAINST RICHMOND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALLEN LESSELS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; DURHAM, N.H. _ Richmond coach Jim Reid was none too confident
with the way his Spiders warmed up and had trouble holding on to
passes before Saturday's game with the University of New Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't feel a whole lot better after his team squandered a
7-0 lead and fell into a 13-7 hole at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of felt like we were getting run out of the
ballpark,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And then the Spiders turned it around. They handled the wet and
nasty weather, and the Wildcats. They played ball control on the
Wildcats, who like to play ball control.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Jimmie Miles passed for a couple of touchdowns and
the Spider defense, helped by UNH's problems holding onto the ball,
shut down the Wildcats for a 22-13 win. Richmond improved to 4-2
overall and continues a swing through New England next Saturday at
Maine. UNH dropped to 2-3 and has Northeastern at home Saturday.
The game did not count in the Atlantic 10 standings.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tale of two halves.
</P>
<P>
   Two halves for Miles, who was 0 for 6 passing in the first half
with two interceptions. And was 7 for 7 in the second half with the
two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Two halves for UNH tailback Jerry Azumah, who had 127 yards on
13 carries in the first half, which put him over the 1,000-yard
mark for the fourth year as he became the only 1-AA runner to
accomplish that feat. He carried only eight times in the second
half as the UNH offense fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   One constant was UNH's difficulty holding onto the ball. The
Wildcats lost an Azumah fumble early in the game at the Richmond
26. And lost another late. Several times there were problems with
the exchange between center Jeff Hayes and quarterback Tim Cramsey.
Several other times receivers failed to hold onto Cramsey passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's something we haven't been doing all year,'' said UNH
coach Bill Bowes of the bad snaps. ``It puts you behind in down and
distance. It's hard to overcome that. Give them credit, they did a
better job holding onto the football than we did. They did a much
better job.''
</P>
<P>
   Richmond broke on top when Miles finished a 58-yard drive with a
7-yard touchdown run midway through the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UNH got that one back on a 41-yard Azumah touchdown on a double
reverse on the first play of the second quarter. UNH went ahead,
13-7 _ the extra point snap was botched _ on a Cramsey to Jermaine
Washington 13-yard touchdown pass with nine seconds left in the
half.
</P>
<P>
   The Spiders tied it 13-13 _ they also had problems on the
conversion _ on their third play of the second half, a 20-yard
touchdown pass from Miles to Matt Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Richmond went back in front on the first play of the fourth
quarter, when Miles connected with Dwaune Jones for a 28-yard
touchdown on a fourth-and-3 play. Jeff Falkowski made the kick and
it was 20-13.
</P>
<P>
   Azumah started UNH's next series with a 21-yard run to the
Richmond 43. And Cramsey fumbled the snap and the Spiders
recovered.
</P>
<P>
   UNH went three plays and out on its next two series. And on the
one after that, after being backed up to his 9 by a holding call,
Cramsey was pulled down in the end zone for a safety by Richmond
tackle Marc Megna, a senior out of Fall River, Mass.

NBA SHOWS INTEREST TO TICKET HOLDERS

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Getting killed in the stock market? You should have
bought season tickets for the Suns or any other NBA team.
</P>
<P>
   With the preseason already wiped out, and the likelihood of
regular-season games going next, at least season-ticket holders can
look forward to getting some money back with interest.
</P>
<P>
   The league announced its policy for season-ticket returns
earlier, and now it will be implementing it.
</P>
<P>
   The plan calls for clubs to refund money at the end of each
month for any games missed during that month _ plus 6 percent
interest.
</P>
<P>
   For clubs, such as the Suns, that include preseason tickets in
their season packages, that money also will be refunded.
</P>
<P>
   Suns General Manager Bryan Colangelo would not comment on the
ticket policy but confirmed the Suns will follow the league plan.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it works:
</P>
<P>
   Within five days after the end of November, the club will be
required to send a check to season-ticket holders for any games
missed in November plus the three home preseason games lost in
October.
</P>
<P>
   So, if the season starts on Dec. 1, a season-ticket holder would
get a refund for 13 November games and three preseason games, plus
6 percent interest from the time the tickets were paid for in full.
Season-ticket renewals were due in full in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   If games are lost in December, the process will repeat at the
end of December and so on.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, for clubs that have partial season-ticket
packages, the ticket holder has the option of a cash refund or
substituting games later in the season.
</P>
<P>
   The Suns have only one partial ticket plan, and it is a
half-season split for floor seats. Since both half-season plans are
sold out, those ticket holders will likely receive a cash refund
unless they want to trade for other seats available in the lower
bowl of the arena or a combination of the two, according to the
league policy.

   Texas unloads arsenal, whips OU
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Oklahoma coaches swore all week that Ricky Williams would
not beat the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of the swearing just north of the Red River is in
reaction to how Major Applewhite, Wane McGarity and the Texas
defense beat the Sooners 34-3 at the Cotton Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And there is likely to be plenty of swearing in the direction of
Oklahoma head coach John Blake. His team committed 14 penalties for
109 yards as the Sooners suffered their worst loss to Texas since a
41-9 decision in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite threw for 293 yards, and McGarity caught six passes
for 153 yards, including 97 on the longest pass play in UT history.
The Longhorns' defense, meanwhile, enjoyed its best performance in
three years. The much-maligned unit held the Sooners to 197 yards,
its fewest surrendered since SMU totaled 188 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners tried three quarterbacks, but none was effective
against the swarming Longhorns. OU running back De'Mond Parker, who
ripped the Longhorns for 291 yards and three touchdowns last year,
was held to 93 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And in an oh-by-the-way performance (for him, anyway), Williams
rushed for 139 yards and two touchdowns against the Sooners, who at
times had as many as 10 defenders within a yard of the line of
scrimmage trying to stop the nation's leading ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw them walk eight (defensive players) up in the box,
I just kind of thought to myself, `Surprise, surprise,'''
Applewhite said. ``Every defensive coordinator will say, `We're
going to put eight in the box.' It's not a surprise. You have to.
If you're going to put seven in there, then you're gonna have
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite continues to cause trouble for defenses that gear
their entire game plan to stopping Williams. The redshirt freshman,
who started his first game against Kansas State in place of the
injured Richard Walton, has thrown for more than 200 yards in each
of his four starts.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the Longhorns (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) to three consecutive
wins, Applewhite has directed the offense to scores in more than
half of its drives (22 of 43).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a balanced offense,'' McGarity said. ``We do a great
job of doing everything out there. Ricky's gonna get the ball _ we
know that's our game plan coming in. When we call passes, it's our
chance to shine. A lot of teams are going to stack the line like OU
did today, and the big plays are going to happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity has four games of 100-plus receiving yards this season,
and the Longhorns have had a receiver with 100 or more yards in a
school-record six consecutive games. Kwame Cavil was just shy of
that number against the Sooners, catching three balls for 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of this as a good game. I only completed 50
percent of my passes (14 of 27),'' Applewhite said. ``But we made
the plays when we had to. That's what we have to do to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma got on the board first with Jeff Ferguson's 47-yard
field goal four minutes into the game. But Texas held a 17-3 lead
at the half thanks to a 20-yard Williams scoring run and
Applewhite's 56-yard touchdown pass to Cavil in the first quarter
and Kris Stockton's 48-yard field goal just before the half.
</P>
<P>
   A quick turn of events early in the third quarter turned the
game into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a spark after a lackluster first half, the Sooners
seemed to get it with Michael Thornton's 79-yard return of the
second-half kickoff to the Texas 15.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, the Sooners were inches away from pulling
within a touchdown when disaster struck. The snap from center
squirted through the hands of quarterback Brandon Daniels, and
Casey Hampton recovered at the two for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams gained a yard, Applewhite and McGarity broke the
game open. McGarity got behind OU cornerback Corey Ivy on a deep
post pattern, and Applewhite, after a straight drop into the end
zone, hit him in stride near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy had no chance in a foot race with the speedy McGarity, and
seconds later, the orange-clad UT faithful at the north end of the
stadium _ part of a total crowd of 75,587 _ were rocking when
McGarity scored.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-yard pass play eclipsed the Texas record of 96 yards from
Todd Dodge to Donovan Pitts against Rice in 1985. More importantly,
it put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice kickoff that gave us a little momentum, but then
we fumble the ball on the one-yard line. You just cannot do that,''
Blake said. ``I thought that was a key play in the ballgame,
because we had the opportunity to get right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense made a big stop and jarred the ball loose,'' Brown
said, ``and then (offensive coordinator) Greg Davis made a great
call. That really put some separation between the two teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' call allowed Applewhite to read the OU safeties and
decide whether to run with Williams or go deep to McGarity.
Applewhite made the wise choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They literally played nine men in the box the whole game, and
our receivers took advantage of that,'' Williams said. ``We got up
to the line (before the 97-yard touchdown), and we had a toss play
called, and Major saw that even in (that) situation the safety was
up six yards from the line of scrimmage. So he checked to a pass
play, and it was wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a gradual thing over the past three games.
The defense has been getting better, and the offense has been
getting better, and it all kind of came together this game.''

FRAZIER SUCCESSFULLY JUG GLES ASU, FIESTA, USOC DUTIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - This is the fall of Herman Frazier's content.
</P>
<P>
   And the busiest the 43-year-old has ever been, which is saying
something for a man whose 20-year professional head has never been
covered by a single hat.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier's 20th year in athletic administration at his alma mater
Arizona State begins in March. He is one of two senior associate
athletic directors, a job that would be plenty for most mortals.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he concedes that his one-year stint as president of the
Fiesta Bowl in this, the first go-round of the Bowl Championship
Series, is like another full-time job. And his other volunteer
positions _ vice president of the U.S. Olympic Committee and
chairman of the Maricopa County Sports Commission _ are as
consuming and complex as anything that comes his way through ASU
and the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that amazes me most is how he is able to tackle each
problem with a great deal of intensity,'' said John Junker, the
Fiesta Bowl executive director who has known Frazier since their
undergraduate days at ASU in the mid1970s. ``His mental stamina. He
shifts gears quicker than anybody I've ever seen. His ability to
keep up the pace. I think I'd last a month.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier passes along the credit faster than the 44.95 seconds it
took to win a 400-meter bronze medal _ and a 4x400 gold _ at the
1976 Olympics. What he calls his ASU cabinet _ assistant athletic
directors Cathy Reid, Mike Chismar and Tom Salder and master
scheduler Jill Adams _ gives Frazier the rope to spread himself
thin yet keep the quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``My grade-point average was higher during the track season than
it was in the fall because I knew I only had a window of time to do
things in the spring,'' Frazier said. ``With juggling 50,000
things, I am probably at my best.''
</P>
<P>
   So Frazier departs after five days in Winnipeg, Manitoba, where
he will be U.S. mission chief for the 1999 Pan American Games, in
time to reach Los Angeles at 2 a.m. for the ASU-Southern California
football game. This week he whirls through a string of
bring-me-up-to-speed campus meetings to clear the deck for
glad-handing with College Football Hall of Famers and meeting with
ABC television officials and sponsors for the Fiesta Bowl,
co-hosting Notre Dame's first football game against ASU and
welcoming the entire U.S. Olympic family to his backyard.
</P>
<P>
   Kickoff at Sun Devil Stadium on Saturday was a half hour before
the USOC Board of Directors meeting, with Frazier on the agenda to
present a Pan Am Games report, began in downtown Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tough compared to if I was out of town,'' Frazier
admitted. ``I just pick out what I ``have'' to do, and it's a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazier already had 12 years (1980-92) experience on the USOC
Board of Directors when he shifted from the organization to USA
Track &AMP; Field, becoming a vice president. Then came the opportunity
to be U.S. assistant mission chief for the Atlanta Olympics and
encouragement from former USOC President Dr. LeRoy Walker and
former USATF executive director Ollan Cassell to pursue one of
three USOC vice-president slots for 1997-2000.
</P>
<P>
   The timing coincided with ASU's athletic-direction transition
from Charles Harris to Christine Wilkinson (interim) to Kevin
White, all of whom supported Frazier's moonlighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona State has always strongly encouraged career
enhancement and development,'' White said. ``Quite frankly at the
end of the day, the university is the big winner in this regard. It
keeps ASU current and makes us look at issues and trends
proactively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Herman is doing a fabulous job to balance all the balls. Most
people could not do what he's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor could Frazier, he thinks, if the time comes that he has a
chance to be USOC president. Or a USOC staff member, which some
feel he is best suited for because of his administrative
background. Or an athletic director, a job that narrowly eluded him
after on-campus interviews at Missouri, San Diego State, California
and Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of a blessing in disguise,'' Frazier said. ``If I
would have taken one of those positions, I would have not have been
VP of the USOC nor would I be the president of the Fiesta Bowl.
That's why I talk about being lucky and fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been a wonderful education to be involved with the
(USOC) Executive Committee. Being on the board is one thing, but
when you're in that room and involved in that decision-making
process, it's incredible. I liken it to a professor taking a
sabbatical to do some research. For me, it's kind of like ongoing
research.'' &QL;

OLYMPIC OFFI CIAL IS A WOMAN ON THE RISE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Her real-estate competitors sometimes suggest to
potential clients that Sandra Baldwin is too busy to handle their
business.
</P>
<P>
   She knows better, and in this day of e-mail, fax and cell
phones, so do her customers. Baldwin's Prudential Arizona Realty
string of most properties sold since 1987 remains intact even as
her commitments to the U.S. Olympic Committee increase as she edges
toward election as the organization's first female president.
</P>
<P>
   If a proposed change in the USOC constitution is passed at the
next Board of Directors meeting in April, current President William
Hybl could run for a second term. Even that would only slow the
seemingly inevitable ascension of Baldwin, a native Arizonan whose
sports career began because her two children were country-club
swimmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly I'd love to be president,'' said Baldwin, 59, who
was USOC treasurer from 1993-96 and has been on the Board of
Directors since '85. ``I've been here a long time and I've worked
hard and I think I understand the organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good old boys organization for so long and
regretfully a good old White boys organization for so long that
it's only been in the past 15 years we've had any diversity. Yet,
look at our athletes. We have great African-American athletes, we
have great Paralympians. When you think we've only had two women
officers (Evie Dennis, a former vice president, being the other), I
think having a woman president would say something toward promoting
women in sports.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin and national-level Olympic sports almost perfectly
coincides with Baldwin and real estate.
</P>
<P>
   After she gave up an 11-year career teaching English at Arizona
State _ ``I got burned out. I couldn't think of anything new I
wanted to say and the environment was a little insulated'' _ she
stepped from Arizona swimming to treasurer of U.S. Swimming
(1978-82).
</P>
<P>
   Her first real-estate listing was in 1982, producing a
half-million dollar sale.
</P>
<P>
   Her almost straight-line rise in both fields has broadened
Baldwin's life beyond her post-classroom imaginings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my aspirations, at every stage of wherever I was, was
to try to do a good job at what I was doing at the time,'' she
said. ``I'm just such a believer in people being at the right place
at the right time and that things happen for a reason if we try to
do them right.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin was president of U.S. Swimming (1984-86) and U.S.
Shooting (1994-95), on the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games
board of directors and finance committee and U.S. mission chief for
the 1995 Pan American Games in Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   She is U.S. mission chief for the 2000 Olympics and in a recent
10-day period traveled to Salt Lake, Sydney, back here for a day
and Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is also on the finance committee that recently delivered
a $1.45 billion budget with a specific price tag on almost every
item.
</P>
<P>
   ``This far out, it's as detailed a budget as any Olympic
organizing committee has had,'' Baldwin said. ``It's going to have
to be done that way. If the Olympics are going to be in this
country, it's very important that we know how much they're going to
cost, what the timing is on that cost and at the end of the day how
you're going to raise the money for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like putting on a county fair yet most people that
sit on these board of trustees until they are really intimately
involved don't understand the scope of the mission.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin knows all too well about the reality of crunching
numbers that in the case of the USOC quadrennium budget have topped
$450 million. That's why she relishes the mission chief role and
putting athlete faces to the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So that you're not always behind a desk and not always looking
at dollars,'' she said. ``Someone has to do that and I manage to do
that pretty well so that's where I have to be part of the time, but
that's not where I have to be all of the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sydney, said Baldwin who will make two more trips to Australia
in 1999 and another in 2000 before the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Games, ``is
going to be the most beautiful Summer Olympics certainly that I've
had the opportunity to see.'' &QL;

USOC IN CREASES SPENDING, FAILS ON `ATHLETE' DEFINITION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The United States Olympic Committee Board of Directors
approved a revised budget Saturday while putting off until today
consideration of the most contentious issue on its Phoenix agenda.
</P>
<P>
   The definition of an athlete, vital to determining who qualifies
to fill the required 20 percent athlete representation in the U.S.
Olympic Committee, was thought to have been hashed out between the
Athletes Advisory Council and National Governing Bodies Council.
</P>
<P>
   But the council pulled its approval Saturday morning, sending
the two groups back into conference with the hope of an agreement
that can be put before the board.
</P>
<P>
   The AAC wants a tighter definition that favors Olympic athlete
selection to the board, committees and task forces. The council
favors a broader definition that makes it easier to fill the 20
percent allotment.
</P>
<P>
   The budget revision includes an additional $28 million in
spending previously approved for Podium 2002 (Salt Lake Winter
Olympics) and Vision 2000/2004 (Sydney/Athens Summer Olympics)
athlete support.
</P>
<P>
   USOC expenses are projected at $462,000 for the quadrennium
through 2000 with revenue pegged at $430 million. The $32 million
deficit is somewhat deceiving because an already-negotiated
increase in domestic Olympic television rights turns that into a
projected $65 million surplus by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Treasurer  &UR; Jim Morris said the USOC is $11 million ahead of
schedule in revenue receipt and $19 million under budget so that
the organization will need to borrow against its line of credit
this year. He termed the USOC financial condition as superior.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour Saturday board session included a video tribute to
1988 three-time Olympic track gold medalist  &UR; Florence Griffith
Joyner, who died Sept. 21 of an apparent heart attack at age 38,
and video highlights from the 1998 Nagano Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Chris Schenkel of ABC Sports gave the keynote address, touching
on the 10 Olympics he covered beginning with the 1960 Squaw Valley
Winter Games.
</P>
<P>
   Schenkel, 75, told of his meetings with three of America's
greatest Olympians:  &UR; Jim Thorpe,  &UR; Babe Didriksen and  &UR; Jesse Owens.
Owens lived in Phoenix from 1972 until his death at age 66 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   USOC Executive Director  &UR; Dick  &UR; Schultz told the 110-member board
that the revised Amateur Sports Act will be attached to the Omnibus
Spending Bill in hopes of getting what will be renamed the Olympic
Sports Act through the U.S. Congress this session.
</P>
<P>
   The landmark legislation, passed in 1978 and naming the USOC as
the country's coordinating body for Olympic athletics, is being
amended for inclusion and mark/symbol protection purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz reminded his audience that the percentage of total
medals won by the United States at Atlanta in 1996 and Nagano was
down from previous Olympics because more sports are offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our program is going in the wrong direction,'' he said, adding
that the earlier the athletes get their training money, the better
the chances of winning a medal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Anita DeFrantz, one of two U.S. International Olympic Committee
members, spoke about the World Conference on Doping, Feb. 2-4 in
Lausanne, Switzerland, out of which a new indepedent agency for
drug testing, education and research could be formed.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed Olympic Movement Anti-Drug Agency (OMADA) would be
responsible for testing at major international competitions in all
sports with consistent sanctions and appeals process.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Soccer Federation was removed from probation because it
has completed constitutional changes required to maintain its USOC
membership.
</P>
<P>
   Among the USOC state fund-raising officials approved was  &UR; Fred
 &UR; Bauman of Phoenix as Arizona vice-chairman. The Arizona chairman
is  &UR; Dr. Art
 &UR; Mollen. &QL;

MUD BATH REJUVENTATES HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE CONCANNON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ It'd been down for the count, a Harvard team that
went unbeaten in the Ivy League a year ago. The Crimson were 0-3
entering Saturday's game vs. Cornell, but maybe all it took was a
good mud bath in Harvard Stadium and a rejuvenated Chris Menick.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were losing respect for us,'' said Menick. ``I knew we
had the ability to do it. It was just a matter of wanting it, and
going out and proving it.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Crimson slopped and slugged their way to a 19-12 victory,
a win that left the Crimson with a 1-1 record among the Ivies and
very much alive and kicking in the Order of the Ancient Eight,
where there appears to be no dominant team. ``After we graduated 16
guys last year,'' said captain and defensive tackle Brendan Bibro,
``we had to mesh as a team, and that had to take some time.''
</P>
<P>
   This was a surprisingly good game with a variety of big plays on
a field that was pure slop in the second half after three days of
occasionally torrential rains. The teams combined for more than 500
rushing yards, and Menick felt a sense of redemption after a
penalty in the fourth quarter in last week's 17-12 setback against
Lehigh stalled a Crimson drive. He ran 39 times for 176 yards to
move into third on the career list with 1,920.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really disappointed when it's self-inflicted,'' said
first-year Big Red (2-2) coach Pete Mangurian. ``We had
opportunities, and when you do you have to take advantage of them.
We were in a situation where someone was going to come out of it
1-1 in the league and someone was going to come out 0-2. They made
the big plays when they had to, and we didn't. The bottom line is
we turned the ball over, and didn't make big plays when we had
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Cornell seized a 3-0 lead 9:36 into the first quarter on a
23-yard field goal by John McCombs but was stalled after picking up
a first down on the 4 on a 17-yard run by Deon Harris. On the
Crimson's next possession split end Terence Patterson swung around
from the left side to take a reverse and raced 60 yards up the
right sideline for a 6-3 lead at 11:14 of the quarter. He'd scored
on a 62-yard reverse a year ago at Dartmouth and is a distinct deep
threat for the Crimson.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Red failed to capitalize on a third-down play from the 6
after Justin Bush ran it 48 yards to the Crimson 11, but after a
loss of 17 for illegal use of hands McCombs kicked a 40-yard field
goal to create a 6-6 halftime tie. The Crimson got going in the
third quarter on three runs by Menick totaling 40 yards, but had to
settle for John Patton's 21-yard field goal. After Isiah Kacyvenski
intercepted a Mike Hood pass, Patton missed a 25-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   There was enough excitement in the next few moments to whet the
appetites of both sides on this wet, chilled afternoon. The game's
next play saw Aron Natale tip a Hood pass, and defensive back Glenn
Jackson caught it and returned it 41 yards for a 16-6 lead on
Patton's extra point. Before anybody could get overly excited, Bush
took the ensuing kickoff and, virtually untouched, raced 87 yards
to cut the deficit to 16-12.

 Tampa-Florida rivalry turns ugly   
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The natural rivalry between the Florida Panthers and Tampa Bay
Lightning took a turn for the worse after an ugly incident during
the preseason, when not only fists were flying, but apparently, so
were some racial taunts.
</P>
<P>
   Great, just what the NHL needs. More stupid remarks from stupid
players.
</P>
<P>
   This time, it supposedly came from the mouth of Tampa Bay's
 &UR; Darcy
 &UR; Tucker, who, according to eyewitnesses yelled a series of
expletives and a racial slur at Florida's  &UR; Peter Worrell, who is
black.
</P>
<P>
   Later, from the penalty box, both Tucker and teammate  &UR; Sandy
McCarthy reportedly made apelike gestures toward Worrell, who
responded only with laughter. Both Tucker and McCarthy have
emphatically denied the accusations and after an investigation into
the incident, the league absolved each of them because of
insufficient evidence.
</P>
<P>
   That won't be the end if it.
</P>
<P>
   Florida Coach  &UR; Terry Murray already has taken offense to
suggestions from the Lightning that the Panthers lied about the
allegations. And he tore into Tampa Bay Coach  &UR; Jacques Demers,
directly blaming him for the actions of  &UR; Andrei Nazarov, who made
an ugly game even uglier by sucker-punching Florida's  &UR; Rob
Niedermayer from behind toward the end of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way Jacques has operated during his entire coaching
career _ everything from behind,'' Murray said. ``That's a
(expletive) move. The ref came over to me afterwards and said it
was just awful. To send a guy out there who plays just five minutes
a game to jump another guy is (expletive). It's a (expletive) move.
But that's the way Jacques has coached all his life. It's a bunch
of crap.''
</P>
<P>
   Demers said Nazarov acted on his own and even called it
``unprofessional.'' Demers also said he thinks Murray is still mad
at him because he got the Tampa Bay job last year after it had been
offered to Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever, but don't expect this feud to die down anytime soon.
It's probably only going to get worse. &QL; 
Chicago toughness
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about  &UR; Dirk Graham, the new head coach of the
Chicago Blackhawks, being too green for the job as a 38-year-old,
first-time coach at any level. Graham even understands if some
question his choice as the replacement for the fired  &UR; Craig
Hartsburg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a legitimate concern, and I would think the same
way if I was looking at the situation,'' Graham said. ``But I could
sit here and have 20 years on the job, but if I lose 60 percent of
my games . . . I have no coaching experience, but I'm confident in
what I can do. I've been around the game for 30 years and played it
since I was 5, so I think I know a little about the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham saw enough by watching the Blackhawks play last season to
know at least one thing: The club had lost its respect around the
NHL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is anytime a team comes into your building and
takes liberties with your captain, they're pretty much saying, `We
don't have any respect for you at all.' And what are we going to do
about it? This is our home, where we practice every day and where
we live every day. When someone comes in and doesn't show you any
respect in the place where you work every day, then it's something
that needs to be addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Team toughness was never a problem during Graham's days with the
Blackhawks, when he wore the ``C'' from 1988 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always a leader as a player, and as a coach, I'm sure
he's going to lay it on the line just as he did when he was
skating,'' Chicago's  &UR; Tony Amonte said. ``Dirk is himself _ he
always tells it straight, and you always know what to expect from
him. What else could a player want?''
</P>
<P>
   General Manager  &UR; Bob Murray said he might have gotten a little
more than he expected in hiring Graham over several other
experienced candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is about Dirk. Some guys are just born to
do it,'' Murray said. ``There's a quiet confidence there. He knows
the game, and he has the presence of mind to handle this.'' &QL; 
The Avs and Av-nots
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell the Colorado Avalanche that the regular season
doesn't mean anything. They were terrible in the second half last
year, winning only eight of their final 22 games, and they blew it
in the playoffs by getting stunned by the Edmonton Oilers after
taking a 3-1 series edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playoffs were a huge disappointment, and that can't happen
again,'' center  &UR; Peter Forsberg said. ``It's a long road until the
playoffs, but you build the whole season, . . . you live off what
you did during the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing in the new Northwest Division with Calgary, Edmonton and
Vancouver will only help Colorado, clearly the best of the lot. But
the Avalanche, under new Coach  &UR; Bob Hartley, won't take anything
for granted. They can't.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody looks like they're more into it this year,''
Forsberg said. ``When you get a new coach, that's something that
happens. It's good for us. I think we needed that.''
</P>
<P>
   They could use All-Star defenseman  &UR; Sandis Ozolinsh, too. He
remains unsigned, and negotiations have reached another impasse
after he turned down a three-year offer worth $10 million, which
seems more than fair. After all, the kid only made $1.5 million
last season. &QL; 
Who's that Predator?
</P>
<P>
   His name is  &UR; Jamie Heward, and in case you missed it, the
forward for the expansion Nashville Predators tied for the
preseason goal-scoring lead with such marquee names as  &UR; Eric
Lindros, Teemu Selanne and  &UR; Luc
 &UR; Robitaille. He finished with six goals, including four on the power
play, also good enough for first in the preseason.
</P>
<P>
   Heward didn't even play a single game in the NHL last season. He
was in the minors. &QL;

Stars open with win over Sabres 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Stars showed a form of banner envy last night that
was enough to make Mike Modano chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   After the Stars raised three banners _ for the Presidents'
Trophy, the Western Conference regular-season championship and the
Central Division championship _ to the roof before the season
opener, the Stars center quipped: ``I was waiting for them to put
up the Power Play banner and the Norelco Faceoff banner. Heck, we
should have about six up there.''
</P>
<P>
   But just as quickly as he started the laughter in the postgame
press conference, Modano settled it down with one quiet, but firm
statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're still missing the important one, though,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the Stanley Cup championship banner, and the Stars
and Modano showed their hunger for it, ripping off a 4-1 victory
against the Buffalo Sabres before a sellout crowd of 16,928 fans at
Reunion Arena. Modano had a goal and two assists and sparked a
power play that went 3-for-8 as the Stars battered two-time
defending NHL MVP Dominik Hasek. The Sabres goalie fell to 3-7
lifetime against the Stars and has now yielded 10 goals in his past
two visits to Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Hasek simply wasn't enough to stop a Stars team that sent
offensive rushes in waves, played physical defense and got a solid
27-save performance from Ed Belfour in goal. In short, the Stars'
depth was simply too much for the Sabres, who were good enough to
make it to the Eastern Conference Finals last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a little bit from everyone; that's who we are, and
that's who we've been for the past three years,'' defenseman
Richard Matvichuk said.
</P>
<P>
   While valued veterans Joe Nieuwendyk and Brian Skrudland still
are sidelined with knee injuries, the Stars definitely made use of
their new pieces. Winger Brett Hull had an assist and fired off six
shots. Tough winger Brent Severyn won his fight with Sabres' tough
guy Rob Ray. Rookie winger Jamie Wright had a yeoman performance on
the checking line.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of the old dependables also showed up. Modano was
spectacular with his three points, an 18-6 night in the faceoff
circle and the speed to draw two key penalties. Linemate Jere
Lehtinen was a pesky performer all night, logging 24:18 minutes of
ice time and adding a goal and an assist. Sergei Zubov had two
assists. Darryl Sydor added a goal.
</P>
<P>
   Derian Hatcher played a team-leading 25:48 and added five hits.
Pat Verbeek had a goal and five hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a long time since we've had a nucleus of such great
players,'' Modano said. ``We have a lot of people to go to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars' first goal was a perfect example. Lehtinen hustled to
keep the puck in the offensive zone on the power play; Modano then
threaded a cross-ice pass to Sydor sneaking in the back door, and
Sydor lifted a perfect shot over Hasek's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great shot,'' Verbeek said. ``It was the only one
we could get by him on the first try.''
</P>
<P>
   Modano scored on a rebound at even strength to make it 2-0 after
the first period, while Verbeek scored on a charge to the net in
the second period, and Lehtinen finished the scoring at the 19:16
mark of the third period.
</P>
<P>
   In between, Geoff Sanderson scored for the Sabres to cut the
deficit to 3-1, but Belfour wouldn't let the Stars get any further
behind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a little bit of a letdown in the second period,''
Matvichuk said. ``But we picked it right back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is exactly what the Stars had in mind after watching three
banners raised that all fell short of last season's primary goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great, it meant a lot to accomplish that,'' Matvichuk
said. ``We just want to improve on what we've already accomplished.
We want more this season.''

Hernandez, relievers shut down Indians 4-0
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JOSEPH DUARTE &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CLEVELAND _ There's something about pitchers with the last name
Hernandez that gives the Cleveland Indians chills in October.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, it was Florida's Livan Hernandez. On Saturday night,
it was his older half-brother, Orlando, who caused the Indians
problems as the New York Yankees evened the American League
Championship Series at two games apiece with a 4-0 victory before a
crowd of 44,981 at Jacobs Field.
</P>
<P>
   If you're scoring at home: Hernandez brothers 3, Indians 0.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Orlando Hernandez watched from his native Cuba as
Livan won two games the Indians and was named MVP of the World
Series _ won by Florida in seven games.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, it was Orlando Hernandez who gave the troubled Yankees
a much-needed shot in the arm, throwing seven scoreless innings and
allowing only three hits. He struck out six and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   The New York offense continued its slumber, but Hernandez _ and
a solo home run by Paul O'Neill in the first inning _ proved to be
enough to guarantee the series will head back to the Big Apple for
at least one more game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were playing for our lives,'' O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention, a place in history. With the victory, the
Yankees have won a major-league record 119 games during the regular
season and postseason, surpassing the 1906 Chicago Cubs' total 118.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez _ nicknamed ``El Duque'' _ showed no signs of rust
from not having pitched in two weeks, using a breaking ball to keep
the Yankees in check while avenging a 4-1 loss to Cleveland on July
13.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the Indians could put nothing together against
Hernandez. Cleveland, which smashed four home runs Friday in a 6-1
win, only could scrape up two singles and a double off Hernandez,
who turns 29 today.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera combined to shut out the Indians
over the final two innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I pretty much had a must-win situation,'' Hernandez
said. ``I had pressure, but I had no fear. I've been through many
difficult times in my life on and off the field. I knew I would be
able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressure?
</P>
<P>
   Before his start Saturday, Hernandez was asked to name the
biggest game of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, of choosing one of the many highlights during a career
with the Cuban national team that included a 129-47 won-loss
record, he recalled the day last December when, along with seven
others, he boarded a boat and drifted for three days in the
Caribbean before being picked up by the Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez cruised most of the way Saturday, and when he did get
in trouble he calmly found a way to keep the Indians off the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   In the sixth inning, Cleveland had runners at first and third
and one out after Omar Vizquel singled and Hernandez hit David
Justice with a pitch. Hernandez reached back to strike out the
Indians' top two power threats _ Manny Ramirez and Jim Thome _ to
end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big lift for us,'' Yankees manager Joe Torre said.
``The biggest lift of the night was him striking out Thome with two
men on base late in the game. Everybody jumped up off the bench on
that one. That was huge.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was probably the at-bat of the game for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland also got two runners on in the eighth. Stanton, who
came on in relief with Enrique Wilson on base, struck out Kenny
Lofton before allowing a single to Vizquel. Stanton then got
Justice to ground into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees didn't fare a lot better Dwight Gooden, who allowed
only three hits _ but three runs _ in 4 innings. He is still
looking for his first postseason victory and, with an 0-4 record in
nine playoff starts, has more postseason starts with a win than any
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez became just the seventh rookie starter to win an ALCS
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're two different people,'' Hernandez said of Gooden's past
playoff failures. ``Today, luck shined on me and I had a chance to
win a playoff game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was arguably the biggest game of his career _ and the biggest
this season for the Yankees, rejuvenated now after dropping two
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Torre said he knew Hernandez might have a good game after
watching the pitcher serve a few of his teammates during brunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very animated, running out and getting different dishes
for people,'' Torre said. ``I felt good that if we scored some runs
we had a chance, and he proved me right. He was a little reluctant
to give me the ball when I went out there in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything he's been through, a playoff game is a playoff
game. Just like a walk in the park.''
</P>
<P>
   New York took a 1-0 in the first inning on O'Neill's 373-foot
homer to right field. Thome just missed his third homer in two days
when his shot to right was caught by O'Neill at the wall to end the
first inning with runners at first and second base.

Texas unloads arsenal, whips OU
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JEROME SOLOMON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
DALLAS _ Oklahoma coaches swore all week that Ricky Williams would
not beat the Sooners.
</P>
<P>
   They were right.
</P>
<P>
   Now, all of the swearing just north of the Red River is in
reaction to how Major Applewhite, Wane McGarity and the Texas
defense beat the Sooners 34-3 at the Cotton Bowl on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   And there is likely to be plenty of swearing in the direction of
Oklahoma head coach John Blake. His team committed 14 penalties for
109 yards as the Sooners suffered their worst loss to Texas since a
41-9 decision in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite threw for 293 yards, and McGarity caught six passes
for 153 yards, including 97 on the longest pass play in UT history.
The Longhorns' defense, meanwhile, enjoyed its best performance in
three years. The much-maligned unit held the Sooners to 197 yards,
its fewest surrendered since SMU totaled 188 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners tried three quarterbacks, but none was effective
against the swarming Longhorns. OU running back De'Mond Parker, who
ripped the Longhorns for 291 yards and three touchdowns last year,
was held to 93 yards on 19 carries.
</P>
<P>
   And in an oh-by-the-way performance (for him, anyway), Williams
rushed for 139 yards and two touchdowns against the Sooners, who at
times had as many as 10 defenders within a yard of the line of
scrimmage trying to stop the nation's leading ball carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw them walk eight (defensive players) up in the box,
I just kind of thought to myself, `Surprise, surprise,'''
Applewhite said. ``Every defensive coordinator will say, `We're
going to put eight in the box.' It's not a surprise. You have to.
If you're going to put seven in there, then you're gonna have
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Applewhite continues to cause trouble for defenses that gear
their entire game plan to stopping Williams. The redshirt freshman,
who started his first game against Kansas State in place of the
injured Richard Walton, has thrown for more than 200 yards in each
of his four starts.
</P>
<P>
   In leading the Longhorns (4-2, 2-1 Big 12) to three consecutive
wins, Applewhite has directed the offense to scores in more than
half of its drives (22 of 43).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a balanced offense,'' McGarity said. ``We do a great
job of doing everything out there. Ricky's gonna get the ball _ we
know that's our game plan coming in. When we call passes, it's our
chance to shine. A lot of teams are going to stack the line like OU
did today, and the big plays are going to happen for us.''
</P>
<P>
   McGarity has four games of 100-plus receiving yards this season,
and the Longhorns have had a receiver with 100 or more yards in a
school-record six consecutive games. Kwame Cavil was just shy of
that number against the Sooners, catching three balls for 93 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think of this as a good game. I only completed 50
percent of my passes (14 of 27),'' Applewhite said. ``But we made
the plays when we had to. That's what we have to do to be
successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma got on the board first with Jeff Ferguson's 47-yard
field goal four minutes into the game. But Texas held a 17-3 lead
at the half thanks to a 20-yard Williams scoring run and
Applewhite's 56-yard touchdown pass to Cavil in the first quarter
and Kris Stockton's 48-yard field goal just before the half.
</P>
<P>
   A quick turn of events early in the third quarter turned the
game into a rout.
</P>
<P>
   Needing a spark after a lackluster first half, the Sooners
seemed to get it with Michael Thornton's 79-yard return of the
second-half kickoff to the Texas 15.
</P>
<P>
   Four plays later, the Sooners were inches away from pulling
within a touchdown when disaster struck. The snap from center
squirted through the hands of quarterback Brandon Daniels, and
Casey Hampton recovered at the two for Texas.
</P>
<P>
   After Williams gained a yard, Applewhite and McGarity broke the
game open. McGarity got behind OU cornerback Corey Ivy on a deep
post pattern, and Applewhite, after a straight drop into the end
zone, hit him in stride near midfield.
</P>
<P>
   Ivy had no chance in a foot race with the speedy McGarity, and
seconds later, the orange-clad UT faithful at the north end of the
stadium _ part of a total crowd of 75,587 _ were rocking when
McGarity scored.
</P>
<P>
   The 97-yard pass play eclipsed the Texas record of 96 yards from
Todd Dodge to Donovan Pitts against Rice in 1985. More importantly,
it put the game out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a nice kickoff that gave us a little momentum, but then
we fumble the ball on the one-yard line. You just cannot do that,''
Blake said. ``I thought that was a key play in the ballgame,
because we had the opportunity to get right back in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas coach Mack Brown agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense made a big stop and jarred the ball loose,'' Brown
said, ``and then (offensive coordinator) Greg Davis made a great
call. That really put some separation between the two teams.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' call allowed Applewhite to read the OU safeties and
decide whether to run with Williams or go deep to McGarity.
Applewhite made the wise choice.
</P>
<P>
   ``They literally played nine men in the box the whole game, and
our receivers took advantage of that,'' Williams said. ``We got up
to the line (before the 97-yard touchdown), and we had a toss play
called, and Major saw that even in (that) situation the safety was
up six yards from the line of scrimmage. So he checked to a pass
play, and it was wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's been a gradual thing over the past three games.
The defense has been getting better, and the offense has been
getting better, and it all kind of came together this game.''

IT'S GOOD, SOUND, FUNDAMENTAL NL BASEBALL

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ Admit it, the National League set you up
beautifully. It has been Trevor Hoffman-esque, really.
</P>
<P>
   All season long the N.L. mesmerized you with long balls, 136 of
them by Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa alone. It came at you with the
hard heat, knowing you wouldn't be able to resist it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, after you've dug in, your interest piqued, the NL is
challenging you with off-speed pitches that are the game's bread
and butter.
</P>
<P>
   The NL Championship Series between the Atlanta Braves and the
San Diego Padres has been about solid strategies, sound
fundamentals and stellar pitching and if that's throwing home-run
fixated fans for a curve, well, they simply need to do what the
Atlanta hitters seemingly cannot: adjust.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres' pitching staff has left the Braves befuddled,
battered and on the brink of elimination. Saturday, it was Sterling
Hitchcock who started the Braves off on the wrong foot, holding his
own against Atlanta ace Greg Maddux for five-plus innings and
outhitting, among others, the Braves' Ryan Klesko.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock handed the bullpen a 2-1 lead, having started the
Padres' two-run rally in the fifth by singling off Maddux. Donne
Wall, Dan Miceli, Randy Myers and Hoffman, the latter of whom
struck out three of the five batters he faced, stretched it into a
4-1 win that gave the Padres a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven
series. Joey Hamilton will oppose Denny Neagle tonight as San Diego
tries to clinch its first World Series appearance since 1984.
</P>
<P>
   A possible sweep sounds so ... lopsided. Ludicrously so, in this
case. The Padres have outscored the Braves 10-3 in the three games
but none of the wins have come easily. Game 1 was an extra-innings
affair, Game 2 was scoreless through five and Game 3 looked like an
Atlanta blowout-in-the-making on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves sent a hitter to the plate with the bases loaded five
times, including twice in the sixth when the Padres were protecting
a one-run lead.
</P>
<P>
   The suspense was enough to make Padres rightfielder Tony Gwynn's
heart leap into his throat, but on the mound, the only things
fluttering were Wall's off-speed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   He set up pinch-hitter Michael Tucker with four straight
fastballs, then struck him out with a changeup that made the
swinging Tucker look silly. He did the same thing with the next
batter, Greg Colbrunn, whetting his appetite with a diet of
fastballs then fooling him badly on a 2-2 curve.
</P>
<P>
   When Colbrunn failed to make contact, the Qualcomm Stadium crowd
of 62,779 raised a roar the likes of which Gwynn had never heard in
his 38 years, the last 17 of which have been spent as a Padre. If
the crowd gets any louder today, the sound waves will be lapping
Eureka.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never heard it louder,'' said Gwynn, who never has been
prouder of the Padres' pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Relief pitching may have pulled the Padres out of an 0-2 deficit
in their NLCS against Chicago and into the lair of the Tigers in
1984 but it's nothing compared to the contribution being made by
this year's brothers in arms. Take starters Kevin Brown and
Hitchcock. They have held the Braves to six hits in the past two
games and collected three hits themselves, which is as much offense
as Klesko, Andres Galarraga and Chipper Jones combined have
mustered in the series.
</P>
<P>
   Hitchcock's hit off Maddux _ he jumped on the first pitch, a
changeup, and slapped it into the leftfield gap _ was huge, coming
as it did with the Padres trailing 1-0 and the crowd as quiet as it
was all afternoon. Hitchcock advanced to second on Quilvio Veras'
ground-out and was doubled home by Steve Finley who himself crossed
the plate on Ken Caminiti's two-out single.
</P>
<P>
   ``Textbook strategy,'' is what Gwynn, the consummate student of
hitting, called Hitchcock's final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``He stayed back on a change and blocked it out,'' Gwynn said.
``Hitch goes up there and does what I've been trying to do for two
weeks and he does it perfectly. That's the way it's gone for us in
the postseason. Everyone is contributing, someone different every
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's someone you'd never suspect. Acquired from
Colorado in August, John Vander Wall was pressed into service at
left field Saturday because of a strained quadricep that kept
slugger Greg Vaughn out of the lineup a second straight game.
</P>
<P>
   All Vander Wall did was make the defensive play of the game. In
the third inning, after the Braves had taken a 1-0 lead on a single
by Walt Weiss that scored Tony Graffanino, Vander Wall scooped up a
Chipper Jones single to deep left and threw a strike to gun down
Weiss at the plate and end the inning.
</P>
<P>
   You see an outfielder throw out his first runner at home in six
years in a game of this magnitude. You watch a Braves regular,
Galarraga, commit his third error of the series and collect his
first hit in a game of this magnitude. And you wonder if the
series, however inconceivable it seems on the surface, isn't
unfolding precisely as it should.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The slow starts of several Diamondbacks playing for the
Scottsdale Scorpions are of little concern to the team's brass. So
far, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Take second baseman  &UR; Junior Spivey, who was hitless in his first
13 at-bats. Don't worry about it, said  &UR; Tommy Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's working on some things right now,'' said Jones,
Diamondbacks director of minor league operations. ``This is his
instructional league. I don't think he's at the point where he's
getting disheartened. He's going to use this league to work on a
couple of things and not worry about his numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Spivey broke out of it Friday with two hits, including a home
run.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, Spivey is working with Manager  &UR; Chris Speier and
hitting coach  &UR; Dan Gladden on his stance and use of his hands. He
hit .281 in 79 games with Class-A High Desert before being loaned
to Double-A Tulsa, where he hit .311 in 34 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``And now he's in a different environment,'' Jones said. ``But
he's a great athlete, and great athletes find a way to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop  &UR; Danny Klassen, who spent time with the Diamondbacks
before returning to Tucson and suffering a fractured shoulder, just
got his average past .200.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny's issue is that he had six or seven weeks of downtime
without facing live pitching,'' Jones said. ``It's been very
difficult to jump into what's almost a spring training type
situation. But at least in spring training, the pitchers are out
there for the first time. But here, pitchers have been pitching all
year.''
</P>
<P>
   After struggling early, outfielder  &UR; Jason Conti got hot. But
Jones isn't looking at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conti's always going to hit,'' he said. ``His biggest thing is
playing center field for the first time. . . . He's made all the
plays. We believe he can play center field.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers  &UR; Vladimir Nunez, Stephen Randolph and  &UR; Russell Jacob
also won't be judged quickly. Nun ez, who finished the year with
the Diamondbacks, has been hit hard. But he's being used as a
closer for the first time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good experiment for him,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob missed a few days because of a sore shoulder, but it is
nothing serious. And Randolph has been getting better.
</P>
<P>
   The thing to remember, said Jones, is that it's early.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our assessment of where these guys truly are will be better
served as we roll around to the middle of November,'' he said. ``By
the same token, this is a good test of where all our players are in
their development. But the time to evaluate is at the end.'' &QL; 
Triple play &QL; 
It went 4-6-3-2-5-1 if you happened to be scoring, which is
doubtful unless you were among the 100 or so fans attending the
Maryvale-Phoenix game in which a triple play occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth with runners on first and second,
Phoenix's
 &UR; Torii Hunter grounded to Maryvale second baseman
 &UR; Warren Morris, who flipped to shortstop  &UR; Damian Jackson, who
relayed to first baseman  &UR; Toby Zuleta for what was then a mere
double play.
</P>
<P>
   But  &UR; Jed Hansen, the runner on second, decided to try to make it
home. Bad decision. Zuleta threw to catcher  &UR; Jason LaRue, getting
Hansen in a rundown. LaRue to third baseman  &UR; Chris Truby to pitcher
 &UR; Danny Young nailed Hansen and completed the triple play.
</P>
<P>
   Morris, by the way, is the player whose two-out, two-run homer
in the ninth inning won the College World Series for Louisiana
State in 1996. He's a Pittsburgh prospect. &QL; 
Short hops &QL; 
Going head-to-head with major league postseason play, Fall League
average attendance was reported at 333 a game during the first
week. Grand Canyon and Scottsdale, both based at Scottsdale
Stadium, were drawing 561 and 520 a game, respectively. Maryvale
was last at 105.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Cubs outfield prospect  &UR; Roosevelt Brown hit four home
runs in his first six games, after hitting 15 homers in 111 games
for Class-A Daytona, Double-A West Tenn and Triple-A Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Among current members of the Diamondbacks,  &UR; David
 &UR; Dellucci, Ben Ford, Neil Weber, Aaron Small, Alan Embree, Joel
 &UR; Adamson, Clint Sodowsky, Andy Fox, Travis Lee and  &UR; Hanley Frias
played in the Fall League.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chicago Cubs first baseman  &UR; Leon Durham, whose fielding
gaffe in the 1984 playoffs is used as a reference point every time
a Cub messes up in a key situation, is a coach with Peoria. Durham,
a coach with Triple-A Vancouver the past two years, was a two-time
All-Star and a pretty good hitter, batting .277 over 10 major
league seasons. &QL;

   Aggies reverse trend, &QL; 
stun No. 2 Nebraska
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
COLLEGE STATION _ History, having teased and tormented Texas A&AMP;M
long enough, locked arms and legs and swayed and rocked with the
Aggies, sharing, even enhancing, their joy.
</P>
<P>
   All the near misses. All the reminders of the last step they had
not taken, the doubts and detractors were made worth the pain. And
the wait made the reward that much sweeter.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M shocked No. 2 Nebraska 28-21 Saturday, and most of the
60,798 squeezed into under-reconstruction Kyle Field celebrated one
of the two greatest wins in school history as only Aggies _
screaming, singing, kissing and finally crying _ can.
</P>
<P>
   The second-ranked, defending national co-champion Cornhuskers
became the highest-ranked team A&AMP;M has beaten since the Associated
Press poll began in 1936.
</P>
<P>
   If that did not make the win A&AMP;M's greatest, that was only
because of the 1939 team's Sugar Bowl win over No. 4 Tulane that
gave it a national title. The winners of that game received their
championship rings Saturday and then saw a victory likely to be as
cherished as theirs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one is for all of us,'' Texas A&AMP;M senior safety Rich
Coady said. ``For everybody that ever stepped on this field, for
everybody that ever practiced, for everyone that wore this jersey,
this is unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Having been reminded repeatedly of their nine-game losing streak
against Top 10 teams this decade, the Aggies declared another step
taken toward joining the elite they had been told excluded them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means the world,'' senior offensive tackle Cameron Spikes
said. ``It means everything.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M broke both the nation's longest winning streak at 19 games
and the Cornhuskers' 40-game success string in regular-season
conference games. And the Aggies won without tricks or flukes,
leading most of the way before stopping Nebraska's last chance with
51 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no consolation in a loss like this,'' Nebraska
receiver Matt Davison said. ``But we're Nebraska, so we never
thought we were out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska had cut A&AMP;M's 28-7 lead to a single touchdown with a
pair of drives that had taken just 2:40 of the fourth quarter. The
Cornhuskers had two minutes left to cover the last 80 yards to
overtime and had moved to their own 40.
</P>
<P>
   But A&AMP;M's Sedrick Curry, in only because Jason Webster had left
his finest game with a sprained ankle, intercepted a Bobby Newcombe
pass at the Aggies' 43-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Curry took a few strides upfield, then fell on top of the ball,
hugging it tightly while the reality set in around him.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first thought was to take it to the house,'' Curry said,
``but I said it was time to get down.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the greatest play of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   If Curry's play was the clincher, it was one of many spectacular
and, in the end, decisive, moments.
</P>
<P>
   After suffering through an early knockout to Nebraska in last
season's 54-15 Big 12 Championship Game rout _ remember the
Alamodome? _ A&AMP;M was determined to start quickly and with 7:05 left
in the first quarter hit on its longest pass play since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Cole ran the post pattern that repeatedly burned North
Texas two weeks ago, and when the Cornhuskers shifted toward him,
A&AMP;M quarterback Randy McCown moved in the pocket long enough for
Chris Taylor to cross the field.
</P>
<P>
   McCown's pass was just out of Nebraska cornerback Ralph Brown's
reach, and Taylor outran the rest of the secondary for an 81-yard
score.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers tied it, but A&AMP;M outran the Nebraska defense
again, this time with 260-pound freshman fullback Ja'Mar Toombs
taking a third-down run 71 yards to the Nebraska one. In a
remarkable reminder of the Cornhuskers' previous loss (to Texas in
the 1996 Big 12 title game), Toombs navigated the final 20 yards by
watching the JumboTron screen, just as Texas' Derek Lewis saw
himself on a big screen and wrapped up the ball to clinch a UT
upset two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I was trying to do,'' Toombs said, ``was get three yards
and a first down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dante Hall covered the final yard for a 14-7 halftime lead. And
though A&AMP;M had led UCLA and Florida State at the half in the
previous ``test'' games, this one quickly proved different.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies came up with three consecutive sacks of Newcombe, the
last by Ron Edwards knocking the ball loose and into the end zone.
A&AMP;M linebacker Warrick Holdman recovered for a 21-7 A&AMP;M lead, and
the Aggies' confidence and control continued to escalate with every
play.
</P>
<P>
   After Webster stuffed a fourth-down reverse pitch at the A&AMP;M 14,
the Aggies not only began to pull away but moved to put the game in
the bag very much as Nebraska has so routinely over the past five
years. A&AMP;M rolled methodically through the rest of the third
quarter, with McCown running the option for a first down before
scrambling on third-and-seven for 33 yards to the Nebraska seven.
</P>
<P>
   Three plays later, on the first play of the fourth quarter,
Toombs crashed into the end zone, and A&AMP;M held a 28-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, Nebraska rallied. But that only seemed to add to
the joy when Curry finally clinched the win.
</P>
<P>
   And in a fitting answer to the critics of A&AMP;M's Top 10 losses,
the Aggies insisted they won not in spite of their previous
big-game defeats, but because of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all about confidence,'' Hall said. ``It started with
UCLA (in last season's Cotton Bowl), then Florida State. We kept
getting closer and closer and closer and, finally, we got over the
hump. We worked and we worked until we finally got it done.''
</P>
<P>
   And A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum got the win that had eluded him and
that his detractors insisted would remain beyond his grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question about it; this is the biggest win of my career,''
Slocum said.
</P>
<P>
   And though he mentioned other wins to compare, none really did.
</P>
<P>
   ``So much has been said,'' Slocum said. ``You have to take it as
a coach. This takes some of the arguments away. I am totally
confident this program will get to its rightful place and where we
want it to be.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was carried off on his players' shoulders, Slocum and his
team moved a huge win closer.

   Prairie View falls short against Alcorn St. 45-36
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BRIAN McTAGGART &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
PRAIRIE VIEW _ There finally is a good reason to stick around past
halftime at Prairie View A&AMP;M football games, and it has nothing to
do with the band.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers, playing their first home game at Blackshear
Stadium since snapping the nation's longest losing streak at 80
games two weeks ago, scratched and clawed Saturady before
eventually dropping a 45-36 decision to Alcorn State.
</P>
<P>
   Prairie View fans have been known to hit the exits after the
``Marching Storm'' band performs at the half, but the new and
improved Panthers football team kept most of the 8,356 sun-drenched
fans in their seats for the better part of three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the football team was the only show on this day.
</P>
<P>
   The band, which got the school embroiled in a controversy with
the Southwestern Athletic Conference after a fight with Southern
University's band, didn't perform after not getting clearance from
the SWAC.
</P>
<P>
   The entire controversy nearly ended Prairie View's football
season when the SWAC indefinitely suspended the Panthers from
league competition because the band missed one game of the two-game
suspension. The SWAC backed off for the time being, and Saturday's
homecoming game went off as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It affected us somewhat, I'm not going to lie,'' Panthers
coach Greg Johnson said of the controversy. ``The strength of a
person is how well he perseveres, and we've got to push through the
little things and take care of the big things on the weekend, which
is the football game. That's what we didn't do.''
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers didn't take care of the football, either, turning
it over seven times, including five fumbles. Three of the seven
turnovers came inside Alcorn State's 10-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just made a lot of mistakes, I don't know how and I don't
know why,'' Johnson said. ``There's some things we've got to get
corrected to get ready for next week.''
</P>
<P>
   Prairie View (1-5, 0-4 SWAC) went up 7-0 midway through the
first quarter on DeMelvi Kelley's four-yard run. The Panthers
forced a punt and drove to the Alcorn State one before disaster
struck. Quarterback Josh Barnes had the ball poked out of his
outstretched hands on fourth down, and Damon Felder picked it up
off the grass and ran 97 yards to tie the score at 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some turnovers in the red zone at key points that I
feel turned the game around,'' Panthers defensive back Quincy
Fuller said. ``Without those turnovers, it is a different ballgame
and we end up on the victorious side.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 17-7 in the second quarter, Prairie View drove inside
Alcorn State's 10 again before Barnes was intercepted by LeeTerry
Moore in the back of the end zone. The Braves (3-3, 1-3) then
sucked the life out of the Panthers with a 17-play, 80-drive that
Cedric Horton capped with a one-yard touchdown run for a 24-7
halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach got on us at halftime, and we came out the second half
fired up and ready to play,'' said Prairie View quarterback Jamal
Foster, who played the second half. ``But we really shot ourselves
in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   A blocked punt set up Prairie View's next score _ a one-yard run
by Kelley early in the third quarter that cut the lead to 24-15 _
and the Panthers forced Alcorn State to punt.
</P>
<P>
   But just as momentum began to swing, Prairie View's DeMarcus
Peterson muffed the punt return to give the Braves the ball at the
10. Rodney Thomas scored from there on the next play, and Braves
had a 31-15 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn State built a 45-15 lead heading into the fourth quarter
before the Panthers scored 21 unanswered points. But it was too
little, too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had three opportunities to score offensively and we just
fumbled or did something wrong on the goal line,'' Johnson said.
``Today just wasn't our day.''

VOLUNTEER EFFORT MORE THAN GOOD ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ For years, Tennessee's main problem was one of
perception as much as reality. Oh, the Volunteers were good enough
to win the nine and sometimes 10 games necessary to make them a
perennial Top 10 team.
</P>
<P>
   But beat Florida? Forget about it. Win a bowl game against a
quality team like Nebraska? Sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Even when the Volunteers changed their normal yearly script by
ending a five-year losing streak against Florida with a stirring
20-17 overtime victory Sept. 19, some skeptics remained, arguing it
was as much what the Gators didn't do as what Tennessee did that
contributed to the victory, which caused a wild celebration in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Beat Georgia, which was coming off a stirring 28-27 road win
over LSU? Beat Georgia without leading rusher Jamal Lewis, who
earlier this week was diagnosed with a knee injury that will
sideline him for the season? Beat Georgia at Sanford Stadium, with
a revved up crowd looking for revenge if not redemption for last
year's 38-13 spanking in Knoxville? That wasn't going to happen,
and Tennessee found itself a 1-point underdog despite having a
higher national ranking (fourth) than the Bulldogs (seventh).
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, was just enough of a motivating factor and the
reason the Vols came here Saturday and whipped the Dawgs from hedge
to hedge in rolling to a 22-3 victory that was far more one-sided
then the final score indicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``This,'' said Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer, who is now 7-0 in
games against Georgia, ``was a program win. We're not supposed to
be this good.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the Vols, who are sure to rise in the polls after
Nebraska's loss to Texas A&AMP;M Saturday, are that good.
</P>
<P>
   For sure, they are different from past Volunteer teams, with
more of a blue-collar, lunch-bucket look to them, a makeover from
the glitz and glamour of the teams that former Vols quarterback
Peyton Manning guided the past four years.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's win was defense-oriented. Georgia, guided by
wunderkind freshman QB Quincy Carter, never did get untracked,
being limited to a total of 254 yards and only 59 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia, which dropped to 4-1, was held to a 48-yard field goal
by Hap Hines in the first quarter, which briefly gave the Dawgs a
3-3 tie.
</P>
<P>
   But Carter, the star of last week's win over LSU, was forced to
move and think on the run from the opening series of the game. ``I
knew they were going to be coming,'' said Carter, who was a
miserable 14 for 37 for 195 yards, with two interceptions. ``But we
didn't handle it. We couldn't figure out what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, Tennessee knew exactly what it was doing all
afternoon. There was quarterback Tee Martin, who picked up 45 yards
rushing and threw for a pair of third-quarter touchdowns that
turned a 9-3 Tennessee lead at halftime into a 22-3 romp. There
were the Travises, Henry and Stephens, who filled the role of Lewis
by combining for 160 yards rushing. And there was the defense, led
by linebacker Al Wilson, who shrugged off a shoulder injury
suffered in last week's win over Auburn and was in Carter's face
all afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people don't realize, we're a very aggressive
defensive team,'' Wilson said. ``We chased Carter all day and we
hit him just to let him know we were there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter knew, and so did the national television audience and
sellout crowd of 86,117, which had come to Sanford Stadium to see a
game between Top 10 teams for the first time since 1983.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia coach Jim Donnan offerd the best explanation for what
took place. ``In the second half, Tennessee assaulted us,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   With almost half the season gone, Tennessee has done that now to
some quality teams, ranging from Florida at home to Syracuse and
Georgia on the road.
</P>
<P>
   What once seemed a long shot _ Tennessee filling one of the
slots in the national championship game in the Fiesta Bowl Jan. 4 _
now does not seem so far-fetched.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols know the potential for disaster still lurks _ this is a
team that lost a regular-season game to Memphis two years ago. They
know even if they go through the remainder of the regular season
unbeaten, they still have to come to Atlanta Dec. 5 and win the SEC
title game.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a different Tennessee team. Tougher. More
in-your-face. ``We're not the prettiest team,'' Wilson said. ``But
if we stay focused and play hard we'll win the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Any game.

   Army's ground attack too much for UH
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Fancy as a howitzer and just as single-minded, Army's wishbone
offense proved to be everything the Houston Cougars feared.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadets, who scored barely 1{ minutes into Saturday's game at
Robertson Stadium, kept the Cougars off balance on defense much of
the day and then stemmed UH's late rush.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 38-28 Conference USA victory for Army, its
inaugural conference road win and the first time in eight games
dating to 1996 the Cadets have won on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Down 31-7 in the third quarter, Houston (1-5, 1-1 C-USA) made it
a 10-point game in the final minute _ a margin that might have been
smaller if Jerrian James had been able to hold onto a
fourth-quarter pass in the end zone. While James (11 catches, 121
yards, two TDs) and others pulled their weight, the Cougars'
defense, as expected, struggled to solve an offense it had precious
little time to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Joe Gerena replaced starting quarterback Johnny Goff
(reinjured ankle) early in the second quarter, and the Cadets,
cheered on by about 4,000 soldiers from various bases, scarcely
skipped a beat. Ranked fourth nationally in rushing, Army gained
324 yards on 54 carries with an array of eight backs against a
Houston run defense that had been ranked 12th in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was as big a nightmare as I thought it would
be,'' UH coach Kim Helton said. ``We thought it would take a
quarter to catch up to the speed of their offense because we
couldn't simulate it in practice. Unfortunately, it took a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unhappy with the way the defense played, but I'm
understanding. We took our good defense and made it look bad. We
were timid and afraid to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Cougars trailed 28-7, due partially to a
lightning-quick start by Army. After Rod Richardson's 47-yard
return of the opening kickoff, Grady Jett sprinted 45 yards on an
end-around to the UH one, from where fullback Ty Amey scored the
first of his three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and busted it right up the middle,'' said Amey,
whose 79 yards on 15 carries included a 40-yard burst.
</P>
<P>
   Army (2-3, 2-1), which scored on five of its first seven
possessions, led 14-0 after its second possession, a series of 10
running plays. The Cadets didn't throw a pass until their 18th play
and probably could have gone the whole game without attempting one.
They finished the day with one completion in three attempts as the
caissons keep rolling along.
</P>
<P>
   Army coach Bob Sutton said a quick start was imperative after
his team fell behind early while losing to East Carolina and
Rutgers in its previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we decided to take the kick to start and see if we
could get something going early,'' Sutton said. ``I felt our
running backs did a good job going at their D (defense).''
</P>
<P>
   UH quarterback Jason McKinley, sacked four times by an Army
defense that had only four sacks in the first four games, had four
touchdown passes, including two each to James and Orlando Iglesias,
while compiling a career-high 29 completions out of 50 attempts for
302 yards. But McKinley also drew an intentional-grounding penalty
and twice fumbled the center snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen all their blitzes on film,'' McKinley said. ``We
just shot ourselves in the foot in the first half. I felt we moved
the ball well in the second half, but we ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   James' 13-yard catch in the corner of the end zone narrowed the
Cadets' lead to 14-7 in the first quarter, but halfback Bobby
Williams (11 carries, 62 yards) broke a 36-yard scoring run on
Army's next series. Amey's eight-yard run just before halftime
ended a 46-yard scoring drive that was helped along by a UH
personal-foul penalty, giving the Cadets a 28-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Army ran more than six minutes off the clock on its first
possession of the second half before Eric Olsen kicked a 37-yard
field goal to make it 31-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, who held an 87-57 margin in plays, didn't get on
the board again until the fourth quarter, when they scored 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   UH made it 31-14 with 11:55 remaining when Iglesias hauled in
McKinley's fourth-down pass for a 17-yard TD after T.J. Light, a
first-time starter at linebacker, made the first of his two fumble
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But Amey's 40-yard burst and Gerena's 15-yard TD run enabled the
Cadets to reel off 80 yards in four plays and 84 seconds, making it
38-14.
</P>
<P>
   Light's fumble recovery set up McKinley's 10-yard TD pass to
James with 6:08 remaining. Trailing 38-21, the Cougars recovered
the ensuing onside kick but failed to convert.
</P>
<P>
   UH wrapped up the scoring with 51 seconds remaining on Iglesias'
38-yard catch-and-run from McKinley.

   Tennessee's defense leaves Georgia clueless
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By BILL SULLIVAN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Ga. _ They came from the sides and from up the middle, and
there were times when it seemed there were more than the standard
complement of 11 bursting into the backfield and ruining plays with
each and every snap.
</P>
<P>
   Quincy Carter knew it was coming. Doing anything about it was a
very different matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't handle it,'' Georgia's freshman quarterback said.
``We couldn't figure out what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Simple, really. When Tennessee 22, Georgia 3 was safely in the
books, Al Wilson probably didn't mean to be quite so blunt, but
there was plenty of truth in the Volunteer linebacker's bottom-line
assessment of Carter's long Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know about frustrating anybody,'' Wilson said. ``But I
knew if we kept it up and never quit hitting him, he'd fold.''
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, Carter had plenty of company in that regard as the
Bulldogs' hoped-for coming-out party fizzled.
</P>
<P>
   With running back Jamal Lewis lost to knee surgery and Wilson
playing with a bad shoulder, No. 4 Tennessee still strolled into
Sanford Stadium and steamrolled No. 7 Georgia in a game that may
not have been even as close as the one-sided score.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia got just 195 passing yards (59 of those on one play) on
37 attempts from Carter, the hero of the previous week's 28-27
victory at LSU. The minor-league baseball veteran was intercepted
twice, sacked twice and chased all over the turf by a blitzing
Volunteers defense that refused to rest.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's chief ally, the ubiquitous Champ Bailey, was largely
missing in action, too. Bailey had the perfect stage to launch a
serious Heisman Trophy bid, but after a first-quarter interception,
things went downhill in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   As a receiver, Bailey had just three catches for 21 yards. Two
punt returns netted 35 yards, but without effect. In the secondary,
he was beaten by Cedrick Wilson on Tennessee's first touchdown. And
later in the decisive third period, Bailey's audition as passer was
a fourth-down heave that was easily intercepted by safety Deon
Grant.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just outplayed us in every way,'' Bailey said.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Stephens (20 carries, 107 yards) and Travis Henry (16
carries, 53 yards) did just fine as replacements for Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without Jamal,'' Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin said, ``we
took it as motivation to do well.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Tennessee would find a way on a picture-perfect
autumn afternoon, making Georgia's stay in the national
championship picture short and not particularly sweet. Supposedly
eager for revenge after the Volunteers allegedly ran up the score
last year in Knoxville, the Bulldogs instead looked like what most
observers pegged them as at the start of the year: young and
talented, but maybe a year or so away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we may have gotten caught up in the hype a little too
much,'' Carter admitted.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but it's just as likely that Georgia got caught up in
an inspired effort on the part of a Tennessee team largely
dismissed as a national contender in the wake of Lewis'
season-ending knee surgery. Martin, asked to replace Peyton
Manning, struggled through a pair of first-half interceptions, but
the Vols used three Jeff Hall field goals (27, 39 and 43 yards) to
more than offset a 48-yarder by Georgia's Hap Hines for 9-3 lead at
halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Once Martin (seven of nine passing for 64 yards and two
touchdowns in the second half) regained his composure, Tennessee
put this one away with remarkable ease and efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The Vols moved 65 yards to the game's first touchdown, a
three-yard pass from Martin to Cedrick Wilson, who beat Bailey on
an out pattern in the right side of the end zone with 12:31 left in
the third quarter. The two-point conversion try failed when Martin
was stopped just short of the goal line, but the points wouldn't be
missed.
</P>
<P>
   After Carter's deep throw for Thad Parker was intercepted by
Dwayne Goodrich and returned to the Tennessee 41, the Volunteers
were off again. A 20-yard pass from Martin to Jermaine Copeland on
third-and-four was the centerpiece of a drive that ended on a
three-yard pass from Martin to Peerless Price to make it 22-3 with
6:06 left in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the only ones among a crowd of 86,117 who seemed to be
enjoying this surprising turn of events were the orange-and-white
clad visitors who filled the west end zone and part of the east
upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   One sideline was pretty happy, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unbelievably proud of our football team,'' said Tennessee
coach Phil Fulmer, whose feud with Georgia counterpart Jim Donnan
over a late Manning touchdown in last year's game helped spice up
the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not supposed to be this good.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidently, they are, though. And with a week off to ponder it
all and prepare for a home game against Alabama, the Vols left town
5-0 and feeling pretty pleased with themselves _ though not too
pleased, Wilson hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing about this defense,'' Al Wilson said, ``is that
we're never satisfied. That's what you're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   On a surprising day in Georgia, the Vols got what they were
looking for and then some.

SHODDY UMPIRING SHOULDN'T HAPPEN THIS TIME OF YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Once again the playoffs, a time when baseball's brightest
spotlight should be firmly on the playing field, are being
overshadowed by shoddy umpiring.
</P>
<P>
   As he's done more and more lately, New York Yankees owner
 &UR; George
 &UR; Steinbrenner is making a lot of sense these days when he says the
entire major league umpiring system should be revamped. Many
umpires do a wonderful job, but the ones who do not stand out so
blatantly that they end up bringing the entire group down with
them.
</P>
<P>
   Never was it more evident than in the past two weeks when
American League umpires  &UR; Joe Brinkman and  &UR; Ted Hendry either lost
control of a game or badly blew a call. Again, the call is being
made that the very best umpires are the only ones who should be
working in October.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we have a mixture of those who have earned the right to
be there on merit and those who have the most time umpiring in the
majors. The result has been a sad mess that is diminishing the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   The best four clubs in the majors are still alive. Why shouldn't
the best umpires be there to officiate the games?
</P>
<P>
   Outgoing Baltimore General Manager  &UR; Pat Gillick, as respected a
person as there is in the game, voiced his displeasure with the
current system last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's back to the same old story _ you've got to have a real
stringent review process,'' Gillick said. ``They've got to be
reviewed constantly. If there are problems with umpires, if they
continue to make mistakes, the lower-rated guys have got to be
gone.''
</P>
<P>
   The hope, at least in big-league front offices, is that the new
executive vice president of the game, former Oakland GM/President
 &UR; Sandy Alderson, will make this issue his top priority. Alderson is
very aware of the problem and may very well be the right person to
straighten this mess out. &QL; 
Down and out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When a club with a $74 million payroll finishes under .500 and
never really contends, you know it was just a matter of time before
some serious finger-pointing takes place.
</P>
<P>
   Count Baltimore hitting coach  &UR; Rick Down as the Orioles'
scapegoat for the poor 1998 season. Manager  &UR; Ray Miller managed to
get Down out of the Orioles coaching staff and replaced by  &UR; Terry
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just know that Terry is outstanding individually and
personally,'' said Miller, who has known Crowley since the two were
with the Orioles in the mid-1970's. ``He was a great player when he
was in Baltimore, and he had a great rapport with people in
Minnesota from what I understand. He did an outstanding job with
guys like ( &UR; Matt)  &UR; Lawton out there . . . He has a great ability to
make adjustments during a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Down, a finalist for the Orioles manager post when  &UR; Davey
Johnson was fired last winter, had one season remaining on his
contract. The Orioles, who hit a then-major league record 257 home
runs in 1996 under Down, will pay the remainder of the deal off.
</P>
<P>
   The knock on Down, at least the one coming from the Orioles
front office, was that he worked the players too hard, requiring
extra batting practice that owner  &UR; Peter Angelos believed led to
the late-season slump of  &UR; B.J. Surhoff, among others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray called and told me that Mr. Angelos had not been happy
with our offense this year and for the past two years,'' said Down,
the former hitting coach for the Yankees under  &UR; Buck Showalter.
``That's my area. If it wasn't up to par, then I'll shoulder the
responsibility . . . I didn't know if it would be me, but I figured
something had to happen.'' &QL; 
About a quart low? &QL; 
Houston outfielder  &UR; Carl Everett, who infuriated his teammates and
the opposing San Diego Padres during the division series when he
disparaged  &UR; Kevin Brown, did it again once the Astros were
eliminated by the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be embarrassed,'' Everett said. ``We got beat by a
team that was a lot older and a lot slower. Their bones are
breaking. They basically crawled onto the field and beat us. It's a
shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had so much talent. We were the feared team, and no one
wanted to play us. The way we played, we deserved to go home. What
you do in the regular season means nothing in the playoffs. It
comes down to whichever team wants it the most. They wanted it
more, and that's why they're going on and we're packing.''
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the Padres dismissed Everett's remarks as those
of an immature 26-year-old who needs some counseling from some of
his teammates. &QL; 
ALCS subplot &QL; 
Opposing outfielders  &UR; Brian Giles of Cleveland and  &UR; Shane Spencer
of the New York Yankees have an interesting past together. The two
grew up in El Cajon, Calif., and played baseball and football at
Granite Hills High together.
</P>
<P>
   They also overcame long odds to reach their current status.
Giles was selected in the 17th round in 1989 while Spencer was a
28th round pick in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not the best of friends, but we're pretty good
friends,'' Spencer said. `We've been playing together since we were
10 years old. Seeing Brian make it to the major leagues was good
motivation for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Giles was a center fielder and running back in high school.
Spencer was a left fielder and linebacker on the same teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gratifying that we've been able to do this,'' Giles said,
``because nobody gave him or me a chance to do anything in the
major leagues.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   THE HIT LIST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; From the Hart: Cleveland General Manager  &UR; John Hart on his club
being an overwhelming underdog against the Yankees: ``People are
missing the boat if they think we are the Washington Generals and
the Yankees are the Harlem Globetrotters. We are not cannon
fodder.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Talk about the rich getting richer: As difficult as it may be
to comprehend, there is a strong belief among baseball executives
that Atlanta may make a shocking move this winter by trading one of
its big three starters _  &UR; Greg Maddux,  &UR; Tom Glavine or
 &UR; John Smoltz _ and then signing free agent and Georgia native &UR; Kevin
 &UR; Brown.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Flashback: Rupert Jones.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Maybe he chatted with Prince: The pitcher formerly known as
 &UR; Dennis Reyes has requested his name be spelled  &UR; Dennys Reyes. One
member of the Cincinnati public relations staff quipped: ``Yeah,
and if he keeps eating we'll have to put the apostrophe in there
(Denny's).''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Still searching for Davey Johnson's replacement: Baltimore
owner  &UR; Peter Angelos telephoned  &UR; Jim Leyland and offered him $3
million per season for three years if he reneged on his three-year
$6 million deal with Colorado. Leyland, who had already agreed to
the Rockies' offer, declined. &QL; 
EXTRA BASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The home run allowed by  &UR; Kerry Lightenberg to San Diego's
 &UR; Ken Caminiti in the 10th inning of Game 1 of the National League
Championship Series on Wednesday night was the first run allowed by
a Braves reliever in 20 post-season innings, a span that dated to
 &UR; Jim
 &UR; Leyritz's memorable home run in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Texas first baseman  &UR; Will Clark's post-season drought continued.
Clark was 1 for 11 with no RBIs and no hits with three at-bats with
runners in scoring position during the Rangers' three-game loss to
the Yankees in the division series. He has not had a post-season
RBI since 11 playoff games dating to the 1989 World Series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Thomas moved into fourth place on the Chicago White Sox's
all-time list for total bases with 2,570, moving ahead of
 &UR; Eddie Collins. The three ahead are:  &UR; Luke Appling, 3,528;  &UR; Nellie
Fox, 3,118; and  &UR; Harold Baines 2,811.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto GM  &UR; Gord Ash will call in Manager  &UR; Tim Johnson and
pitching coach  &UR; Mel Queen for a three-way meeting to see if the
latter two can iron out their differences. Johnson and Queen did
not speak for most of the final two months of the season. If the
two cannot work out their problem one may be asked to leave.
</P>
<P>
   After Pittsburgh's September collapse (the Pirates were 5-22 in
the final month) owner  &UR; Kevin McClatchy voiced his displeasure with
how the club mailed it in down the stretch. Manager
 &UR; Gene Lamont will be on the hot-seat next season. &QL; 
THE RUMOR MILL &QL;
</P>
<P>
   San Diego insists it will be able to move reliever  &UR; Randy
 &UR; Myers and the hefty $12 million remaining on his contract. Expect
the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are fairly resigned to losing closer
 &UR; Jeff
 &UR; Shaw, to be among the most interested.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Felipe Alou is clearly the Dodgers' primary choice to become
just their fifth manager since leaving Brooklyn in 1957. But
Montreal, realizing it needs credibility if the Expos are to make a
real move to fund a downtown baseball stadium, may match any offer
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Should  &UR; Alou bolt for LA, expect  &UR; Kevin Kennedy's name to
surface as next Expos manager. Kennedy, who managed Texas and
Boston, cut his big-league teeth as Alou's bench coach in the early
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With  &UR; Sean Casey expected to be Cincinnati's first baseman for
the next half dozen years, the Reds are looking to move Valley
native  &UR; Paul Konerko. Could Konerko head right back to Los Angeles,
possibly for  &UR; Shaw? It's a good fit for both clubs.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis is once again wrestling with the idea of bringing back
ageless outfielder  &UR; Willie McGee. The Cardinals favorite will be 40
before next season starts and remains one of the best clubhouse
influences in an otherwise fractured clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   There's a possibility Philadelphia may be willing to trade
closer  &UR; Ricky Bottalico this winter. The hard-throwing right-hander
only saved six games this year but that was mostly because he had a
bone spur removed from an elbow in April. The Phillies need help
and Bottalico is someone who may bring it in return. &QL;

QUAIL SMALL, BUT THEY'RE PLENTIFUL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TONTO BASIN, Ariz. - Travis Williams of Chandler was walking out
of Butcher Hook Cafe just after noon on Friday, the opening day of
Gambel quail season in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   He looked pretty satisfied and stopped for a talk.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists had predicted that this could be the best quail
season since 1993, the year before declining years of precipitation
that led to drought and some of the poorest quail seasons in
memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw more birds today than in the past five years put
together,'' Williams said. ``They were all small birds _ this
year's (hatch of) birds.''
</P>
<P>
   He had a point there. Last year there weren't a lot of quail,
and most of them were adults. They're much harder to hunt than
young, stupid quail. They prefer running far ahead and then
flushing out of gun range. They didn't get to be adults by being
dummies.
</P>
<P>
   But El Nino rains during the winter and spring brought a great
hatch of quail. Biologists say rain at the right times is the
single most important factor in quail reproduction. It provides the
right green plants to spur hens to lay more eggs, brings on the
growth of more cover and seeds to protect and sustain the birds and
causes larger insect hatches that provide needed nourishment.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists said the quail reproduced into August, hence some
really small quail for the opening of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a dog,'' Williams said. ``I had five I couldn't
find in all that cover or I would have limited out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was getting hot, in the 90s, and time to take a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty hot,'' Williams said. ``Time to go back to the
trailer, drink a beer and take a nap. We'll go back out at 5 when
it's cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   He said his hunting group spent the entire morning hunt in El
Oso Wash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just chased them around in circles. I've had enough
sweating for one morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Ron Horejsi, a wildlife manager for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department, said he wasn't seeing a lot of birds but heard a lot of
shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guys without dogs are really having trouble finding their
birds,'' he said. ``There are a lot of birds, but as you heard,
some of them are really small.''
</P>
<P>
   Curt Rambo, who lives in the basin, chipped in that ``it takes a
good shot to get those little birds.''
</P>
<P>
   Horejsi said there a lot of hunters but that they were scattered
all over the basin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saturday will be a big day here,'' he said. ``All the guys who
couldn't get off Friday will show up.''
</P>
<P>
   That made for a big day in the basin on Saturday. Besides all
the hunters, a bass fishing tournament drew another couple hundred
people with boats.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Beauchamp of Payson and his son, Jimmy, of Phoenix were
taking advantage of both worlds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're bass fishing and quail hunting,'' the elder Beauchamp
said. ``Right now, we're doing much better with the bass.'' He said
the two fished Wednesday evening and Thursday morning and took
about 40, mostly on top-water lures.
</P>
<P>
   Son Jimmy had seen a covey of quail walk up a draw toward the
lake. He got on the shoreline and shot three.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're dropping off the boat back in Payson, then we'll come
back and just hunt quail,'' the elder Beauchamp said.
</P>
<P>
   Because the lush cover also brought on good reproduction in
rodents, rattlesnake populations increased. But no one was
complaining.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Denson of Gilbert and Paul Kaminski and Don Striker, both of
Chandler, said in their hunt together they had heard one
rattlesnake but had seen five tarantulas.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw tons of 40-bird coveys,'' Denson said. ``This is the
best it's been in at least seven years.`` They, too, complained of
lost birds in the heavy cover and a majority of small quail. But
they were loving the number of birds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those little birds aren't too smart,'' Striker said. ``You
have to run at them to flush them, but they just run around in
circles. But the later it got the better they held.''
</P>
<P>
   But the heat turned out to be a major factor for Kaminski and
Striker. Although they carried water, they ranged too far from
their vehicle on this hot day, running out of water and struggling
to get back.
</P>
<P>
   Rambo's hunt wasn't as good. His hunting companion was late
showing up, then could only hunt a short time because he became
ill.
</P>
<P>
   But when the two entered a rugged draw at 3:30 p.m., quail
starting flushing everywhere. Coveys rose one after another, and
not all of them were small birds. And the 40-bird coveys were not
an exaggeration.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a good quail year. Compared with the past three or
four, it will be paradise. &QL;

   Army's ground attack too much for UH
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JERRY WIZIG &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
HOUSTON _ Fancy as a howitzer and just as single-minded, Army's
wishbone offense proved to be everything the Houston Cougars
feared.
</P>
<P>
   The Cadets, who scored barely 1{ minutes into Saturday's game at
Robertson Stadium, kept the Cougars off balance on defense much of
the day and then stemmed UH's late rush.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a 38-28 Conference USA victory for Army, its
inaugural conference road win and the first time in eight games
dating to 1996 the Cadets have won on the road.
</P>
<P>
   Down 31-7 in the third quarter, Houston (1-5, 1-1 C-USA) made it
a 10-point game in the final minute _ a margin that might have been
smaller if Jerrian James had been able to hold onto a
fourth-quarter pass in the end zone. While James (11 catches, 121
yards, two TDs) and others pulled their weight, the Cougars'
defense, as expected, struggled to solve an offense it had precious
little time to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Joe Gerena replaced starting quarterback Johnny Goff
(reinjured ankle) early in the second quarter, and the Cadets,
cheered on by about 4,000 soldiers from various bases, scarcely
skipped a beat. Ranked fourth nationally in rushing, Army gained
324 yards on 54 carries with an array of eight backs against a
Houston run defense that had been ranked 12th in the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first half was as big a nightmare as I thought it would
be,'' UH coach Kim Helton said. ``We thought it would take a
quarter to catch up to the speed of their offense because we
couldn't simulate it in practice. Unfortunately, it took a half.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm unhappy with the way the defense played, but I'm
understanding. We took our good defense and made it look bad. We
were timid and afraid to make a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   By halftime, the Cougars trailed 28-7, due partially to a
lightning-quick start by Army. After Rod Richardson's 47-yard
return of the opening kickoff, Grady Jett sprinted 45 yards on an
end-around to the UH one, from where fullback Ty Amey scored the
first of his three TDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out and busted it right up the middle,'' said Amey,
whose 79 yards on 15 carries included a 40-yard burst.
</P>
<P>
   Army (2-3, 2-1), which scored on five of its first seven
possessions, led 14-0 after its second possession, a series of 10
running plays. The Cadets didn't throw a pass until their 18th play
and probably could have gone the whole game without attempting one.
They finished the day with one completion in three attempts as the
caissons keep rolling along.
</P>
<P>
   Army coach Bob Sutton said a quick start was imperative after
his team fell behind early while losing to East Carolina and
Rutgers in its previous two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we decided to take the kick to start and see if we
could get something going early,'' Sutton said. ``I felt our
running backs did a good job going at their D (defense).''
</P>
<P>
   UH quarterback Jason McKinley, sacked four times by an Army
defense that had only four sacks in the first four games, had four
touchdown passes, including two each to James and Orlando Iglesias,
while compiling a career-high 29 completions out of 50 attempts for
302 yards. But McKinley also drew an intentional-grounding penalty
and twice fumbled the center snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd seen all their blitzes on film,'' McKinley said. ``We
just shot ourselves in the foot in the first half. I felt we moved
the ball well in the second half, but we ran out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   James' 13-yard catch in the corner of the end zone narrowed the
Cadets' lead to 14-7 in the first quarter, but halfback Bobby
Williams (11 carries, 62 yards) broke a 36-yard scoring run on
Army's next series. Amey's eight-yard run just before halftime
ended a 46-yard scoring drive that was helped along by a UH
personal-foul penalty, giving the Cadets a 28-7 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   Army ran more than six minutes off the clock on its first
possession of the second half before Eric Olsen kicked a 37-yard
field goal to make it 31-7.
</P>
<P>
   The Cougars, who held an 87-57 margin in plays, didn't get on
the board again until the fourth quarter, when they scored 21
points.
</P>
<P>
   UH made it 31-14 with 11:55 remaining when Iglesias hauled in
McKinley's fourth-down pass for a 17-yard TD after T.J. Light, a
first-time starter at linebacker, made the first of his two fumble
recoveries.
</P>
<P>
   But Amey's 40-yard burst and Gerena's 15-yard TD run enabled the
Cadets to reel off 80 yards in four plays and 84 seconds, making it
38-14.
</P>
<P>
   Light's fumble recovery set up McKinley's 10-yard TD pass to
James with 6:08 remaining. Trailing 38-21, the Cougars recovered
the ensuing onside kick but failed to convert.
</P>
<P>
   UH wrapped up the scoring with 51 seconds remaining on Iglesias'
38-yard catch-and-run from McKinley.

   Tech overcomes Oklahoma State
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By W.H. STICKNEY JR. &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ Jones Stadium on Saturday night was the site of the
annual homecoming game at Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   It might also have been a laboratory for the Red Raiders and
Oklahoma State Cowboys, a pair of Big 12 South foes that had
something to prove.
</P>
<P>
   With Dorian Pitts stirring things up on defense by blocking a
punt to set up a first-half touchdown and returning a fumble 53
yards for a fourth-period TD, the Raiders frolicked to a 24-17
victory that just may have proved to the pollsters they belong
among the nation's Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   Tech, though unranked, improved to 6-0. With a 3-0 mark in Big
12 play, they remain tied with Texas A&AMP;M atop the South Division.
</P>
<P>
   This is only the third time in school history the Raiders have
begun a season 6-0 and the first since 1976, when Steve Sloan, in
his second season as coach, led them to an 8-0 start and 10-2
overall record. They were also 6-0 in 1938.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an honor to be 6-0. But there's still room for
improvement,'' Pitts said. ``As long as we keep getting better,
we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Oklahoma State (2-3, 1-2) failed in an effort to
prove that last week's 24-17 defeat to No. 2 Nebraska wasn't truly
indicative of its talents. Perhaps the emotional strain of allowing
that one to slip away had a carry-over effect.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the Cowboys did show the Raiders, however, was that
Tech's rush defense, fourth-best in the NCAA and No. 1 in the Big
12, might need a little more tinkering.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Nathan Simmons (16 carries, 81 yards) and
quarterback Tony Lindsay (17 carries, 59 yards) combined for 140
yards on the ground as OSU rolled up 281 yards of offense.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough to overcome a rather balky offense and
11 penalties that yielded a costly 132 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We continue to make critical mistakes,'' OSU coach Bob Simmons
said. ``Until we eliminate those types of things we will continue
to struggle. I thought our offense played well enough to win.''
</P>
<P>
   During one fourth-period drive by Tech that produced a 32-yard
field goal by Chris Birkholz for a 17-10 lead, the Cowboys were
called for a dead-ball personal foul and a 15-yard facemask
infraction.
</P>
<P>
   Pitts applied the clincher when he picked up a fumble by Lindsay
and raced 53 yards for a touchdown with 2:53 left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took one bounce and bounced up in my hands,'' Pitts said.
``I saw nothing but greenery ahead of me, and I had no other choice
but to score.''
</P>
<P>
   OSU got its final tally on an eight-yard pass from Lindsay to
Terrance Richardson with 2:20 left.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the heroics by Pitts, Tech used a pair of
touchdown passes from quarterback Rob Peters to receiver Donnie
Hart to shake out of an early-game slumber and beat OSU for the
third consecutive time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a nice win,'' said Tech coach Spike Dykes. ``It was
probably the best team win we had. The defense gave our offense a
number of chances to get back into our game. And our offense did a
good job of getting back into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Peters, making only his second start this season after suffering
an injury in the opener, completed eight of 15 passes for 74 yards
and the two scoring strikes to Hart (four receptions, 53 yards).
</P>
<P>
   Tech tailback Ricky Williams, the nation's second-leading ground
gainer, carried 25 times for 97 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders' usually solid run defense, meanwhile, was
tested from the moment the Cowboys first got their hands on the
football. OSU stormed to an early 7-0 lead, using only one pass in
a 12-play, 51-yard drive that followed a 29-yard punt by Tech's
Brian Roberson. Reserve fullback Brian Aikins got the touchdown on
a one-yard plunge.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the first period ended, the Cowboys had already run
for 92 yards, far exceeding the 71.6 yards averaged by Tech
opponents coming in.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also had a 10-0 lead, courtesy of a 38-yard field
goal by Tim Sydnes that came with 40 seconds left in the period.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of defense wasn't the only phase of the game giving Tech
coach Spike Dykes headaches. Williams bolted for 22 yards on the
Raiders' first possession, but that was about all the offense Dykes
got through the first 15 minutes. Tech came out of the first period
with only two total yards of offense, minus-two yards rushing and a
goose egg on the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   Quicker than a swish from the tail of their mascot horse, the
Raiders used a fumble recovery and blocked punt near the end of the
second period to right the foundering ship.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys had recovered a fumble by Peters and set up shop on
the 43 of Tech. Two plays later, OSU returned the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chaloupka had come on to replace Lindsay, the 1997 Big 12
Freshman of the Year, at quarterback. And after a holding call on
the Cowboys, a pitchout by Chaloupka was fumbled by tailback Jamaal
Fobbs and recovered by Tech middle linebacker Tim Duffie.
</P>
<P>
   With only his second completed pass of the evening, Peters
brought the Raiders within 10-7. Hart got behind defensive back
Evan Howell in the end zone for the 14-yard TD reception.
</P>
<P>
   Though he had to leap and extend to bring in a high spiral from
Peters, Hart executed the move as if in a ballet. Chris Birkholz
tacked on the point-after.
</P>
<P>
   On the very next possession by OSU, Tech was opportunistic
again. The Cowboys in three plays were unable to get a first down
and brought on freshman Scott Elder to punt. His kick was blocked
by Pitts, giving the Raiders the ball at the Cowboys' 26.
</P>
<P>
   Following an offsides call on OSU, Peters for the second time
found Hart, this time with a bullet over the middle. The touchdown
covered 18 yards, and with Birkholz's extra point, gave Tech its
first lead, 14-10, with 3:44 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got flat,'' said Nathan Simmons. ``And we shot ourselves in
the foot when we had the momentum.''

SAGGING DEVILS APPEAR CLUELESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - After the leprechaun pranced off the field, they
looked at each other in bewilderment. In the post-mortem, they
sounded clueless.
</P>
<P>
   How can Arizona State be 2-4?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one knows,'' Chad Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Kealy, what's wrong with you? ASU's starting quarterback
shifted in his chair like a witness testifying before a federal
grand jury. Knocked woozy against Southern California and replaced
a week later by Elliott after throwing his third interception,
Kealy either didn't wish to answer the tough, rapid-fire questions
that came at him, or as probably was the case, the sophomore simply
couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your guess,'' Ryan replied, ``is as good as mine.''
</P>
<P>
   When the season began, the Sun Devils were ranked No. 8 in the
nation. Now they're just another ho-hum, so-what middle of the
Pac-10 team.
</P>
<P>
   ASU may finish 5-6.
</P>
<P>
   This season has been a disaster.
</P>
<P>
   This season is o-v-e-r.
</P>
<P>
   ASU looks like a team lacking focus and confidence. A team short
on leadership. A talented team that is playing hard but not smart.
A team going nowhere fast.
</P>
<P>
   Like every Bruce Snyder team, this one took a solemn oath before
the season began. The four-point pledge is displayed on a wall in
the room in Sun Devil Stadium where Elliott and Kealy and several
teammates blinked at their inquisitors after Saturday's 28-9
surrender to Notre Dame.
</P>
<P>
   The oath reads:
</P>
<P>
   1. I will hustle.
</P>
<P>
   2. I will display courage.
</P>
<P>
   3. I will know what to do.
</P>
<P>
   4. I will care about my teammates.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils may be living up to 1, 2, and 4. ``We're still a
family,'' safety Mitchell Freedman made a point of saying.
</P>
<P>
   It's pledge No. 3 that has left this team frustrated, perplexed,
at a loss for words. The Devils look like they don't know what to
do. It's a team without answers. This team looks lost.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to cite the problems, some of which are obvious, even the
head coach couldn't be specific _ or he chose not to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's something you can pinpoint,'' Snyder said.
He looked and sounded like a man who welcomed a break in the
schedule. Snyder promised to evaluate every position and every
player between now and the next game Oct. 22. The coaches must look
in the mirror, too.
</P>
<P>
   The next opponent, Stanford, is one team ASU figured it should
beat. Now, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The offense is studded with talent, like a ham with cloves.
Offense was to be ASU's strength. Against Notre Dame, which had
allowed an average of 28 points per game, Kealy and his teammates
were almost as irrelevant as public address announcer Jeff Munn
after the stadium suffered a power outage at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   During the second half, Munn's mike was dead. The scoreboard was
blank. (Thought for the Day: What if this had happened during the
evening Fiesta Bowl national championship game?) So was the ASU
offense until Snyder pulled the plug on Kealy and Elliott directed
the Devils on their only touchdown drive.
</P>
<P>
   But to blame only Kealy would be like blaming the power failure
on a freshman student's dorm room hot plate. ``I dunno. I just
plugged it in and the campus went dark . . .''
</P>
<P>
   The defense couldn't stop Notre Dame's fullback trap. Backup
fullback Joey Goodspeed ran for 109 yards on four carries. What if
Joey had ``great'' speed?
</P>
<P>
   Penalties were suicidal. With ASU trailing, 14-3, Freedman
intercepted at the ASU 1-yard line. But the Devils defense was
offside, nullifying the theft. Two plays later, the Fighting Irish
scored their third touchdown. Game, set, match.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder obviously overestimated his team. Many of us did. Part of
the problem is leadership. The Devils miss not having players like
Jake Plummer and Pat Tillman, whose contribution to ASU's football
revival extended far beyond their ability to make big plays. Both
have personalities their teammates rallied around. Who are the
leaders on this team?
</P>
<P>
   The game over, ASU players filed silently toward their locker
room, as empty as they felt. Behind them, they could hear the
cheers of happy Notre Dame fans celebrating with the players who
were leaving the other end of the field, their gold helmets
gleaming in the sun. Notre Dame is 4-1. ASU is _ inexcusably _ 2-4.
</P>
<P>
   One school's disappointing slide coupled with the other's third
win in a row calls to mind the old story about the two fellows who
passed each other in midair, traveling in opposite directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know anything about parachutes?'' one shouted, tugging

   Freshman has hand &QL; 
in maroon-letter day
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CCOLLEGE STATION _ This was the day the campus of the state's
agricultural and mechanical school became a monkey-free
environment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the day Texas A&AMP;M Aggies have waited for all of this
decade, if not all of their lives. Doing all the things their
critics said they couldn't or wouldn't do, the Aggies ambushed No.
2 Nebraska 28-21 on Saturday, and in the process they uncovered a
new star of field and screen.
</P>
<P>
   The key figure in this historic win was a huge freshman
fullback, who had been, until now, a fringe player. Ja'Mar Toombs
sped 71 yards to the Nebraska one-yard line to set up A&AMP;M's second
touchdown, and he scored their last with a bull rush from the
three. That one put the Aggies up by 21 points on the first play of
the fourth quarter, giving them the cushion they would need so
urgently in the closing minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs is too young and earnest and carefree to understand he
was discovered Saturday, or that his long gallop will burrow its
way into Aggies' memories.
</P>
<P>
   ``He grew to a man today,'' said Dante Hall, who had previously
employed Ja'Mar as a blocking back.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 60,798 embraced him, dragging out the middle
letters in his last name, as sports crowds relish doing, so that
the chant of ``Toooombs'' droned on through the day.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, at least for a day, the Nebraska dynasty suffered a
tomb-like fate.
</P>
<P>
   Hall and Toombs each gained over 100 yards, Ja'Mar getting his
on 10 carries _ one more than he had recorded in the previous five
games.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Hall was asked if he felt ``a little jealous''
of the freshman's reception. Dante didn't understand the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, the way the crowd chanted his name,'' added the
reporter, bucking for dumb-question-of the-month honors. ``They
loved him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall cocked his head and said: ``They loved all of us. Hey, man,
are you drunk?''
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies in the crowd refused to leave their seats after the
game. They cheered, they swayed, they sang the war hymn and they
gave each player a standing ovation as he ducked under the stands
and into the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies had scored on the first pass they completed, 81 yards
from a scrambling Randy McCown to Chris Taylor, who said he was
surprised when the play worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had tried it a couple times before,'' he said. ``I turned
around and no one was there.''
</P>
<P>
   It was virtually the only success the Aggies had in the air,
completing only one more out of eight attempts.
</P>
<P>
   But it was Ja'Mar's explosion up the middle of the field that
gave the Aggies partisans their best clue this would be their day.
Facing third-and-two from the Aggies' 28, Toombs burst up the
middle and found a suddenly vacant field in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually,'' he said, ``the strongside linebacker is in the
hole. But he overran the play. There was some daylight, and I just
kept running''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the only person between Toombs and the goal line was
the back judge. While running free, and trying to avoid the
official, Toombs managed to take a peek at the Sony JumboTron
behind the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know there was a (Nebraska) guy behind me,'' he said,
``until I looked at the big screen and saw him. I was about the
20-yard line. The guy behind him wasn't on the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   One of them tripped him up at the one, and Hall scored the
touchdown a play later. Toombs ran like he was on a track, hardly
varying from his path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was running as fast as I can,'' he said, ``because Nebraska
is famous for its speed. The official ran right beside me for a
while. I could see it in his face, he was scared and trying to get
out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it was a shrewd use of technology by the Kilgore
freshman, who glanced at the screen rather than turn his head.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs has virtually come out of nowhere to help the Aggies
break out to a 5-1 record and a national ranking. He reported for
fall practice at 270 pounds, went on a strict diet and workout
program and in three months managed to slim to 260. He would not be
starting if the two fullbacks ahead of him had not become
indisposed.
</P>
<P>
   Toombs has been compared to George Woodard, an A&AMP;M fullback of
the '70s who weighed 275 and was sometimes mistaken for Rhode
Island.
</P>
<P>
   One way or another, the Aggies rolled back the years Saturday,
on a day of buttermilk skies. Arguably, this victory ranks among
the greatest in Aggies history, a list that would include the 1939
national champions' win over Tulane in the Sugar Bowl and beating
Texas for the first time in Memorial Stadium in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   The Aggies were hanging on by their fingernails in the fourth
quarter, but hang on they did, ending Nebraska's winning streak at
19, the longest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Few teams in college football lore needed a victory so badly,
and few produced one any bigger. The word gargantuan comes to mind.
</P>
<P>
   The win was A&AMP;M's first over a Top 10 team since 1989, when they
turned back No. 8 Houston and eventual Heisman Trophy winner Andre
Ware 17-13. R.C. Slocum was in his first season as the school's
head coach, and the Aggies five weeks earlier had opened with a win
over No. 7 LSU.
</P>
<P>
   Since then they had hit nothing but dry holes, losing nine in a
row to ranked teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we have heard around here,'' said tight end Dan Campbell,
``was how we couldn't win a big game, that coach Slocum can't coach
a big game. Well, we did it. That's all I've got to say. We did
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum called it the biggest win of his career and, in a nice
rounding of the circle, cited Toombs as a symbol of why it was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ja'Mar was widely recruited,'' said Slocum, impeccably attired
in maroon sportcoat and silver hair. ``He was told if he ever
wanted to win a big game, beat a big-time team, he had to go off to
Ohio State or Florida State or somewhere else. I don't think they
can say that anymore.''

NORTHRIDGE SITS ATOP BIG SKY WITH WIN OVER MONTANA 
</HEADLINE>
  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
 &LR;  NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ After 36 seasons of chuck-and-duck football,
Cal State Northridge finally has a defense. And it's a darn fine
one at that.
<P>
   CSUN quarterback Marcus Brady was again exciting, scrambling to
make big plays, but even he fell into the backdrop Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense of the 23rd-ranked Matadors was the show-stopper as
it throttled No.18 Montana 21-7 in front of a season-high 5,237 at
North Campus Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The seven points are the fewest the Matadors have allowed in a
Big Sky game and just the second time in 36 games they've allowed
less than 10. It's also the least number of points Montana (3-3,
1-2 Big Sky) has scored in 80 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this defense I could say that's going to happen quite a
bit this year,'' Brady said. ``We have a great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple CSUN's fourth straight win with Weber State's loss to
Montana State and the Matadors CSUN (4-1, 3-0) sit alone atop the
Big Sky standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were nine teams at the Big Sky Conference (media day)
that all thought they could win, and some are finding a way, and
we're one of them,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``Montana
definitely played good enough on defense to win the football
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, part of the reason Montana scored just one
touchdown was the unexpected absence of All-American quarterback
Brian Ah Yat, who had a bruised back. But backup Seth Davis proved
his worth last week when he threw for 297 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors had to deal with a defensive line devastated by
injuries. But even with seven defensive linemen on the sideline in
street clothes, the Matadors were able to put pressure on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest play was turned in by nose guard Quinton Reed late
in the fourth quarter. On fourth-and-1 from Montana's own 24, Reed,
a converted linebacker playing his first game on the defensive
line, dropped Brian Gales for a 4-yard loss. Four plays later
Melvin Blue scored on a 4-yard run to give CSUN a 21-7 lead with
1:56 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the dude fumbled the ball,'' Reed said. ``I knew I
hit him, but I thought I hit him and we got the recovery. I didn't
know whether he made it or not. I went blank. I just knew I had to
get there.''
</P>
<P>
   CSUN's defense, which played with five defensive backs most of
the way, sacked Davis six times. The Matadors also had a crucial
interception in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On its previous possession Montana answered a 51-yard scoring
pass from Brady to Jimmy Greninger with a 13-yard pass from Davis
to Travis Walker. It tied the game at 7-7 midway through the third
quarter. But with the Grizzlies driving again, Matadors cornerback
Donnell Day intercepted Davis inside the 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have confused (Montana's offense) because we never
ran four corners in at one time (before this game),'' said CSUN
safety Jeremy Golden, who had 11 tackles. ``They might have
expected it to happen, but they would have thought there would have
been some linebackers covering down somewhere. It just didn't
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when CSUN's offense was able to get into the end zone, the
defense played a big part in setting it up.
</P>
<P>
   After Ethan Beck's 66-yard punt pinned Montana on its own 3-yard
line, CSUN's offense got the ball back on the Grizzlies' 47. Only
then was Brady able to work his magic, though first the Matadors
had to overcome a 57-yard touchdown pass that was negated by a
holding penalty.
</P>
<P>
   But Brady converted a pair of third downs to push the ball to
the 21, and two plays later he connected with Aaron Arnold for a
21-yard scoring pass over the middle to give CSUN a 13-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the difference in the game was the Brady kid making
big-time plays in the critical situations,'' Montana coach Mick
Dennehy said. ``We were close, and we had him in our grasp a lot,
but you have to finish. Being close on him doesn't make any
difference.'' &UR; !dlim!!end! &LR;

LIGHTS GO OUT ON ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - The message by Arizona State players afterward
was this: We're not a bad team.
</P>
<P>
   They just play one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Is was as if a hand reached down and pulled the plug on ASU's
season. In front of a sellout Sun Devil Stadium crowd of 73,501, a
regional television audience and much of the Valley's clergy, ASU
was humiliated, 28-9, by Notre Dame Saturday in a game marked by a
second-half power outage on and off the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a cancer inside,'' cornerback Courtney Jackson said.
``We've got to get the tumor out.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils fall to 2-4. Yes, ``2-4.'' This from a team that
was a preseason Top 10 pick in many polls. With games against No.
15 Oregon and No. 10 Arizona ahead, ASU is in real danger of
finishing below .500.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils could have a quarterback controversy in the
making.
</P>
<P>
   ASU Coach Bruce Snyder replaced sophomore Ryan Kealy with
redshirt freshman Chad Elliott late in the third quarter after
Kealy threw his third interception. Afterward, Snyder said he would
use the Sun Devils' bye week to evaluate all positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ryan is struggling,'' Snyder said. ``There's nothing in him
that lacks effort or courage. I feel for him. Certainly not all our
problems are because of him, but we are struggling at that position
. . . There's a hesitancy to him. He's pressing.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy was at a loss for an explanation, but said at the time,
``I did force the ball.
</P>
<P>
   He completed 13 of 22 passes for three interceptions and no
touchdowns. He has thrown seven interceptions this season, the same
amount he threw all last year. Elliott was 6 of 8 for 47 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame, meanwhile, improved to 4-1 behind a defense that has
struggled this season. Offensively, quarterback Jarious Jackson
only had to pass for 69 yards thanks to a ground game that got 109
yards from fullback Joey Goodspeed and 84 from tailback Autry
Denson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Competition either brings out the best or worst in you,''
Fighting Irish Coach Bob Davie said. ``I think it brings out the
best in us.''
</P>
<P>
   And apparently the worst in the Sun Devils, who continue to beat
themselves with mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Against Southern California last week, ASU lost because of a
blocked punt and an interception that were returned for touchdowns
in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Notre Dame's first touchdown was set up by a Kealy
interception, and the second was a 25-yard interception return by
A'Jani Sanders.
</P>
<P>
   Two plays before the Fighting Irish's third score, a 1-yard run
by Denson in the third quarter, Sun Devils safety Mitchell Freedman
intercepted a Jackson pass at the ASU 1-yard line, but it was
called back by an offside call.
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame's final score, another 1-yard run by Denson, in the
fourth quarter, was highlighted by Goodspeed's 60-yard run.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the game, ASU's defense was solid, but it did have
problems with the fullback trap.
</P>
<P>
   It's time for the Sun Devils to do some serious soul-searching.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think sometimes people might take a play off here or
there,'' linebacker Joe Cesta said. ``They might not think the
ball's coming at them. Things like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder insisted afterward that his team's problems are not
because of lack of effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may not do the smartest things,'' he said. ``But this team
really wants to be good. They try really hard, and this comes from
a professional coach who gives my life to coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   They may want to be good, but at this point, they're not.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the coaches will give serious consideration to starting
Elliott against Stanford on Oct. 22.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not up to me, that's up to the coaches,'' Elliott said.
``I'll be ready if they need me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tailback J.R. Redmond, who rushed for 94 yards and had ASU's
only touchdown, a 1-yard run in the fourth quarter, said, ``Chad
Elliott did a great job. It's tough for a backup quarterback
because you don't get as many snaps during the week.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a surreal game throughout. The power outage, which was
due to the failure of a transformer on the main concourse of Sun
Devil Stadium, came during halftime and knocked out the public
address system and the scoreboard for the entire second half. It
also sent ABC off the air for much of the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   It might have been the best thing for ASU fans watching the
game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really hurts,'' Jackson said. ``Our only goal going in was
to be 3-3. To have that goal destroyed . . . We've got to take a
few days off and each person has to evaluate himself.''

<P>
   Cotton Bowl brings forth special memories
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By JOHN P. LOPEZ &LR;  &QL; 
DDALLAS _ For one day, the Longhorns could reminisce.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this team in the orange and white on this day, in this
setting, was like going back to a time when men were men, Texas was
Texas and there was no reason to believe things would change.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of funnel cakes and crispy corn dogs wafted through
the air Saturday afternoon at the Texas State Fairgrounds. And the
feel of old-time Texas Longhorns football made its way to the
Cotton Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   That was saltwater taffy being spun under the shadows of the
giant ferris wheel. Just like old times.
</P>
<P>
   And that was Texas 34, Oklahoma 3 in an old-fashioned shucking
that had everything but James Street, although if you squinted,
Major ``General'' Applewhite bore a striking resemblance.
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't the only one bringing back memories.
</P>
<P>
   That was No. 37 dancing across the Cotton Bowl turf, looking so
graceful yet powerful, carrying seemingly defenseless Sooners with
him and later talking about things like perspective, humility and
just wanting to help the team.
</P>
<P>
   Texas tailback Ricky Williams brought back the days of legendary
SMU running back Doak Walker, all right, but this time the Doaker
wore orange.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doak was a role model for me,'' Williams said. ``It was
special to wear his number.''
</P>
<P>
   Start to merciful finish, much about this game was like taking a
nostalgic trip down a nostalgic trail.
</P>
<P>
   Those were old-fashioned cotton candy vendors, carnival barkers
and merry-go-rounds making the grounds buzz on a beautiful Saturday
afternoon for football that might not have been out of Norman
Rockwell's book, but certainly Cactus Pryor's.
</P>
<P>
   And those were Longhorns fans _ smiling, of all things _ acting
as if the past 18 or so years were just a bad dream. No Fred Akers.
No John Mackovic. No up-and-down emotions or losing seasons. And
definitely, no losing games 66-3.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one day, sure. It was only a time to reminisce and
see things in Texas that have not been seen with any consistency
for years. Power. Balance. Poise. Even defense, for gosh sakes.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Saturday's impressive effort only will lead to more tease,
more Longhorns frustrations down the road and more wondering if the
Empire ever will be rebuilt to the level it once was.
</P>
<P>
   After all, for all the parts to this Texas show that seemed so
perfect _ the potential Heisman winner making gallant dashes and
classy gestures, the slippery quarterback heaving bombs, the
crushing defensive effort, the smart coach _ it came against an
Oklahoma team that is bad. Very bad.
</P>
<P>
   The Sooners have little team speed, showed little discipline (14
penalties for 109 yards) on either side of the ball, tried three
quarterbacks with equal futility and was outcoached or overrated on
defense. Maybe both.
</P>
<P>
   As much as this was the kind of day that showed why Mack Brown
wanted to come to Texas to try to rebuild the Empire, it also
showed why Sooners coach John Blake might be shown the way out of
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now I'm frustrated with everything,'' Blake said
afterward. ``We didn't do much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you could understand why no matter the opponent or the
mediocre 4-2 Texas record even with the win, on this day, in this
setting, there were hints of a turn in the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone around here is in danger of thinking that
we've made it back,'' Brown said. ``But after our first three
games, I wasn't sure we could win another game this year. We're
better now. This was good for us today. There were some big
emotions flowing in me when we walked into the stadium. You
understand why Texas-OU is so special when you're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the day, you also could understand why Williams
did what he did, wearing his departed friend's jersey number, then
pointing to the sky and saying to himself, ``This is for you,
Doak,'' both times he scored a touchdown. Afterward, Williams
presented the No. 37 jersey to Walker's children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put on the jersey this morning and felt rejuvenated,''
Williams said. ``He was the kind of person that I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   On this day you could understand.
</P>
<P>
   Walker won the Heisman Trophy in 1948, but never had to be
handed a piece of hardware for all the world to know he was
special. Williams, who carried the football 139 yards and his team
the distance in this one, might not win the coveted award 50 years
later.
</P>
<P>
   It's early in the Heisman campaign. And frankly, only a
2,000-yard season by Williams could make some voters forget the
Longhorns' dismal efforts against UCLA and Kansas State. But
Williams made himself at home in the house Doak built, showing why
he is a special Longhorns player no matter what trophies decorate
his home.
</P>
<P>
   Williams changed the complexion of the game by just walking onto
the field. The Sooners tried eight men on the defensive line, then
nine, trying to find a way to stop No. 37.
</P>
<P>
   They couldn't. Williams foiled every plan, changed every
strategy, just like it was when Doak roamed the Cotton Bowl or in
the old glorious Texas days of Street's wishbone, Roosevelt Leaks'
dashes and Earl Campbell's pounding runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a special day for me, because of the jersey,''
Williams said. ``And we showed we can play. We can play with
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Ricky was Doak. And Texas was Texas.

BUMBLIN' BEARS NO LONGER CUTE TO FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the first month of the season, the Chicago Bears were, well,
kind of cute. No one expected anything from them, and they turned
in some gritty performances while starting 0-4.
</P>
<P>
   They led each game at halftime only to collapse, but they didn't
quit, and they showed just enough skill to be entertaining. And
besides, Chicago was consumed by the Cubs, who were making a run at
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   But by last Sunday, the Bears' charm had worn off faster than a
child actor's.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone had caught the act, and with the Cubs having been
eliminated from the playoffs the day before, the eyes of Chicago
were on the Bears, who were playing Detroit at Soldier Field.
</P>
<P>
   Bears Coach Dave Wannstedt could sense the mood changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said in the locker room, `Hey, we'd better play good this
week and win because we're going to have about 60,000 upset Cubs
fans in the stands and they're going to be taking out all of their
frustrations on us,' '' said Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears didn't play great _ losing five fumbles _ but they
scored 21 points in the fourth quarter to come back and win, 31-27.
</P>
<P>
   For a franchise that went 4-12 last year and had lost four
straight to start this season, it was a huge relief.
</P>
<P>
   But Wannstedt is hardly ready to declare that the Bears are
back. After all, they barely beat a bad Detroit team, and even a
victory today over the Cardinals (2-3) at Sun Devil Stadium won't
turn anyone into believers.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt, in his sixth season as head coach, has caught
considerable heat for the Bears descent into the bowels of the NFL.
His tenure started so promisingly with a 7-9 season in 1993
followed by a 9-7 record and a playoff win in 1994. The Bears went
9-7 again in 1995, then slipped to 7-9 and then to 4-12 last year.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the slide are familiar to Cardinals fans, who
have watched that organization make similar mistakes. Bad drafts.
Poor choices in free agency. Freakish injuries. Questionable
coaching.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Cardinals, who are on their third coach since
1993, one of the few constants for the Bears has been Wannstedt,
who still has the support of team President Mike McCaskey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mystery to me or anybody around here what has
happened the last few years,'' Wannstedt said. ``We're just trying
to battle our way back a little bit. It's not the norm in the NFL,
where a coach is in his sixth year and going through a rebuilding
stage. But that's where we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It's taken a series of personnel mistakes to get there, and
there are plenty of people to blame.
</P>
<P>
   When Wannstedt was hired, he was given considerable powers over
personnel. Rod Graves, now in the Cardinals front office, was the
director of player personnel from 1994-97 and was blamed for the
poor drafts. And many people point at McCaskey and the structure of
the organization for the Bears' problems.
</P>
<P>
   After Bill Tobin left the team after the 1993 season, the Bears
no longer had just one person in charge of all personnel decisions.
Like the Cardinals, a decision was made only after it filtered
through several layers of management. And the decision usually
turned out to be the wrong one.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears haven't had a Pro Bowler since 1994. The top draft
pick in 1994, defensive end John Thierry, hasn't done much. The
second pick that year, tackle Marcus Spears, never contributed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the Bears' top two picks were running back Rashaan
Salaam and defensive lineman Pat Riley. Neither is with the team.
</P>
<P>
   The club also failed to improve itself through free agency.
Middle linebacker Bryan Cox, signed in 1996, was supposed to
provide a stabilizing force but proved to be more of a divisive
one. He's gone.
</P>
<P>
   Wannstedt traces part of the downfall to 1996. In the preseason,
Wannstedt proclaimed that all the pieces were in place for the
Bears to return to prominence. And it seemed to be true after the
Bears opened the season with a victory over Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   However, the season turned, Wannstedt said, when quarterback
Erik Kramer suffered two herniated cervical discs after starting
the first four games.
</P>
<P>
   The Bears spent part of the next two seasons trying to find a
replacement. Dave Krieg was a stop-gap measure, and the Bears ended
up trading a first-round pick to Seattle for Rick Mirer and a
fourth-round selection.
</P>
<P>
   Mirer started the first five games of last season and was
horrible. The Bears lost all five, and Mirer was replaced by
Kramer. For the season, Mirer completed just 51.5 percent of his
passes, didn't throw a touchdown pass and was intercepted six
times. He was released before training camp this year.
</P>
<P>
   As the club floundered, the front office structure was changed.
Mark Hatley, who had spent nine years in Kansas City's personnel
department, was hired as the vice president of player personnel. He
restructured the scouting department, creating separate departments
for pro and college scouting, something Graves requested but was
denied.
</P>
<P>
   Most experts think the Bears' 1998 draft was more productive
than in years past, given the early season play of running back
Curtis Enis, the first-round pick, and safety Tony Parrish, taken
in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   McCaskey, meanwhile, gave Wannstedt a vote of confidence. But
Wannstedt knew he not only needed an infusion of talent on his team
but also some character.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some things going on within the club that we're not
going to discuss, but it's a different ballclub this year,'' said
receiver Bobby Engram. ``Guys in this locker room believe we can
win, that we have a chance to win every week, and that's all you
can ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goals and objectives were different (last year),''
Wannstedt said. ``The team and its approach is different this year.
We're a better team.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been Wannstedt's mantra since training camp, which he
called the most fun in his six seasons in Chicago. There are 11 new
starters, and problems such as defensive end Alonzo Spellman and
Cox have been weeded out. It's questionable whether these Bears are
better than last year's team, but no one denies that there are
fewer problems in the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really took a hard stance and said that we might be getting
rid of some talented players,'' Wannstedt said. ``But we felt like
we would be able to take one step back but two steps forward from
an attitude standpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite being 1-4, the players seem to genuinely believe that
this season is salvageable. The upcoming schedule is favorable,
with the next six games coming against the Cardinals, Dallas,
Tennessee, St. Louis, Detroit and Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   After last Sunday's game, a reporter asked Kramer if he really
believes it's possible the Bears can reverse their fortunes. ``It
must be if you're asking me that question,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is a town that does not indulge warm beer or losers for
long. There aren't many fans who truly believe Wannstedt can pull
the franchise out of the muck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chicago's a tough town, and I feel like I've got big enough
shoulders to handle it,'' Wannstedt said. ``It's easy to blame
everything on me. And in a lot of cases that would have happened.
But Mike (McCaskey) has not responded that way. He's got confidence
in what we're doing, and we're just plowing ahead.'' &QL;

TROJANS COUGH ONE UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took six games, but USC coach Paul Hackett
finally demonstrated he has something in common with predecessor
John Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans still can blow games against clearly inferior
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite holding a 21-point lead deep into the third quarter, the
19th-ranked Trojans completely collapsed and were upset by
California 32-31 before 65,678 at the Coliseum on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   It was reminiscent of Cal's unexpected victory over USC two
years ago, and several other games during the Robinson era when the
Trojans were caught flat-footed by lesser teams.
</P>
<P>
   USC led 31-10 in the third period before the Bears reeled off 22
consecutive points. Marcus Fields' 3-yard run with 3:30 remaining
in the game capped the surge and gave Cal its first lead of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   The loss devastated a USC team that had been brimming with
confidence just a week ago after defeating Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was bad tonight. It was a huge disappointment,'' Hackett
said. ``We had a game we could have won and didn't do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't dodge the bullet. The penalty issue overwhelmed
us. We've got to address the penalty issue.''
</P>
<P>
   USC (4-2, 2-1) had nine penalties for 89 yards and has committed
56 in the past five games.
</P>
<P>
   And one penalty clearly made the difference between winning and
losing for the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   With USC leading 31-18 in the fourth quarter, Petros Papadakis
appeared to break loose on a 58-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   But wide receiver Larry Parker was flagged for blocking Cal's
Nate Geldermann in the side of the back, nearly 20 yards behind the
play and about the same time Papadakis reached the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The touchdown was called back, and USC was put on Cal's 32-yard
line. Two players later, quarterback Carson Palmer completed a
short pass to tight end Antoine Harris, but Cal's Albert Dorsey
stripped the ball from Harris. Safety Damian Marzett picked up the
loose ball and went 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   In the span of two plays, the Trojans lost a touchdown,
possession of the ball and their momentum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't really aware that (the penalty) was called 'till like
30 seconds later,'' Papadakis said. ``I heard the ref say something
like it was a block in the back. It's nothing you can fault a guy
for.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett, who was racing down the sideline watching Papadakis'
run, never saw the infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was absolutely stunned that anything happened at all,''
Hackett said. ``It doesn't matter now.''
</P>
<P>
   Cal coach Tom Holmoe appeared the most convinced that Parker
committed an infraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a guy going free, you just can't block from behind. It
was obvious,'' Holmoe said. ``Flags were coming from all points in
the compass.''
</P>
<P>
   Even after Cal (4-1, 2-0) scored to cut the lead to 31-25, the
Trojans appeared in control. But with 6:42 left, freshman tailback
Frank Strong fumbled and Cal safety Peter Destefano recovered at
the Trojans' 43.
</P>
<P>
   That set up Fields' game-winning touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did that deadly thing you can't do,'' Hackett said. ``We
turned the ball over.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans had a final gasp, but Mike Van Raaphorst failed to
complete a pass on three straight plays. The Trojans punted with
2:53 remaining and never got the ball back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The game was pretty much in hand honestly; we just kept
kicking ourselves in the butt,'' Van Raaphorst said. ``We just
didn't play in the second half. It wasn't one thing. It was
everybody handing the game over.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed afterward that the Trojans probably became a
little too passive once they built their 21-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out flat. We kind of thought the game was won,''
linebacker Chris Claiborne said.
</P>
<P>
   Added wide receiver Billy Miller: ``I think we might not have
expressed it on the field, but in a lot of people's minds, it was
like, `This game was over.' It cost us.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was any other turning point, it occurred at the end of
the first half. USC blocked a punt and had the ball at Cal's 2 with
13 seconds left. After a running play gained a yard, Hackett
elected to kick a field goal with seven seconds left _ much to the
crowd's chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I look back on it, yeah, I should have gone for it with
seven seconds left,'' Hackett said. ``That one's gonna haunt me. I
felt the lead at halftime was gonna hold up.''

QUITTER QUARTERBACK INFURIATES PANTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The bashing of Carolina quarterback  &UR; Kerry Collins, who quit on
his team last week, is going on inside the Panthers' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can officially say I've seen everything that can
happen in the NFL now,'' Carolina cornerback  &UR; Eric Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unheard of,'' outside linebacker  &UR; Kevin Greene said.
``The only other case I know of that was anything like it ws when
(New Orleans) Coach  &UR; Jim Mora just up and died out (by resigning)
in the middle of a season.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins stunned the team when he walked into Coach  &UR; Dom Capers'
office Wednesday morning and announced that his heart wasn't into
it and that he wanted to be traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had made that comment, my wife would have shot me,''
linebacker  &UR; Jeff Brady.
</P>
<P>
   With Collins out of the picture, former Cardinals quarterback
 &UR; Steve
 &UR; Beuerlein becomes the starter for today's game at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Beuerlein said he was shocked when Collins told him of his
decision to forfeit the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was joking,'' Beuerlein said. ``I didn't realize
he was serious until he re-emphasized it several times. I don't
know if it was something that was festering in him or if he just
woke up (Wednesday) morning and felt this way. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a situation so unique, I don't even know what to
compare it to.''
</P>
<P>
   Brady described Beuerlein as a veteran who has the players'
respect. ``There's an uplifting breath of fresh air with him,''
Brady said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins' impending departure doesn't have huge salary-cap
implications because he is in the last year of his contract. In
fact, team officials declined after last season to exercise an
option on his contract, which would have required them to pay
Collins a $6 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   But the team can't replace him in the first round of next year's
draft in what is considered a deep quarterback crop, headed by
Kentucky's  &UR; Tim Couch. The Panthers sent their first-round pick to
Washington in the deal for defensive tackle  &UR; Sean Gilbert.
</P>
<P>
   Collins was the franchise's first draft pick and led the team to
the NFC championship game in his second season. But the past two
years have been disastrous for him.
</P>
<P>
   He offended teammates by using a racial slur after going out
drinking on the final night of training camp a year ago. Three days
later, he suffered a broken jaw in a preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Collins went on to lead the NFL in interceptions with 21 and
ranked last in passing efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he wants out because he doesn't like the franchise, the
city of Charlotte, N.C., or the South.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a hard thing for me to say, but he has quit on us,'' said
offensive lineman  &UR; Frank Garcia, a Maryvale High School product.
``He has jumped ship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He may be able to come in and play. But will people respect
him as a leader? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said the Panthers are better off without Collins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if you're washing cars,'' Davis said. ``If you
don't want to be out there washing cars, the guy who wants to do it
will do a better job.'' &QL; 
Wet and wild &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Seattle Seahawks punter  &UR; Jeff Feagles never has seen rain fall
as hard or long as the 3.6 inches that fell in Kansas City last
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   The storm caused the game at Arrowhead Stadium to be delayed for
54 minutes and left the field ``a complete mess,'' according to
Feagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stayed pretty dry (on the sideline),'' said Feagles, the
former Cardinals punter. ``We had big ponchos on and trash bags
were over shoes. But at one point, I just gave up staying dry. I
was tying my shoes, and as a I drew the laces tighter, water
squeezed out of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One time when I ran out to punt, I could see my shoes
sloshing.'' &QL; 
Losersville, USA
</P>
<P>
   Denver Broncos quarterback  &UR; Bubby Brister was asked whom he
likes in today's game between the winless Washington Redskins and
the winless Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cheerleaders,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The game between two 0-5 teams has been billed as the ``Paper
Bag Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has been outscored, 137-52. The Redskins have been
outscored, 169-74, and have a minus-11 turnover ratio. &QL; 
No hard feelings
</P>
<P>
   Former Cardinals Coach  &UR; Joe Bugel, offensive line coach at San
Diego, returns to Oakland today for the first time since being
fired as head coach of the Raiders last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Bugel, a class guy, isn't angry about being dumped after one
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never left a job bitter,'' said Bugel, who was fired
after a 4-12 season.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, two weeks after his ouster, Bugel kept a scheduled
visit to an Oakland elementary school and told the kids of his
firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``That day relieved a lot of pain, to be honest with you,''
Bugel said. ``I told them that sometime, something like that could
happen in their life, and I wanted them to know you could bounce
back with a smile.''
</P>
<P>
   Bugel said he is still smiling even though he likely won't get a
chance to be an NFL head coach again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a real good lieutenant,'' he said. ``I've served in this
capacity most of my career, and I didn't realize how much I missed
it.'' &QL; 
Unbeatable?
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay Packers safety  &UR; LeRoy Butler doesn't expect the
Minnesota Vikings (5-0) to lose a game anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until we meet them again,'' said Butler after the Packers were
routed, 37-24, last Monday night at Green Bay's Lambeau Field. ``I
don't see anybody else beating them. We were the only people
capable of beating them. They're going into the sunset now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're playing this good without Brad (starting
quarterback
 &UR; Brad Johnson), when Brad gets back, oh my God.''
</P>
<P>
   The rematch is Nov. 22 in Minneapolis. By that time, Vikings
wide receiver  &UR; Randy Moss might already have locked up the
offensive Rookie of the Year Award.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've taken a lot of criticism, and a lot of people want me to
fail, but I think I turned a lot of heads,'' said Moss after he
caught five passes for 190 yards and two scores. ``There's no room
on this bandwagon for all the people who want to climb on.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator  &UR; Brian Billick said he still is getting a
gauge on what Moss can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speed, size, jumping ability, ratio . . . and he's
absolutely unflappable,'' Billick said. ``Here it is Monday night
in Lambeau, and this guy is loving every minute of it. There's not
a nervous bone in his body. For a rookie, that's unnatural.'' &QL;

BROWN STANDS TALL AT CORNER  
 BACKUP TAKES CHANCE, SHINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY TIM TYERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Sometimes the best decisions in life are those we
don't have to make, and the one he didn't have to make in August
has proven fortunate for cornerback J.B. Brown and the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   The issue was tissue.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Brown's sister turned out to be a tissue match to
provide their mother with a new kidney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't get the chance because my sister was a match, but if
she had not been, and I was, I would have done it,'' Brown, 31,
said. ``Even if it meant I'd never play football again.''
</P>
<P>
   Which it would have meant. He's pleased to report both mother
and sister are doing well.
</P>
<P>
   Acquired from Pittsburgh for a seventh-round draft pick on
Tuesday, Aug. 25, Brown flew to Arizona the next day, returned to
Washington on Thursday for the transplant surgery, and then joined
the Cardinals in Oakland on Saturday. Without a practice, he played
in more than half the preseason victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know the defense or anything,'' Brown recalls. ``I
just wanted to play hard, show my skills and play with good
technique and go on from there.''
</P>
<P>
   Where he went from there was into a supporting role at right
cornerback to Tommy Knight. It blossomed into a starting role last
Sunday when Knight was sidelined because of a tear in a hamstring
connector. It's likely that Knight's injury will keep Brown in the
starting role again today when the Chicago Bears visit.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, in his 10th NFL season, drew raves from Cardinals
defensive coaches after his play against the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very valuable for us,'' defensive coordinator Dave
McGinnis said. ``We're fortunate to have a veteran like him to come
in and play as well as did. Oakland tried to go after him twice
late in the game and he was in great position both times. I was
really pleased.''
</P>
<P>
   Secondary coach Larry Marmie and Brown spent more than a week in
hourlong, crash-course sessions on the defense before the other
players came to work daily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sunday's game was the best he's played since he's been here,''
Marmie said. ``I feel very confident with him going into the game
now. He's a quality person who wants to be coached. It isn't like,
`Tell me what you want me to do and I'll do it.' He wants to be
coached and asks, `How do you want me to do it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Brown has 16-career interceptions and four fumble recoveries in
eight seasons in Miami and one in Pittsburgh. He was a starter for
six years in Miami, at one point started 71 consecutive games and
played in 75 straight before a knee injury sidelined him. In 1993,
his five interceptions led the Dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   He has no problem accepting his role behind a healthy Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage of my career I'm just happy to be playing and
contributing,'' said Brown, a Maryland product. ``When I came here
I told Coach (Vince) Tobin I wanted to help anyway I could,
including special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've put my ego to the side. It just doesn't matter to me.
This is a good opportunity for me. I was a nickel back in Miami two
years ago and a backup in Pittsburgh last year, so I really haven't
played much in two years.'' &QL;

PLUMMER WIPES OUT LAST WEEK  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Second-year quarterback Jake Plummer appreciates all the
concerned citizens who have inquired about the state of his psyche
and his right arm.
</P>
<P>
   But he wants Cardinals fans to know that he's not as fragile as
some might think.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of funny that they are worried,'' Plummer said.
``Maybe it means they care about me.''
</P>
<P>
   They also care not to see Plummer throw three interceptions, two
that resulted in Oakland Raiders scores in a 23-20 loss last
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Plummer will try to bounce back today when the Cardinals play
host to the Chicago Bears at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a new week,'' Plummer said. ``I learned that at
(Arizona State). Last year, I threw four picks in a game. The next
game, I didn't think about them. You keep pushing on. Hopefully,
I'm going to have a couple hundred games in my career. One bad game
doesn't push me back.''
</P>
<P>
   Rookie safety Pat Tillman, Plummer's college and pro teammate,
doesn't think there is any reason to spend sleepless nights
worrying about Plummer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake's fine,'' Tillman said. ``You're not going to get him
down. Look at the position he plays. You have to be headstrong to
do it. . . . He'll bounce back from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin is confident Plummer will play well today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jake has had a good week of practice,'' Tobin said.
``He's a battler. He has continued to work. It's not going to get
him down.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes Plummer's job even tougher is that the Cardinals have
second-worst third-down percentage in the league, at 17 of 66.
</P>
<P>
   Defensively, the big question is whether defensive tackle Eric
Swann (knee) will play. He hasn't practiced this week.
</P>
<P>
   If Swann doesn't play, he'll be replaced by second-year pro
Rashod Swinger, who would be making his first NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Chicago Tribune'' reported this week that Swann guaranteed
a victory in an offhanded remark.
</P>
<P>
   Swann wasn't quoted in the article, and his teammates maintain
he never said it.
</P>
<P>
   Note
</P>
<P>
   Only once in Cardinals history has a player guaranteed a win.
Defensive end Michael Bankston guaranteed a victory over Cleveland
in 1994. The Browns won, 32-0. &QL;

NAU KEEPS PACE IN BIG SKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM GINTONIO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLAGSTAFF, Ariz. _ It was a day of ``Can you top this?'' for
Northern Arizona linebacker Afa Faraimo.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered a fumble on the first play of the game that led to
a touchdown, blocked a punt that a teammate took 31 yards for
another score and intercepted a pass.
</P>
<P>
   And just for the heck of it, he made 12 tackles and led an
inspired defense that triggered Saturday night's 30-7 victory over
Idaho State. It was a game the Lumerjacks desperately needed to
stay on the fringes of the Big Sky race.
</P>
<P>
   Faraimo, a 5-foot-10, 205-pound junior, dedicated the game to
his 4-month-old son, Daniel, and his performance capped a perfect
campus Family Weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is by far the best game I've ever had,'' he said. ``But
we had some players coming back from injuries, and we all wanted to
make some plays. We wanted to play to our standards, and we pretty
much did that.''
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jake Crissup marveled at Faraimo's performance: ``He
was just incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   NAU (3-3, 1-2 Big Sky) completely dominated the Bengals (1-4,
1-2) before a crowd of 12,301 at Walkup Skydome. And it may take a
similar effort next week when the Lumberjacks visit Montana, a
perennial Division I-AA powerhouse and where NAU Coach Jerome
Souers coached for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the game's first play for Idaho State, quarterback Seth
Buford was clocked by defensive tackle Derek Allen, and Faraimo was
there to pounce on the loose ball at the Bengals' 28-yard line.
That set up a 1-yard scoring plunge by Tavon Cooper, who also put
the finishing touches on the evening with a 35-yard scoring jaunt
in the final quarter.
</P>
<P>
   In between, two key players, quarterback Travis Brown and
Crissup, put in some time. Brown had been out for more than three
games because of a dislocated left elbow, and Crissup missed last
week's game because of injured ribs.
</P>
<P>
   But it all came back to Faraimo, who said the Lumberjacks'
defensive scheme worked well, especially on his blocked punt and
one of his near-blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, who played the second and third quarters, looked solid.
He was 10 of 15 for 95 yards, including a 24-yard touchdown strike
to Justin Yuille. Backup quarterback David Moran, who may have seen
the last of his starting duty, continued his good work as a
fill-in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good to get back in there,'' Brown said. ``I wanted to
take a hit, but not a bad hit. I felt like I was in a groove right
away.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is the likely starter against Montana next week, and his
return comes at the right time for NAU. &QL;

KEALY HAS SUPPORTER ON NOTRE DAME SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN AND BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - ASU quarterback  &UR; Ryan Kealy didn't have many
supporters in Sun Devil Stadium by the end of his team's 28-9 loss
to Notre Dame. But he did have one on the Notre Dame sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Irish kicker  &UR; Jim Sanson, a former St. Mary's High School
teammate of Kealy, came to his defense after Kealy was booed by the
crowd and replaced by redshirt freshman  &UR; Chad Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   Sanson spoke with Kealy before the two teams left the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him to keep his head up,'' Sanson said. ``He's a
great quarterback. He's better than the guy they put in behind him.
I just can't believe they booed him like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanson knows what it's like to have the home fans on his back.
He even got death threats after missing an extra point against
Southern California two seasons ago. &QL; 
Grey matter &QL; 
Arizona State center  &UR; Grey Ruegamer is one of 12 finalists
announced Saturday for the Lombardi Award, given to the nation's
top college lineman.
</P>
<P>
   Four nominees are from the Big Ten, including Ohio State's  &UR; Andy
 &UR; Katzenmoyer, who was a finalist last season. Iowa defensive tackle
 &UR; Jared DeVries, Wisconsin offensive tackle  &UR; Aaron Gibson and
Michigan offensive tackle  &UR; John Jansen also are finalists.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA offensive tackle  &UR; Kris Farris is the Pac-10's other
representative. Three come from the Southeastern Conference:
defensive tackle  &UR; Ed Chester, of Florida; linebacker  &UR; Jevon Kearse
of Florida; and offensive tackle  &UR; Matt Stinchcomb, of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The other finalists are Texas A&AMP;M linebacker  &UR; Dat Nguyen, Texas
Tech end  &UR; Montae Reagor and Colorado State guard  &UR; Anthony Cesario.
</P>
<P>
   The finalists will be pared to four on Nov. 6, and the winner
will be announced Dec. 8. Nebraska's  &UR; Grant Wistrom won the award
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Ruegamer also is a candidate for the Outland Award. &QL; 
What's in a name? &QL; 
Notre Dame fullback  &UR; Joey Goodspeed carried only four times in the
game but led all rushers with 109 yards.
</P>
<P>
   But Goodspeed, a 6-foot, 241-pounder, got caught from behind on
his longest run, a 60-yard dash to the ASU 6-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm not as fast as I thought,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, the name is Goodspeed, not Greatspeed. &QL; 
A motto is born &QL; 
After the game, safety  &UR; A'Jani Sanders said of the Fighting Irish,
``A team that won't be beat, can't be beat.''
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that's sort of a motto the Irish adopted from
former Coach  &UR; Dan Devine, a Valley resident who once coached at ASU
and later led Notre Dame to a national championship in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a note from Coach Devine after we beat Purdue,'' said
Notre Dame Coach  &UR; Bob Davie. ``It said, `An old philosopher once
said that a team that won't be beat, can't be beat. And you just
made an old philosopher very proud. That was one of the greatest
comebacks I've ever seen.'
</P>
<P>
   ``We have kind of adopted that and taken that phrase to
heart.'' &QL; 
Quick hits &QL; 
 &UR; Stephen Trejo, who has been sidelined with a knee sprain, did not
play.
</P>
<P>
   When the power went out at Sun Devil Stadium, the advertisement
that was stuck on the scoreboard was for APS, ``the official power
source for Sun Devil Stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Notre Dame improved to 24-4 when playing an opponent for the
first time. &QL;

STAID 'CATS GET WILD AND WOOLY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ UCLA, the team that loves fast starts and trick
plays, got a dose of its own imagination Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Long known as a bastion of blandness, Arizona dipped into the
creative chapter of its playbook in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats used a fake punt to set up their first touchdown,
with punter Ryan Springston passing 35 yards to A.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   They used cornerback Chris McAlister as a tailback and receiver.
Once, McAlister took a pitch from quarterback Ortege Jenkins, ran a
few yards, then pitched it to tailback Kelvin Eafon.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, the Wildcats shifted to a no-huddle
offense, which propelled them to another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they ran several plays with quarterbacks Keith Smith
and Jenkins on the field together. Smith, a Newbury Park native,
was in a shotgun formation, while Jenkins lined up at receiver,
which he played last season before switching to quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't ask: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris, a
junior, has been bombarded by questions about his future.
Specifically: Will he turn pro after the season?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, he doesn't know. Farris will seek advice after
the season _ both from NFL general managers and the NFL Draft
Advisory Board _ and then decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farris is one of 10 finalists for the Lombardi Award, given to
the nation's top lineman. Other finalists include Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen.
Based on the Lombardi Award's initial press release, Farris has
little chance. His name was spelled ``Ferris.''
</P>
<P>
   __ It's good: Chris Sailer made his first field goal of the
season when he connected from 41 yards to give UCLA a 24-21 lead in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Saw it coming: Bruins coach Bob Toledo wasn't surprised by
the importance of Saturday's game. He had it pegged in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look on the schedule and put pinpoints on certain games,''
he said. ``I felt this would be our first one. I thought it would
be Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   Say what?: Lanky receiver Brian Poli-Dixon excels at making
difficult sideline catches; he thrusts one leg into the air while
dragging the other inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that, `Pee on the hydrant,' '' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fatherly advice: Toledo spoke with suspended tailback
Jermaine Lewis several times last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to make the decision because I feel bad for the
kid,'' he said. ``I told him he's like a son _ `I'm going to
discipline you, but I still love you.' I tell the (players), `Don't
make me have to discipline you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could be reinstated as early as Monday if Toledo
determines Lewis was acting in self defense when he fought Elonza
Malone III in the early hours of Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Game times: Saturday was the only night game on UCLA's
schedule. Kickoff for the Oregon game next week at the Rose Bowl is
12:30 p.m. The Bruins expect to know Monday if their Oct. 24 visit
to Cal starts at 12:30 or 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford game at the Rose Bowl on Halloween is either 12:30
or 3:30, depending on television. The three November games (at
Oregon State, at Washington, and USC) are all daytime kickoffs.
</P>
<P>
   __ Still waiting: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said he did
not speak to Miami AD Paul Dee last week about rescheduling the
canceled game for Dec. 5.

PLUCK OF THE IRISH OVERWHELMS KEALY  
 SUSPECT SECONDARY RISES TO CHALLENGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - It was evident from the first play of the game on
Saturday that Arizona State was ready to test a battered and often
beaten Notre Dame defensive secondary.
</P>
<P>
   And from that first play, when Fighting Irish cornerback Brock
Williams tipped away an underthrown Ryan Kealy bomb for Lenzie
Jackson, it was apparent the Notre Dame defense would pass that
test and every other the Sun Devils presented in a 28-9 victory at
Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came out on that first play, and threw long on
play-action because they knew we had to respect (ASU running back)
J.R. Redmond,'' said safety A'Jani Sanders. ``We knew that was
coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the day was over, the Irish had intercepted Kealy three
times _ including one that Sanders returned 25 yards for a
touchdown _ and forced the Sun Devils into a quarterback change.
</P>
<P>
   The Notre Dame run defense wasn't bad either, limiting Redmond
to 94 yards on 19 carries and the Sun Devils to 315 total yards.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Irish came into the game ranked 22nd in the country
by the Associated Press and 24th in the USA Today/ESPN coaches
poll, their defense was suspect. Notre Dame had yielded averages of
28 points and more than 400 yards a game.
</P>
<P>
   Opposing quarterbacks had racked up an average of 269 yards a
game and the Notre Dame defense, with two starting safeties out
because of injuries, had intercepted only two passes all season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our secondary just made plays,'' said cornerback Deveron
Harper. ``We made plays on their running game, too. We just stick
together and play hard.''
</P>
<P>
   About the only major mistake the Irish defensive backs made was
Harper's. With Notre Dame leading, 14-0, Kealy was hit while trying
to scramble and lost the ball on a third-down-and-10 play. The ball
landed at Harper's feet, and while his teammate and the Sun Devils
scrambled for the ball, Harper nonchalantly gave it a little shove
with the side of his foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the play was over,'' Harper said. ``I thought it was
an incomplete pass, and I was heading back to the sideline. I
thought we had them stopped on third down.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, there was a 15-yard penalty and an ASU first down. To
make matters worse, Kealy fired a 17-yard completion to Jackson,
who beat Harper on the right sideline.
</P>
<P>
   It eventually led to an ASU field goal and a heated tongue
lashing from Notre Dame Coach Bob Davie for Harper.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you want to know (what I said),'' Davie said,
laughing. ``We had a little disagreement. He saw things a little
different. Those little things can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for Harper, Davie didn't kill him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He let off a little steam,'' Harper said. ``I told him,
`Coach, look me in the eyes. I did not kick the ball
intentionally.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Davie called it ``a silly play'' later, but he didn't have many
reasons to complain about his club's defense. He expected ASU to
challenge his secondary and felt fortunate that the Sun Devils
didn't convert on the first play of the game. Jackson had a step on
Williams but had to wait for Kealy's pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew that was coming on that first play of the game,'' he
said. ``We play an eight-man front on first down, and we knew they
would be coming with that (long pass) right there. The ball may
have been a little under thrown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had something going right there. That could have been a
7-0 lead on the first play. Those are the little things that make
the difference.'' &QL;

KEALY'S PROG RESS INTER CEPTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB COHN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. Of all the nasty numbers concerning the mystifying
sophomore slump of Arizona State quarterback Ryan Kealy, here are
two that stand out _ seven and seven.
</P>
<P>
   Seven is how many interceptions Kealy threw all of last season
when he was the model of precision, breaking most of Jake Plummer's
freshman passing records.
</P>
<P>
   And seven is Kealy's interception total in only six games this
year after Notre Dame picked him off three times during its 28-9
victory over ASU on Saturday at Sun Devil Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interceptions, on a badly overthrown pass, was
returned 25 yards for a touchdown by free safety A'Jani Sanders to
give the Fighting Irish a 14-0 lead early in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, who appeared headed for stardom, might be headed for the
bench. He came out for redshirt freshman quarterback Chad Elliott
in the fourth quarter. The same thing happened last week during
ASU's loss to Southern California, with one difference. A
concussion forced Kealy to leave the USC game. This time, it was
his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Facing a bye week, which will enable the Sun Devils to try to
heal emotionally and physically and take stock of themselves, ASU
Coach Bruce Snyder was asked if he would look at the quarterback
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The prudent thing to do would be to look at everything,'' he
said. ``And the quarterback position falls into that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, who helped lead ASU to an 8-3 record and a Sun Bowl berth
in 1997, has the identical completion percentage (54.5) and almost
the same efficiency rating. But all those interceptions. And as the
Sun Devils fell to 2-4 to already exceed last year's loss total, he
has not shown the anticipated progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made some mistakes and paid for them,'' he said after the
game. ``It's my job to correct them.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy said he felt no effects from last week's knock in the head
against the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just me not playing well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy, a St. Mary's High School graduate reunited with his
former teammate, Notre Dame kicker Jim Sanson, was limited to a
brief question-and-answer session that lasted about five minutes.
But it could have gone an hour without him producing a ready
explanation for his inconsistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little baffling to me, personally,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He conceded, ``Probably, at times, I did tend to force the
ball.'' His analysis went no further.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy completed 13 of 22 passes for just 121 yards. There also
were two fumbled exchanges with center Grey Ruegamer, both
recovered by Kealy, one of which was caused by Ruegamer's wet
hands.
</P>
<P>
   If Kealy's confidence is lagging, coaches tried to snap him out
of it by calling a deep pass to wide receiver Lenzie Jackson on the
game's first play. The ball was slightly underthrown and barely
tipped away by cornerback Brock Williams. If Jackson had caught it,
he could have gone all the way, 76 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``That play was scripted,'' quarterbacks coach John Pettas said.
``We should have had that one. That was close. We thought we could
throw on them and then run.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU managed 315 yards against a defense giving up more than 400
a game.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Kealy's confidence has taken a hit, Pettas said, ``A
little bit, possibly, especially late in the game. We've got to
overcome it and end it. We had a lot of faith in him and still do.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been pressing a lot more in terms of trying to make plays
and carry the team and live up to expectations. What happens, I
think, is that when he struggles, he gets a little bit down. But we
know he's a talented kid. My job is to get it right.'' &QL;

DODGERS WON'T GET ALOU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Felipe Alou, whose strong character and quiet
manner made him the top candidate to become the Los Angeles
Dodgers' next manager, has decided to remain with the Montreal
Expos.
</P>
<P>
   New Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone learned Saturday night
that Alou will reject the club's offer of a multiyear contract
worth nearly $1 million per season to stay in Montreal, where he is
critical to the survival of the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not official, but that is where it is headed,'' Malone
said. ``I still think there is a glimmer of hope, but the situation
really became a quandary. All the qualities we like in Felipe as a
manager were the very reasons he is staying in Montreal. His
loyalty to that organization and the city are the reasons he is
staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone added that he already has spoken to Davey Johnson, who
managed a World Series championship team with the New York Mets in
1986 and led Cincinnati and Baltimore to division titles the past
three years.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, fired by the Orioles over differences with owner Peter
Angelos, was out of baseball this season. He draws almost universal
praise from his players, but is known to be abrasive with
superiors. Malone was an assistant GM in Baltimore last year when
the Orioles won the American League East title.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that is still early,'' said Malone, who hoped to have a
manager in place by the World Series, which begins next Saturday.
``There will be discussions this week.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone learned of Alou's intentions Saturday evening during a
telephone conversation. Malone returned to Los Angeles on Friday
night after spending three days with Alou near the manager's home
in the Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   It was there Malone and club president Bob Graziano made their
offer. Early Saturday, Alou flew to the Expos spring training base
in Jupiter, Fla., to meet with Montreal general manager Jim
Beattie.
</P>
<P>
   The two met twice. According to sources, Beattie failed to
convince Alou to stay until an evening dinner. The Expos guaranteed
they would double any contract offer made by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   That would put Alou's new contract at three years for almost $2
million per season, close to the three-year, $6 million deal Jim
Leyland signed last week with Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``But knowing Felipe, this was not about the money,'' Malone
said. ``This was about his family. His wife is from Montreal and he
felt a great commitment to that organization. I had great
confidence during our meetings that we could get a deal done. But I
think the Expos laid a pretty heavy guilt trip on him to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The cost-cutting Expos, who have lost money despite trading much
of their top talent in the past few years, could not afford to lose
Alou, the organization's most popular figure.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos are hoping to keep the club in Montreal by building a
downtown open-air ballpark to replace the ill-fitting Olympic
Stadium. After after years of trading players like Pedro Martinez,
Larry Walker and John Wetteland, they signed young stars Vladimir
Guerrero and Ugueth Urbina to long-term contract this year in an
attempt to build support.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal also hopes to infuse capital into the organzation by
adding several new members to their 11-man ownership committee. But
first it had to keep its manager.

MATOCK SAYS RECOVERY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC defensive tackle Marc Matock might have
provided the Trojans' only positive news Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Matock said he expected to speed up his recovery from the broken
ankle he suffered against Arizona State last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be six weeks, and I'll be back for the UCLA
game,'' Matock said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have told Matock to expect to be out eight weeks and
return only if USC makes a bowl game.
</P>
<P>
   Tailback Chad Morton (bruised back) did not suit up and watched
the game from the coaches' booth. He did not participate in pregame
warm-ups.
</P>
<P>
   __ Claiborne takes the blame: USC's best player, linebacker
Chris Claiborne, took responsibility for the 32-31 loss to
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm gonna take the blame for this one. Today, I didn't take
over the game,'' he said. ``Chris Claiborne didn't step up. I
didn't make a big play to change the game.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Lost in the shuffle: Wide receiver R. Jay Soward could have
been the game's star, if the Trojans had won the game.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had 229 all-purpose yards, highlighted by an 80-yard punt
return and a 77-yard touchdown reception. The punt return was
Soward's 20th play of 40 or more yards in his career, 16th play of
50 or more yards and fifth play of 80 or more yards.
</P>
<P>
   __ Another milestone: Last week, Arizona State's J.R. Redmond
became just the eighth back to gain more than 200 yards against
USC.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Cal wide receiver Dameane Douglas set a school
record and a USC opponent record with 13 receptions (151 yards).
</P>
<P>
   ``USC feels that their athletes can cover anyone one-on-one,''
Douglas said. ``They don't double anyone. I wanted to show I was
better than anyone they had.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Measure of revenge: USC tailback Petros Papadakis had a
65-yard touchdown run and a 41-yard run against his former school.
Papadakis spent a week at Cal in 1995 before transferring to USC.
</P>
<P>
   __ Oregon game time: USC officials said they expect the Oct. 24
game at Oregon to be a day game in Eugene. An official announcement
could come as early as Monday.

LUC PULLS KINGS UP IN OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDMONTON, Alberta - So far, so good, as the Los Angeles Kings
take their first tentative steps into the land of great
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   With a strong defensive effort and Luc Robitaille's goal with
4:35 remaining Saturday night, the Kings opened the new season with
a 2-1 victory over the Edmonton Oilers before a sellout crowd of
17,100 at Skyreach Centre.
</P>
<P>
   And the start of the season couldn't have come a moment sooner
for Kings coach Larry Robinson, whose team concludes its brief
season-opening trip Monday afternoon in Vancouver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four weeks of training camp can wear on you,'' Robinson said.
``It's kind of nice just to get going and start playing for real.''
</P>
<P>
   And as the Kings began playing for real, there were a few new
sights to be seen. For one, rookie left wing Josh Green made his
NHL debut, playing on a line with Robitaille and Yanic Perreault,
though at times he was replaced on the line during power plays by
Sandy Moger.
</P>
<P>
   The other new sight was that off veteran defenseman Garry Galley
sitting in the stands in favor of Philippe Boucher.
</P>
<P>
   In the early minutes of the new season, the Kings looked
somewhat burdened by their high hopes, even after Rob Blake
inaugurated the new year after 47 seconds with a thunderous
open-ice hit that left Edmonton left wing Andrei Kovalenko prone
for several minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Less than two minutes later, with the Kings scrambling in their
own end, Edmonton's Boyd Devereaux took a hit behind the net from
Ian Laperriere, but managed to pass the puck across the end boards
to teammate Kelly Buchberger. Former King Kevin Brown, unchecked to
the left of goalie Stephane Fiset, then swatted in Buchberger's
centering feed for a 1-0 Edmonton lead.
</P>
<P>
   Six minutes later it nearly became 2-0, when Kings defenseman
Steve Duchesne lost the puck in center ice, setting up a 2-on-1 for
the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   Only a brilliant split save by Fiset on a shot by Pat Falloon
kept the Kings within a goal, a deficit they overcame on a power
play a little more than two minutes later, when Perreault scored on
an eight-foot blast off a centering pass from Robitaille.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the Kings settled down for the rest of the first
period and through the scoreless second period, in which they
outshot the Oilers 11-5. Some of the Kings' finest shifts came from
their third and fastest line of Russ Courtnall, Craig Johnson and
Nathan LaFayette, which did a good job of neutralizing Edmonton's
edge in team speed.
</P>
<P>
   But the Kings were repeatedly frustrated by former Mighty Ducks
goalie Mikhail Shtalenkov, who entered the game in the second
period after Edmonton starter Bob Essensa departed after 20 minutes
with an ankle injury.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov, 32, has been well-traveled in the past few months.
First, he was left unprotected by the Ducks in the expansion draft
in June and selected by the Nashville Predators. Then on Oct.1, the
Predators dealt him to Edmonton in a five-player trade.
</P>
<P>
   Shtalenkov's play on Saturday made it clear why teams have
wanted him in the past few months, but left unclear why other teams
haven't felt the need to keep him around.
</P>
<P>
   Of the many big saves he made in the second period, two stood
out. Midway through the period, Shtalenkov made an acrobatic glove
save on a 35-foot Robitaille slap shot from the slot. Three minutes
later, he stuck out a pad to stop Johnson on a breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   Fiset had his moments, too, none better than when he sprawled
from one side of the crease to the other to block a wide-open shot
by Buchberger.
</P>
<P>
   The Kings' best chance to take the lead came early in the third,
when Oilers defenseman Craig Millar received a double minor for
high-sticking Moger. But the Kings failed to generate an attack,
and the advantage disappeared when Duchesne nearly coughed up the
puck and pulled down Todd Marchant to avoid a possible Oilers
breakaway.
</P>
<P>
   It took until overtime loomed for the Kings to get the
game-winner, a bang-bang play on which Perreault beat Josef Beranek
on a faceoff to Shtalenkov's right. The puck went to Robitaille in
the slot, and he blasted it into the Oilers' goal, building off his
strong exhibition season.
</P>
<P>
   After Robitaille's goal, the Oilers never seriously threatened
to tie the score, and the Kings won an opener for the first time
since beating the New York Islanders, 1-0, two years ago.

BETTER HOLD OFF ON THE HEISMANIA 
</HEADLINE>
  &HT;     (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
 &LR;  TUCSON, Ariz. _ ``Average'' never looked so bad.
<P>
   ``Average'' _ that's what an Arizona player called UCLA
quarterback Cade McNown a few days before the two top-10 teams
collided here.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins read the quotes in the paper, they must have
enjoyed a good laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Average''? Their favorite Heisman Trophy candidate?
</P>
<P>
   Then came Saturday night, and for the longest time, the Bruins
must have wished McNown was even as good as average.
</P>
<P>
   For the first 20 minutes, he was outpassed not only by Ortege
Jenkins and Keith Smith, the Arizona quarterbacks, but by Ryan
Springston, the Arizona punter.
</P>
<P>
   Springston completed a 35-yard pass to put Arizona at the 1 and
set up the game's first touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   McNown, meanwhile, finished the first quarter with two complete
passes in 10 tries, for 29 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He overthrew, threw behind and short-hopped receivers, forced a
couple of passes he was lucky not to have intercepted.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he rallied, and so did the Bruins, but their comeback and
eventual 52-28 victory in front of 58,738 fans had more to do with
freshman tailback DeShaun Foster than McNown.
</P>
<P>
   So it's time to ask:
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened to that Heisman Trophy campaign, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Is McNown's gold hat still in the ring?
</P>
<P>
   Is McNown lucky this game ended after the bedtime of most East
Coast voters and started after the bedtime of the rest?
</P>
<P>
   Or is McNown falling out of the race?
</P>
<P>
   There was more than the usual pressure on McNown in the game
that matched third-ranked UCLA against 10th-ranked Arizona with
national-title and Rose Bowl hopes on the line and the local fans
turned into a ``Red Siege'' by an everyone-wear-red promotion.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins played without Jermaine Lewis, the tailback who'd
rushed for 113 yards in one game, 94 yards in another, and eight
touchdowns in their 3-0 start. Lewis was suspended Tuesday pending
investigation of an off-campus fight.
</P>
<P>
   Add that to the weight on McNown's freckled shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McNown faced his first game of the season
against another high-rated quarterback. In this case !ital!two!off!
high-rated quarterbacks _ Jenkins, whose touchdown flip beat
20th-ranked Washington in the last seconds a week ago, and Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Add !ital!that!off! to the weight on McNown's freckled
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, McNown was being challenged verbally, his
Heisman credentials questioned.
</P>
<P>
   There was the bulletin-board material from Arizona
cornerback/receiver/tailback Chris McAlister.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looks like an average quarterback to me, personally,''
McAlister said to Tucson writers earlier in the week. ``I haven't
seen anything special about him.''
</P>
<P>
   And there were pointed remarks from UCLA head coach Bob Toledo,
who assessed McNown's 31-for-59 passing in the past two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been very average,'' Toledo said, describing him as ``out
of sync.''
</P>
<P>
   The point was, the senior quarterback had to pick up his game
for the Bruins to beat Arizona and, next week, 15th-ranked Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   First things first, Arizona figured to be tough on him. The
Wildcats had held quarterbacks under 45 percent three times in
their 5-0 start.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to see why. The Wildcats put the rush on McNown early
and often, hurrying his throws. At his best, McNown might have
overcome it, but this time he looked tentative.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had to find a way to take the heat off. They found it
in the form of Foster, a ballcarrier with wide shoulders and piano
legs, torso by Schwarzenegger and legs by Steinway.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the first quarter, on his first rush of the game, Foster
broke tackles and went 37 yards for a touchdown to make it 7-7.
Late in the half, he went 2 yards to make it 21-21.
</P>
<P>
   Foster went over the 100-yard mark shortly after the halftime
band's last note died. No longer could Arizona chase the
quarterback and lay off the tailback.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, McNown began the fourth quarter with nine completions
in 23 attempts for 107 yards, 14 of those on a touchdown pass and
run to Brian Poli-Dixon.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe Chris McAlister was right.
</P>
<P>
   He saw something before the rest of us. He saw ``average'' where
the rest of us saw ``Heisman.''
</P>
<P>
   If his cornerback/receiver/tailback career doesn't work out, the
Rams could use him as a scouting director. &QL;

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ For seven years, the Atlanta Braves have had a
formula for winning that has been fun to watch and always seemed to
work. But their magic may be wearing off.
</P>
<P>
   For the third straight game, the Braves were stifled by the San
Diego Padres. Saturday, San Diego did more than just beat Atlanta,
4-1, to take a 3-0 lead in the best-of-seven National League
Championship Series. The Padres did it at the expense of Greg
Maddux, the best pitcher in baseball in the '90s. But even a
four-time Cy Young Award winner can't win if his team doesn't score
a few runs.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Padres, who can wrap up their first World Series
appearance since 1984 with a win Sunday night, are beating the
Braves at their own game _ starting pitching. San Diego won Games 1
and 2, 3-2 and 3-0, as Alan Ashby and Kevin Brown were better than
John Smoltz and Tom Glavine. Saturday, the Padres only got five
innings out of lefthander Sterling Hitchcock. But by the time he
left, San Diego had a 2-1 lead it would not relinquish.
</P>
<P>
   The three-run homer has been hard to come by for the Braves.
Former sluggers David Justice and Fred McGriff now wear different
uniforms. The bench is weak and the offense is vulnerable to strong
pitching, which the Padres have shown the last three games. No team
in baseball history has rebounded from a 3-0 deficit to win in a
best-of-seven series.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shut us down,'' Braves manager Bobby Cox said. ``We had
good matchups going into situations and couldn't smell a hit. You
can't get going into bases-loaded situations every inning without
doing some damage.''
</P>
<P>
   After taking a 1-0 lead in the third inning, the Braves loaded
the bases in the fourth, sixth, and eighth and failed to score.
Meanwhile, San Diego scored twice off Maddux in the fifth with a
rally that was started by Hitchcock of all people. Little did the
62,779 in attendence at Qualcomm Stadium suspect the two-run rally
would be enough to beat Maddux, who was removed in the sixth for a
pinch hitter.
</P>
<P>
   With one out in the fifth, Hitchcock singled to left off Maddux,
who flied out with the bases loaded to end the fourth. Hitchcock
advanced to second on a grounder to the mound by Quilvio Veras.
Steve Finley followed with a double up the gap in left-center,
scoring Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves then intentionally walked Tony Gwynn. But the
strategy backfired as Ken Caminiti singled to center, scoring
Finley to give San Diego a 2-1 lead. The Padres scored two
insurance runs in the eighth off Rudy Seanez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maddux was really good,'' said Finley, who had 12 hits in 61
at-bats (.197) prior to Saturday against Maddux. ``He was moving
the ball in and out like he usually does. It's hard to pick up. I
just tried to see the ball, back it up, and put a swing on it.
Thank goodness, it got into the gap.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux would make no excuses. He wasn't upset that he was
removed from the game for a pinch hitter after throwing just 77
pitches. The club needed runs and pulled out all the stops in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the sixth inning and we had a chance to score some
runs,'' said Maddux. ``Was I surprised? No. We're not finished. We
have to bounce back. I'm aware no team has ever come back from 3-0.
But then no team has won seven in a row, either,'' referring to
Atlanta's seven straight division titles. ``It doesn't matter.
There's a first time for everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what is happening is natural. Teams are not scoring
runs in playoff games. The reason teams get to the playoff round is
that they have good pitching. Not just us. Other teams, too. That's
why they're up and after us, with their pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Padres say they understand the series is not over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to win and be ahead by three games,'' said manager
Bruce Bochy. ``I don't think you could ask for a better situation.
But we know this is a best-of-seven and there is still a lot of
baseball left. We have to be levelheaded out there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've relied on our pitching and defense all year.
Offensively, we haven't been as strong as we like. But last year,
we set a Padre record for runs scored and finished last. So it
shows you how important pitching has been to us.''

<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ UCLA tailback Jermaine Lewis' suspension was
greeted with indifference by Arizona coach Dick Tomey on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're just looking for an excuse to play DeShaun Foster,''
he cracked.
</P>
<P>
   Little did he know it, but Tomey's comment would symbolize
third-ranked UCLA's most impressive performance of the season, a
52-28 victory over No. 10 Arizona before 58,738 at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, not Heisman Trophy candidate Cade McNown or Arizona
flipmeister Ortege Jenkins, was the star.
</P>
<P>
   Subbing for Lewis, the true freshman gained 94 yards in the
first half and singlehandedly grabbed the momentum away from
Arizona's potent offense _ propelling the Bruins to their first win
here in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Foster scored on his first carry, a 37-yard run in which he
broke four tackles, and he had 103 yards in three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The victory, combined with Nebraska's loss, could vault UCLA to
No. 2 nationally. It improved the Bruins to 4-0, 2-0 in the Pac-10,
setting up a critical game against Oregon on Saturday in the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Foster's performance helped offset Jermaine Lewis' suspension
and another subpar game by Bruins quarterback Cade McNown, who
completed 9 of 23 passes in three quarters.
</P>
<P>
   However, McNown made one of the game's biggest plays, connecting
with Danny Farmer on a 64-yard touchdown pass with 11:18 remaining
for the 38-28 lead. It was McNown's 50th career touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to past Tucson visits, UCLA wasn't worried about
matching Arizona's physicality. Instead, coach Bob Toledo was most
concerned with eliminating the mistakes (especially penalties) that
are often the difference in tight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``More games are lost than won, and we can't go in and lose
it,'' he said. ``We can't get sacked. We can't (commit) turnovers.
We can't get penalties or give up big plays or (make mistakes in)
the kicking game.''
</P>
<P>
   Although UCLA made no mistakes in the first half, the Bruins
seemed taken aback by Arizona's aggressiveness. The Wildcats used
several trick plays and odd formations _ including quarterbacks
Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins on the field together _ but it was
their attacking defense that gave UCLA tons of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats blitzed every chance they got and continually
disrupted McNown's rhythm. He completed two of his first 10 passes
and didn't find a groove until Foster forced Arizona to respect the
run: he gained 94 yards on 10 carries in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona jumped to a 7-0 lead with the help of a trick play.
Facing a fourth-and-7 from UCLA's 36, Wildcats punter Ryan
Springston heaved a long pass down the left sideline to A.J. Brown.
The ball was beyond Bruins cornerback Julius Williams and Foster,
the punt returner who raced over when Springston threw. Brown made
a diving catch at the 1, and two plays later Kelvin Eafon scored.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats made the first mistake, as receiver Dennis
Northcutt fumbled on the ensuing possession.
</P>
<P>
   McNown threw two incompletes, then hit Danny Farmer for 23 yards
to advance to the Arizona 37. One play later, Foster charged over
right end, broke four tackles and raced into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had quelled Arizona's momentum _ but only for a
moment. Two plays later, Jenkins connected with Trung Canidate on a
short crossing pattern into open field, and Canidate ran 74 yards
down the left side to UCLA's 4. Eafon scored again for a 14-7 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The pace slowed as the teams exchanged punts. But on UCLA's
first possession of the second quarter, McNown ran the option for
12 yards, then Foster galloped for 20. A personal foul (late hit)
on Arizona cornerback Chris McAlister pushed UCLA into the red
zone, where it rarely misfires. On third down, McNown found Brian
Poli-Dixon, a Tucson native, on a quick-hitting screen. He broke
one tackle, then glided into the end zone to tie the game 14-14.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats responded with a time-consuming, 80-yard drive of
their own. The key play was a fabulous one-handed catch by
Northcutt on a well-thrown pass from Smith. The reception gave
Arizona possession at the Bruins 17. On the next play Smith, with
plenty of time to throw, found Jeremy McDaniel for a 21-14 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Their offense finding its rhythm, the Bruins countered with
their most impressive drive. It included an 18-yard shovel
(underhand) pass from McNown to tight end Ryan Neufeld. Foster took
care of the final 13 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bruins cornerback Ryan Roques intercepted Jenkins early in the
third quarter _ Roques' third pick of the season _ and ran 39 yards
to Arizona's 19. From there, the Bruins went backwards, eventually
needing a 41-yard field goal from Chris Sailer to take a 24-21
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Unfazed, the Wildcats moved downfield easily, and Jenkins hit
McDaniel on a 31-yard touchdown pass. McDaniel made the catch in
full extension at the goal line _ certainly the play of the game.

PADRES LEVELHEADED DESPITE LOPSIDED LEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN DIEGO _ They're saying all the right things, and who
wouldn't?
</P>
<P>
   I mean, holy moley, the Padres are up three-and-oh. No one ever,
anywhere, at any time or any place, has ever come back from a 3-0
deficit in this sport. But you're not going to get anyone in the
San Diego camp to say anything that would have the slightest chance
of either a) stirring up the Atlanta Braves, or b) fooling around
with the karma.
</P>
<P>
   And it's a funny thing about this never-ever business. For if
there is one sport in which no one should be surprised if a team
were to come back from 0-and-3 to win four straight, it's baseball,
right? All you need is four well-pitched games, a timely hit or
two, a little luck, and, who knows?
</P>
<P>
   The Padres know. Trust me. They know.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to win one more game,'' sighed San Diego general
manager Kevin Towers, ``and that's not going to be easy. You're
looking at (Denny) Neagle, (John) Smoltz, (Tom) Glavine, and (Greg)
Maddux. Those four guys could sweep you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you could ask for a better situation,'' agreed
manager Bruce Bochy. ``But there's still baseball left, and we have
to be levelheaded about this. It's a good feeling, but we have to
go out there and get number four.''
</P>
<P>
   They will get it if they continue to do the same things they've
done to win numbers one, two, and three, all of which have included
a formula mix of superb starting pitching, brilliant relief
pitching, good fielding when needed, and just enough hitting to
make sure they're in the lead when Trevor Hoffman jogs in from the
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman saved Saturday's 4-1 victory with 1 1/3 innings of
shutout relief. When the Padres lead after eight, it's the donest
deal in sport. They haven't lost a game in that situation since
July 24, 1996, and Trevor Hoffman is the reason.
</P>
<P>
   But in order to get to that situation they need help from other
people, most of whom have no need for bodyguard help as they stroll
the mean streets of America. 'Fess up, now. If you heard that Donne
Wall or Dan Miceli walked into the restaurant while you were
ordering, would you even look up from the menu? They might as well
be in the Baseball Witness Protection Program, which is what
happens when you play your games out here, in the Land That TV
Forgot.
</P>
<P>
   Wall and Miceli, both righthanders, are two of Hoffman's set-up
guys, and the team wouldn't be here without them. The latter was
10-5 this season. The former was 5-4, with a 2.46 ERA, and in this
series he has been immense. He saved Game 1 for Hoffman and
Saturday he extricated the ballclub from a bases-loaded, none-out
jam in the sixth by striking out pinch hitters Michael Tucker and
Greg Colbrunn on breathtaking changeups.
</P>
<P>
   For this, Mr. Towers can take a bow, because he got both of them
in the same deal. Now that's some savvy GMing.
</P>
<P>
   Who outside of fine-print fanatics was paying attention last
Nov. 19 when Towers sent Tim Worrell and Trey Beamon to Detroit for
Messrs. Wall and Miceli? I sure wasn't. And yet it is moves like
this which so often turn out to be key in the construction of
pennant-winning teams. It isn't always a matter of throwing $75
million at a superstar. This is a 25-man game. Never forget that
Ken Griffey Jr. and Alex Rodriguez may very well be the two best
players in baseball, and look where the Mariners are today.
</P>
<P>
   Towers had his eye on the 31-year-old Wall for a long time. ``I
liked him when he was the pitcher of the year in the Pacific Coast
League,'' he said. ``We put a waiver claim in on him last year when
he went from Houston to Cincinnati, but we couldn't get him. They
sent him right over to Detroit, and then we were able to make the
deal. He's a guy with ice water in his veins.''
</P>
<P>
   Miceli, according to Towers, is a ``bulldog.'' Towers needed no
briefing on him, since the GM was in Pittsburgh three years ago
when Miceli was busy saving 21 games for a bad team. ``He's got a
closer's mentality,'' Towers said.
</P>
<P>
   If any casual fan knows anyone on the Padres, it is Tony Gwynn,
and maybe _ maybe _ Greg Vaughn, who hit the most anonymous and
instantly forgotten 50 home runs in baseball history. Ken Caminiti?
Maybe. He did, after all, win the 1996 MVP award.
</P>
<P>
   The shortstop? It's Chris Gomez, and, no, he's not from San
Pedro de Marcoris or Maracaibo. He was born and raised in
California. Oh, and the catcher? You have any idea who Carlos
Hernandez is?
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hernandez is another Towers coup. Towers signed him as a
minor league free agent in 1996 after he had spent parts of seven
seasons backing up the likes of Mike Piazza. In AL eyes, he's just
a box score line. ``He's done a great job for us,'' Towers said.
``He calls a good game. He stops the running game. And he's had
many big hits for us this year.'' Hernandez was 2 for 4 with a run
scored in Game 1 and he had a damaging eighth-inning double
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres are in their current position _ one win from the
World Series _ because they have simply been better than Atlanta in
every phase of the game. There has been nothing wrong with the
vaunted Atlanta starting pitching (5 earned runs in 18 innings),
except that San Diego's has been better (2 earned runs in 21
innings). The Padres aren't smacking the ball around, but they've
done enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitchers have really been clutching it up,'' said center
fielder Steve Finley. ``They've just been dominating. And the
hitters have done just enough to stay ahead until Trevor comes
in.''
</P>
<P>
   And the San Diego unknowns have done more than the Atlanta
unknowns. Let's not forget that.
</P>
<P>
   So it's 3-0. That's very nice, but now's the time to heed Yogi's
Law, the one which holds that the struggle is not terminated until
it's, well, terminated. ``These guys have been around,'' said
Bochy. ``They know how good Atlanta is.''
</P>
<P>
   That's as close to inflamed rhetoric as you're going to get from
this bunch.

YANKEES PULL EVEN WITH INDIANS

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Orlando Hernandez, taught as a child in Cuba to fear
and loathe the Yanquis, did his part to save the New York Yankees
Saturday night in a 4-0 win over the Cleveland Indians that tied
the American League Championship Series at two games apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Just as his younger brother Livan did a year ago for the Florida
Marlins against these same Indians, El Duque turned the national
pastime into a showcase for Cuban defectors, demonstrating the same
mix of composure, cunning, and command that made his brother the
World Series MVP.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I should just go ahead and trade for them all,'' said
Indians general manager John Hart. ``Intercept the boat.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez gave up just three hits in seven innings and allowed
just one runner as far as third base, putting the Yankees back in
position to seize control of this series with ace David Wells
scheduled to pitch Game 5 this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a must-win situation, no doubt about it,'' said shortstop
Omar Vizquel, who had three of the Indians' four hits. ``Live or
die.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow is the most important game. David Wells is on the
mound at 4 o'clock. It will be tough to see the ball anyway.
Against that guy, every little mistake will count.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with what outfielder Paul O'Neill described as a
``dangerous situation,'' the Yankees rallied behind a pitcher
forced to survive much graver perils just to get here, a man who
left family and friends behind the day after Christmas last year
when he set off on a raft from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called him this morning,'' said his agent, Joe Cubas, who
had engineered the defection of Livan Hernandez from the Cuban
national team while it was in Mexico, ``and I said, `You know that
God puts people in difficult situations, but always situations they
can handle. He's done that to you many different times. You guys
are down, everybody is down, but you're going to pull them through
this.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool? That's this guy's demeanor. This guy had to risk his
life in the Florida Straits. Pitching for him is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   While Hernandez held the Indians in check, striking out Jim
Thome and Manny Ramirez in succession in both the fourth and sixth
innings, the latter occasion with two runners on base, the Yankees
generated just enough offense to take a 3-0 lead against Doc
Gooden.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill hit a first-inning home run to give the Yankees a 1-0
lead, then opened the fourth with the first of two consecutive
walks issued by Gooden. Designated hitter Chili Davis then dropped
an opposite-field, ground-rule double just inside the left-field
foul line to score O'Neill to make it 2-0, and Tino Martinez, the
Yankees' slump-ridden first baseman, followed with a sacrifice fly
that scored Bernie Williams, making it 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez's fly ball generated another controversial call when
second-base umpire Jim McKean ruled that Indians center fielder
Kenny Lofton dropped the ball, even though replays showed Lofton's
drop came as he was transferring the ball from his glove to his
throwing hand after the catch had been made.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez reached first on the error, but Gooden avoided further
damage when Jorge Posada flied out and Chad Curtis tapped into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees added a final run in the ninth when Martinez hit an
opposite-field double off reliever Dave Burba, a hit that ended his
0-for-19 streak in ALCS play, and pinch runner Homer Bush advanced
on a wild pitch and scored on Scott Brosius's sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen Doc better,'' Indians manager Mike Hargrove said,
``but Doc certainly threw well enough to win tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden was part of the Yankees' run to a World Series title in
1996, throwing a no-hitter after Yankees owner George Steinbrenner
gave him a chance to salvage his career when it appeared
drug-related suspensions had brought it to an end. But Saturday
night, he was unable to end his legacy of never having won a
postseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden has two Cy Young Awards and is a four-time All-Star, but
in 10 postseason starts for the Mets (seven times), Yankees (once),
and Indians (twice), he has never come away with a victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of frustrating,'' said Gooden, who was ejected four
batters into his last start, against the Red Sox in the Division
Series, and was lifted with two out in the fifth Saturday night
after throwing 92 pitches. ``A lot of different things have
happened. Pitch good, and get outpitched, a lot of no-decisions. I
just have to look forward to the next opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez dodged an early bullet in the first inning, when with
two on and two out Thome's bid for a home run died on the warning
track in right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez set down nine Indians in a row until Vizquel lined a
single over shortstop Derek Jeter's head in the sixth and David
Justice was hit by a pitch. That brought up the iron of the
Indians' order _ Ramirez and Thome _ and Vizquel did his best to
distract Hernandez by stealing third while Hernandez held the ball
on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get him out of focus when I stole third and he lost
his head a little bit,'' Vizquel said, ``but then the coach (Mel)
Stottlemyre came out and said, `Don't worry about that guy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez answered with his finest moment, setting Ramirez and
Thome down on strikes, Thome with a 3-and-2 changeup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, he really surprised me,'' Vizquel said. ``He's never
been in this situation before, but he made great pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, it was suggested, the Indians should think about
getting their own Cuban-made pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel smiled. ``There aren't many with that talent. Livan has
a little more velocity, more of a power pitcher, but El Duque, he
knows how to pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a cool one, right there.''

   CLEVELAND _ Pressure? Are you kidding?
</P>
<P>
   Pitching to keep your team in a game, in a championship series,
in front of an international television audience and 45,000
unfriendly spectators is not pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez knows real pressure. Pressure is
making $8.75 a month, living in a one-room, cinderblock apartment
in Havana while your country denies you the right to do what you do
best. Pressure is the constant threat of arrest because the leaders
of your country think you might defect, just as your half-brother
did. Pressure is hopping aboard a 20-foot makeshift wooden sailboat
last December with seven friends and relatives, bound for freedom.
Pressure is running aground 10 hours later, somewhere in the
Bahamas, and living on seaweed and conch for three days awaiting
rescue.
</P>
<P>
   El Duque has been through all of the above. So how was he going
to get rattled by the Cleveland Indians and/or the expectations of
the Yankee fandom and its maniacal owner?
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban righty with the high kick beat the Indians, 4-0, with
seven-plus innings of three-hit pitching Saturday night at Jacobs
Field. The win evened the American League Championship Series at
2-2 and the 114-win Yankees hope to regain the lead with David
Wells on the mound this afternoon. Saturday night's game was even
more dramatic than Livan Hernandez's heroics for the world champion
Florida Marlins last October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had pressure but I had no fear,'' Hernandez said through an
interpreter. ``I have been through many difficult times in my life
on and off the field and I knew I would be able to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very relaxed, very determined,'' said Yankees manager
Joe Torre. ``A playoff game is a playoff game, just like a walk in
the park for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were tense before Saturday night's Game 4. All the
pressure had shifted to the Pinstripers and there were questions
about New York's ability to deal with adversity, which it was
facing for the first time all year.
</P>
<P>
   And then along came El Duque, the Tiant-esque, high-sock,
low-cap righthander who pitched his last playoff game at Estadio
Latinoamericano in Havana. Under the flag of Cuba, he hurled 10
seasons for Havana's Industriales, but was kicked off the team in
October of '96 for allegedly plotting to defect (Livan Hernandez
defected in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   After crashlanding on Anguilla Cay (an island off Bermuda),
Hernandez and his companions were spotted by a helicopter, and a US
Coast Guard cutter was radioed. The group was initially detained by
local authorities, but Hernandez and his common-law wife acquired
humanitarian visas and took up residence in Costa Rica. Once there,
he was free to sign a $6.6 million contract with the Yankees, the
favorite team of his childhood. He went 6-0 at Triple A, then went
12-4 with a 3.13 ERA in 21 starts with the musclebound Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees needed him desperately in Game 4. It was 57 degrees
at game time and there were fears that El Duque might have trouble
with the cold. Nonsense. It was probably pretty cold on that boat
last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Paul O'Neill staked Hernandez to a 1-0 lead with a homer in the
first. El Duque gave up a single to Omar Vizquel in the first and a
double to Kenny Lofton in the third, but was not truly threatened
until the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Leading, 3-0, Hernandez surrendered a one-out single to Vizquel,
then hit David Justice. The crowd howled, but El Duque never lost
his cool, not even when Vizquel stole third while he wasn't looking
and danced down the line while he pitched to the heart of
Cleveland's order. No problem. El Duque fanned Manny Ramirez and
Jim Thome to get out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   He needed only 10 pitches in a rocking-chair seventh, then was
pulled when he walked No. 9 batter Enrique Wilson to start the
eighth. New York's bullpen (Mike Stanton and Mariano Rivera) did
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he (Hernandez) was very good,'' said Cleveland
manager Mike Hargrove. ``I don't know that he missed any spots all
night long. He threw tough pitches when he had to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   According to some records, Sunday is Hernandez's 29th birthday,
but many of his countrymen believe he is closer to 33. He certainly
pitched like a veteran against Cleveland. Too bad the Communist
Party newspaper will pretend the game never happened. El Duque's
two daughters, still in Cuba, may not hear of their dad's
achievement.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Pettitte, who was rocked for four homers in Game 3 Friday,
would be in turn to pitch a potential seventh game in this series,
but Torre would almost certainly come back with El Duque if there's
a deciding game in New York Wednesday night. And then we might have
a Hernandez brother winning a postseason MVP award for the second
straight season.

GALAXY'S SHOW ISN'T ENOUGH

<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ Octavio Zambrano made his point. If there
were any doubts about the best team in Major League Soccer's West,
they were washed away Friday night by a brilliant Los Angeles
Galaxy performance in the opener of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   It counted for nothing, as it turned out.
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Fire, taking advantage of the best opportunity it
was given all night, took control of the best-of-three series by
using a late free kick to earn a 1-0 triumph before 25,107 at the
Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Marsch's rebound of Lubos Kubik's curling shot in the 86th
minute tacked a dramatic finish to a tense battle defined by the
Galaxy's almost complete control of the match and their inability
to penetrate a flawless Fire defense.
</P>
<P>
   And so the series heads to Chicago, with the Galaxy needing a
victory Friday to keep alive its hopes of playing in MLS Cup '98.
</P>
<P>
   The match turned on Kubik's free kick from 22 yards, created
when L.A. defender Steve Jolley, tangling with Chris Armas for a
loose ball outside the L.A. box, tripped his former teammate. Kubik
sent the free kick around the Galaxy wall, and goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman's diving save sent the ball to Marsch, racing in from the
left. Marsch shot past Hartman to the far side of the net.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy nearly forced a shootout in the final minute, when
Martin Machon's bicycle kick in the goalmouth _ after a Carlos
Hermosilli shot from a corner kick _ flew just wide to the left.
</P>
<P>
   It was a strategic battle !ital!par excellence!off!, a tense and
thrilling war of wills in which little, on the surface, actually
happened.
</P>
<P>
   That masked a surprisingly entertaining match, contested almost
entirely in midfield and in front of Chicago's goal. The Galaxy
owned the ball most of the match, and neither team offered many
surprises. L.A., patiently trying to find seams in Chicago box,
paths to the Fire goal, played beautiful possession soccer, weaving
geometric patterns across the field.
</P>
<P>
   They were able to do so by winning most of the midfield battles
and playing superb team defense. Credit, again, Danny Pena and
Martin Machon, who allowed the Fire few options when they possessed
the ball, and Mauricio Cienfuegos, who adapted to Chris Armas'
shadowing with quick play.
</P>
<P>
   All the brilliant ball movement meant little near the Fire's
goal. There was no space to exploit, and the Galaxy's attempts to
draw the Fire out of their shell were fruitless. Chicago, as
always, maintained perfect shape, perfect organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy managed just three first-half shots and 11 over 90
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Fire, which took only five, didn't get a shot off until the
50th minute, but they were unfortunate not to score when they
finally got one. It came from an error by rookie defender Joe
Franchino, who tried to head a Francis Okaroh cross out of the L.A.
box and instead gave it to Marsch, standing just a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Marsch tried to step around Franchino, and in doing so put the
ball on Armas' path, maybe eight yards from the net. Armas' blast
cleared the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's best chances arrived about five minutes later, both
Carlos Hermosillo feeds for Welton. The first, in the 56th, was a
throughball into the Chicago box. Welton streaked past goalkeeper
Zach Thornton, but Josh Wolff stepped between the Galaxy forward
and the ball, which he knocked over the end line.
</P>
<P>
   A minute later, Welton got a touch on a Hermosillo cross from
the right wing but couldn't put it on target.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. managed just two more shots from within Chicago's box, both
by substitute midfielder Wellington Sanchez, who blasted one ball
into a defender and sent a turn-and-volley at Thornton.
</P>
<P>
   If the Galaxy wins in Chicago, the series will return to the
Rose Bowl on Oct. 21 for the decisive third game.

BRUINS GO FOR KNOT IN OPENER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was a night of glitter, stars, and history as the
Bruins opened their 75th National Hockey League season Saturday
night at the FleetCenter. Before the game, Bobby Orr, Derek
Sanderson, former voice of the Bruins Bob Wilson, and ex-coach Don
Cherry participated in the festivities that featured pyrotechnics
and a laser show.
</P>
<P>
   Past meets present. Last year's coach of the year Pat Burns and
rookie of the year Sergei Samsonov were honored for last season's
achievements that they hope will translate into this season's
success.
</P>
<P>
   As warm and fuzzy as the ceremonies were, the contest itself was
a ragtag coaches' nightmare that ended in a 3-3 tie as Boston
battled back from a two-goal deficit twice to earn the point.
</P>
<P>
   Goalie Byron Dafoe kept the Bruins in the game throughout,
stopping 21 shots while Grant Fuhr made 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the opening jitters got to everybody,'' said Burns,
whose team was defensively challenged the entire night. ``We came
along better after. They're a big team. I didn't realize they were
that big. They were beating us on the boards a little bit. Their
size definitely came into play there at one point but our speed
started picking up and we found a way to get a point and tie the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   While Dafoe was one of the heroes another was enforcer Ken
Baumgartner, who scored his first goal (No. 13 in his career in 628
games) since Jan. 17, 1996, that turned out to be the tying goal at
3:17 of the third.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins got off to a rocky start. Just 2:30 into the game,
former Boston College star Marty Reasoner charged in on a
two-on-one with Pascal Rheaume. Reasoner snapped a shot from the
inside edge of the right circle that Dafoe knocked down with his
glove. It was a harbinger of things to come.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe had no chance on the Blues' first goal at 8:59. Al
MacInnis, who has one of the hard-est slappers in the league, teed
up a shot from just inside the blue line at the right point and
blistered it at the net. It went off Blues' enforcer Tony Twist and
deflected past Dafoe for the 1-0 lead. Baumgartner later noted that
not only was it the first time he and Twist, who had just his ninth
career goal in 383 games, scored on the same night but it happened
in a game in which neither had a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Dafoe was equally blameless on the second St. Louis goal, scored
on the power play when left wing Pavol Demitra banged in a
back-door shot from the left post at 16:07. The Bruins got one back
two minutes later on the power play. Samsonov took a pass from
center Jason Allison down low. From behind the net, he backhanded a
pass to Steve Heinze, who beat Fuhr from in front at 18:19.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins had a goal nullified at 2:02 of the second. Pronger
committed a kneeing penalty and play continued with defenseman Don
Sweeney shooting from the left circle. Antti Laaksonen beat Fuhr on
the rebound from the crease but it appeared the whistle had blown
prior to the goal, despite the fact that Boston had puck possession
the entire time.
</P>
<P>
   ``He blew the whistle,'' said Burns of referee Blaine Angus,
when asked what he was told about the non-goal. ``Why, I don't
know. Only (baseball) umpires I see give press conferences, our
guys don't. Maybe it's time. He said he blew the whistle because I
guess he thought (the Bruins) lost the puck. He didn't come over
and tell me. He'd be over at the bench all night long.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blues regained the two-goal edge at 13:31 when they took
advantage of a Bruins' turnover at the offensive blue line. Demitra
went in on a breakaway and beat Dafoe with a backhander to make it
3-1. Boston started the climb back at 17:08 on the power play.
Samsonov took the puck from Heinze behind the net, skated it right
to left, and curled into the left circle around a pick from
Allison. He let his shot fly and when Fuhr stopped it, he went into
the crease after it and whacked at it again. It went in off
MacInnis and the Bruins were within one, 3-2, setting the stage for
Baumgartner's heroics when he took advantage of a Fuhr miscue. He
scored unassisted on a backhand shot. Even Burns couldn't suppress
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   But Burns won't be laughing if his club has to rely on Dafoe
every game to save it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Byron Dafoe kept us in the game the whole time,'' said Burns.
``We were making some awful mistakes. I think the puck weighed
about 10 pounds there for awhile. We were getting a lot of passes
intercepted.''

OPENING NIGHT WAS REVIVAL FOR BRUINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ The Bruins moved ahead with a new season Saturday
night _ an interesting 3-3 tie with the St. Louis Blues _ but not
without first looking back fondly at their past.
</P>
<P>
   Boston's hockey team turns 75 years old this season and Opening
Night on Causeway Street began with some laser lights and fireworks
and also included a parade of former Black 'n Gold heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Now beginning their fourth season in the Vault, the city's
biggest and richest ATM, the Bruins trotted out Bobby Orr, their
ageless icon, to help in handing Sergei Samsonov the rookie of the
year award. No. 4 picked up assists from Derek Sanderson and Ray
Bourque, with the Causeway crowd shaking the roof over Orr's
appearance as Samsonov clutched the chrome.
</P>
<P>
   One faithful baby boomer in the crowd held high an old
black-and-gold sweater with ``ORR 4 EVER'' on its back. Samsonov,
who received the Calder in the league's June award ceremonies at
Toronto, posed for pictures with his distinguished Boston brethren.
</P>
<P>
   But all eyes, as usual, were on Orr. He was his trademark humble
self, chin tucked, looking embarrassed by the attention. He scooted
in on the heels of Sanderson, with emcee Bob Wilson wasting little
time during introductions _ no doubt at Orr's prompting. Nearly a
quarter-century has passed since Orr laced 'em up for the Bruins,
but he remains the eternal object of the Hub's affection.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the occasional championship won by the Celtics _ the
local entry in the currently-defunct-but-does-anyone-notice NBA _
we live in a relentless hail of pro sports disappointments in Our
Town. The latest chapter in the book of torture, of course, played
out last weekend at Fenway Park when the Red Sox went charging into
the postseason war, only to find their wild card was a joker. Hey,
how were they to know they'd have to send nine guys to the plate
and not four?
</P>
<P>
   Orr is symbolic of a time when we thought it was OK to win, when
we expected good things happened to those who wait ... and wait ...
and wait some more. Now when we sense victory we instantly are
overwhelmed by the fetid stench of doom. Bill Buckner. Bucky Dent.
Too many men on the ice. One too many Parcells in New Orleans. Petr
Klima. Outchamagoucha.
</P>
<P>
   In Orr's day, the Bruins should have won, and they did win, and
he remains that everlasting link to getting it done when it's there
to do.
</P>
<P>
   Until someone serves up a fresh batch of feel-good memories
(inhale deeply here, folks, and hold it until your fingers and toes
turn blue), Orr will own the Boston patent on pure joy.
</P>
<P>
   Former Bruins coach Don Cherry also received a warm hand from
the Vault faithful. Grapes presented Pat Burns with the Jack Adams
coach of the year award.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry was dressed to the nines, as usual, with starched white
collar matching his mustache and goatee. He looks like a character
peeled from a pouch of fine pipe tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   The video screen flashed images of Cherry in his days behind the
Boston bench. Twenty years ago, as it turned out, Cherry was
entering his last season with the Bruins, it all ending in a clash
of egos with general manager Harry Sinden. No coach in Boston since
has been Cherry's equal for showmanship, theatrics, engaging the
media. Parcells was close. Mike Milbury was a smart guy who
cleverly worked at acting crude (witness: the tirade he launched
Bob Johnson's way in the '91 playoffs), but true crazies don't come
in Armani suits. Cherry was a character _ sometimes with a little
too much salt, mind you, especially in how he viewed the early wave
of European players. You might have loved him. You might have hated
him. In all likelihood it was one or the other, nothing in between.
</P>
<P>
   Burns is a character, too, but not in Cherry's league. Times are
different. Money is huge. Burns makes about $750,000 a year, about
seven times what Cherry made. Burns gets heated up now and then and
lashes out with an emotional thunderclap. Then it's over.
</P>
<P>
   Cherry was forever stirring it up, pushing buttons, kicking over
rocks, making himself a cult hero here _ an act he later refined
and turned into a fortune on Canadian television. Nutcases like
Grapes can't land big jobs today. The business is self-important
and believes it is too refined. It is, in fact, too refined for its
own good. A couple of nutcases would go a long way in putting a
little character back in the product.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new hockey season has dawned in the old West End.
The Hub's hockey hopes spring eternal. The Bruins haven't won the
Cup since John Bucyk rhumbaed around Madison Square Garden in '72,
but that drought didn't prevent a sellout 17,565 from pledging
their allegiance once more to the Great Bear Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   How good will they be? Is this the year? Will Bourque one day
rock on his front porch the way a great old hockey man should,
clutching a picture of himself holding that Cup, his cheekbones
chiseled and chafed?
</P>
<P>
   For those answers and more, read these pages in the days, weeks,
and months to come. The first night is now history, will all the
rest be?

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It took 89 games and a little digging under Grant
Fuhr's blocker, but Bruins wing Ken Baumgartner finally showed his
scoring punch, rather than his knockout punch, Saturday night at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   And his first goal in a Boston uniform couldn't have come at a
better time, 3:17 into the final period that lifted the Bruins into
a 3-3 standoff with St. Louis on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   It was Baumgartner's first goal since the 1995-96 season, ``at
least 200 games ago,'' by his own count and just his 13th
regular-season goal in 628 National Hockey League games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the happiest moment of his career here and probably the
happiest moment of mine,'' said Bruins coach Pat Burns.
</P>
<P>
   It had been all uphill for the Bruins until the Bomber's
hustling forechecking effort and it's fair to say the 32-year-old
veteran, who played for Burns in Toronto, had never been so crowded
in along the boards as he was by the media at his locker Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   After all, this was an occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell it's been awhile since I've had this much
attention over one goal,'' he said. ``It was a big one. We'll take
the point. It wasn't our best effort, we have some things to work
on, so when it can be timely, it's helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing fancy about the key play, or even a hint, at
first, that the Bruins would even threaten in the Blues zone. But
when St. Louis defenseman Marc Bergevin slid the puck toward Fuhr,
Baumgartner did his best to create a little confusion by rushing
straight at the goalie in hopes that the puck had not been tied up.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't, and, said Baumgartner, ``I don't know if Fuhr was
about to clear it, but I stayed there and it was loose and I was
able to put it in the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes if you put pressure on people, they'll do things
that they wouldn't if you just waited for them at the blue line.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner's offensive fireworks put the finishing touch on an
evening of fireworks at the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of energy in the building,'' he said, ``but
one of these days, they'll realize you can't set off fireworks
indoors. It was about the second period before you could see across
the ice. There were some legends in the building. It was a great
night for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   And a memorable one for Baumgartner, because his poke and shot
marked the second goal he's scored against Fuhr, ``the only goalie
in the NHL I've scored two on. He's not a bad guy to have that
record against.''
</P>
<P>
   His other goal against Fuhr, Baumgartner said, came on a slap
shot. His most recent goal, he recalled, ``was a game-winner,''
against Winnipeg Jan. 17, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably the active leader (for consecutive games
without a goal),'' he said with a grin, ``but I am no longer.''
</P>
<P>
   On a night when neither of the team's tough guys, Tony Twist of
the Blues and the Bruins' Baumgartner, dropped their gloves, both
players scored goals. Twist opened the scoring and Baumgartner
closed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew good things were about to happen when I saw Twist get
one,'' he said. ``I couldn't have him run away with the scoring
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Baumgartner said he never saw his shot go in because it was off
his backhand and when he got back to the bench, Ted Donato told him
not to rush back to take the faceoff at center ice, but to enjoy
the rare moment with his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a hard worker and such a good guy in the dressing
room that I don't think that anybody would ever tease him about
(his long scoreless streak) or offend the guy,'' said Rob Tallas.
``He works so hard in practice, he's a great leader in the dressing
room. Tonight we were happy that a great guy like that got a goal.
And it was a big one.''

PRONGER HAS LIVED UP TO BILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN VELLANTE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Five months to the day, back on May 10, Blues captain
Chris Pronger lay on the ice at Joe Louis Arena in Detroit fighting
for what many thought was his survival.
</P>
<P>
   He had just taken a Dmitri Mironov slap shot to the chest and
went into cardiac arrhythmia. Medical personnel rushed to the ice
ready to administer CPR.
</P>
<P>
   But their services weren't needed. As quickly as Pronger's heart
had gone weak and irregular it began to pump strong and steady. He
was taken to the hospital for tests, all of which showed no
abnormalities, and two days later he was taking a regular shift in
the playoff series against the Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night at the FleetCenter, in a 3-3 tie against the
Bruins, Pronger was doing what the Hartford Whalers, in general,
and general manager Brian Burke, in particular, envisioned when
they made him their top pick, second overall, in the 1993 draft.
</P>
<P>
   And showing no ill effects from what he, his coach, and his
teammates call a ``freak thing.''
</P>
<P>
   He logged 33 minutes 48 seconds of ice time, more than any other
player except the goalies, had a pair of quality shots on net, and
played with his usual reckless abandon, racking up six penalty
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A typical Chris Pronger game,'' said Blues coach Joel
Quenneville. ``He's a tough kid. What happened was a freak thing.
At the time, you had some scary thoughts going across your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger downplays the incident, saying, ``It was isolated, just
out of the blue. Stuff like that happens. It's part of the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Twist, who had the Blues' first goal Saturday night,
recalls the incident, and Pronger's reaction, vividly.
</P>
<P>
   ``He couldn't figure out what all the fuss was about,'' Twist
said. ``He was kicking and moaning on the stretcher on his way to
the ambulance and wanted to get back into the game. That's how bad
he wanted to get back into the game. He's a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   What the 24-year-old Pronger has accomplished thus far in his
short career hasn't surprised Burke, now president and GM of the
Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought he'd be a guy who could play 30 minutes or so a
game, be a Norris candidate, play nasty, and be a respectable, but
not damaging scorer,'' Burke said. ``He hasn't won the Norris yet,
but he will within the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hartford thought so much of Pronger that they swapped picks with
San Jose to assure they'd get their man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a deal that helped both teams,'' said Burke. ``Sam Jose
wanted Viktor Kozlov and we wanted Pronger. I just couldn't believe
that a guy that big (6 feet 6 inches, 220 pounds) had such quick
feet. We had to have him.''
</P>
<P>
   Pronger spent two years struggling with Hartford before being
dealt to St. Louis in the summer of 1995 for Brendan Shanahan. And
since joining the Blues, he's done all that Burke projected.
</P>
<P>
   e's been playing his 30 or minutes a game, has done some
scoring (27 goals, 71 assists), and picked up more than 400 penalty
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's still young and maturing every day,'' said Quenneville.
``I wouldn't trade him for anyone.''

OOPS, BRUINS BOTCH THE PLAY _ AND SCORE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The most important play of the game was a
mistake. With UCLA clinging to a 31-28 lead, quarterback Cade
McNown called the wrong formation on a pass play.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had it scripted, but it was supposed to go to Brian
(Poli-Dixon),'' UCLA receiver Danny Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, McNown faked an option run, then dropped into the
pocket and fired downfield to Farmer, who raced 64 yards for a
touchdown that gave UCLA a 38-28 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they bit on the run fake, so it was wide open,''
Farmer said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Character switch: UCLA, the team that loves fast starts and
trick plays, got a dose of its own imagination Saturday night. Long
known as a bastion of blandness, Arizona dipped into the creative
chapter of its playbook in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats used a fake punt to set up their first touchdown,
with punter Ryan Springston passing 35 yards to A.J. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   They used cornerback Chris McAlister as a tailback and receiver.
In the second quarter, the Wildcats shifted to a no-huddle offense,
which propelled them to another touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, they ran several plays with quarterbacks Keith Smith
and Jenkins on the field together.
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't ask: All-American offensive tackle Kris Farris, a
junior, has been bombarded by questions about his future.
Specifically: Will he turn pro after the season?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is, he doesn't know. Farris will seek advice after
the season _ both from NFL general managers and the NFL Draft
Advisory Board _ and then decide.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no rush,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Farris is one of 10 finalists for the Lombardi Award, given to
the nation's top lineman. Other finalists include Ohio State
linebacker Andy Katzenmoyer and Texas A&AMP;M linebacker Dat Nguyen.
Based on the Lombardi Award's initial press release, Farris has
little chance. His name was spelled ``Ferris.''
</P>
<P>
   __ It's good: Chris Sailer made his first field goal of the
season when he connected from 41 yards to give UCLA a 24-21 lead in
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   __ Saw it coming: Bruins coach Bob Toledo wasn't surprised by
the importance of Saturday's game. He had it pegged in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look on the schedule and put pinpoints on certain games,''
he said. ``I felt this would be our first one. I thought it would
be Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Say what?: Lanky receiver Poli-Dixon excels at making
difficult sideline catches; he thrusts one leg into the air while
dragging the other inbounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call that, `Pee on the hydrant,' '' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   __ Fatherly advice: Toledo spoke with suspended tailback
Jermaine Lewis several times last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was tough to make the decision because I feel bad for the
kid,'' he said. ``I told him he's like a son _ `I'm going to
discipline you, but I still love you.' I tell the (players), `Don't
make me have to discipline you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis could be reinstated as early as Monday if Toledo
determines Lewis was acting in self defense when he fought Elonza
Malone III in the early hours of Oct. 4.
</P>
<P>
   __ Still waiting: UCLA athletic director Peter Dalis said he did
not speak to Miami AD Paul Dee last week about rescheduling the
canceled game for Dec. 5.

BRUINS BONDING SESSION IS FRUITFUL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ One by one, they stood in front of their
teammates and opened their hearts. The captains, then the defensive
line, then coach Bob Toledo.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the most memorable Friday nights of the Toledo
tenure, and it spurred the No. 3 Bruins to one of their most
impressive wins in years, a 52-28 victory over No. 10 Arizona on
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most emotional meeting I've ever been associated
with,'' linebacker Ryan Nece said. ``There was so much energy, so
much togetherness.''
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was especially important for the defensive line.
Young, injured and ineffective, Toledo knew that if the Bruins
could not stop Arizona's running game and pressure its
quarterbacks, UCLA would face its fifth consecutive loss in Arizona
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins staggered early but finished strong. They limited
Arizona to 29 yards rushing in the second half by doing something
previous UCLA teams could not: They dominated the Wildcats
physically.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game was punch for punch, pound for pound,'' Arizona
offensive lineman Yusef Scott said. ``UCLA just threw more
punches.''
</P>
<P>
   Many were thrown by rookies. True freshmen defensive linemen Ken
Kocher and Anthony Fletcher helped stuff Arizona's ground game.
Linebackers Nece and Tony White pressured the quarterbacks. While
UCLA recorded just two sacks, it hounded Ortege Jenkins and Keith
Smith all night.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just whipped us physically in the fourth quarter on our
home field,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said. ``That really hurts.''
</P>
<P>
   The physical pressure helped force three Arizona turnovers.
(UCLA had none.) The Bruins stripped receiver Dennis Northcutt in
the first half and intercepted both Smith and Jenkins in the
second.
</P>
<P>
   The telling turnover came in the fourth quarter, when White
grabbed a Smith pass on the Arizona 20. On the next play, Keith
Brown rumbled 20 yards for the clinching touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great team meeting,'' Toledo said. ``The kids really
counted on each other. They made some bold statements and they
backed them up. We talked about it being a 15-round fight.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Bruins won the late rounds, outscoring Arizona 31-7 in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went in at halftime and had them right where we wanted
them,'' Toledo said. ``It was tied up and we were wearing them
down. They got one touchdown in the second half. Offensively, we
knocked them off the line of scrimmage and we were running hard.''

UCLA EXPLODES IN 4TH QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ It was flip to flop.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's dreams of an unbeaten season went flat suddenly and in
stunning succession Saturday night in a 52-28 loss to UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats high-wire ride after Ortege Jenkins' acrobatic flip
into the end zone at Washington nine days took a tumble within 2:08
of the fourth quarter at Arizona Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Third-ranked UCLA scored three touchdowns within that stretch, a
Bruin blitz.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Brown, a junior running back from Mountain Pointe High
School, scored two of them. One was on a 54 yard run. The other
covered 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The initial strike in the Bruins' TD triple was a 64-yard pass
to Danny Farmer from Cade McNown, UCLA's Heisman Trophy contender.
</P>
<P>
   By the time it was over, the thunderstruck crowd of 58,738 fans
had seen the probable end of No. 10 Arizona's chances at a Pac-10
title.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd also witnessed Arizona's first loss since last season.
The Wildcats' nine-game win streak was gone.
</P>
<P>
   Gone, too, were any national title pretensions. UCLA (4-0, 2-0
Pac-10) was the only contender at the sudden, strange end.
</P>
<P>
   It was strange, because an apparent first-half shootout
continued through the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins grabbed the second-half advantage on a 41-yard field
goal by Chris Sailor. The scoring opportunity was created by a
37-yard interception return of an Ortege Jenkins pass attempt. The
chance at a UCLA touchdown was killed by a Marcus Bell sack.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 5:20 later, the Wildcats retaliated with the brilliance
and boldness that have become their trademarks. The key play was
some beautiful footwork by Jeremy McDaniel on a 30-yard reception
of a Jenkins pass. The payoff came with a TD reception by McDaniel,
who stretched across the goal line to catch a 28-yard pass from
Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bruins were as resilient as Arizona was bold. The Bruins
put together a carefully-called, unerring drive that covered 53
yards in 13 plays. McNown, UCLA's Heisman Trophy contender, applied
the capper with a 3-yard TD run.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about the first half was ordinary. More like
extraordinary. There were big plays, small plays. And unusual
plays. Within two quarters, there was enough of the unpredictable
for one season.
</P>
<P>
   Call it wild, wacky and uniquely Arizona in a season that has
been full of Wildcat surprises from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona's first touchdown was set up by a punter's pass to a
reserve cornerback. Among the Arizona Stadium's crowd of 58,738 _
the fourth largest in school history _ only the punter and
cornerback were not surprised.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it happened:
</P>
<P>
   Arizona punter Ryan Springston, an All-State high school
quarterback in Kansas, waited at midfield in what appeared to be a
kicking situation. After all, it was fourth down and about eight
yards.
</P>
<P>
   Springston caught the long snap. A split-second later,
cornerback A.J. Brown, a redshirt freshman from Washington High
School, was open near the one-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Springston lofted a pass. Brown caught it. Springston and Brown
made it look as though they had been a combination for years. They
haven't been, of course. A dramatic guessing game full of bluffs
and power had just begun.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats held the early advantage after Kelvin Eafon dove
into the end zone two plays after the punter-to-cornerback strike
late in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's turn was next. Freshman running back DeShaun Foster
introduced himself four plays after Wildcats receiver Dennis
Northcutt fumbled and UCLA recovered at the Bruins 40. First, there
was a 33-yard pass from McNown to Danny Farmer. Then, Foster broke
an attempted tackle by Marcus, spun and raced 37 yards for the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   It was all even. On the scoreboard. And on the sensational
scale. But it was far from over.
</P>
<P>
   Before the first quarter ended, the Wildcats struck again. This
time, the opportunity was created by tailback Trung Canidate, the
powerful junior from Central High. He caught about a 10-yard pass
from Ortege Jenkins and raced about 64 on a path that took him from
one sideline to the center of the field to the Bruin four. The
powerful Eafon bulled his way in the end zone one the next play.
</P>
<P>
   Before the crowd caught its collective breath, it was UCLA's
turn. First, Foster broke a Scooter Sprotte tackle on a 20-yard
dash. A couple of plays later, an eight-yard Foster run and a
15-yard personal foul penalty against Chris McAlister put the
Bruins on the Arizona 15. Three plays later, McNown hit Brian
Poli-Dixon, a sophomore from Tucson, with a 14-yard TD strike early
in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Within five minutes, the Wildcats drove 80-yards, and this time
Keith Smith was at quarterback. The key play was a 27-yard pass to
Northcutt, who looked over his shoulder and pulled the ball down
with one hand. The TD was scored on a 15-yard strike from Smith
Jeremy McDaniel.

BRUINS' BROWN SHOWS FRIENDS, FAMILY &AMP; UA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BY KENT SOMERS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON _ With 45 friends and relatives in the stands, UCLA
tailback Keith Brown knew the pressure was on to put on a show.
</P>
<P>
   It took awhile, but Brown, a junior from Phoenix's Mountain
Pointe High School, came through Saturday night against Arizona.
Brown scored twice within a 25-second span in the fourth quarter to
help the Bruins break open a tight game and beat the Wildcats,
52-28.
</P>
<P>
   Brown was in the starting lineup in place of Jermaine Lewis, who
was suspended from the game because of his involvement in a fight
last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of pressure on me,'' Brown said. ``And a lot of
the media were hitting me up for interviews over the last week. But
I was coming home. I was supposed to put on a show. And I think I
did a good job.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown hadn't done much Saturday until the fourth quarter, and in
fact, he had been overshadowed by freshman DeShaun Foster, who
rushed 20 times for 118 yards and two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA led by three going into the fourth quarter, when
quarterback Cade McNown hit flanker Danny Farmer with a 64-yard
pass to extend the lead to 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins then shut down the Wildcats' offense. On the first
play of the next possession, Brown took the ball off right tackle,
slipped a couple of defenders and cut back left and sprinted to a
54-yard touchdown to give the Bruins a 17-point lead with 9:35
left. ``I just had one man to beat and it was a foot race then,''
Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA intercepted Arizona quarterback Keith Smith on the next
possession. On the next play, Brown went 20 yards for another
touchdown. Until Saturday, Brown had carried just 14 times for 37
yards this season, although he had scored two touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Brown finished the night with 91 yards on nine carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a great game,'' Brown said. ``It was like a
15-round boxing match.''
</P>
<P>
   Both opponents used nearly all of their tricks.
</P>
<P>
   To see the different offenses used in college football, you
usually have to have a remote control in your palm, a satellite
dish on your roof and a free Saturday on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   Or, you could have just watched Saturday night's game at Arizona
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Like end-of-the-week stew, there was a little something for
everyone in the pot. A little bit of Canadian League flavor, a dash
of Arena League, a bit of the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   There were long passes, triple options and power running. There
were quarterbacks and defensive backs catching passes, and punters
and receivers throwing them. Receivers were running the option. Two
quarterbacks were lining up in the same backfield.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just in the first half. &QL;

THE SLIPPER FALLS OFF ARIZONA'S FOOT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. - Destiny disappeared. The karma expired. The
somersaults turned to smelling salts.
</P>
<P>
   In a matter of 128 seconds, the great fantasy went poof.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona will not weasel its way into the Fiesta Bowl. The
Wildcats will not play for a national championship on Frank Kush
Field while the normal tenants are off in some remote outpost. The
biggest football game in school history went from riveting to
ridiculous, and the hosts will need much detergent to get the tire
tracks off their uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   Just when the game got serious, just when the final 15 minutes
began to tick and the great upset seemed within reach, UCLA hung a
28-point barrage on Arizona, coasting to a 52-28 victory that said
more about the winners than it did the losers.
</P>
<P>
   They have a Heisman Trophy candidate in Cade McNown, a rising
star in tailback DeShaun Foster, an offense that almost scores at
will. Since opening last season with losses to Ryan Leaf and Peyton
Manning, the Bruins have won 14 straight. And they made a
convincing case to what many have expected since last December.
</P>
<P>
   They could be the best team in the nation and should have a
chance to prove it come January. After all, coupled with Nebraska's
loss Saturday, the Bruins occupy one lane on the fast track to the
Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   In Tucson, the pain will linger, the bruises exacerbated by the
missed opportunity. &QL; 
No Cinderella &QL; 
Every season has its Cinderella, its enchanted program, its
underdog that charms the nation. Doug Flutie and the Hail Mary.
Jake Plummer and the Sun Devils. Northwestern and its journey to
the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the slipper seemed to fit Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   First, it was Ortege Jenkins and his highlight-reel tumble into
the end zone. On Saturday, it was a punter throwing a successful
bomb. An acrobatic, one-handed catch by Dennis Northcutt. A pair of
quarterbacks that not only shared playing time, but lined up in
something called the ``Muddle Huddle'' and threw the ball to each
other. A full-fledged diving catch in the end zone by Jeremy
McDaniel that staked the Wildcats to a 28-24 lead midway through
the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   If they could hold on to the lead, if they could prevail, the
Wildcats could dare to dream. The schedule softens up considerably.
The two biggest games left on the docket _ skirmishes against
Oregon and Arizona State _ are both at home. They could think about
playing in their first Rose Bowl. And with a couple of breaks, they
might even make the big dance.
</P>
<P>
   It all ended so suddenly. Collapsed so convincingly.
</P>
<P>
   But they will find solace. If UCLA runs the table, Arizona still
has a chance for the Rose Bowl. And no matter what happens, they
have succeeded where their rivals in Tempe have failed, and that's
saying something. &QL; 
ABC made fans losers &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the real loser was a nation of college football
fans, and the lesson was a painful reminder of priorities and
money. Because no matter how much you smell like destiny _ and the
Wildcats carried the scent all week _ you can never get past the
800-pound gorilla.
</P>
<P>
   Shame on ABC. Shame on the suits who opted for the knee-jerk
allure of Notre Dame. Shame on the people who, according to one
source, wanted to use Saturday's game at Sun Devil Stadium as a dry
run for the Fiesta Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   So what did they get? A boring game. A power outage that had the
Bidwill family smiling and officials from the Bowl Championship
Series slightly alarmed.
</P>
<P>
   Everything you know about the East Coast bias originates from
this, from marquee games televised at night when they should be
showcased in the afternoon. It is how Troy Aikman finished third in
the Heisman balloting in 1988. How Stanford's John Elway finished
second in 1982. How Plummer finished third to Danny Wuerffel in
1996. How a fraud named Gino Torretta took home a trophy that
rightfully belonged to Marshall Faulk.
</P>
<P>
   And what did they miss? Nothing but two wonderful teams and an
explosive game of pinball. One powerhouse threatened for three
quarters before showing its mettle. And in the end, one
overachiever that simply ran out of magic. &QL;

NO BLAHS IN EVIDENCE EVEN THOUGH IT'S PREPLAYOFF SEASON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ The Presidents' Trophy banner? Nice.
</P>
<P>
   The season-opening audience at Reunion Arena? Just fine.
</P>
<P>
   The new guy from St. Louis? He'll do.
</P>
<P>
   So, when do the playoffs start?
</P>
<P>
   It irks Stars coach Ken Hitchcock that a team can play earnest,
Cup-caliber hockey for six months, and people _ people like you and
me _ can yawn and jingle pocket change during the banner-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But that's hockey. Some people had important cell-phone calls to
make.
</P>
<P>
   The regular season, we have come to learn, is six months of
sound, fury and a few fistfights, signifying ... a nice banner? The
meaningful stuff is not supposed to start until around Memorial
Day.
</P>
<P>
   But anybody who truly thinks that doesn't know Hitchcock.
</P>
<P>
   On a banner night at Reunion, the Stars again displayed
Cup-caliber form in throttling the Buffalo Sabres, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   If there were any feelings of been-there, done-that among the
Presidents' Trophy-winning Stars, they vanished swiftly under the
emotion of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first 12 minutes,'' Hitchcock said, ``with the way we
moved the puck; I haven't seen our team play like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Against the acknowledged best goaltender on the planet, Dominik
Hasek, the Stars dominated play for those first 12 minutes and then
settled back to play with shoulder-jarring efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 line of new guy Brett Hull, Mike Modano and Jere
Lehtinen created an immediate presence. The Stars' deep cadre of
defensemen was superb. Hasek, for his part, was outplayed by the
Stars' Eddie Belfour.
</P>
<P>
   Stars fans had to pinch their Calvins to remind themselves that
Hasek and the Sabres reached the Eastern Conference finals last
season. Yet, the home team won almost handily last night.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour stopped 27 of 28 shots, reminding the local crowd that
his alleged meltdown in the Western Conference finals was not the
Eddie they've come to love and know. Granted, Belfour had plenty of
help in front of him against Buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know where he was really strong?'' Hitchcock suggested.
``With the puck, in the area around the net.''
</P>
<P>
   The rules are different this season. The ice is foreign, in a
way. With the goal lines moved out an additional two feet, goalies
have to resist the wanderlust that once beckoned some of them.
</P>
<P>
   Belfour has always been eager to stray. But last night he was as
trusty as a guard dog.
</P>
<P>
   More than that, Hitchcock said, ``He helped us on breakouts
probably 15 times by getting the puck out quickly to us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Stars made Hasek pay. Interestingly, against the Czech
Republic-born Hasek, who beat the world at the 1998 Winter
Olympics, the Stars are 7-3. This is the same goaltender who has
won the NHL's most valuable player award, the Hart Trophy, two
years in a row. This is the same Hasek who has won the Vezina
Trophy as the league's top goalie for four of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   But the Stars peppered him with opening-night welcomes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We scored two great goals against him tonight,'' Hitchcock
said. ``But we had two two-on-ones and one three-on-one, and he
stoned us in all three. He never allows you to stretch your lead.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe. But a 4-1 victory sounds like an ample stretching.
</P>
<P>
   It was midseason hockey in the NHL's yawning days of autumn. How
many days until the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   While the crowd sauntered in, the Stars held a quasi-impressive
ceremony to hoist three banners signifying their last season
accomplishments. There were cheers and nods of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really bothers me when people write that stuff off,''
Hitchcock said later. ``People write that it was a waste of energy
to get there, and that bothers me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning things like that set such a strong foundation for your
team _ a work ethic foundation, a consistent-play foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   He'll take a President's Trophy over an Also-Participated Plaque
any day, Hitchcock was trying to say.
</P>
<P>
   In six months, we'll see.

TWO-WAY PERFORMER KEYS NORTH TEXAS' WIN AT BOISE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENNIFER FLOYD 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOISE, Idaho _ North Texas defensive tackle Brian Waters asked
coach Darrell Dickey last week if he had a second.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop by, Brian,'' Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Waters did, pleading with Dickey to give him a chance to play
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   Dickey remembered, calling Waters' number in a critical
third-down, fourth-quarter, UNT-trailing situation last night
against Boise State.
</P>
<P>
   Waters responded by hauling in a 27-yard touchdown pass that
provided the go-ahead score in UNT's 21-13 victory against Boise
State last night at Bronco Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess he listened,'' said Waters, who played tight end his
first three seasons before moving to defense in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   It was Waters' first reception of the season. It was UNT's first
Big West Conference game of the season. And it was also UNT's first
victory of the season.
</P>
<P>
   And when that victory looked in doubt _ Boise State (3-3, 0-1
Big West Conference) had responded by driving to UNT's 24-yard line
_ Waters responded in kind.
</P>
<P>
   He caused a fumble that linebacker Fred Pertile recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the victory remained in doubt until tailback Tubby
Coleman's 10-yard touchdown with 1:44 remaining. Coleman finished
with a career-high 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   It was also a little redemption for Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   He had a costly fumble a play after the Eagles (1-4, 1-0 Big
West Conference) got into Boise State territory with a spectacular,
over-the-shoulder, 40-yard catch by Jay Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sick feeling,'' Coleman said of his fumble. ``So, yes,
it did feel a little redeemed.''
</P>
<P>
   The nail-biting finale, with Boise State failing to convert a
fourth down deep in UNT territory with nine seconds remaining, was
in sharp contrast to most of the game.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams were plagued by penalties and sloppy play.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams opened with yawn-inspiring displays.
</P>
<P>
   By the time a lazy first quarter ended, UNT and Boise State had
combined for 95 yards, a handful of first downs and hardly a threat
of a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, better than 20 minutes in, a 21-yard Todd Belcastro
field goal ended that drought, well, at least for BSU.
</P>
<P>
   A suddenly revitalized Broncos bunch followed with a five-play,
63-yard drive. The touchdown came on a 15-yard pass from backup
quarterback Nate Sparks to backup tailback Shaunard Harts.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what I was most pleased about?'' Dickey said. ``We're
0-4 and we fell behind and we were making some mistakes, and not
one time did I feel like the players were saying `Here, we go
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead UNT went 82 yards in 56 seconds, ending with Coleman
scampering in for a 4-yard touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   Back-to-back passes by Jason Attaway _ a 23-yarder to Young and
a 33-yarder to Carlos Yearwood _ keyed that drive. Attaway finished
7-of-17 for a career-high 155 yards. Extra points When Garrett
Courtney's 48-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right with 37
seconds remaining in the first quarter, it broke his streak of nine
consecutive field goals made from 40 yards or better. ... The
Eagles are 0-5 in coin tosses this season. ... UNT's 82-yard,
touchdown-producing drive marked its longest of the season. ...
When UNT took a 14-13 lead with 12:23 remaining, it was their first
lead since the second quarter against Oklahoma in Week 1.

   The Boys: The Untold Story of 732 Young Concentration Camp
Survivors
</P>
<P>
   By Martin Gilbert. Owl/Holt, $16.95. A seasoned custodian of the
memory of the Holocaust puts a human face on the catastrophe by
letting a remarkable group of mostly Polish Jews recall their
childhood ordeals. Last year our reviewer, Michael R. Marrus,
called this a `` remarkable volume ... about survival and painful,
vivid, individual memories of surviving.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Believers: A Novella and Stories &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Baxter. Vintage Contemporaries, $13. These
psychologically dense tales track the unpredictable destinies of
ordinary Midwesterners, often focusing on the internal struggle
between the forces of love and violence. ``It's the eloquence of
the language _ the quirky intelligence, the humor, the lively
rhythmic assurance of sentences and paragraphs _ along with the
surprising plots, that makes these stories such a pleasure to
read,'' Francine Prose said here last year. The same publisher has
reissued an earlier collection by the author,  &UR; Through the Safety
Net: Stories &LR;  ($13), which features many middle-class characters
estranged from life _ a couple paralyzed by the death of their
child, for example, or a perpetual graduate student dazed by the
real world. In 1985 in the Book Review, Ron Hansen called these 11
stories ''original, gracefully written, always moving, frequently
funny and _ that rarest of compliments _ wise.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Nearer, My God: An Autobiography of Faith &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By William F. Buckley Jr. Harvest/Harcourt Brace, $14. The
author may be an imposing public intellectual but he's also a
devout Christian, and this unusually personal essay is both a
celebration of his lifelong Roman Catholicism and a doctrinal
apologia for the church. ``It is certain to provide many insights
into the mind of a polished writer ... and it will do much to
explain how the hopefully changeless faith of a Catholic jibes with
the politics of a late-20th-century American political
conservative,'' William R. Everdell wrote here in 1997.  &UR; In Living
Faith &LR; , by Jimmy Carter (Times Books/Random House, $13), the former
president laces his spiritual self-portrait with poems, Scripture
and frank revelations about his personal and political lives. The
book, which includes a new preface by Carter, is ''an appealing,
straightforward account of a life marked, as many are, by
unexpected successes and crushing failures,'' Michael Wright said
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lucky You &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Carl Hiaasen. Warner Vision, $7.50. JoLayne Lucks doesn't
have much good fortune in the romance department, but things look
up when she wins half of a $28 million prize in the Florida
lottery: the trouble is, the other winners are two dirtball white
supremacists who aim to rip her off. ``Hiaasen writes witty
dialogue that crackles, and his characters are eccentrically
colorful,'' Charles Salzberg said here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Goldwyn: A Biography &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By A. Scott Berg. Riverhead, $16. The legendary mogul who set
Hollywood in motion was an inspired ruffian whose outsize ambitions
and appetites make for terrific reading. ``This story of a grabby
but imaginative man would make a more telling movie about America
... than Goldwyn ever produced himself,'' Mordecai Richler wrote
here in 1989. On a smaller stage,  &UR; How I Made a Hundred Movies in
Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime &LR; , by Roger Corman with Jim Jerome
(Da Capo, $14.95), explains how the schlockmeister responsible for
fare like ``Bloody Mama'' was able to become a major independent
force in filmmaking while running an absurdly tight ship. ``Corman
comes across as likable, admirable and, in his ability to survive
in Hollywood with his integrity intact, even awe-inspiring,'' Barry
Gewen wrote here in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Byrne &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Anthony Burgess. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95. The author's final
novel is an audacious hybrid even for a lifelong experimentalist:
the story of a minor modern composer whose real skills are in the
bedroom unfolds in novelistic fashion but entirely in rhymed verse.
Last year our reviewer, Dana Gioia, called this ``genuinely
astonishing _ a complex dark comedy.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Platypus and the Mermaid: And Other Figments of the
Classifying Imagination &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Harriet Ritvo. Harvard University, $15.95. A history
professor chronicles the Victorian obsession with classifying and
categorizing God's creatures, particularly as they relate to man
and the dinner table. Last year in the Book Review, Stefan Collini
called this an ''entertaining and informative tour of both the
highroads and the hedgerows of natural history.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Teen Angel: And Other Stories of Wayward Love &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Marianne Gingher. Zuckerman Cannon, $14. The adolescent
characters who populate these inventive tales somehow manage to be
both quirky and down to earth despite the broken adult
relationships around them. ''Gingher possesses a stylistic deftness
and a flair for comic detail,'' W.L. Taitte said here in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Magician's Assistant &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ann Patchett. Harvest, $13. When a gay Los Angeles magician
named Parsifal dies suddenly, he leaves behind his heartbroken
assistant, Sabine, and a secret past that leads her to Nebraska and
a family she never knew he had. Last year our reviewer, Suzanne
Berne, called the author ``an adroit, graceful writer.''

 &HT;    Russia's crisis worries the world

   MOSCOW _ Imagine that your parents suddenly lost their jobs
because their bosses could no longer afford to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that your family could not get its money out of the bank
because the doors were locked and the automatic teller machine
(ATM) was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that you went with them to the grocery story to get your
favorite breakfast cereal, only to find it was gone from the
shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, this is what life is like in Russia today for many
people.
</P>
<P>
   A SHORT HISTORY LESSON: Russia used to be part of the Soviet
Union, a vast country ruled under communism. The Soviet government
ran the economy and provided jobs for its people, but did not allow
them many personal freedoms like travel and public speech and
religion. In 1991, the Soviet Union broke up because it could not
keep its economy going and more and more people were demanding
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   Russia and many other countries once ruled under communism have
tried to change their political systems and economies to become
more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, the change has been slow and the result in August
was an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED: Russia has been spending more money than it
brings in. After several difficult years, it appeared that Russia's
economy would grow in 1998, but foreign investors began leaving and
Russia was forced during the summer to borrow billions of dollars
from the United States and others. When that ran out, the crisis
hit Aug. 17. Seeking a solution, President Boris Yeltsin fired his
government, but that only made things worse. After weeks of
turmoil, Yeltsin appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in
September. He is working on a plan to help the Russian economy and
hoping that the United States and other nations will give more
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BUT SMALL; RICH BUT POOR: Russia is the largest country in
the world, almost twice the size of the United States. It is rich
in natural resources like oil, gas, timber and minerals, but its
people are very poor. In terms of the country's total output of
goods and services, Russia does not make the list of the world's
top 20 economies.
</P>
<P>
   It has 146.5 million people. But the number is declining as the
death rate outpaces the number of babies born. Poor health-care and
alcoholism means the life expectancy for males is 58 years old; 72
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has moved slowly toward
a free-market economy. However, the bulk of the country's wealth is
in the hands of a small number of industrialists and financiers.
Meanwhile, most ordinary Russians have seen their standard of
living drop and many workers wait months for their pay.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM: Pretend you live in Moscow. The
national currency in Russia is the ruble. Every time you babysit or
mow a lawn, you make 50 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of August, that 50 rubles was worth about $8 (6.2
rubles _ $1). Now, because the ruble has been losing value in the
bad economy _ a process called devaluation _ the 50 rubles is worth
only about $3 (16 rubles _ $1).
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of things you want to buy such as T-shirts, video
games and compact discs are rising rapidly, even as the ruble is
falling in value. And you can't raise your price of 50 rubles for
babysitting or mowing because the people who pay you are losing
their jobs and cannot afford to pay more, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Living standards in Russia were never as high as they were in
the United States, so the impact is felt even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in Russia in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles is now worth about $50. Meanwhile,
inflation _ the measure of the increase in the cost of living _ was
up 38 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   FIXING RUSSIA: It won't be easy. The crisis has raised a
fundamental political debate over whether Russia should revert to a
government-run economy as it had during Soviet times, or pursue
meaningful reforms to seek a free-market economy. The United States
and other countries are nervous about giving more aid, fearing it
will only be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA TROUBLES ARE U.S. TROUBLES: From 1946 until 1991, the
Soviet Union and America were involved in the Cold War, where they
sought to influence other countries and they built huge arsenals of
powerful nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic problems have forced it to cut back its armed
forces, but it remains the world's second largest nuclear power.
Russia has an estimated 22,000 nuclear weapons and caches of
weapons-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   So, a stable Russia is considered important not only for
Russians, but for the safety of the world.

tried to change their political systems and economies to become
more like the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, the change has been slow and the result in August
was an economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT HAPPENED: Russia has been spending more money than it
brings in. After several difficult years, it appeared that Russia's
economy would grow in 1998, but foreign investors began leaving and
Russia was forced during the summer to borrow billions of dollars
from the United States and others. When that ran out, the crisis
hit Aug. 17. Seeking a solution, President Boris Yeltsin fired his
government, but that only made things worse. After weeks of
turmoil, Yeltsin appointed Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov in
September. He is working on a plan to help the Russian economy and
hoping that the United States and other nations will give more
financial aid.
</P>
<P>
   BIG BUT SMALL; RICH BUT POOR: Russia is the largest country in
the world, almost twice the size of the United States. It is rich
in natural resources like oil, gas, timber and minerals, but its
people are very poor. In terms of the country's total output of
goods and services, Russia does not make the list of the world's
top 20 economies.
</P>
<P>
   It has 146.5 million people. But the number is declining as the
death rate outpaces the number of babies born. Poor health-care and
alcoholism means the life expectancy for males is 58 years old; 72
for women.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Soviet Union collapsed, Russia has moved slowly toward
a free-market economy. However, the bulk of the country's wealth is
in the hands of a small number of industrialists and financiers.
Meanwhile, most ordinary Russians have seen their standard of
living drop and many workers wait months for their pay.
</P>
<P>
   AN EXAMPLE OF THE PROBLEM: Pretend you live in Moscow. The
national currency in Russia is the ruble. Every time you babysit or
mow a lawn, you make 50 rubles.
</P>
<P>
   In the middle of August, that 50 rubles was worth about $8 (6.2
rubles _ $1). Now, because the ruble has been losing value in the
bad economy _ a process called devaluation _ the 50 rubles is worth
only about $3 (16 rubles _ $1).
</P>
<P>
   But the prices of things you want to buy such as T-shirts, video
games and compact discs are rising rapidly, even as the ruble is
falling in value. And you can't raise your price of 50 rubles for
babysitting or mowing because the people who pay you are losing
their jobs and cannot afford to pay more, if at all.
</P>
<P>
   Living standards in Russia were never as high as they were in
the United States, so the impact is felt even deeper.
</P>
<P>
   The average monthly household income in Russia in June was 861
rubles, about $137. With the ruble's devaluation since Aug. 17, the
same income of 861 rubles is now worth about $50. Meanwhile,
inflation _ the measure of the increase in the cost of living _ was
up 38 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
   FIXING RUSSIA: It won't be easy. The crisis has raised a
fundamental political debate over whether Russia should revert to a
government-run economy as it had during Soviet times, or pursue
meaningful reforms to seek a free-market economy. The United States
and other countries are nervous about giving more aid, fearing it
will only be wasted.
</P>
<P>
   RUSSIA TROUBLES ARE U.S. TROUBLES: From 1946 until 1991, the
Soviet Union and America were involved in the Cold War, where they
sought to influence other countries and they built huge arsenals of
powerful nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's economic problems have forced it to cut back its armed
forces, but it remains the world's second largest nuclear power.
Russia has an estimated 22,000 nuclear weapons and caches of
weapons-grade materials.
</P>
<P>
   So, a stable Russia is considered important not only for
Russians, but for the safety of the world.

 &HT;    Andrew Young tells Christians in China to keep faith
 &HT;    WITH PHOTO
 &HT;    By Marcia Kunstel and Joseph Albright
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANJING, China _ Like the preacher he started out to be, Andrew
Young came here Sunday and delivered solace and hope to an overflow
congregation of nodding, rapt Chinese parishioners _ believers
under a communist regime that keeps religion on a short leash.
</P>
<P>
   Like the diplomat he became, the former United Nations
ambassador, mayor of Atlanta and U.S. congressman plans to meet
later this week with Chinese leaders in Beijing to explain how that
short leash might chafe U.S.- China relations. Young is expected to
tell the Chinese that America is about to pursue a policy of
punishing countries that persecute religious minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the nondenominational Mochou Road Church, one of the
country's largest Protestant churches, Young invoked the memory of
the Rev. Martin Luther King in a speech reminiscent of those Young
used to inspire embattled civil rights workers in the American
South.
</P>
<P>
   ``He challenged our government about many of its policies,''
Young recalled of the friend and mentor he said gave his life for a
cause stemming from his Christian faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we refused to do any violence against people, even those
who did violence against us. We followed Jesus's commands to love
your enemy and to bless those who persecute you,'' said Young.
</P>
<P>
   ``You show them your love of God, and God works through you to
transform them. So God will work through you in this church to show
the love of God to this country.''
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 1,600 Chinese parishioners listening to the sermon
in translation may have detected an underlying message addressing
their own daily lives. Here in China, the openly religious are
relatively few, religious education and proselytizing are
restricted, and those who refuse to toe the Chinese government's
mark by worshipping in unregistered ``underground churches'' may
find themselves imprisoned.
</P>
<P>
   The congregation of common, everyday Chinese, men and women,
elderly and children, dressed in everything from old wool Mao coats
to pretty silk jackets, listened closely in the sanctuary, then
gave Young solid applause. Others listened in a next-door meeting
hall where the service was piped in for the overflow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very touching. Very inspiring,'' said Yu Zhi Xiang, a tiny
68-year-old happy to stop and chat after the service.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese are not accustomed to suggestions they directly
challenge their government a la Martin Luther King. And Young
certainly did not exhort them to storm out, confront the state and
convert their 1.2 billion countrymen not already believers.
</P>
<P>
   The government conservatively estimates there are 10 million
Protestants and 4 million Catholics in China, and even double that
would still comprise only 2 percent of the population. But the
numbers of churchgoers are said to be rising _ the Rev. Jiang Juin
Yu said he receives ``several hundred'' new members every year at
Mochou Road _ and the country's communist government has been
careful to prevent the movement from getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Besides imposing limitations on religious education and
promotion, the government requires that church meeting places be
registered and may censor cleric's sermons. Officials can prohibit
a sect or group from meeting on vague grounds of being a
``pseudo-religion'' or endangering security. Christian churches are
supposed to be nondenominational _ either Protestant or Catholic,
the latter stripped of ties to the Rome church.
</P>
<P>
   These constraints are part of the reason Young and a delegation
of the National Council of Churches of Christ in the USA, of which
he is president-elect, are making this visit to China.
</P>
<P>
   ``This trip is different, because we'll meet with government
officials to talk about the implications of the new (American)
policy,'' said the Rev. Joan B. Campbell, National Council of
Churches general secretary. The new policy is the Religious
Persecution Act, passed by Congress but not yet signed by President
Clinton, which provides for possible U.S. diplomatic or economic
sanctions against countries found to persecute citizens for their
religious practices.
</P>
<P>
   The seven-day visit has been arranged by the China Christian
Council, the state-sanctioned body that promotes Protestant
religious activity and serves as the formal channel to the
communist government. The National Council of Churches has
maintained relations with the China Christian Council since its
formation in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Saturday, Young said China's religious situation
``is very complex'' and has been portrayed in a negative and
one-dimensional way by American political figures intent on
China-bashing for political reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of nuts in Atlanta that we've put in jail for
preaching on street corners and disrupting traffic,'' Young said.
``How can I assume that I can make judgments about a nation this
large, with more than a billion people?''
</P>
<P>
   Young's last visit to China grew out of the Nike controversy. In
1997, he visited Nike factories in China, Vietnam and Indonesia as
a paid Nike consultant to investigate charges by American labor and
human rights advocates that Nike mistreated its workers, and
similarly found a complex situation not so simple for him to
declare right or wrong. He was later criticized by some Western
human rights groups for ignoring their complaint that Nike workers
were paid ``below-subsistence'' wages and subjected to corporal
punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Young is not the only one to find China's religious situation
complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Some Western religious leaders have expressed concern that
attempts to punish the prickly Chinese government for its domestic
policies may backfire, causing the government to crack down on the
freedoms that do exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to support these churches every way we can,'' said
Campbell of the NCC. ``Just to be a Christian in an atheist society
is a confrontation.

 &HT;    Jackets at Wolfpack: Make or break time
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Georgia Tech coach George O'Leary keeps telling his
team to approach this season as if it was playing 11 one-game
seasons. The Yellow Jackets' next game _ Saturday at N.C. State _
might be the one to make or break the season.
</P>
<P>
   Beat N.C. State and the Jackets (3-1, 2-0 ACC) are in a position
to fight Florida State and Virginia for the conference title. Lose,
and Tech will have its work cut out to get to a better bowl than
the Carquest.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack (3-1, 2-0) has been the surprise of the season,
upsetting Florida State 24-7 and following with a 38-17 win over
Syracuse Thursday night. Torry Holt (29 catches, 594 yards, four
touchdowns) is making a case for being the top receiver in the
country, and quarterback Jamie Barnette is having a strong year.
</P>
<P>
   Throw in N.C. State's loss to Baylor and near-loss to Ohio
University, and the Wolfpack vulnerabilities come to the surface,
but N.C. State is clearly Tech's toughest opponent yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're playing with great, great effort and enthusiasm,''
O'Leary said. ``They've got their crowd behind them big-time.
They're making big plays on offense and defense. Holt could be tops
in the country. What doesn't he have? He's strong. He's quick. He
can catch. He's got big hands.''
</P>
<P>
   As for what Tech has planned for Holt defensively, it is yet to
be seen. Cornerback Jamara Clark is Tech's best cover man, but he
won't be asked to take Holt on by himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody in the country who can cover him
1-on-1,'' O'Leary said. ``(But) If you overload on him, they've got
two other receivers who can beat you.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Tech, here are some observations by O'Leary following
Saturday's 41-13 victory over Duke:
</P>
<P>
   _ Good: Joe Hamilton. Big plays on offense, such as Hamilton and
Dez White hooking up for a 53-yard touchdown. Creating turnovers on
defense: The Jackets scored 10 points off two forced turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bad: Dropped balls. Tech had six of them against Duke.
``They're running before they have the ball,'' O'Leary said. ``You
can't do that in a big game.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Worrisome: The health of backup quarterback George Godsey, who
pulled his hamstring at the end of practice Thursday. Without him
against Duke, Tech had to risk playing Hamilton for the entire
game.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said the plan was if Hamilton had to come out and the
game wasn't close to use walk-on Alex Thompson. If the game was
close and Hamilton had to come out, he'd use true freshman Jermaine
Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he'll use the same plan this week if Godsey is
unable to go. The difference is Thompson will have more than one
light practice day to get prepared for something besides running
the scout team in practice. O'Leary doesn't want to use Crenshaw if
at all possible, thus saving him a year of eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   UP NEXT FOR GEORGIA TECH
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: N.C. State
</P>
<P>
   When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Carter-Finley Stadium, Raleigh.

 &HT;    By any name, Saturday slate will be critical

   ATLANTA _ You can call it ``Showdown Saturday'' or you can call
it ``Shakedown Saturday.'' No matter what you call it, if you're a
college football fan, you better watch at least one of these games
during the coming weekend. After this Saturday, the national
championship race will begin to take shape:
</P>
<P>
   -- Tennessee (4-0) at Georgia (4-0): The winner has the inside
track to the SEC East championship and will be the league's best
hope of placing a team in the Fiesta Bowl. The last time the
Bulldogs beat the Vols (1988), Vince Dooley was beginning his last
season as coach. ESPN's Game Day is coming to the biggest home game
in Athens since Tennessee-Georgia in '92.
</P>
<P>
   -- LSU (3-1) at Florida (4-1): LSU is still licking its wounds
after Saturday night's 28-27 loss to Georgia and can't be looking
forward to going to The Swamp, where the Tigers were pummeled 56-10
two seasons ago. ``We can mope the rest of the season or we can try
to come back,'' said coach Gerry DiNardo. Florida was lucky to
escape with a 16-10 win at Alabama and coach Steve Spurrier knows
it. This will not be a fun week around Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   -- UCLA (3-0) at Arizona (5-0): Arizona has become the darkhorse
team in the Pac-10 after Saturday night's dramatic 31-28 win over
Washington. UCLA has better talent, but could struggle at Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   -- Nebraska (5-0) at Texas A&AMP;M (4-1): After struggling to beat
Oklahoma State 24-17 Saturday night, the No. 2 Cornhuskers should
bounce back and spank the Aggies, who also looked lackluster in
beating Kansas 24-21.
</P>
<P>
   Monday morning quarterback
</P>
<P>
   -- Expect Spurrier to decide on a quarterback and stick with him
before Saturday's game with LSU. After scoring only one touchdown
at Alabama Saturday, Spurrier is finally convinced that alternating
Doug Johnson and Jesse Palmer is killing offensive consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm tired of this zig-zagging around,'' said Spurrier. Our
money is on Johnson, who completed 10 of 20 passes for 187 yards.
</P>
<P>
   -- The mood was not much better at Florida State after the
Seminoles needed a school-record five field goals from Sebastian
Janikowski to beat Maryland 24-10. ``It felt worse than a loss,''
said defensive end Tony Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   -- Auburn now has a quarterback controversy. Regardless of how
fast sophomore Ben Leard comes back from an elbow injury suffered
against Tennessee, there will be pressure to play true freshman
Gabe Gross, who came off the bench and did some good things in the
17-9 loss to the Volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looks like Ben has a battle on his hands,'' conceded coach
Terry Bowden. Gross was 7-of-15 for 112 yards. The injury to Leard
was so unexpected that Gross was out on the field not knowing a lot
of the Auburn offense. ``I didn't think he knew what any play
was,'' said Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Worth noting
</P>
<P>
   -- Tennessee quarterback Tee Martin almost got hit in the head
with a full soft drink bottle after Saturday's game at Auburn.
Someone from the upper deck of Jordan-Hare Stadium dropped the
bottle near Tennessee's postgame interview area behind the stadium.
Later, Tennessee running back Jamal Lewis left the locker room with
a police escort and did not give interviews. He had an ice bag
taped to his right knee but his injury is not believed to be
serious.
</P>
<P>
   -- With 350 yards and five touchdowns in Saturday's 54-33 win
over Iowa State, Ricky Williams of Texas is now fourth on the NCAA
career rushing list with 5,241 yards. He's 841 yards shy of Tony
Dorsett's career record of 6,082. He needs to average 140 yards in
his final six games to reach that mark.
</P>
<P>
   -- Keep an eye on Tulane, 4-0 after Saturday's big 21-7 win over
Southern Mississippi. The Green Wave forced six turnovers and won
even though quarterback Shaun King played with a cast on his left
wrist. Also keep an eye on coach Tommy Bowden, who is being
mentioned as a possible candidate at Clemson or South Carolina if
either makes a change.
</P>
<P>
   -- While you were sleeping, Arizona QB Ortege Jenkins made one
of the plays of the year. Jenkins scored on a 9-yard run with four
seconds remaining when he somersaulted over three Washington
defenders into the end zone. The acrobatic play gave the Wildcats a
24-20 win and kept them undefeated going into Saturday's game with
UCLA.

 &HT;    Dogs' center may be out for Tennessee
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Georgia could be without starting center Miles
Luckie for Saturday's SEC showdown against No. 4 Tennessee in
Sanford Stadium. The Volunteers are waiting to see if All-SEC
tailback Jamal Lewis' right knee is fine.
</P>
<P>
   Luckie, a 6-foot-1, 285-pound junior from Clarkston, left
Saturday night's 28-27 win over LSU with a bruised right knee.
Luckie left the game in the third quarter and was replaced by
sophomore Jonas Jennings, the starting right guard. Sophomore
Reggie Stargill of LaGrange replaced Jennings.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Luckie) had an MRI (Sunday) and it came back good for us,''
Bulldogs coach Jim Donnan said. ``He has a badly bruised knee.
We're hoping he can play, but we'll have to see. I'd say he's
questionable.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, the former Douglass High star who ripped the Bulldogs for
232 rushing yards on 22 attempts last year, bruised his right knee
in the Vols' 17-9 win at Auburn. Lewis will undergo an MRI today.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee strong safety Fred White of Griffin injured his left
knee and will undergo an MRI, and reserve defensive end Will
Overstreet is questionable with a thumb injury. The good news for
the Vols: All-SEC linebacker Al Wilson, who missed the Auburn game,
will return to practice today and will play against Georgia.
Offensive tackle Jarvis Reado is doubtful with a foot injury.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings is one of seventh-ranked Georgia's most versatile
players. The offensive line played well against the Tigers, who
sacked quarterback Quincy Carter three times.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's ability to avoid would-be tacklers was a big factor. He
rushed for 72 yards on 14 carries, but finished with 41 yards after
the sacks. Carter was more impressive throwing the ball, completing
27 of 34 attempts for 318 yards and two touchdowns in only his
fourth career start.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was one of the greatest games by a quarterback in any
game, in my opinion,'' Donnan said.
</P>
<P>
   UP NEXT FOR GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Opponent: Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   When: Saturday, 3:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Sanford Stadium, Athens.
</P>
<P>
   TV/radio: CBS; WSB (98.5 FM).

DIVX TAKES ON DVD, RENTAL CASSETTES IN FILM-FORMATTING WAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite test marketing in two cities that did not appear to be a
runaway success, the national rollout is underway for Divx, a
disk-based recorded movie format intended to compete with rental
videocassettes and the emerging DVD digital disk format.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, industry rivals have gone on the counterattack
with newspaper ads in several major cities that extol DVD while
obliquely panning Divx _ a DVD hybrid that allows viewing of a
recorded film only for a limited time, unless buyers pay additional
fees.
</P>
<P>
   The ads were placed by video-rental dealers and Warner Home
Video, a major producer of DVDs that also holds a financial stake
in the format.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Circuit City Stores Inc., the consumer-electronics
retailer that is the primary backer of Divx, began selling players
for the disks and a few dozen Divx recorded movies in San Francisco
and Richmond, Va. The consumer appeal of the format is supposed to
be that the disk does not need to be returned after viewing, since
it simply will not play after an initial 48-hour period unless the
consumer pays additional fees via a telephone line to have it
reactivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nearly everyone knows the hassles of renting movies: late
fees, rewind charges and not being able to get new releases because
they are already rented,'' the company's promotional material says.
</P>
<P>
   Through the summer, Circuit City solicited additional investors
to help pay for the national debut of the format, since the
start-up costs of Divx have been a heavy drag on the company's
bottom line. Circuit City has a two-thirds stake in Divx, and a Los
Angeles law firm holds the other third. No other investors were
found, suggesting that potential investors had not been overly
impressed with the test-market results.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with financial analysts last month, Richard
Sharp, chief executive of Circuit City, said the company had seen
``reasonable results out of our two launch markets.'' Nonetheless,
the company said it was forced to scale back its national
promotional budget to $60 million from $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   A Circuit City spokesman said the company was planning ``a soft
national launch'' for Divx, primarily using newspaper ads. In the
test-market cities, the company aired several television ads.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers of regular DVDs, the CD-size digital disks that
hold a feature-length movie, see Divx as a grave threat. So do
operators of videocassette rental and sales shops. The
manufacturers say they are afraid the differing formats will
confuse consumers and take sales away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Videotape dealers worry that Divx owners will bypass their
stores to buy Divx disks elsewhere. None of the dealers have agreed
to sell Divx disks, meaning that Divx owners have to go to a
Circuit City location or a handful of other consumer-electronics
stores to buy Divx movies.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, which owns Warner Home Video, has been encouraging
video dealers to rent DVDs alongside videotapes, to promote the
format and act as a counter to Divx. Until recently DVDs have been
available only for sale, at a price of about $25. But Time Warner
reported last week that 5,000 of the nation's 20,000 video dealers
nationwide are now stocking rental DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Every movie studio but one, Dreamworks, issues movies in the DVD
format. Most of the studios, though not all of them, also issue
Divx disks.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Warner Home Video is not cooperating with
Divx; nor are Sony's studios. Sony is another stakeholder in DVD.
Circuit City offered all of the studios large cash advances to join
the Divx fold.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner and the software dealers ran their ads in The New
York Times, as well in Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago
newspapers. ``Don't let anyone feed you a line,'' the ad declared
at the top, just above a photo of hand holding the dangling end of
a telephone line. (Divx players must be connected to phone lines so
the company can activate the disk for additional viewings and keep
track of the pay-per-view charges.)
</P>
<P>
   The ad never mentioned Divx by name, but it did list all the
things that the open-format DVD offers that Divx does not,
including: ``No phone hookup necessary; no extra charge for
repeated play; wide-screen picture with exclusive behind the scenes
footage.'' To anyone unfamiliar with the DVD-Divx battle, the ad
may have seemed obscure.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of this month, Circuit City said, Divx players and
disks will be available in 800 consumer-electronics retail stores
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Divx players, costing about $100 more than conventional DVD
players, are being manufactured by three companies: Zenith
Electronics; Panasonic, a unit of Matsushita Electric Industrial,
and Thomson. These companies are promoting their players, but all
of them also sell regular DVD players. As a result, the
manufacturers have not been outspoken Divx proponents.
</P>
<P>
   About 150 movies are available in the format, compared to more
than 2,000 for regular DVD.
</P>
<P>
   A Divx disk costs $4.49, allowing a 48-hour viewing period.
Extending the period requires paying an additional fee of about
$3.50. In most locations, a regular DVD is being rented for two
nights at $2.99.

 By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Michaels has never been known for his
mild-mannered demeanor. Office folklore has it that the 77-year-old
editor of Forbes magazine even fired one of his employees _ whose
wife was pregnant _ on Christmas Day, back in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, no one could be such a Scrooge. So it's thoroughly
surprising that when asked about the incident, the elfin Michaels
tilted back in his chair, adjusted his black-rimmed glasses and
said, ``In those days, well, it might have been Christmas Day.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause. ``But it wasn't, actually. I think it was sometime
during the holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   Call him a grinch or an eminence grise of financial journalism,
but Michaels' transition _ from editor of Forbes for 37 years to
overseer of related editorial projects, a change announced last
week by Steve Forbes, the chief executive of Forbes Inc. _ is
notable for a universe of reasons. Not the least is that Michaels
has long been known as a contrarian fixture of financial
journalism, who is fond of quoting himself: ``If we're saying what
everybody else is saying, then we're not going to bother saying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes' father, Malcolm Forbes, he conceived the Forbes 400
list of wealthiest Americans and established it as a benchmark of
American affluence. He was the face behind the late Forbes' public
one, shying away from the social circuit, choosing to remain an
objective journalist rather than socializing with the people he was
covering.
</P>
<P>
   But the changing of the guard _ Michaels will be replaced by
William Baldwin, Forbes' 47-year-old executive editor _ is not just
one of generations, but of taste and consumer sensibility; in an
attempt to play a game of catch-up with Business Week and Fortune
magazines, Forbes will more closely associate itself with the
booming technology industry. In so doing, Forbes will heighten its
competition with Fortune _ which is published by Time Warner's Time
Inc. and is considered to have a strong grasp of Silicon Valley
commerce _ as well as with McGraw-Hill's Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is a well-known technophile. And with cooperation from
Richard Karlgaard, the new Forbes publisher since July, the
magazine is marking a course toward the warm rays of Silicon
Valley, exploring not only the pockets of technology advertisers,
but stories as well. By November, the Forbes Silicon Valley office
in Burlingame, Calif., will have about 40 staff members, including
both editorial and advertising staff for Forbes and Forbes ASAP, a
technology supplement formerly edited by Karlgaard.
</P>
<P>
   While Fortune and Business Week have both had bureaus in
Northern California for several years, Forbes opened its office
there only last year with seven employees. Karlgaard, in fact, will
also keep his office there; it may be the first time a New
York-based magazine has asked its publisher to maintain his primary
office on the opposite coast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent flurry of reports about dismal advertising
prospects from the technology industry, Karlgaard has remained
optimistic enough to expand the staff of the Silicon Valley outpost
so that it will rival in size the staff of The Wall Street
Journal's San Francisco advertising office and news bureau, which
covers Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On the editorial side, Forbes has hired three new technology
writers in the last few months, and Michaels estimated that ``one
out of three'' covers in the last year has focused on technology.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard said: ``You have to have a holistic way of looking at
technology. In our editorial coverage, in the category of
advertisers we pursue and in how we operate the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultants say that Forbes seems to have made the
strongest recent commitment of any of the general-interest business
magazines toward identifying itself as a technology-driven
publication. ``They've probably looked at Wired, Fast Company and
Business 2.0 and said, `Well, we're not going to quite become them,
but there's a changing focus in what American business is really
concerned with,''' said Martin Walker, a magazine consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know how to read the tea leaves at Forbes are not
sure if its technology coverage is as hard-hitting as Forbes' other
articles have been in the past. Several former staff writers
pointed out that a July 27 cover article titled ``Masters of the
... New Universe'' _ in which several Internet entrepreneurs like
Amazon.com's Jeffrey Bezos and Yahoo's Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang posed
with surfboards _ had an uncharacteristically light touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got a lot of mail from Geekland,'' Baldwin said, pointing
at the cover. ``And the guys all had fun posing with the surfboards
and everything.'' But, he admitted with a shrug of the shoulders,
``It was a sympathetic story about the Internet.'' And Michaels
remarked that the article was ``not a typical Forbes story.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of recent belt-tightening at Ziff-Davis, a technology
publishing subsidiary of Softbank at which the dismissal of 10
percent of the employees was blamed in part on decreasing
technology ad sales, Karlgaard's particularly focused mission as
publisher will be to fatten advertising pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer product advertising is down in the computer
magazines,'' Walker said, referring to Ziff-Davis' closing of three
computer-oriented magazines. ``But it's still a real opportunity
category for the business magazines. They have lots of room to
grow. Forbes is not PC magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's a slump as we sit here today,'' said Alan
Jurmain, director of media services at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, an
advertising agency. ``But I suspect everybody will pull through
over time, and I see nothing on the horizon as potent as technology
advertising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes will meet the other business biweekly, Fortune, in
battle over technology coverage. They have long fought over staff,
and this year Fortune _ which also has several Forbes alumni _
hired three writers away from Forbes. Fortune's sister publication,
Money, has hired away two Forbes staff writers this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is arguable that John Huey's 1995 promotion to editor of
Fortune sparked a fire beneath Forbes. Michaels keeps a note pinned
to the wall in his office _a quote from Huey _ that reads,
``Forbes: They're Nasty, Venal People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that about us once, and I just thought it was
terrific, '' Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   Huey described the rivalry this way: ``It's a bit like
professional wrestling. We have to snarl at each other once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They've always said nasty things about Fortune. But
Fortune used to be run by a bunch of gentlemen who would never say
anything back. Until I came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that he felt Forbes was too ideologically skewed to be
his direct editorial competitor. ``They want to return to the gold
standard and like to write stories about how to avoid paying taxes
by moving to an island somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Huey said that his advertising sales staff considered Forbes
a direct competitor. And while Forbes maintains that its growth in
technology advertising exceeds that of both Fortune and Business
Week, data from the Publishers Information Bureau indicate that it
still lags behind the competition. The bureau estimates that so far
this year the top 10 leading national advertisers in Fortune
includes three technology advertisers. There were five technology
companies in Business Week's top 10. However, there was only one in
the top 10 of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, among the top 10 Forbes advertisers for 1998 to date
are three Forbes affiliate companies: Forbes Magazine Conferences
ranks highest (at 32 pages for the year to date), the Forbes Stock
Market Course, and Forbes Magazine OnLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Forbes giving money to Forbes,'' Walker, the
consultant, said. And it's a way, he said, to inflate the number of
ad pages the magazine reports each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Forbes and Fortune remain neck and neck in terms
of circulation, as they have for the past few years. When Michaels
joined the Forbes staff as a reporter in 1954, circulation was
around 325,000, according to a Forbes spokeswoman. In June 1998,
the magazine had an average paid circulation of 784,220, according
to the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
(In the Oct. 19 issue, the Forbes ownership statement gives its
current average paid circulation as 806,447.)
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Fortune's most recent circulation figure is
767,148. Five years ago, in 1993, Fortune's circulation for the
second half of the year was 786,777. Forbes' circulation for the
same period was 770,008.
</P>
<P>
   In the current year through Sept. 30, ad pages for Forbes were
down slightly: 3,002 pages in the first nine months, a five-tenths
of 1 percent drop from 3,016 pages in the comparable period last
year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. But ad
revenue in the same period rose 5.2 percent, to $165.9 million,
from $157.7 million in the year-earlier period, according to
estimates from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   For Fortune during the same period, ad pages grew 16.5 percent,
to 2,702 from 2,319, and revenue advanced 16.7 percent, to $173.5
million from $148.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Michaels' transition will affect editorial
morale at Forbes; neither he nor Baldwin are known for warm and
fuzzy personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baldwin knows the pH of human blood,'' said one former staff
writer who requested anonymity. ``He knows at what temperature
liquid nitrogen freezes. He knows the 17th root of 4 trillion. He
is a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite Michaels' cantankerous demeanor _ so crotchety that
his editorial remarks on reporters' copy were turned into an
advertising campaign earlier this year _ his concise, if brutal,
editorial hand will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   One staff writer said that Michaels could still edit a
10,000-word article in two hours. And Richard Behar, a staff writer
at Fortune magazine who spent six years at Forbes, summarized the
feeling at the Forbes office when he was there: ``It was always
said that Michaels could edit the Lord's prayer down to six words
and nobody would miss anything.''

TRANSLATING A BRITISH PAPER FOR THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost every weekday morning, Jerri Wildrick pulls her gray van
up to the headquarters of Berkshire Hathaway and delivers a
salmon-pink copy of The Financial Times destined for Warren
Buffett, Berkshire's founder and the nation's best-known and
richest investor.
</P>
<P>
   Getting Buffett his paper means adding a 300-mile weekday round
trip to the normal Chicago-area delivery routes. That extra effort
is emblematic of Pearson PLC's, desire to make the year-old
expansion of its flagship newspaper a success. The goal is to bring
North American circulation up to 100,000 by the end of 1999 by
marketing The Financial Times as the single-malt scotch of
international financial journalism _ then to offer advertisers
worldwide the lure of a U.S. readership with a taste, and income,
for the finer things.
</P>
<P>
   But it may also show what a stretch it could be to pull this
off. The audacious effort to push outward from the Financial Times'
longtime beachheads in Washington and New York, the home base of
The Wall Street Journal, was started a year ago. Now, measured
against itself, The Financial Times _ known familiarly as the FT _
is doing quite well, thank you.
</P>
<P>
   Spurred by substantial price cuts, the Financial Times'
circulation in the United States and Canada has risen to nearly
60,000 from about 37,800 a year ago. (Of the 60,000 about 12,000
are distributed free by airlines or hotels.) Worldwide, the
newspaper's circulation is about 354,000, and early this year, for
the first time, it sold more copies outside Britain than on its own
ground.
</P>
<P>
   But measured against the Wall Street Journal's circulation of
1.8 million, The Financial Times is still a pipsqueak.
</P>
<P>
   That, the Financial Times' editors say, is not the point. Look
at the journalism, urged Robert Thomson, U.S. managing editor, who
pointed out that some early warnings on the Asian financial crisis,
including skeptical pieces on Thai lending policies, ran in 1994,
1995 and 1996, when ``tiger,'' not ``meltdown,'' was the word most
frequently used in discussions of Asian economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``President Clinton's speech last month about global problems
and global solutions and a global summit _ that was an FT speech,''
said Richard Lambert, the newspaper's editor. ``Those issues are
what we're trying to address.'' Lambert spent the last year in New
York helping guide the Financial Times' expansion in North America
_ where it now has printing plants and distribution networks around
New York, Chicago and Los Angeles _ before turning over control of
U.S. coverage to Thomson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We only have a small portion of the niche we're after _
business people, policy makers and academics interested in
international business,'' Lambert said. While the weekday editions
and the expanded Saturday newspaper, with its wide-ranging
political and cultural coverage, are read by Treasury Secretary
Robert Rubin, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Federal Reserve
Chairman Alan Greenspan and people on Wall Street like Robert
Hormats, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., the editors want
more.
</P>
<P>
   In some regions of the world, The Financial Times is struggling.
In Asia, where The Wall Street Journal started an Asian edition in
1976, it outsells the Financial Times 59,000 to 14,000, a 4-to-1
margin. But in continental Europe, The Financial Times outsells the
Journal 102,000 to 54,000. Still, in both continental Europe and
Asia, the Journal fields more full-time reporters.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, where The Financial Times first began
printing a North American edition in 1985, the newspaper has
doubled its reporting staff in the last year and will soon add
bureaus in Houston and Atlanta. But the new total is just 22
reporters, compared with several hundred at The Journal.
</P>
<P>
   Limited staff resources can push newspapers to mimic wire
services, with reporters writing two or three stories daily.
Thomson is putting more emphasis on longer-term reports. ``A story
done well that is original, that nobody sees anywhere else, is far
more valuable than two or three ordinary stories,'' he said in an
interview last week.
</P>
<P>
   With an eye to offering an alternative to the news judgment of
U.S.-based publications, the editors of the Financial Times' U.S.
edition have recently played down their coverage of the
Clinton-Lewinsky affair. Some subjects that are barely mentioned
elsewhere, like the Chinese central bank's decision last week to
shut down one of the country's largest financial institutions,
received front-page display in The Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson acknowledges that the built-in difficulties of remaking
his newspaper's U.S. editions for a U.S. audience inevitably
conflict with the daily push to get presses rolling. It is hard, he
said, to get London-based editors to think like Americans.

   Marjorie Scardino, the Texas-born chief executive of Pearson, is
widely credited with making The Economist magazine a should-read
among Americans with an interest in foreign affairs. It is the
success she achieved as chief executive of the Economist Group _
which is 50 percent owned by Pearson _ that Financial Times
executives hope to emulate, although a newspaper with daily
deadlines faces different challenges than a glossy weekly magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The 1997 Pearson annual report says that the company committed
more than $25 million to the international expansion of The
Financial Times, which began publication in Britain in 1894. Last
year's expenditures were the first portion of a $160 million
investment. Thus far in 1998, advertising revenues have increased
to more than $1 million, from $600,000 in all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But the same financial troubles that The Financial Times has
covered, from Thailand to Japan and from Russia to Brazil, may
torpedo its plans for growth. A year ago, it cut its U.S. street
price to $1, from $1.50, and its annual subscription price to $184
for an introductory one-year offer (the cost doubles on renewal),
from about $450. Even so, with profits falling on Wall Street, will
financial institutions like Merrill Lynch, Bankers Trust and others
be able to justify pricey reading material for their executives?
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an audience of people who will undeniably buy The
Financial Times,'' said Karen Elliott House, the president of Dow
Jones' International Group. ``But the audience for all that British
news in the FT and the rest of their global news is limited.''
</P>
<P>
   But if compared to The Journal, the Financial Times seems a
mouse scurrying at the feet of an elephant, it is a mouse with
attitude. While Ms. House, a former foreign editor of The Journal,
notes, ``We print a ton of international news,'' Thomson coolly
replies: ``We'll never go head to head with The Wall Street Journal
in covering U.S. corporate news. Because we're a global business
newspaper, we are selective. People want a guide to the
international events that matter.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Michaels has never been known for his
mild-mannered demeanor. Office folklore has it that the 77-year-old
editor of Forbes magazine even fired one of his employees _ whose
wife was pregnant _ on Christmas Day, back in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Surely, no one could be such a Scrooge. So it's thoroughly
surprising that when asked about the incident, the elfin Michaels
tilted back in his chair, adjusted his black-rimmed glasses and
said, ``In those days, well, it might have been Christmas Day.''
</P>
<P>
   A pause. ``But it wasn't, actually. I think it was sometime
during the holiday season.''
</P>
<P>
   Call him a grinch or an eminence grise of financial journalism,
but Michaels' transition _ from editor of Forbes for 37 years to
overseer of related editorial projects, a change announced last
week by Steve Forbes, the chief executive of Forbes Inc. _ is
notable for a universe of reasons. Not the least is that Michaels
has long been known as a contrarian fixture of financial
journalism, who is fond of quoting himself: ``If we're saying what
everybody else is saying, then we're not going to bother saying
it.''
</P>
<P>
   With Forbes' father, Malcolm Forbes, he conceived the Forbes 400
list of wealthiest Americans and established it as a benchmark of
American affluence. He was the face behind the late Forbes' public
one, shying away from the social circuit, choosing to remain an
objective journalist rather than socializing with the people he was
covering.
</P>
<P>
   But the changing of the guard _ Michaels will be replaced by
William Baldwin, Forbes' 47-year-old executive editor _ is not just
one of generations, but of taste and consumer sensibility; in an
attempt to play a game of catch-up with Business Week and Fortune
magazines, Forbes will more closely associate itself with the
booming technology industry. In so doing, Forbes will heighten its
competition with Fortune _ which is published by Time Warner's Time
Inc. and is considered to have a strong grasp of Silicon Valley
commerce _ as well as with McGraw-Hill's Business Week.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is a well-known technophile. And with cooperation from
Richard Karlgaard, the new Forbes publisher since July, the
magazine is marking a course toward the warm rays of Silicon
Valley, exploring not only the pockets of technology advertisers,
but stories as well. By November, the Forbes Silicon Valley office
in Burlingame, Calif., will have about 40 staff members, including
both editorial and advertising staff for Forbes and Forbes ASAP, a
technology supplement formerly edited by Karlgaard.
</P>
<P>
   While Fortune and Business Week have both had bureaus in
Northern California for several years, Forbes opened its office
there only last year with seven employees. Karlgaard, in fact, will
also keep his office there; it may be the first time a New
York-based magazine has asked its publisher to maintain his primary
office on the opposite coast.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent flurry of reports about dismal advertising
prospects from the technology industry, Karlgaard has remained
optimistic enough to expand the staff of the Silicon Valley outpost
so that it will rival in size the staff of The Wall Street
Journal's San Francisco advertising office and news bureau, which
covers Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   On the editorial side, Forbes has hired three new technology
writers in the last few months, and Michaels estimated that ``one
out of three'' covers in the last year has focused on technology.
</P>
<P>
   Karlgaard said: ``You have to have a holistic way of looking at
technology. In our editorial coverage, in the category of
advertisers we pursue and in how we operate the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Industry consultants say that Forbes seems to have made the
strongest recent commitment of any of the general-interest business
magazines toward identifying itself as a technology-driven
publication. ``They've probably looked at Wired, Fast Company and
Business 2.0 and said, `Well, we're not going to quite become them,
but there's a changing focus in what American business is really
concerned with,''' said Martin Walker, a magazine consultant.
</P>
<P>
   But those who know how to read the tea leaves at Forbes are not
sure if its technology coverage is as hard-hitting as Forbes' other
articles have been in the past. Several former staff writers
pointed out that a July 27 cover article titled ``Masters of the
... New Universe'' _ in which several Internet entrepreneurs like
Amazon.com's Jeffrey Bezos and Yahoo's Jerry Chih-Yuan Yang posed
with surfboards _ had an uncharacteristically light touch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That got a lot of mail from Geekland,'' Baldwin said, pointing
at the cover. ``And the guys all had fun posing with the surfboards
and everything.'' But, he admitted with a shrug of the shoulders,
``It was a sympathetic story about the Internet.'' And Michaels
remarked that the article was ``not a typical Forbes story.''
</P>
<P>
   In light of recent belt-tightening at Ziff-Davis, a technology
publishing subsidiary of Softbank at which the dismissal of 10
percent of the employees was blamed in part on decreasing
technology ad sales, Karlgaard's particularly focused mission as
publisher will be to fatten advertising pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer product advertising is down in the computer
magazines,'' Walker said, referring to Ziff-Davis' closing of three
computer-oriented magazines. ``But it's still a real opportunity
category for the business magazines. They have lots of room to
grow. Forbes is not PC magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there's a slump as we sit here today,'' said Alan
Jurmain, director of media services at Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS, an
advertising agency. ``But I suspect everybody will pull through
over time, and I see nothing on the horizon as potent as technology
advertising.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Forbes will meet the other business biweekly, Fortune, in
battle over technology coverage. They have long fought over staff,
and this year Fortune _ which also has several Forbes alumni _
hired three writers away from Forbes. Fortune's sister publication,
Money, has hired away two Forbes staff writers this year.
</P>
<P>
   It is arguable that John Huey's 1995 promotion to editor of
Fortune sparked a fire beneath Forbes. Michaels keeps a note pinned
to the wall in his office _a quote from Huey _ that reads,
``Forbes: They're Nasty, Venal People.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He said that about us once, and I just thought it was
terrific, '' Michaels said.
</P>
<P>
   Huey described the rivalry this way: ``It's a bit like
professional wrestling. We have to snarl at each other once in a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``They've always said nasty things about Fortune. But
Fortune used to be run by a bunch of gentlemen who would never say
anything back. Until I came along.''
</P>
<P>
   Huey said that he felt Forbes was too ideologically skewed to be
his direct editorial competitor. ``They want to return to the gold
standard and like to write stories about how to avoid paying taxes
by moving to an island somewhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Huey said that his advertising sales staff considered Forbes
a direct competitor. And while Forbes maintains that its growth in
technology advertising exceeds that of both Fortune and Business
Week, data from the Publishers Information Bureau indicate that it
still lags behind the competition. The bureau estimates that so far
this year the top 10 leading national advertisers in Fortune
includes three technology advertisers. There were five technology
companies in Business Week's top 10. However, there was only one in
the top 10 of Forbes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, among the top 10 Forbes advertisers for 1998 to date
are three Forbes affiliate companies: Forbes Magazine Conferences
ranks highest (at 32 pages for the year to date), the Forbes Stock
Market Course, and Forbes Magazine OnLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Forbes giving money to Forbes,'' Walker, the
consultant, said. And it's a way, he said, to inflate the number of
ad pages the magazine reports each year.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Forbes and Fortune remain neck and neck in terms
of circulation, as they have for the past few years. When Michaels
joined the Forbes staff as a reporter in 1954, circulation was
around 325,000, according to a Forbes spokeswoman. In June 1998,
the magazine had an average paid circulation of 784,220, according
to the most recent figures from the Audit Bureau of Circulations.
(In the Oct. 19 issue, the Forbes ownership statement gives its
current average paid circulation as 806,447.)
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Fortune's most recent circulation figure is
767,148. Five years ago, in 1993, Fortune's circulation for the
second half of the year was 786,777. Forbes' circulation for the
same period was 770,008.
</P>
<P>
   In the current year through Sept. 30, ad pages for Forbes were
down slightly: 3,002 pages in the first nine months, a five-tenths
of 1 percent drop from 3,016 pages in the comparable period last
year, according to the Publishers Information Bureau. But ad
revenue in the same period rose 5.2 percent, to $165.9 million,
from $157.7 million in the year-earlier period, according to
estimates from the bureau.
</P>
<P>
   For Fortune during the same period, ad pages grew 16.5 percent,
to 2,702 from 2,319, and revenue advanced 16.7 percent, to $173.5
million from $148.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear whether Michaels' transition will affect editorial
morale at Forbes; neither he nor Baldwin are known for warm and
fuzzy personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baldwin knows the pH of human blood,'' said one former staff
writer who requested anonymity. ``He knows at what temperature
liquid nitrogen freezes. He knows the 17th root of 4 trillion. He
is a machine.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite Michaels' cantankerous demeanor _ so crotchety that
his editorial remarks on reporters' copy were turned into an
advertising campaign earlier this year _ his concise, if brutal,
editorial hand will be missed.
</P>
<P>
   One staff writer said that Michaels could still edit a
10,000-word article in two hours. And Richard Behar, a staff writer
at Fortune magazine who spent six years at Forbes, summarized the
feeling at the Forbes office when he was there: ``It was always
said that Michaels could edit the Lord's prayer down to six words
and nobody would miss anything.''

<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ To put it bluntly, Michael Naumann swims
with the sharks instead of the carps since he abandoned the
rarefied world of New York publishing for a rank as German culture
minister and a political career that can so far be counted by the
months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though he's now a nouveau politician and no longer chief
executive of the publishing house Henry Holt &AMP; Co., part of
Verlagsgruppe Georg von Holtzbrinck, he came to mingle with
publishers at the 50th annual Frankfurt Book Fair. The sprawling
yearly rite of the book industry last week drew some 6,700 national
publishers promoting more than 360,000 titles.
</P>
<P>
   It was a literary homecoming for Naumann, 56, who for years
roamed the vast exhibition space as a publisher for Henry Holt and
before that as head of the German publishing house Rowohlt Verlag.
</P>
<P>
   At the cramped Henry Holt booth, there was no publisher in
evidence this week to replace Naumann, who abruptly resigned last
summer. He agreed then to take the ministry position if the Social
Democrats won national elections, which they did this month. Yet,
here at the book fair, the new culture minister was still willing
to promote Henry Holt titles developed under his watch, like a
biography of Anne Frank.
</P>
<P>
   But there are clear limits on what Naumann will promote in his
new role as a publisher turned politician.
</P>
<P>
   German literature, for instance. ``If I start to promote a book
for one publisher, then 10 others will get angry,'' he said after
appearing on a panel discussing the market for German literature.
``Don't expect Michael Naumann to run around saying, `Buy German
literature.' What you do is provide financial support to
institutions that are already doing this work.''
</P>
<P>
   With a $2 billion budget, Naumann no longer has to worry about
book sales; he will be doling out money to support major
symphonies, museums and castles. One of his primary goals is to
nurture and develop cultural institutions in eastern Germany, he
said. He also has plans to start musical academies for young people
and a refugee program for writers and intellectuals exiled from
their home countries.
</P>
<P>
   In the gossipy publishing world that he fled, Naumann's frank
comments sometimes kept him from being a popular figure. He
irritated some U.S. publishers with his decision to boycott the
annual National Book Awards dinner when the judges failed to
nominate his author, Thomas Pynchon, for a prize for ``Mason &AMP;
Dixon.'' Several U.S. publishers questioned any criticism from
Holt, saying that it had suffered losses up to $8 million last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Such griping seems rather tame now to Naumann, who said he had
quickly learned the differences between the cultures of publishing
and politics. Without being specific, he complained about turf
disputes. ``I always thought that publishing, in a way, is full of
sharks,'' he said. ``I now know we are all carps _ carps compared
to the sharks of politics.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Naumann has already made his mark in his new environment,
particularly with his penchant for outspokenness. Just a few days
after he was nominated to be the Social Democrats' cultural czar,
he stirred a fiery debate by raising the issue of whether Germany
should abandon its project to build a huge memorial to victims of
the Nazi Holocaust near the Reichstag building, the national
parliament house in Berlin. ``The real memorials in Germany are the
concentration camps,'' he said at the time, adding that the
memorial would ``not lead psychologically to what a simple visit to
Bergen-Belsen evokes in a more shocking manner.''
</P>
<P>
   Helmut Kohl, who was toppled as chancellor in the election last
month, mused after Naumann made his comments: ``It's hard to see
how you could smash much more china than this man has done in just
a few hours.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Frankfurt fair, some Germans in publishing circles were
still talking about election-night news clips that they said showed
Naumann jockeying to get closer to the newly elected chancellor,
Gerhard Schroeder.
</P>
<P>
   With his political career just two months old, Naumann said he
now understood the attractions of politics, although the ministry
position represents a two-thirds cut in pay from what he was making
at Holt. There was the moment when he returned to Koethen, his
hometown in the former East Germany, where a former classmate is
now the mayor, and was greeted by people he hadn't seen in 40
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm finding out why politicians do this,'' he said. ``It's
exciting. It gets the adrenaline going. You get your highs through
huge crowds.''
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Naumann considered applying for U.S.
citizenship, a step that obviously is foreclosed now for him. ``To
be frank, I miss America,'' he said as he walked away from the book
fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this fails,'' he added, ``I don't have any doubt that I
would turn around with my suitcase and go back to try to find a job
in the United States.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Such was the paranoia at CBS News last week, before
some 120 employees were laid off, that several high-level CBS
journalists passed along an ominous rumor: Mel Karmazin, president
and chief operating officer of CBS Inc., had told Andrew Heyward,
president of CBS News, that the network should get out of the
news-gathering business because it cannot compete with the 24-hour
news channels.
</P>
<P>
   That comment was never made, both men say. But part of it would
have been right on the money. CBS cannot compete with CNN, MSNBC
and Fox News Channel in the 24-news business. Nor can ABC and NBC.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean they are getting out of the news-gathering
business. But it does mean they are significantly changing the way
they conduct it.
</P>
<P>
   The evening newscasts have been reshaped, foreign and domestic
bureaus have been closed or downsized, correspondents are being
asked to move faster and do more and the broadcasters are relying
more on nonnetwork personnel to gather the news.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, broadcasters have been reassessing what
news coverage means to them as a result of three powerful forces:
</P>
<P>
   _ The 24-hour news networks will almost always be first to
report a story and be able to stay with it longer.
</P>
<P>
   _ The precarious economics of the broadcast business _ where
billions of dollars are spent for football and basketball contracts
and hundreds of millions for shows like ``ER'' and ``Home
Improvement'' _ have given the Big Three news divisions no choice
but to slice budgets.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the swiftly evolving wizardry of satellite and computer
technology has enabled networks to produce news reports much faster
and more efficiently, while also enabling them to rely more on
footage from partner networks in other countries and from the two
giant video news agencies, Reuters Television, a division of
Reuters Holdings PLC, and APTN (Associated Press Television News).
</P>
<P>
   ``The technological advances and the economic realities of
networks are paralleling each other,'' said Bob Murphy, senior vice
president for hard news at ABC. ``We have to figure out how to make
the most of that, and how to make sure our management of resources
on the editorial side becomes stronger because of these changes,
not more superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   How to be stronger on tighter-than-ever budgets is the Big Three
networks' challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the challenge is the growth of CNN, a unit of Time
Warner Inc., and especially after the Gulf War in 1991, television
news viewers have had ``a massive change in expectations,'' said
Nigel Baker, head of news operations for APTN in London. ``Five
years ago, people had a hope for same-day pictures. Now they expect
same-hour, if not same-minute, pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   The technology and partnerships and the need to be distinctive
from the 24-hour channels are combining to change the roles of
crews and correspondents. On most breaking news stories, video will
be the same, whether shot by APTN or Reuters crew or by an ABC, CBS
or NBC crew. So the networks have cut back on crews. But they are
also deploying them on more in-depth stories that require _ and
show off _ their own correspondents' expertise.
</P>
<P>
   They have to pay for it, too _ salaries range up to about
$500,000 for a top foreign correspondent. Because those men and
women are expected to report with greater depth and to cover more
territory and issues, the premium on keeping the good ones is
greater than ever.
</P>
<P>
   So is getting the most out of them. Gone are the days of the
``bon vivant'' correspondent, who stayed in capitals like Paris,
London or Rome; lunched regularly with the foreign minister, and
when sent on a story farther afield was accompanied by a producer,
an editor, camera and sound crew and sometimes extra people to
handle the bulky and technically complex equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, we can pack a satellite uplink in a couple of metal cases
as airline baggage,'' said Bill Wheatley, executive vice president
of NBC News. ``And digital equipment will soon mean taking an
editing deck the size of an attache case.''
</P>
<P>
   With laptop computers and cell phones, a correspondent can go
afield with a lone camera person, file a story, and consult on the
editing with someone in London or New York. And with the layoffs
over the last few months, there are fewer editors, producers and
researchers to consult with.
</P>
<P>
   One CBS correspondent, after hearing of the 120 or so layoffs
(from a staff of 1,600), said he could hardly mind the extra work.
Traveling a bit more and having pieces edited at a central hub
operation was not exactly hardship duty. Sounding enormously
relieved, he said, ``They could have wiped us out, but they
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   But at NBC, where foreign correspondents used to complain that
they rarely got stories on ``Nightly News with Tom Brokaw'' because
NBC uses fewer foreign news stories than ABC or CBS, some
correspondents now complain of burnout. They are asked to file for
MSNBC regularly, for CNBC sometimes, and for msnbc.com, the Web
site the network operates jointly with Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic correspondents, too, face the same pressures and are
also occasionally asked to file stories for the news magazine
``Dateline.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, on all three networks' nightly 6:30 newscasts, there are
fewer slots for stories than there were 10 or even five years ago,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have nine or 10 stories each night of about a
minute-and-a-half each,'' Ortiz said. ``Now, we spend more time on
longer segments that tend to be shot over several days and have
more depth, more analysis. We feel less need to extract nine, 10 or
11 hard-news offers out of the news each night to fill up the
broadcast.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tyndall Report, which tracks coverage of different types
of stories on all the networks, has found a steady decline in
foreign stories used. Until 1996, ABC used more reports from its
foreign bureaus than the other two did; since then, CBS has had a
slight lead. NBC deliberately uses more domestic stories, believing
viewers are more interested in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the Berlin Wall fell and the Cold War was seen to
be over, there's been a de-emphasis on foreign news,'' said Richard
Wald, senior vice president for editorial quality at ABC News.
``That has stopped the overseas bureaus from growing, and has begun
a slow attrition of the amount of overseas coverage done and the
money spent on it. Money follows interest, not the other way
around.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Agency reports fill in the gaps, or at least can be on hand as
protection, as back-up footage to be used if a story suddenly
becomes more newsworthy and a report must be pulled together
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Wheatley, executive vice president of NBC News, said
another factor helping the Big Three networks feel they are still
able to stay atop foreign news developments is their partnerships
with networks in other nations.
</P>
<P>
   NBC has alliances in Britain with ITN, in Germany with ZDF and
in Japan with Nippon TV. They also share bureau space, which helps
save money; NBC's Frankfurt bureau is in ZDF's headquarters, for
example. NBC recently closed most of its Tokyo bureau, keeping only
an office space where visiting correspondents or producers can
work.
</P>
<P>
   ABC News shares bureau space with its Japanese partner, NHK, in
Moscow, Tokyo and some smaller cities where ABC has stringers and
NHK has a bureau, like Bangkok, Thailand, and Seoul, South Korea.
ABC's British partner is the BBC, with whom they share offices in
Paris, Cairo, Egypt, and Delhi, India (ABC has no correspondent in
those cities, however).
</P>
<P>
   Such affiliation agreements are CNN's hallmark. CNN boasts of
having 23 fully staffed bureaus in foreign cities and 10 in the
United States, but both CNN/USA and its global counterpart, CNN
International, also use extensive amounts of footage from Reuters
and APTN, and from their mutual-affiliation partners.
</P>
<P>
   Eason Jordan, CNN's president of global news-gathering, said the
network has two-way contracts with more than 550 television
stations in the United States alone and more than 200 foreign
networks, ranging from the BBC to Iranian state television. Those
contacts are one reason why CBS News has had preliminary talks in
the past about a cooperative arrangement with CNN.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have twice as many affiliates in the U.S. as any broadcast
network, because we operate on a nonexclusive basis,'' he said.
``When there's a big story _ a plane crash or the O.J. Simpson
Bronco chase or whatever _ we have multiple feeds available,
whereas broadcasters rely on just one station. It gives us a
tremendous competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   And that advantage greatly annoys the Big Three networks, whose
affiliates and in some cases owned stations have these reciprocal
contracts with CNN. That way, the stations can be sure of getting
pictures from a breaking news story almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``That used to be the role of the traditional three broadcast
networks,'' said Jim Williams, vice president and director of
broadcast services for APTN. ``Being first, having it right. They
can't be first anymore, so their competitive strategy has changed
to one of being more expert, giving more in-depth analysis and
bringing context to the story. Which means better reporting, better
writing and making strategic decisions to invest in their
correspondents.''
</P>
<P>
   How well protected are those assets when support staff are cut?
That is a question raised by the cuts at CBS last week, and the
less publicized cuts at NBC and ABC earlier this fall. Can context,
depth and insight be provided if correspondents are working with
fewer producers, fewer researchers, less supervision as to what
stories to pursue and how to shape them?
</P>
<P>
   This remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the networks have to do is become less like the basic
news provider, which the 24-hour news services are, and more like a
value-added provider,'' said Richard Wald. ``That's the current
that is pulling us all forward now.''

THE MAKING OF AN `IT' GIRL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The star's angelic face was everywhere. The reviews were mostly
glowing. The show was being called the next ``Dawson's Creek'' or
the next ``Ally McBeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In every way ``Felicity,'' a new drama on the fast-charging WB
network about a girl's journey to college and self-discovery, was
the single new show to go into the television season resounding
with buzz _ the swirl of publicity, promotion and press coverage
that usually converts into a cultural phenomenon and the next big
thing on television.
</P>
<P>
   The hype was so exquisitely successful that during a
season-opening lunch in Hollywood, program executives at rival
networks identified ``Felicity'' as the new show they would most
like to steal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, only two weeks into the run of the series,
``Felicity'' stands not only as a classic example of a perfectly
orchestrated symphony of buzz, but perhaps of its limitations.
</P>
<P>
   No other new show this fall attracted anything like the
attention given to ``Felicity,'' whose star, Keri Russell, was on
the covers of ``Seventeen'' and ``Detour'' magazines before the
show went on the air. And indeed, the build-up resulted in the best
rating for any new show in WB's short history.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike ``Dawson's Creek,'' the object of a similarly crafted
campaign last season, ``Felicity'' is apparently not escalating _
or even holding _ the pre-premiere excitement.
</P>
<P>
   In week two, ``Felicity'' fell 2 percentage points in its
national share of audience. It lost 4 percentage points among
teen-agers. Surprisingly, ``Felicity'' finds itself trailing other
new series in appealing to teen-agers including ABC's ``Two of a
Kind'' and ``Brother's Keeper.''
</P>
<P>
   More pointedly, last Tuesday, the second episode of ``Felicity''
finished behind ``Costello'' _ a comedy on Fox considered such a
flop that it was the first series of the season canceled last week
_ in the categories of overall number of viewers; viewers between
the ages of 18 and 49, considered the most important sales category
for advertisers, and even women between 18 and 34, a category more
suited to WB's other successful shows.
</P>
<P>
   WB merits a break when measured against the larger networks
because the latter's station lineups are much stronger. But even
Paul Schulman, whose agency buys time for advertisers, and the man
whose early endorsement of ``Felicity'' was used by WB as the fuse
to ignite its promotion campaign, expressed concern about the
drop-off.
</P>
<P>
   In a comparison that made ``Felicity'' sound like a high-tech
initial public offering whose price was bid up before it hit the
market, Schulman said: ``A six share in the second week is
respectable. If week three is a four share, I'd say, if that's a
stock, it might be time to sell.''
</P>
<P>
   That's not likely to happen. In an exercise that illustrates the
symbiosis between the world of network television and national
magazines, both of which gear themselves disproportionately to
attracting younger consumers, Entertainment Weekly and TV Guide
have already discussed cover deals with ``Felicity'' for upcoming
issues.
</P>
<P>
   TV Guide's plan is for Ms. Russell to share the cover on the
Nov. 7 issue with David Boreanaz, of another WB series, ``Buffy,
The Vampire Slayer,'' as two representatives of ``young
Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   Steven Reddicliffe, the editor of TV Guide, said the magazine
has done extremely well in the past with youth-oriented covers on
``Dawson's Creek,'' ``South Park'' and ``Buffy.'' He said the goal
of increasing newsstand sales was one reason to go for a
``Felicity'' cover this early in its life. Another, he said, is
``it's a good show.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those reasons all apply to the decision-making at Entertainment
Weekly as well. Mary Kaye Schilling, the assistant managing editor
who oversees the magazine's television coverage, said, ``We made
them an offer of a cover.''
</P>
<P>
   But one thing does concern her. ``The second episode was very
slow,'' she said. ``They need to do another good episode. `Dawson'
took off and just kept going. We need to see what happens before we
commit to the cover.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schilling was among the first targets of WB's skillful
efforts to make ``Felicity'' its new ``Dawson's Creek.'' She was
sent a copy of the show's script before it was even filmed, and she
made the decision to assign a writer to follow the show's path to
the air.
</P>
<P>
   The early tipoff of possible breakthrough hits to media outlets
that want to be identified with the next hot, young show has been a
hallmark of WB's innovative approach to establishing public
awareness of its shows.
</P>
<P>
   First, WB takes the daring step of singling out just one new
show for special saturation promotion. Of the $4.5 million the
network spent to promote its new season, said Bob Bibb, the
co-executive vice president of marketing for WB, ``about half went
to `Felicity.'''
</P>
<P>
   Getting advertisers _ and the press _ excited is at the heart of
the strategy. It begins, said Brad Turrell, the senior vice
president of publicity for WB, with the program department
``delivering a really good show.''
</P>
<P>
   Convinced that ``Felicity'' was just that, Turrell said, the
network, weeks before the May presentations of fall schedules to
the advertising industry, sent off the pilot to Schulman, who
acknowledged that ``I'm known as someone who will take a public
stand on something if I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   He liked ``Felicity'' and Keri Russell very much. ``She couldn't
have been more precious,'' he said. Schulman was so immediately
taken with the show, he said, that he contacted several of his
clients, including Ralston-Purina, Gap, and Pier One. ``All of them
are now sponsors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The same day the show was unveiled to advertisers in New York
(with Ms. Russell a special guest at Schulman's table), WB's press
office sent out 600 tapes of the pilot to critics around the
country. That set off the steady stream of mentions that WB had
found the next ``Dawson's Creek.''
</P>
<P>
   After that, the show was marketed as though WB was releasing a
movie, with posters in movie theaters, hanging mobiles above the
popcorn machines, even trailers that played along with the coming
attractions. To reach rock music fans, WB not only purchased a
Madonna song, ``The Power of Love,'' to use as the ``Felicity''
theme song, it also bought up the rights to the background music on
the hold-button message on Ticketmaster's phone lines for people
calling to buy tickets to rock concerts.
</P>
<P>
   The network also bought commercials on Channel One, the news
channel fed daily into high schools. To bring in Seventeen, WB made
a deal that got Ms. Russell on the cover. In return, Seventeen got
to join with WB to produce an hourlong special on the network about
teen-oriented movies and television shows in the coming season.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the cover treatment, ``Felicity'' received splashy,
pre-debut features in numerous other magazines including Vanity
Fair and Time, the latter writing: ``Polished execution and an
enormously appealing cast may make the hype prophetic rather than a
curse.''
</P>
<P>
   But might the glittering build-up have created unreasonable
expectations for a show that may take time to find its true
footing? Ms. Schilling thinks so. ``We really loved the pilot,''
she said. ``But the show has to find its way. It has to lighten
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Schulman said, ``Serial dramas take time to build. `Melrose
Place' was getting numbers in its first year that were very
cancellable.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox stayed with that show and it emerged as a true hit, not just
a buzz hit, even though it was on the cover of People magazine
before it went on the air.
</P>
<P>
   The connection is no accident. Many of the top WB executives
learned the business of buzz creation in the early days of Fox.
They know how to tap into advertising and media outlets hungering
for the next big hit with the young audience.
</P>
<P>
   So get ready, Turrell said, for a show called ``Zoe Bean,'' a
midseason comedy WB is already labeling `` `Seinfeld' for teens.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the dust settles on `Felicity,' '' Turrell said, ``we'll
start hitting key people with `Zoe.' We'll be getting the first
tapes out in early November.''

 ADVERTISING: STARTLING NEWS FROM ANA 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Fla. _ The annual conferences and meetings of the
advertising industry trade associations are almost always like
Kabuki or No theater _ highly stylized, ritualized events carefully
choreographed on the theory that, to quote the old ad slogan, the
best surprise is no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   So it was startling when officials at the 89th annual conference
of the Association of National Advertisers, held here at the
Ritz-Carlton Hotel this weekend, sharply deviated from the familiar
patterns with unexpected news: They would for the first time open
their membership to regional and national agencies that create all
types of advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``These agencies represent brand marketers' most important
partners in building brand equity,'' John Sarsen Jr., president and
chief executive of the association, said at the general session on
Friday. ``Together, major marketers and major marketing
communications agencies can build the most powerful, resourceful,
effective brand-building association in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to add as full members agencies that produce
advertising from television commercials and Web site banners to
ethnic campaigns and direct mail galvanized attendees, quickly
overshadowing the entire agenda of the meeting. They spoke of
virtually nothing else before and after the three daily general
sessions and during receptions and meals.
</P>
<P>
   One reason the decision so dominated the conference was because
it pointed up a rift between the association and its counterpart
trade organization for Madison Avenue, the American Association of
Advertising Agencies. Three top officers of the agency association,
who were here attending the advertiser meeting, said they knew
nothing about the decision until moments before Sarsen announced
it.
</P>
<P>
   The three executives tried to put the best face they could on
the decision. ``Any initiative that will allow agencies to get
closer to clients is welcomed by the AAAA,'' said O. Burtch Drake,
president and chief executive of the agency association. ``What
agency doesn't want a chance to sit down with clients?''
</P>
<P>
   But Drake and his colleagues expressed dismay and concern at
being kept in the dark about such a significant change, which could
have profound implications for agencies and the agency association.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a courtesy that exists in the trade association
business,'' Drake said. ``You give someone a heads-up regardless of
the issue.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the advertiser association will not require its
prospective agency members to also be members of the agency
association _ meaning they could cancel memberships in one as they
join the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take what appears to be a problem and make it an
opportunity,'' said Michael Donahue, executive vice president of
the agency association.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to alter the membership rules, which was approved
unanimously by the board of the advertiser association and ratified
unanimously by the full membership, marked the second aggressive
effort in a year to seek income where in the past there had been
only outgo.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1997 conference, the advertiser association began selling
sponsorships of the general sessions, at an estimated $100,000
each, to the media companies from which advertisers buy commercial
time and ad space. That highly unusual practice, which continued
here this year, prompted grumbling from many attendees about
sitting through thinly veiled sales pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the agencies to which advertisers pay commissions and fees
are being asked to pay the advertiser association's membership
dues, to be calculated on a sliding scale based on billings or
income.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to admit agencies as members ``is not
revenue-driven,'' said John Costello, the 1998-99 chairman of the
advertiser association who is also senior executive vice president
and general marketing manager at Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. Rather, he
added, because ``our mission is to focus on brand-building,'' it
made sense to reach out to ``our closest business-building
partners, the advertising agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   Sarsen and Costello said that many details were still to be
worked out, including exactly what the range of agency membership
dues would be or even how many ad agencies were expected to sign
up.
</P>
<P>
   But asked whether media companies would now be considered for
membership as well, Sarsen replied that the agencies were ``right
at the top of the list,'' and the media, which he referred to as
``delivery vehicles,'' were ``at the bottom of the list.''
</P>
<P>
   Drake had a caustic response to that. ``Why not include the
media?'' he asked. ``They've already sold the meeting to them.''
</P>
<P>
   At a briefing after the general session, Sarsen and Costello
defended their decision not to discuss the change with the agency
association officers until after its approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt an obligation to talk to our members and board
first,'' Costello said. But he added that ``we did talk to some
selected friends to get their input and guidance.''
</P>
<P>
   One such friend was Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief
executive of the Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of WPP Group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   A supportive quotation from Ms. Lazarus, the 1998-99 vice
chairwoman of the agency association, was displayed on a large
screen as Sarsen announced the decision. The statement quoted her
as calling the decision ``a good first step'' that ``begins an
important dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Pressed to explain why Ms. Lazarus was consulted when other top
agency association leaders were not, Sarsen said that the criterion
was to talk to agency executives that ``someone was pretty close
to.'' Indeed, Ms. Lazarus works closely with Costello because
Ogilvy is a main agency of Sears.
</P>
<P>
   That relationship raises an issue: Will agency executives feel
obligated to join the advertiser association to satisfy or mollify
clients?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to say no,'' Drake asserted. ``It's like getting a
call from a client saying: `I'm being honored at the Waldorf. Would
you like to take a table?' Agencies take a table.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   F. Stone Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Gotham Inc.,
an agency in New York owned by Interpublic Group of Cos., said:
``There's no question agencies will join the ANA. We're going to
follow the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick McGrath, the 1998-99 chairman of the agency association,
said that he did not view the decision ``as any kind of a threat''
to agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put out their hands and said, `Come join us in helping
build our brands,''' said McGrath, who is also chairman and chief
executive of Jordan McGrath Case &AMP; Partners in New York. ``It's a
real plus for agencies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't have felt so good if, for instance, they wanted
management consultants,'' he added. That was a reference to the
fears among agencies that consultants are usurping their role in
developing brand-building advertising for clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like the ANA is looking for free branding advice,''
said Tom Messner, partner at Messner Vetere Berger McNamee
Schmetterer Euro RSCG, a unit of Havas Advertising in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the point'' in joining the advertiser association,
he added. ``I don't think it makes sense unless they have some good
health insurance plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Messner's viewpoint seemed to be in the minority.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt I would join,'' said Mary Lou Quinlan, chief
executive at N.W. Ayer &AMP; Partners, a unit of MacManus Group in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we'll have to appreciate the opportunity,'' she added,
``and give the advertisers time for peer networking among
themselves. Otherwise, it'll be everybody on the hunt and the
advertisers will say, `Is this what I signed on for?'''
</P>
<P>
   David Ropes, director for corporate advertising and integrated
marketing at Ford Motor Co., agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to lose the ability to get together and talk
about our mutual interests,'' he said of the advertisers. ``We want
to incentivize agencies to become full marketing partners. But the
intention is not to turn this into a meeting for a thousand
people.''

   CLINTON-ASSESS (Washington) _ News Analysis: Examining the
Clinton administration's foreign policy, and reflecting on the
failure to push the Caspian initiative or forge ahead on the Middle
East peace talks. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   PHOENICIAN-SHIPS (Undated) _ The Phoenicians were the master
seafarers of antiquity, but modern scholarship knows little of the
vanished people and almost nothing of their empire's basis, its
merchant ships. Now, however, the cold depths of the Mediterranean
have yielded a bonanza that might change all that _ if
archeologists and treasure hunters can learn to work together. By

   CLINTON-CONGRESS (Washington) _ Three weeks before the election,
Democrats have decided that the best place to campaign is from the
Capitol. Adopting their own version of the ``Rose Garden
Strategy,'' they are romping around marble hallways demanding that
their Republican counterparts do something _ other than talk about
impeachment, that is. By Alison Mitchell.

   DNA-DATA-BASE (Undated) _ A national DNA data base will be
opened on Tuesday by the FBI. It is the hope of advocates of an
increasing array of DNA techniques that they will significantly
reduce rape and other crimes by catching repeat offenders earlier.
This new generation of forensic DNA techniques promises to be so
efficient that some civil libertarians fear the data bases will be
expanded to include almost everyone, giving the state inordinate
powers over its citizens.
</P>
<P>
   RURAL-AIDS (Lowry City, Mo.) _ Rural America is becoming a new
frontier for AIDS, as the experience of patients and people trying
to help them is aggravated by social taboos, remote locations,
poverty and lack of education. And, as the HIV virus becomes more
common in women nationally, health experts are especially worried
about rural women because they are often more isolated, less
independent and less assertive. By Pam Belluck.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SCHOOLS (Houston) _ A coalition of Christian
conservatives, favoring home-schooling, vouchers, the mandated
teaching of creationism, heavy editing of textbooks and a breaking
down of the wall between church and state, at least as far as
public schools are involved, now control five seats on the Texas
state school board. Because of a fluke, they are guaranteed a sixth
after the election in November. This means that they only need to
win one more to have control of the state board, and they have two
or three opportunities to get it. Many political professionals
believe this, not the Bush race for governor, which is a foregone
conclusion, is the most significant election in Texas this fall. By
Rick Lyman.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Microsoft's legal department could keep a travel agent fully
occupied these days. In addition to dispatching lawyers from
Redmond, Wash., to federal court in Washington, D.C., the company
is currently defending itself against lawsuits filed by software
companies in San Jose, Calif., Salt Lake City and Bridgeport, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Although Microsoft has said these three other suits are without
merit, it has so far been notably unsuccessful in its efforts to
have them dismissed or delayed _ or to have a change of venue to
the presumably less burdensome and friendlier environs of Redmond.
And the possibility exists that any evidence dug up in these
corporate suits could reinforce the government's case.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the differences among the three competitor suits, all
make the same contention that lies at the heart of the
federal-state antitrust suit against Microsoft: They argue that the
company has tried to use its dominance to forestall competition.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest of these three pending suits was filed in July 1996
by Caldera Inc., of Orem, Utah, which sells DR-DOS, a competitor to
Microsoft's MS-DOS, the operating system underlying Windows. The
next, filed in October 1997, came from Sun Microsystems Inc., of
Palo Alto, Calif., the creator of Java, a programming language. The
most recent, filed in August, was brought by Bristol Technology
Inc., of Danbury, Conn., which makes software tools that enable
programs originally written to run on Windows to also run on other
operating systems.
</P>
<P>
   Like any large corporation, Microsoft over the years has been
the subject of many legal actions. It has won some of these _
notably in 1992, after years in court, when a judge ruled against
Apple Computer Inc.'s claim that Microsoft's Windows software
infringed on Macintosh copyrights. The software giant has lost some
_ like tiny Stac Electronics Inc.'s 1994 claim for patent
infringement, which resulted in Microsoft's settling the matter by
buying a majority interest in Stac.
</P>
<P>
   And Microsoft has settled others, most recently, for undisclosed
terms, a licensing dispute with AT&AMP;T over access to the programming
code underlying Microsoft's Windows NT software.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pending the suits by Caldera, Sun and Bristol that
are most noteworthy right now because of their parallels with the
federal-state antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   Caldera filed its antitrust suit against Microsoft on July 24,
1996, the same day it completed the acquisition of the DR-DOS
product from Novell Inc. (Novell had acquired the program's
creator, Digital Research Inc., in 1991.) Although DR-DOS
essentially duplicated the functions of MS-DOS, Microsoft could
never challenge the product on legal grounds because MS-DOS itself
was derived from CPM, an older operating system created by Digital
Research.
</P>
<P>
   Any chance for competition in desktop computing between MS-DOS
and DR-DOS is now history. But Caldera officials see a market
opportunity for DR-DOS in small hand-held devices, where their
product competes with Microsoft's version of Windows for
consumer-electronics products, called Windows CE. And Caldera's
suit alleges that Microsoft used its market power to thwart sales
of DR-DOS through unfair pricing practices and license agreements,
as well as false statements and ``vaporware'' announcements
suggesting that improved versions of MS-DOS were forthcoming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt as a smaller company we were in a unique position to
bring the lawsuit forward,'' said Bryan Sparks, chief executive of
Caldera, which is majority owned by Raymond J. Noorda, former head
of Novell. ``We weren't beholden to Microsoft for anything,''
Sparks said, ``so if they were to retaliate, they couldn't do
much.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more striking claims to come from Caldera's suit is
the testimony leaked to the news media that is said to have been
given in the deposition of Stefanie Reichel, a former Microsoft
account manager in Germany. According to lawyers familiar with her
testimony, Ms. Reichel's deposition alluded to the destruction and
withholding of evidence that would have been relevant to the
Justice Department's previous investigation of Microsoft, which the
company settled in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At a hearing in Salt Lake City on Sept. 28, Microsoft requested
that Caldera be served with a contempt order, claiming it was
illegally sharing confidential information safeguarded by
protective order. But U.S. District Judge Ronald Boyce granted
Caldera the right to attempt to substantiate Ms. Reichel's
testimony. The judge also denied Microsoft's request for a 120-day
delay of the trial, which is scheduled to begin next June.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft contends that MS-DOS has been totally subsumed by the
Windows 95 and Windows 98 operating systems and that any
competitive issues with DR-DOS were covered in the 1995 Justice
Department settlement. But Caldera officials assert that MS-DOS is
alive and well and running under Windows 95 and 98 _ just as it did
under earlier versions of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can run Windows 95 or 98 on top of DR-DOS; they are
absolutely separable,'' Sparks said. ``Windows 95 is essentially a
walking antitrust violation because it ties together two products
with no benefit to the consumer.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the case of Sun Microsystems, which filed its suit on Oct. 7,
1997, the issue is breach of contract and false advertising, not
antitrust. And yet, this suit, too, accuses Microsoft of
anti-competitive behavior. Sun's suit, filed just two weeks before
the Justice Department set in motion the legal events leading to
the impending government antitrust trial, stems from a license Sun
granted to Microsoft in 1996 to use and distribute Java _ a Sun
technology and programming language for use on the Internet. One of
the key features of Java is that programs written with it are
supposed to work with any operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft made modifications to the Java code that allows
its version of Java to work only with Windows computers. In Sun's
view, this Windows tailoring negates the cross-platform purpose of
Java and violates the terms of Microsoft's license. Last March in
San Jose, U.S. Judge Ronald Whyte made an interim ruling in Sun's
favor, issuing a preliminary injunction that forbids Microsoft from
using a Java-compatible logo on its products.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is now seeking to block all Microsoft shipments of
Java-based products that do not meet its compatibility tests. At a
hearing in San Jose on Sept. 10, Sun's attorney, Lloyd ``Rusty''
Day, argued that Microsoft wanted ``to kill cross-platform Java and
grow the polluted Java market'' by encouraging software developers
to abandon its cross-platform ability.
</P>
<P>
   Day focused his remarks on a Microsoft Java product called VJ
(plus plus) 6.0, a new software ``tool kit'' for creating
Java-based programs. VJ (plus plus) 6.0, he said, forces outside
software developers to create Java programs that are ``locked into
the products that Microsoft alone distributes.''
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft's lawyer, Karl Quackenbush, said the case was
fundamentally about a contract, in which he said ``Microsoft got
broad rights to modify, adapt, create, derivative works of the
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush said the features added to VJ (plus plus) 6.0 did
not violate the licensing agreement because software developers
were free to turn them off if they wished and to create
Sun-standard Java programs with the product. ``Maybe Sun wishes
Microsoft would not have gone forward and made these
enhancements,'' he said. ``That doesn't mean it's a breach of
contract.''
</P>
<P>
   The most recent suit alleging anti-competitive behavior against
Microsoft came from Bristol, which filed on Aug. 18. The suit
contends that Microsoft injured Bristol and the rest of the
software industry through ``predatory'' control of the Windows
application programming interfaces _ the bits of codes that outside
programmers use to assure that their products will work properly
with the Windows operating system.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is Bristol's product Wind/U, a program that lets
Windows programs run on computers that use the Unix operating
system. Bristol executives said they had initially developed Wind/U
without access to Microsoft application programming code, but
modified it after Microsoft granted Bristol a license in 1994.
Although Microsoft then publicly endorsed Bristol's products for
several years, Bristol said Microsoft was now refusing to update
the license to cover Microsoft Windows NT 4.0, Windows NT 5.0 and
subsequent releases _ at least not under terms that Bristol says
are technically or economically viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that what happened was NT got this big share of the
market, then Microsoft said now that we've got this foothold we no
longer want people to run Windows applications on Unix,'' said
Keith Blackwell, Bristol's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, however, says that Bristol's private antitrust suit,
like the government's case, is groundless. Jim Cullinan, a
Microsoft spokesman, said Bristol had sought to license Windows NT
4.0 and 5.0 at the same terms as it paid for NT 3.0, even though
the later programs are considerably larger.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought negotiations were ongoing until Bristol filed this
suit,'' Cullinan said, adding that Bristol's primary competitor,
Mainsoft Inc., ``has signed a contract accepting terms very similar
to what we offered Bristol.''
</P>
<P>
   Bristol seeks an injunction, pending a trial, that would prevent
Microsoft from blocking Bristol's access to Windows source code. A
hearing in Bridgeport is scheduled for this Wednesday; Microsoft's
trial is set to begin in Washington next Monday.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The slow-moving storm system that brought downpours to much of
New England at the weekend, including nearly 12 inches of rain in
parts of southern Maine will move into the North Atlantic Ocean on
Monday. Clouds will linger for a time in parts of eastern and
northern New England, but sunshine will return as drier breezes
from the north develop.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the interior Northeast will have ample sunshine with a
mild afternoon, despite patchy morning fog in the valleys of the
central Appalachians.
</P>
<P>
   The southeastern states will be warm and abundantly sunny as
high pressure drifts over the region. Onshore winds along the
southern flank of the high will bring a few clouds and isolated
showers to the eastern coast of Florida and parts of the western
Gulf of Mexico coast.
</P>
<P>
   Periods of cool rain will fall near a low-pressure center as it
moves across northern Minnesota to the northern Great Lakes.
Farther south, a broken band of light showers will accompany a
front as it sweeps through the central Great Lakes states. In the
wake of the front, cool, gusty winds from the northwest will import
drier air to the Dakotas to the northern Mississippi Valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the West, the Rocky Mountain states will have plenty of
sunshine. By afternoon, temperatures in most areas will be several
degrees above the seasonal average. A cold front will bring clouds
and showers as it moves into the Pacific Northwest. Meanwhile, the
deserts of the Southwest will be very warm with plenty of bright
sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Autumn Frost
</P>
<P>
   In much of the Northeast, October brings the first frost since
spring. However, the occurrence of the first frost can differ by as
much as months within 100 miles. There are significant delays in
frost in major cities as opposed to the surrounding countryside, in
coastal communities compared with inland areas, and over hilltops
vs. nearby valleys. On the plateau of northwestern Pennsylvania,
there is a 70 percent chance of a freeze by Sept. 1. Yet not far
away along the shores of the relatively warm Lake Erie, wine makers
can enjoy frost-free weather into early November.

   CHICAGO _ Some 100 paintings, pastels, drawings and prints from
public and private collections worldwide go on display Tuesday at
the Art Institute of Chicago in an exhibition billed as the first
retrospective in 30 years devoted to Mary Cassatt (1845-1926). The
only American and one of three women to exhibit with the
impressionists in Paris, she is perhaps best known for her
paintings of mothers and children.
</P>
<P>
   Organized with the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, where it will
appear from Feb. 14 to May 9, and the National Gallery of Art in
Washington, where it will be seen from June 6 to Sept. 6, ``Mary
Cassatt: Modern Woman'' runs through Jan. 10 in Chicago.

NEWLY FOUND CANVASES SHED MORE LIGHT ON FRANCIS BACON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For several weeks, the basement of Tony Shafrazi's
SoHo gallery has been transformed into a makeshift photography
studio where scores of high-wattage lights and large-format cameras
mingle with paintings of mostly distorted, screaming figures.
</P>
<P>
   The paintings are unmistakably by the hand of Francis Bacon, the
Irish-born artist best known for his macabre, twisted images,
according to two leading Bacon experts. There is Bacon's well-known
figure of a pope boxed inside the canvas, crying out as if trapped
in his own anxiety; there is also a triptych of blurred wrestling
figures, half human, half animal, and a brilliantly colored
landscape that recalls the flat, heavy brush of van Gogh.
</P>
<P>
   The subjects are familiar; variations on these Bacon paintings
hang in the collections of major museums around the world, and in
the last decade some have fetched as much as $6 million at auction.
And the works at Shafrazi's gallery are considered an important
find, although the circumstances of their discovery are mysterious.
</P>
<P>
   The artist was thought to have destroyed some of them before his
death in 1992. Some were found rolled up in his cluttered London
studio, others at a local framer where Bacon used to store
paintings and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Their existence has been a carefully guarded secret for nearly
two years. John Eastman, the lawyer for the Bacon estate, said he
did not want to let the world know about the works until he had a
plan for how to handle them. Many will go on display on Oct. 31 at
the Tony Shafrazi Gallery on Wooster Street.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Shafrazi, who was recently asked to represent the
artist's estate along with the well-known London gallery Faggionato
Fine Arts, only the artist's friend and sole heir, John Edwards,
Eastman and two of the world's leading Bacon experts have seen the
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Ten are from the 1950s, one is from the 1960s and the rest are
from the 1980s and 1990s, including the triptych of abstracted
figures.
</P>
<P>
   David Sylvester, an English art historian, curator and author of
a book of penetrating interviews with Bacon, who recently saw 11 of
the 17 works, said, ``Two are absolute masterpieces, and most of
the rest are very interesting.'' One of those two is ``Study After
Velazquez,'' a 1950 image of a screaming pope set against a gray
striped background that resembles a curtain. The other is ``Study
for Landscape After Van Gogh,'' from 1957.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Hunter, a professor emeritus of art history at Princeton
University who has written extensively about Bacon, said he was
thunderstruck when he saw some of the works. ``They're very
powerful,'' he added. ``I think these works are a real find.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester said he believed many of the newly discovered
paintings were works the artist considered unfinished. For that
reason, other experts who have not seen the works question how
important they are, believing that some may be paintings the artist
discarded. Bacon was often dissatisfied with his work, and until
the 1960s he routinely destroyed some of his best paintings,
Sylvester said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   It seems strange that they have been revealed only now, six
years after Bacon's death. Stranger still, many experts say, is the
choice of Shafrazi as the dealer handling the estate, instead of
the Marlborough Gallery, which had represented Bacon since 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards is notoriously reclusive and speaks through Eastman, a
Manhattan lawyer whose clients include Paul McCartney, his
brother-in-law; Rosie O'Donnell; and Billy Joel. Eastman also
represents the estate of painter Willem de Kooning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighteen months ago, these works were uncovered and sent to
Marlborough, who immediately turned them over to John Edwards,''
Eastman said. Since then, the lawyer has taken charge of putting
things in order. In August, the estate gave the contents of Bacon's
London studio, in a mews house in South Kensington, to the Hugh
Lane Municipal Gallery of Modern Art in Dublin, where the studio is
to be recreated and opened to the public in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Shafrazi became the estate's dealer at the request of Edwards,
Eastman said. The two first met in 1970, and both were friends of
Robert Fraser, a London dealer, who died in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Among contemporary art experts, both the choice of Shafrazi and
the reason Marlborough lost the estate and the artist are a source
of curiosity and speculation. No one close to the estate was
willing to speak for attribution. Officials at the Marlborough
Gallery have little to say.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman in New York said, ``Marlborough's association with
Francis Bacon came to an end with his death.'' She added,
``Marlborough International has the largest stock of top-quality
paintings by Bacon in private hands, which they acquired directly
from the artist during his lifetime.'' The directors of
Marlborough's New York and London galleries would not comment
further. Eastman also declined to discuss the change of galleries.
</P>
<P>
   Shafrazi, born in Iran, wanted to be an artist and studied at
the Royal College of Art in London before coming to New York in
1969. In the 1970s, he helped Cameron Diba, the director of the
Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, put together its vast
collection. In 1974, he became notorious as the artist who walked
into the Museum of Modern Art and spray-painted the words ``Kill
Lies All'' across Picasso's ``Guernica.'' He was charged with
criminal mischief. In 1979, Shafrazi opened his first gallery, and
within a few years he had made his reputation handling talents like
Donald Baechler and then-hot graffiti artists like Jean-Michel
Basquiat, Keith Haring and Kenny Scharf.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last night I stayed up until 4 in the morning poring over
pictures,'' Shafrazi said recently, gazing at the lineup of Bacons
on his basement walls. He also has boxes of carefully preserved and
documented photographs from Bacon's studio, which have become a
source of information about the paintings. ``Every day I discover
new things,'' he said. ``So much of this is uncharted territory.''
</P>
<P>
   Shafrazi said he was not sure how many works he would show until
he actually began installing the exhibition. But among the most
important will be two 1950s studies after Velazquez. One is the
image Sylvester calls a masterpiece; the other shows a screaming
man sitting with his legs crossed, an outline of his foot drawn as
if it were kicking out of the canvas, perhaps the artist's metaphor
for the soul.
</P>
<P>
   Also on view will be the ``Landscape After Van Gogh,'' as well
as ``Two Figures in the Grass,'' also from 1950, a frenetic
painting of crouching figures contained in a box-like
configuration, a well-known spatial device in Bacon's work. As in
the studies after Velazquez, the foreground has long streaks of
paint like a curtain. A white arrow points toward an unrecognizable
head. Arrows and circles _ devices the artist used to lead the eye
_ keep cropping up as Shafrazi studies the paintings. ``The longer
you look at these, the more you see,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A tattered cover of an old magazine that features Ayrton Senna,
the Brazilian race car driver, haunted Shafrazi, who recognized
Senna's face in the last figure of Bacon's 1991 triptych.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bacon was one of the first artists who acknowledged the cinema
and photography,'' he said. ``As early as 1949, he was looking at
the world through magazines. The next artist to do that was
Warhol.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Warhol, Bacon was surrounded by mystery and myth. He had a
dark view of life. (One of his best-known sayings was ``You can't
be more horrific than life itself.'') This view was reflected in
his sharp wit and the twisted figures he depicted on canvas.
Stories and speculation about Bacon's work _ how much of it he
destroyed, what remains that hasn't already been snapped up by a
museum or major collector _ and sordid tales about his private life
have continued since his death.
</P>
<P>
   A new film, ``Love Is the Devil,'' starring English actor Derek
Jacobi as Bacon, has stirred up more interest, although it deals
little with art and more with Bacon's penchant for masochistic
homosexual relationships, drinking and violence.
</P>
<P>
   As is generally the case with artists' estates, no one will say
precisely how much art is left, both in the estate and in
Marlborough's stock, for fear of devaluing the work. But people
close to Bacon's affairs estimate that Edwards inherited art worth
$100 million. These values vary depending on where the artist's
work is on offer.
</P>
<P>
   Though long heralded in Europe as one of the greatest postwar
artists, Bacon has never been so popular in America, despite
several major exhibitions here. Two years before his death, a
retrospective of his work opened at the Hirshhorn Museum in
Washington, then traveled to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art
and to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In January, another retrospective, with 74 works, organized by
the Trust for Museum Exhibitions in Washington, is to open at the
British Center for Art in New Haven, Conn. It is to travel to the
Minneapolis Institute of Arts, the California Palace of the Legion
of Honor in San Francisco and the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Shafrazi and Eastman see their job as giving Bacon more exposure
in the United States. ``This is an estate post-taxes, so it's not a
matter of creating a market to raise money,'' Eastman said. As a
result, few of the works in Shafrazi's show are for sale. Rather,
both dealer and lawyer see the exhibition as public relations.
``It's about showing the public what we've discovered,'' Eastman
said. ``And about creating an aura.''

   The New York Times' computer football ranking is based on an
analysis of each team's scores with emphasis on three factors: who
won, by what margin and against what quality of opposition. The
quality of an opponent is determined by examining its record
against other teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Times' computer model collapses runaway scores and takes
note of a home-field advantage. Recent games count more than
earlier games.
</P>
<P>
   The top team is assigned a rating of 1.000; the ratings of all
other teams are percentages reflecting their strength relative to
the top team. This week, for example, there is a very large
difference Ohio State (1) and UCLA (2), and a much smaller
difference between Tennessee (4) and Virginia Tech (5).

LIZ PHAIR: A WOMAN'S PERSPECTIVE AND A MAN'S PREROGATIVE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANN POWERS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Liz Phair loves to hear a crowd roar for her. ``I
wish I could tape-record everything you guys are saying out
there,'' she said, grinning hugely, at Roseland on Thursday night.
Then she lifted her slender arms in a come-on gesture to get her
fans to yell more. She adores that sound, not because it signals
solidarity or whatever else women in rock are supposed to champion,
but just because it turns her on.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Phair has been accused of many things since releasing her
debut album, ``Exile in Guyville'' (Matador/Capitol), in 1993.
Vanity is certainly one of them. Evidence of it abounded at
Roseland, starting with a preperformance slide show that captured
Ms. Phair in myriad poses: baring her breasts, smooching some guy,
guzzling a beer. Watching the images revolve to a soundtrack of her
favorite pop hits was like getting stuck between the translucent
pages of her favorite photo album.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those who begrudge the Oberlin-educated singer her
prettiness and privilege don't see that her sense of entitlement is
exactly the point. This projection of a big, bad self defines her
artistry. Very few women have acted so sure that they had a right
to be rock stars. Many have fought for that status, stolen it or
changed it to fit them. But Ms. Phair simply spoke the language.
</P>
<P>
   She gained notoriety for using dirty words, but her voice
mattered more. Adopting a dry, conversational tone, she rejected
the female singer's usual aura of vulnerability working toward
strength. She sang about her needs as if they were important, and
not only to her. Her subjects, mostly love botched, were familiar.
But her ability to assume a man's prerogative while maintaining a
female perspective was new.
</P>
<P>
   At Roseland, she fulfilled another aspect of her promise by
claiming the role of band leader. Gone was the awkwardness of her
early live performances, which contrasted so strangely with her
recordings. Defiantly glamorous in strappy high heels, she led her
five-piece group with exhilarated poise. She played inventive
rhythm guitar; when she removed the instrument to better vocalize,
she hit every tough note.
</P>
<P>
   New selections from ``Whitechocolatespaceegg,'' her latest
album, show Ms. Phair's growth as a songwriter; she fleshes out
characters other than herself now. Her music has matured, too, into
feisty mainstream power pop. New versions of her earlier songs
revealed that this big sound always lurked within them. &QL;

`LIFE OF THE PARTY': A KNACK FOR MEETING THE FAMOUS AND MARRYING
WELL 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Production notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By ANITA GATES    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Things have reached a sad state when two hours with Ann-Margret
isn't sexy. This is no reflection on the actress, who has been
exuding sensuality since ``Bye Bye Birdie,'' when she was 22. Now,
at 57, she seems the perfect choice to play Pamela Harriman,
America's ambassador to France who was better known for the
powerful men she had loved and/or married. But the resulting film,
which has its premiere Monday on Lifetime, is deadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life of the Party: The Pamela Harriman Story'' seems to want
to paint Harriman as a great courtesan. But it keeps telling us how
irresistible she was to men while illustrating nothing of the kind.
</P>
<P>
   The flashback to London in 1941, where the young Pamela Digby
Churchill first meets Averell Harriman, reveals this film's
Harlequin Romance-style idea of enticing dialogue. The scene, in
which bombs are dropping while the couple are at a party and all
the other guests are running for the shelter, boils down to this:
</P>
<P>
   Averell: ``You like danger, don't you?'' Pamela: ``Hold me.''
Close-up: his hand unzipping her dress.
</P>
<P>
   In a later scene, Leland Hayward, the agent and Broadway
producer who becomes Pamela's second husband, is astounded by her
sexual skills. ``You wouldn't believe what she could do with an ice
cube,'' he tells a friend by telephone. ``You do? Well, did she
tell you that she learned it from the Duchess of Windsor? I mean,
no wonder Eddie abdicated.''
</P>
<P>
   The name dropping is one of the film's few enjoyable aspects.
The '50s period detail is another. Scenes with Babe Paley and Betsy
Whitney, who act as a sort of Greek chorus, analyzing Pamela's
romantic situations over elegant lunches, look like a gorgeous old
Revlon ad come to life.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, the plot unfolds in disappointing just-the-facts
style. Pamela leaves her native England, her first husband
(Randolph Churchill, son of Winston) and her teen-age son to move
to New York in 1955. Betsy and Babe introduce her to Hayward.
Pamela impresses him by having researched Broadway musicals,
marries him, alienates his daughter Brooke and takes care of him
until his death in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   Within a year, she marries Harriman, now a former governor of
New York. All it takes is a little fiddling with dinner-party place
cards and a quick visit to Frank Sinatra to make him jealous. She
moves to Washington, alienates Harriman's godson, Peter Duchin,
whom he reared, and cares for her husband until his death in 1986.
Alone at last, she throws herself into Democratic politics, becomes
an ambassador and dies in Paris in February, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   After the movie, Lifetime is showing a documentary, ``Intimate
Portrait: Pamela Harriman,'' which covers her childhood and her
earlier liaisons, among them Prince Aly Khan and Edward R. Murrow.
``The remarkable thing,'' says Brooke Hayward, who married Duchin
in 1985 (drawn together by a common hatred?), ``was that she wasn't
remarkable.'' Judging by these two television productions, Ms.
Hayward is right.

NEW $20 BILL SAYS MORE THAN ITS WEIGHT IN GOLD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I don't really have anything against new money. I haven't been
around enough old money to get snotty about its patina of
tradition, its noble character and its good breeding.
</P>
<P>
   But now things have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm not talking about the nouveau riche. I'm talking about
the new $20 bill beginning to creep into our pockets. The recently
redesigned $50 and $100 notes haven't mattered much; for me, they
have remained pretty much out of familiar reach. But soon these
crude, brash and ill-proportioned $20s will be everywhere. And
their ruder, cheaper cousins are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Why am I making so much fuss? Look at the elegant endowments
possessed by old money. At the back of the old $20 is the
graciously curved South Portico of the White House, with the
building set back, allowing space for the lawn, surrounding trees
and hints of textured sky.
</P>
<P>
   The image is not sharply bounded but fades gracefully away. And
surrounding it is a frame that resembles an elaborate proscenium
from a century-old theater, ornamented with banners, rosettes and
elements derived from classical columns. Even the identifying
numbers are elegant: two enclosed in octagons, two in ovals.
</P>
<P>
   Now look at the new bill. The South Portico's curves are
exchanged for a head-on, close-up of the Grecian north entrance. No
lawn is visible, only shrubs. The leaves are detailed, but the sky
is artificial, without texture. The image does not wash into the
bill's background; instead, it is briskly cropped and bounded by a
draftsman's oval. And around that oval are disorienting expanses of
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the once ornate frame has shrunk into a thin molding.
Two of the identifying 20s hang down as if by accident. A third
pushes up from below, while in the right corner another 20,
grotesquely large with a typeface new to American money, bursts
through the frame and bubbles into the bill's empty space.
</P>
<P>
   It is as if the new design were pieced together from spare
parts, and there weren't quite enough to go around. The almost
belle epoque reverence of the old, with its sense of looking
through some nobly decorated portal at a building of charm and
authority, is replaced by the cavalier recklessness and rudeness of
the nouveau riche.
</P>
<P>
   And I haven't even mentioned the face of the bill, where the
formal grace of the top and bottom borders is undercut by the
blown-up medallion of Andrew Jackson with its matinee-idol
slickness.
</P>
<P>
   The portrait is off-center, even breaking apart the once subtle
identifying label: The word ``Federal'' is pushed to one side,
leaving ``Reserve Note'' to fend for itself. This bill looks like
money that doesn't care too much about looking like money. It looks
like play money.
</P>
<P>
   All right, maybe I'm making too much of this. After all, until
we use it, paper money is play money. This is its genius: Instead
of actually using valuables to exchange for other valuables _
nuggets of silver or gold, bags of barley or precious-metal coins
stamped with their weight _ something absolutely worthless is used,
worthless and by its very nature transitory, subject to rips, wear
and decay.
</P>
<P>
   But a delicate drama takes place within these slips of paper.
Their fragility is almost part of the point. The authority that
distributes them is so powerful that it can confer the greatest
value on what is most valueless. The bill also relies on a social
contract between its users, who agree to accept that governing
authority and trust that others will as well.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, as economists have long noted, paper money is so
vulnerable; it relies on intangibles like trust, faith and power.
Alexander Hamilton objected to the stuff. ``In times of
tranquillity it might have no ill consequence,'' he wrote about
paper money. ``But in great and trying emergencies, there is almost
moral certainty of its being mischievous.''
</P>
<P>
   The mischief, of course, is that more can be printed at will,
offering a fraudulent promise of value. And if the authority behind
the paper weakens, or has no influence with a neighboring
authority, the bills become useless scrip.
</P>
<P>
   In 1860, for example, there were more than 1,600 private
American banks offering their own paper money in 10,000 basic note
types. One estimate is that 5,000 counterfeit types were also
circulating. The evolution of the Federal Reserve System and the
centralized American monetary system was not merely an economic
reform but a social transformation.
</P>
<P>
   So the design of bills is not a casual matter. Large forces are
being invoked. The inscriptions are almost magical: When they
appear in precisely the right way, they accomplish an alchemist's
dream, as if turning lead into gold. And called into play are all
the weighty icons of the social covenant and its governing
authority, which are _ to alleviate Hamilton's anxieties _
portrayed as eternal, immutable, even divine.
</P>
<P>
   Mythic or ancient images proliferate on almost every nation's
currency (look at the Latin inscriptions and the hovering eye over
the pyramid on our $1 bill). So do the iconic portraits and
buildings of a country's earthly presence.
</P>
<P>
   But the new $20 bill seems indifferent to all this. The guiding
strategy, according to the Treasury Department, was to further foil
counterfeiters with watermark images, color-shifting ink and a
labeled security thread. But that seems to have been the only
concern; elsewhere all density of detail and intricacy of
connection are tossed aside.
</P>
<P>
   As in so many new American stamps, almost every design element
has been dumbed down, turned almost cartoonish, even condescending.
The Treasury even boasts of the ``easy to read'' numeral slapped on
the back. Why not just print the number over the entire surface of
the bill if that's the point? The 20s on the back of the old bill
were actually easier to read, because the eye was drawn to them:
They formed the stable corners of the note's architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while it may seem as if the national icons are given
more importance _ in Jackson's enlarged portrait or the zoomed-in
view of the White House _ this assertiveness could be a sign of
inflation. The bill's stilted decorations, blank spaces and mixed
typefaces actually weaken the icons, which seem to have no secure
place in the overall fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The White House in particular seems like part of an out-of-place
curio hanging on a blank wall. And isn't all this an unsettling
allusion to the nature of contemporary public life?
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the new design, with its almost casual disregard for the
dense meanings of paper money, may also be unwittingly revealing
another imminent transformation.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the currency now being designed across the ocean: the
euro. That currency won't rely on the authority of individual
countries, because its guarantor will not be a country at all, but
an economic association. Its bills will be adorned not with
national capitols but with nonexistent buildings meant to broadly
symbolize the evolution of architecture in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The euro will start being used for electronic transfer of funds
on Jan. 1, three years before bills are even available.
</P>
<P>
   What a peculiar situation: The euro will begin as abstract money
and then take form in bills decorated with the abstract
architecture of a newly imagined realm. And instead of being
created by a government, the euro is creating a government. It is
as if money had been freed of all material constraints, attaining
untested powers.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new American bills also bear hints of this. We can
barely associate money with national boundaries anymore (60 percent
of American currency is probably circulating in foreign countries),
so why worry about national icons and their meanings?
</P>
<P>
   As for design, why be concerned when currency is becoming
increasingly abstract, dissolving into a digital stream of ones and
zeroes, making encryption more important than inscription? Paper
money, with all its mythic invocations and heroic portraits, may
become superfluous. The real new money may be personalized versions
of the EZ-Pass used by drivers in the New York area.
</P>
<P>
   There goes the neighborhood.

 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The federal government and the Microsoft Corp. may be nearing a
historic antitrust showdown. But Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates
has largely disengaged himself from the company's legal defense to
concentrate on new ways to extend the world's largest independent
software company's influence into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   And instead of a corporation struggling to stay a step ahead of
technological obsolescence _ the argument with which he has tended
to rebut his antimonopolist critics in recent years _ Gates boasts
in a recent memo to his staff that Microsoft's position in the
computer industry is stronger than it has ever been.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the memo contends, one of the company's biggest
challenges will be finding ways to continue motivating employees
who in many cases are so wealthy from their Microsoft stock that
they no longer have an economic need to work.
</P>
<P>
   The 14-page, single-spaced memo _ whose title, ``The Era Ahead''
evokes his 1995 best-selling book, ``The Road Ahead'' _ spells out
the main opportunities and threats that Gates sees for Microsoft in
the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in many ways, the future according to Bill Gates looks
very much like the present.
</P>
<P>
   The personal computer, in his view, will remain the main
business and technology platform from which Microsoft stretches
upward toward the province of big mainframe systems, while reaching
downward into the realm of hand-held consumer-electronics devices.
</P>
<P>
   And the Internet will continue to provide the ties that bind
these various products into a Microsoftian whole _ but only, the
memo warns, if the company continues to ward off the threats posed
by the perceived nemeses of IBM, Netscape Communications, Oracle
and Sun Microsystems, all of which the memo cites by name.
</P>
<P>
   Distributed within the company in early September, the memo was
supplied to The New York Times last week by Microsoft on the
condition that it not be quoted directly. Gates declined to be
interviewed for this article. The memo's release, presumably, was
meant to demonstrate that he is concentrating on Microsoft the
business enterprise even while the Justice Department is intent on
exposing Microsoft as a marauding monopolist.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the memo implicitly also provides further indication that
Gates, who is 42 and possibly the world's richest man, is
withdrawing from operational management of Microsoft to return to
his programmer-geek roots and become the company's chief
technologist.
</P>
<P>
   It is a personal and professional transition that became evident
in July when he gave the position of president to his longtime
friend and colleague, Steven Ballmer, who now shares most
day-to-day responsibilities with the company's chief operating
officer, Robert Herbold.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is vintage Microsoft and vintage Bill Gates,'' Herbold
said in an interview last week. ``It's all about the core issue for
Microsoft, which is developing product.''
</P>
<P>
   Herbold said that the responsibilities Gates had turned over
include mundane tasks like the mid-year review of the budget.
``Guess what,'' Herbold said drily. ``Steve Ballmer and I can
handle that.''
</P>
<P>
   Before July, according to colleagues of Gates who spoke on
condition of anonymity, he had been showing signs of increasing job
stress, as Microsoft's battles with the Justice Department and
several state attorneys general appeared to overshadow the
company's focus on product development and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   In a get-away-from-it-all restorative he prescribed for himself,
Gates, after deputizing Ballmer, took a summer vacation with
friends, including Warren Buffett and William Randolph Hearst III,
that also included pure sight-seeing activities, such as glacier
watching by boat near Juneau, Alaska, and a train trip through the
Pacific Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fun-to-work ratio for Bill is going up,'' said a Microsoft
executive, one of several who noted that Gates seems more relaxed
lately than he has in years.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the pace of his work does not seem to have slowed much.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, for example, he spoke at industry gatherings in San
Diego and Denver, and he recently traveled to Europe to speak at
industry events and visit Microsoft customers. Back at corporate
headquarters in Redmond, Wash., he still schedules meetings at his
executive offices from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   And while his September memo presents a deeply confident view of
the company's competitive status, Gates also voices
dissatisfactions in it that have been part of the Microsoft litany
for nearly two decades.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1981, Gates' stated corporate quests included the
development of software that was simpler to use. He is now making
that a top priority, to deflect growing criticism that as Microsoft
has added supposedly beneficial features to its software, the
products are increasingly awkward.
</P>
<P>
   True, he places much of the blame on the software that other
companies produce for use with Microsoft's Windows operating
system. But he directs his own company to solve this problem by
writing more rigid programming rules and guidelines for outside
software developers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Along with this implicit charge to his engineers to bring the
industry to heel, there are also hints at future industry clashes.
Gates' memo, for example, describes a new service that may be
introduced as Windows Tone, or Wintone _ a computing analogy to the
concept of a telephone dial tone. Sun Microsystems has already
introduced a similar concept, one based on its so-called Jini
software, which is designed to enable different hardware devices to
communicate over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   As Gates sees the future, Wintone will assign Microsoft the job
of managing PC data over the Internet, which will allow for
automatic backup of that data on network storage computers while at
the same time employing the Internet to provide automatic updates
of the software on users' own machines.
</P>
<P>
   To create accessible network ``storage lockers'' for this vast
amount of data, Gates describes a new system to be called
Megaserver, which will provide computer users with access to their
personal information and electronic mail wherever they have an
Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   He also notes that in the future the operating system _ the
basic command-and-control software of a computer _ will play an
increasing role in protecting intellectual property from data
piracy by tracking the use of information and preventing illicit
copying.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most significant revelation, in light of a
government lawsuit that posits the monolithic dominance of Windows,
is the memo's grumblings about the operating system's various
technical shortcomings. He also notes that programs to remove
Windows are among the best-selling PC software products and cites
that fact as evidence of a fundamental failure by Microsoft to keep
its customers satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   Gates also discusses, even if he seems to gloss over them, the
competitive threats to Microsoft that are coming from outside the
personal computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   He writes, for example, that a recent agreement involving the
three leading wireless telephone makers _ Ericsson, Motorola and
Nokia _ and Psion, a small British developer of software for
hand-held devices, represents serious competition. And yet he
appears to believe that the company's Windows-based Win CE
operating system, which is beginning to appear on a variety of
information appliances, will stave off the threat the agreement
might pose.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of his memo, Gates calls for the help of his
Microsoft colleagues in meeting the challenges he spells out. He
alludes to the sense of privilege he feels in being part of the
positive impact he says the company's effort will have on the way
people work, learn and communicate. He even suggests a source of
further reading, a Web site on Microsoft's internal network.
</P>
<P>
   But nowhere in the 10,000-word tome does he mention the one
external force that could alter Microsoft's future more
fundamentally than the forays of any software competitor: the
federal antitrust trial scheduled to begin in Washington next
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But then, this is the new, less-engaged, more geeky Bill Gates,
who leaves such vexations to his operational subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not preoccupied with the legal case,'' Herbold said of
Gates. Referring to the company's general counsel, Herbold added
that ``Bill Neukom will tell us when we need his input.''

CASTING LIGHT ON TUMORS 
MEMORABILIA BY THE PIECE 
BACKPACK ON WHEELS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Calif., Pa.)   (mk) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    During Victorian times, physicians tried to detect breast tumors
by illuminating the breast with candlelight. The candlelight
technique turned out to be less than successful. But now, more than
a century later, researchers are turning to light once again _ this
time in the form of sophisticated lasers _ as they search for more
precise, less potentially hazardous alternatives to X-ray
mammography.
 &HT;    Robert Alfano, a laser physicist at City University of New York
and a pioneer in this area, recently received a patent for optical
imaging of breast tissue.
 &HT;    Normally, trying to find a tumor by shining a light into breast
tissue is as futile as trying to find a largemouth bass by aiming a
flashlight into murky water. This is because the light immediately
scatters when it hits such a dense medium.
 &HT;    Alfano and his colleagues have discovered a way to use laser
light to get sharp images of, for example, a tumor lodged in a
breast: by capturing the light particles after they pass through a
given object during the first 100 picoseconds, or 100-trillionths
of a second, of a laser pulse.
 &HT;    These early light particles _ unlike the far more abundant
``diffuse'' photons that arrive 100 picoseconds later _ are known
as ``ballistic'' photons and ``snake'' photons. The ballistic
photons fire straight through the object; the snake photons swish
through, taking a more snake-like path. Both yield important
information about what might lie inside an object.
 &HT;    ``The idea of this is to replace X-ray mammography, which
doesn't tell you the state of the tumor _ whether the tumor is
cancerous or not _ and it also often doesn't pick up small
tumors,'' Alfano said.
 &HT;    Ultimately, Alfano hopes that optical breast imaging will enable
physicians to determine whether a tumor is malignant as the image
is made, without having to perform a biopsy, simply by separating
out different colors of light.
 &HT;    For now, however, he cautions that his research is quite
preliminary. ``We have not done this on a real breast at this
point,'' he said.
 &HT;    Alfano and colleagues Ping-Pei Ho, Leming Wang, Xiangchun Liang
and Pierre Galland received patent 5,799,656.

   Budget-busting price tags put most Mark McGwire memorabilia
beyond the reach of the average fan: $5,000 for an old uniform,
$1,000 for a pair of used shoes and an untold fortune for one of
this season's record-breaking homer balls.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Gluck, of Irvine, Calif., has patented what he says is a
way to make such memorabilia more democratically available: by
chopping it up into little bits and attaching it to trading cards.
</P>
<P>
   Some baseball card companies already have begun doing this.
</P>
<P>
   Upper Deck Co. of Carlsbad, Calif., recently chopped up into 200
pieces an old bat belonging to Babe Ruth, which the company had
purchased for $23,000. The cards featuring slivers of Babe Ruth's
bat have been randomly inserted into the company's 1998 UD Retro
Baseball series, which is being distributed this month.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck, who is one of the founders of Upper Deck but no longer
affiliated with the company, said he was currently in licensing
negotiations for his patent.
</P>
<P>
   Gluck dismisses critics who have charged that his idea
encourages the desecration of rare sports artifacts. ``This gives
the average kid an opportunity to have a piece of history,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Can we expect to find miniature Mark McGwire bats in trading
cards any time soon? Gluck said he hoped so, given that he and
McGwire share the same agent, Robert Cohen, of Los Angeles. ``I
haven't approached Mark McGwire,'' he said. ``But I was tickled
pink Bob Cohen took me on.''
</P>
<P>
   He received patent 5,803,501.

   Every morning from the porch of her house in Ardmore, Pa.,
Virginia McDermott watches the neighborhood children struggle with
their heavy backpacks as they rush to catch the school bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep thinking, some day they are going have back troubles,''
she said. And Ms. McDermott knows back troubles. ``Bad backs run in
my family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So Ms. McDermott has patented a backpack with wheels. It looks
pretty much like a normal backpack, except for a handle and wheels,
which allow it to be dragged along the ground, much like those
rolling suitcases so common in airports these days.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McDermott, who received patent 5,743,447, hopes to license
it.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

<P>
   The fallout from CNN's discredited Tailwind broadcast continues
to accumulate. One defamation suit has been settled, three are
pending and at least one more has been threatened. One of the suits
names April Oliver, the lead producer on the report, as an
individual defendant. Trouble is, Ms. Oliver and Time Warner, CNN's
corporate parent, are co-defendants without much of a common cause.
Ms. Oliver, who was dismissed by CNN, is looking for vindication

 ANALYSIS: RISKS FOR THE NEW TEAM AT THE BROOKLYN ACADEMY 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In his 31 years as president of the Brooklyn Academy
of Music, Harvey Lichtenstein infused an institution founded during
the Civil War with so much of his own vision that it was almost as
if he created the place. So one question lingered after last week's
announcement that he would step down next summer from an
organization he transformed from an artistic wreck to an
international showcase: How do you replace a legend?
</P>
<P>
   The short answer in this case is that it should be easier than
the history of other institutions might suggest. Lichtenstein
handed over power to two longtime collaborators in an orderly,
structured transition that seemed a model of smart organization
building.
</P>
<P>
   But the longer answer is more complicated. When an institution
has been dominated by and identified with one person for decades,
succession can be full of perils even in the best circumstances.
And if the Brooklyn Academy makes a smooth transition from
Lichtenstein's era to its next one, Lichtenstein will have pulled
off a final and extremely difficult coup _ building an organization
that can move along just fine without him.
</P>
<P>
   The academy announced on Thursday that Lichtenstein, who assumed
his post in 1967, would step down as president and executive
producer on July 1. The academy's executive vice president, Karen
Brooks Hopkins, will succeed him as president, in charge of
finances, fund raising and operations. The producing director,
Joseph Melillo, will become the new executive producer, in charge
of the artistic side.
</P>
<P>
   Artists and arts executives familiar with all three say it is an
ideal situation because the three have worked together for years,
know the organization's board and share a common vision for what
the Brooklyn Academy of Music should be.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're talking about three people who have worked together for
a very long time, who've been together so long they're almost a
family,'' said Nathan Leventhal, president of Lincoln Center. ``I
assume it will be as smooth a situation as you could possibly
imagine. It looks like a model for a sensible and efficient
transition. It does not often work out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, other arts institutions are full of models for
transitions that proved to be much rockier.
</P>
<P>
   The figure Lichtenstein is most often compared to is Joseph
Papp, who directed the New York Shakespeare Festival for 37 years,
during which he became synonymous with it. Papp, ill with cancer,
apparently offered the job of succeeding him to at least four
people from outside the organization before naming JoAnne Akalaitis
as festival head in 1991, shortly before his death.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to emerge from his shadow and widely seen as lacking the
personal charisma and forcefulness he brought to the job, she was
replaced by George Wolfe after 20 months.
</P>
<P>
   Other dominant figures have also been difficult to replace.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Sherry became artistic director of the Chamber Music
Society of Lincoln Center in 1988, succeeding Charles Wadsworth,
who founded the society in 1969. His moves to bring in newer
musicians and more contemporary music rankled some subscribers,
subscription sales fell and he stepped down after the 1991-92
season.
</P>
<P>
   Don Scardino in 1991 replaced Andre Bishop, who had headed the
Playwrights Horizons nonprofit theater for 17 years. He was soon
accused of failing to come up with hits as often as Bishop, whose
achievements included ``Driving Miss Daisy,'' ``The Heidi
Chronicles'' and ``Sunday in the Park With George.'' He left ``by
mutual agreement'' in 1995 after his contract expired.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at the Brooklyn Academy is different because of
the length of time the three have worked together and the
power-sharing management structure Lichtenstein leaves behind. Many
artists associated with the academy have working relationships with
Melillo comparable to the ones they have had with Lichtenstein.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known Joe as long as I've known Harvey,'' choreographer
Mark Morris said of Melillo. Morris' Dance Group has appeared at
the academy since the early 1980s. ``They don't have identical
tastes, but they have compatible esthetics. I can't see any
problems. I'd just tell them to keep up the good work and don't get
scared.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But that does not mean the transition is without perils,
particularly at an venture that has always steered a risky course,
with less margin for failure than some wealthier, more established
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   All three say Lichtenstein will be able to pass on the authority
to run the academy and still remain as a consultant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have his verbal commitment he will not meddle with our
tenure,'' Melillo said. ``And he's just not the kind of person who
would work against you. I don't expect a left hook.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is unusual for a figure as powerful and forceful as
Lichtenstein to stay on. And while the academy would surely benefit
from his presence in two major projects _ its new film program and
its ambitious plans to redevelop the surrounding neighborhood _ it
could make it difficult for his successors to put their stamp on
the organization.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Lichtenstein has left behind a management structure
that artfully uses the talents of Ms. Hopkins and Melillo. Though
Ms. Hopkins has the title of president, the two are described as
having equal power, both reporting to the board.
</P>
<P>
   But other arts figures say a joint leadership agreement can be
hard to pull off. In the past, when artistic and financial concerns
clashed, Lichtenstein was a final, magisterial arbiter. Now Ms.
Hopkins and Melillo will have to thrash out disagreements between
them. The academy's leadership has taken knotty, high-risk
situations to its board in the past, and it will surely do so
again. But having two heads instead of one responsible for
administrative decisions can add complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``Becoming two people instead of one is difficult
automatically,'' Morris said. ``I don't foresee it getting ugly in
any way, but it's something they'll have to work out.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another risk that is almost inevitable. Lichtenstein
revitalized the academy by reinventing it as a haven for
experimental music, art, opera and dance. Since then, institutions
like the Joyce Theater and programs like the Lincoln Center
Festival have been offering in Manhattan the kind of fare
associated with the academy, making its mission somewhat less
singular and distinctive.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins and Melillo can stay the course and risk being seen
as mere keepers of the flame, or they can change course and run the
risk of being seen as people who tried to fix something that wasn't
broken. In either case, it can be riskier to inherit a successful
enterprise than a flagging one.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hopkins stressed that most of the issues that would arise
were ones that she, Lichtenstein and Melillo have dealt with
before. And she said she and Melillo were acutely aware of the need
to respect what they have helped build, while pushing it in new
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Melillo, for instance, is interested in a more international and
far-flung approach to seeking adventurous art and in younger
artists working with new technology. And, if only because he is 18
years younger than Lichtenstein, he represents a generation with
very different experiences. But after acting as Lichtenstein's
artistic alter ego since 1983, he is not expected to lurch in
wildly unexpected new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Joe and I love this place,'' Ms. Hopkins said. ``So
we want to both keep a good thing going and put our imprint on it.
We feel that the BAM we've built is the right BAM, but we also know
we have to keep it fluid and free, so it can keep on reinventing
itself. We do what we do with great deference to what's gone on
before. But anyone who thinks Joe and I will just be caretakers
doesn't understand our role here.''

`THE EVOLUTION OF JANE': WHEN FRIENDS BREAK UP, DARWIN MAY KNOW
WHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Publication notes appear at the end of the review.) 
(js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Have you ever lost a friend?,'' Jane Barlow Schwartz, the
narrator, asks at the opening of Cathleen Schine's witty new novel,
``The Evolution of Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   Jane has lost a friend, Martha Barlow, her distant cousin. ``She
had been my best friend for almost a decade, for more than half of
childhood,'' Jane explains, ``and then she evaporated, as though
she had never really existed at all. Did anyone call me, try to
console me, try to find a new friend for me? Yet when my husband
left me after six months, I was bathed in sympathy and
inappropriate blind dates.''
</P>
<P>
   When her husband left her, Jane's mother became convinced that
she needed to `` `go abroad' in order to heal.''
</P>
<P>
   `` `Off you go!' my mother used to say when she pushed me out
the door to play, to stop me from moping around the house.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Off you go!' she said after my divorce. `Off to the
Galapagos!' ''
</P>
<P>
   Why the Galapagos? In her childhood, Jane had been infatuated
with Darwin. Like the protagonists of Ms. Schine's previous novels
(``Alice in Bed,'' ``To the Birdhouse,'' ``Rameau's Niece'' and
``The Love Letter''), Jane is fascinated with order, and what she
had particularly liked about an illustrated account of the voyage
of the Beagle were ``pictures of the cabinets used to store
specimens, pictures of rows of little bottles and jars and wooden
boxes, each labeled in an old-fashioned hand.''
</P>
<P>
   She had always wanted to visit the Galapagos, the famous site of
Darwin's studies of the origin of species. So she happily accepts
her mother's offer of a trip there as her 25th-birthday present.
And when she arrives, who turns out to be her tour guide? None
other than Martha Barlow, her long-lost childhood friend.
</P>
<P>
   In what follows, Jane worries increasingly about why Martha
``had thrown me over, dumped, ditched, cut, cold-shouldered,
discarded, shelved, jettisoned and retired me,'' which she has
never understood. On the tour, Martha is friendly to Jane and
highly instructive on the Galapagos flora and fauna, particularly
as they pertain to Darwin's theories of natural selection. But
happy as she is to become reacquainted with Jane, she clearly isn't
interested in exploring their personal past.
</P>
<P>
   This forces Jane to remember the details of their friendship and
to examine them for possible offenses she might have given. Their
families had occupied two of three identical houses in Connecticut
built by the girls' great-great-grandfather for his triplet sons.
These sons were ``ships' captains who prospered and caused their
New England village to prosper to such an extent that the town
fathers rechristened it `Barlow' after its own favorite sons.''
</P>
<P>
   In the family's subsequent history, some sort of mysterious feud
had broken out, possibly over the sale of part of the family
business. This may explain why Jane's and Martha's parents,
although summer next-door neighbors, were politely cool to one
another. But the girls had overcome whatever stood between the
families and become virtual twins. Until somehow, somewhere, Jane
did something to drive Martha away.
</P>
<P>
   In the Galapagos, Jane feels compelled to understand how the
friendship came to an end, just as in her passion for order she has
to understand how a unique organism comes into being and what
exactly defines a species. ``The mechanism that explained the
transmutation of species would explain Martha's transmutation, the
transmutation of friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   If she can't find an explanation, if friendship lapses into
nonfriendship in the way that one species seems to transmute into
another, then Jane faces what she feels is most frightening about
Darwin: ``not nature red in tooth and claw,'' ``not our ancestors
the apes,'' but chaos, meaning ``there is no plan, there never was
one.'' Perhaps to face this chaos is where Jane has to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Evolution of Jane,'' Ms. Schine very nearly pulls off a
tour de force in which friendship comes to stand for the
possibility of transcending natural selection. The characters,
especially as bright, strong-willed children, are charming in the
way we have come to expect of Ms. Schine's writing. (Typical of
Jane as a child is her response to her father's saying, ``Jane, I'm
speechless,'' which is to retort, `` `I'm speechless' is speech.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Darwinian ideas are articulated with vivid intensity,
particularly in the anecdotes that Martha relates about the
creatures of the Galapagos.
</P>
<P>
   But a degree of strain becomes evident when events are made to
illustrate the novel's ideas. Certain incidents seem awkwardly
forced. That Jane thinks so little about her ex-husband that she
mentions him only three or four times in passing is hard to
believe. And despite all the theorizing about the nature of Jane's
and Martha's friendship, one finds it difficult to accept that Jane
can never bring herself to sit down with Martha and ask her: ``So
what happened to us? Why did you stop returning my calls?''
</P>
<P>
   Consistently amusing and provocative, ``The Evolution of Jane''
remains a great pleasure to read. But it works better
intellectually than in the gut, where the best fiction has to make
its presence felt.

`OEDIPUS': DESTINY'S CHILD DOESN'T QUITE GET THE MESSAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes are at the end of review.)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``You simpleton! You missed the point.''
</P>
<P>
   That's telling him. The man at whom these words are yelled, in
the latest play from the Blue Light Theater Company, is named
Oedipus, and no one, of course, is more famous for missing the
point until it's way too late to do anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   Misreading auguries, refusing to look for answers inside
himself, delegating blame like the paranoid head of a Fortune 500
company: the unfortunate habits that characterized Sophocles'
mother-loving monarch are to some degree shared by the title
character of Dare Clubb's ``Oedipus,'' a serio-comic meditation on
destiny and its discontents.
</P>
<P>
   But this younger, callower variation on the man whose name has
been immortalized as a Freudian complex gets things wrong in ways
that would make his classical prototype blush. Unlike the Sophocles
character, who worked overtime to escape his predicted fate, this
Oedipus is so eager to embrace his that he rushes to commit crimes
that could be classified under the rubric ``Sorry, wrong mother.''
Yes, the poor doofus kills the wrong man and beds the wrong woman:
they're his adoptive parents, not his biological ones.
</P>
<P>
   There's a certain collegiate glee in this antic scrambling of
mythic literature, and the company of actors in ``Oedipus,'' which
features the seriously talented movie stars Frances McDormand and
Billy Crudup and is directed by Clubb, brings undeniable zest to
the interpretation of it.
</P>
<P>
   But don't go to the Classic Stage Company, where the work is
being performed, expecting just fractured theogony tales. Clubb's
play is as earnest as it is irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   Oedipus' road to self-knowledge has never been so long and
winding, an itinerary that takes more than four hours and includes
many detours through a world that is bleak, brutal and
uncontrollably talky. In tone and structure, the play aspires more
to Voltaire than to Sophocles. Indeed, Crudup's Oedipus is first
cousin to Candide: innocent, literal-minded and disastrously
harnessed to a philosophy that the world around him keeps refuting.
Or, as one character says late in the third and final act: ``The
gods don't frighten me. Men frighten me. Men with concepts.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, another character says much the same thing in the
first act. Despite its narrative sprawl, ``Oedipus'' is essentially
a one-idea play, a series of riffs on a single moralizing theme.
Clubb creates a lineup of terminally self-involved creatures, out
of touch with natural human feelings and paralyzed by a mindless
devotion to theology and ideology.
</P>
<P>
   They range from Oedipus' adoptive mother, Merope (Ms.
McDormand), whose more than maternal emotions inspire her to
Byzantine, Phaedra-like speeches of self-disgust, to a
manic-depressive woodsman (Jon De Vries), eternally brooding over
an oracle's pronouncement that he has no fate of his own. The
play's central metaphor for all this circular, sterile thought is
found in a scene in which the wandering Oedipus and his best
friend, Teiresias (Jeffrey Donovan), find only saltwater to quench
their thirst but drink it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Clubb has come up with some appealingly goofy, deadpan jokes
that play off the work's tragic antecedents. (``We'll suffer for
this, probably,'' says Merope, after making love to young Oedipus,
``but so what?'') The script also reaches dangerously for real
poetry, to an eloquence that tries to rival classical eloquence
even as it parodies it, a little in the manner of T.S. Eliot, whose
``Prufrock'' poem is alluded to here. So we get high-flown lines
like ``Even the afternoon silences in your light-filled rooms have
the shape of music,'' and ``If there's no single truth, only a
million versions of the truth, then what is beauty?'' Now imagine
lines like this multiplied to fill four hours.
</P>
<P>
   The actors have been directed to pace the stage as they voice
their characters' convoluted thoughts, which may be symbolically
appropriate but is wearying to watch. There are some isolated,
ingeniously staged touches, as when two anonymous figures in
raincoats point out a raving madman with voyeuristic hisses and
when a troop of bloodthirsty mercenary soldiers emerges from
beneath the stage, but the production needs many more.
</P>
<P>
   It is daunting to imagine what sitting through ``Oedipus'' would
be like without the exceptional cast with which Clubb has been
blessed. Ms. McDormand, the Oscar-winning star of ``Fargo,'' brings
a hypnotic intensity to Merope, even if the monologues finally get
the better of her, and her brief, incisive appearance as the
riddling Sphinx, in the show's wittiest scene, is delicious. And
while passive, Candide-like figures are seldom rewarding to actors,
Crudup, the fine-featured star of the movie ``Without Limits,''
winningly walks the line between spoof and solemnity, finding
astonishingly varied line readings in his one-note character.
</P>
<P>
   All the actors, including such gifted young New York stage
regulars as Camilia Sanes, Johanna Day and Alan Tudyk, give off a
charming air of being glad to be doing what they're doing here,
shifting through multiple roles and giving diverse life to an
elaborate story. They certainly provide the best argument for
staying awake during this epic-length ``Oedipus.'' They even, from
time to time, make you forget that although their characters cover
many miles, the play in which they appear remains firmly lodged in
one place.

   WASHINGTON _ A long-sought compromise to let high-technology
companies hire more foreign workers has been derailed in the
Senate, and infighting in the final hours of the 105th Congress is
threatening final passage of two other cornerstones of the
information-technology industry's legislative agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Still in limbo as Congress' newest deadline for adjournment
neared was a ban on Internet taxes and landmark legislation to
protect copyrights in the digital age.
</P>
<P>
   The breakdowns, late Friday, came just two days after industry
leaders joined House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Republican leaders
at a news conference in what turned out to be a premature
celebration of the bills' passage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does show that you cannot let up your guard,'' Marc Pearl,
general counsel and senior vice president of government affairs for
the Information Technology Association of America, said Sunday.
``You must remain vigilant until the bill is signed. Until the
measure you don't want is absolutely positively dead. You just
can't let go.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Andrew Grove, chief executive of Intel Corp., had
foreshadowed the snags on Wednesday, when, appearing via video
hookup at the Gingrich news conference, he told the speaker that,
at Intel, an order is not complete until the product is shipped.
``These bills haven't shipped yet,'' Grove said, ``and I hope and
trust that they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich replied that the bills were on their way to the loading
dock. But time is now running out.
</P>
<P>
   Congress was supposed to adjourn at midnight Friday. Budget
disputes, however, forced an extension of that deadline until
midnight Monday. And while House members are in a hurry to go home
for campaign season, more extensions could be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the only major information-technology bill that has
actually passed is one involving Year 2000 liability, which
encourages companies to share information about whether their
computer systems are prepared to handle calendar dates beyond 1999,
and about how any related problems can be fixed; the companies
would be exempt from lawsuits that are based on the information
they have disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Internet tax bills and the copyright measure, still
pending are a half-dozen measures covering matters like Internet
gambling, protection of children on the Internet and shielding
technology companies from lawsuits based on their fluctuating stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned,'' Pearl said of the last-minute delays.
``It is always difficult to predict what Congress will do when we
are in this kind of breakneck speed to get into a recess. Sometimes
good things fall through the cracks.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the victims, apparently, will be the bill sponsored by
Sen. Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., to nearly double the number of visas
available to highly skilled foreign professionals. Both the House
and Senate had passed versions of the bill earlier this year, and a
compromise was worked out with the White House last month.
</P>
<P>
   But late Friday, a small group of senators blocked a final vote
on the compromise measure, effectively killing it for this year.
Opponents argue that the industry has exaggerated claims of a
worker shortage so it can bring in cheaper foreign labor to keep
wages down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The programming shortage never materialized,'' said Sen. Tom
Harkin, D-Iowa, whose opposition helped blocked passage of the
compromise measure. He noted that a number of high-technology
companies have reported layoffs. ``There is simply not the shortage
that some say,'' Harkin said.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, a dispute over the appointment of a former
Democratic lawmaker to a key high-technology trade group delayed
final passage of a comprehensive digital copyright bill.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act, would make
it a crime to break through the technologies that secure digital
copies of software, music and videos and literary works from
Internet pirates. It was drafted to implement world treaties for
protecting intellectual property on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   But lobbyists and congressional staffers said that Republican
leaders yanked the copyright measure from the House calendar late
last week, to express their outrage that Dave McCurdy, a former
Democratic representative from Oklahoma, had just been named to
head the Electronic Industries Alliance, a lobbying group that has
been involved in the copyright legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This piece of legislation should not be an issue that is
subject to petty politics,'' Pearl said. ``It has always been one
that has had a global implication to it, one that is generally
viewed as a tremendous beneficial step forward. So we are just
hoping that the leadership will realize that before they pack it
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Final passage of the Internet Tax Freedom Act, which would
impose a three-year moratorium on any new state or local taxes on
Internet commerce or access to the network, was threatened by
disputes between House and Senate leaders over changes made to the
bill in the Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill is considered crucial for the growth of electronic
commerce. Without it, supporters say, there are more than 30,000
state and local taxing entities that could try and lay claim to
transactions on the Internet.

BERLIN PHILHARMONIC:THE GRATIFICATION OF A DELAYED HONEYMOON 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In music, as in politics, while some lame ducks are
merely hanging on, others are thriving. Claudio Abbado, who is 65
and has announced that he will give up the podium of the Berlin
Philharmonic in 2002, seems to be luxuriating in a particularly
mellow relationship with the orchestra, perhaps partly in
compensation for the honeymoon the initially recalcitrant band
denied him when he arrived in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Such, at least, was the impression left by the orchestra's three
concerts last week at Carnegie Hall, which were superbly performed
in almost every detail. With few exertions visible to the audience,
Abbado drew brilliant and committed playing from the group, and
seemingly everything he wanted by way of interpretation. As so
often, the listener could wish only that Abbado had wanted more.
</P>
<P>
   Mahler's Third Symphony on Wednesday evening, for example, was
easy to admire but hard to love. The dynamic range was
breathtaking. Mahler has seldom been heard quieter than in
pianissimo passages here, suspended by a mere thread of sound. And
when the underlying coiled tension was unleashed, as at the end of
the first movement, the ruckus was thrilling in its splendor.
</P>
<P>
   Those attributes counted for much in performances of Mahler's
more abstract and tautly constructed Fifth and Ninth Symphonies by
the same forces at a Mahler festival in Amsterdam three years ago.
But the Third is, and is meant to be, all over the place. It is,
Mahler suggested, the world. It needs to bob and weave, vibrate and
spin, billow and sway. And even if one grants that there are many
ways to play Mahler short of the all-out passion of a Leonard
Bernstein, Abbado's sheerly analytical approach left much of the
symphony's magic and mystery untapped.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the four inner movements, framed by those vast and
powerful pillars at either end, would hardly have been eventful at
all but for the splendid contribution of Anna Larsson, a young
Swedish contralto. From her first sounds, the repeated A on ``O
Mensch,'' Ms. Larsson, who is also heard on Esa-Pekka Salonen's
recent Sony recording of the work with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic, carried a listener back to the not so distant heyday
of great Mahler altos like Kathleen Ferrier and Maureen Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of Bruckner's Fifth Symphony on Thursday, too,
offered almost anything a listener could want except transcendence.
Which, in Bruckner, may be everything.
</P>
<P>
   The final concert, on Friday, was a more casual affair,
ostensibly juxtaposing German and French music. The orchestra
retained some of its Brucknerian edge and solidity in Schumann's
``Manfred'' Overture, and Renee Fleming sang Strauss' ``Four Last
Songs'' with gorgeous tone, excellent amplitude and evolving
emotion.
</P>
<P>
   The performance of ``La Valse'' did not, for all its magnificent
qualities, sound very French. The grotesqueries were put forward
with earnestness and weight, and by the end, Ravel seemed to have
entered the world of Varese, with its internationalist clangor.
</P>
<P>
   In Debussy's ``Nocturnes,'' there seemed to be more women
onstage than usual in this orchestra. The enigma evaporated in the
concluding ``Sirenes,'' when it became apparent that the excess
consisted of women of the Westminster Choir, interspersed with the
players to achieve an atmospheric vagueness of location in their
siren-call vocalise.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But there was also news on the feminist front. A fascinating
sidelight to the Mahler performance took place last Monday, when
principal players of the orchestra coached sections of the
Manhattan School of Music Symphony in the work's long finale,
preparatory to a rehearsal-type reading of the movement at the
Manhattan School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Abbado, who
was to have conducted but was recovering from a viral infection,
yielded the podium to the assistant conductor of the Berlin
Philharmonic, Graziella Contratto.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin Philharmonic was, to be sure, quicker than its
counterpart in Vienna to bend to the social mandates of the 20th
century. It admitted its first woman in 1982 and now has 11. Still,
it was remarkable to find the young Ms. Contratto anywhere near the
podium so identified with the autocratic Herbert von Karajan, who
in 1982 reversed his opposition to the hiring of women, fighting
vainly on behalf of the clarinetist Sabine Meyer, only as part of a
power play against the orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's mainly an office job,'' said Ms. Contratto, who took up
the position just months ago, ``but a very interesting one.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Ms. Contratto, who is Swiss and in her early 30s,
spends most of her time seeing that the players' parts are marked
according to Abbado's meticulous specifications. Only occasionally
does she conduct a rehearsal segment. Unlike assistant conductors
of U.S. orchestras, who can expect to conduct a few concerts a
season, if not on the regular schedule then at least filling in for
an ailing music director or guest conductor, Ms. Contratto is
offered no such prospect.
</P>
<P>
   More's the pity, perhaps. Ms. Contratto worked well with the
students in halting yet expressive English, relying perhaps too
heavily on metaphors yet imparting sharp musical insights. Tall and
lean, she used her wide wingspan cannily to illustrate the
horizontality and lack of metric stress she wanted in what she
called this ``most unbeated'' music.
</P>
<P>
   Elmar Weingarten, the general manager of the Berlin
Philharmonic, said, ``She has been received very well, and compared
to her male predecessors, exceptionally well.'' Ms. Contratto, it
seems clear, will make her way into public view soon, if not in
Berlin, then elsewhere.

POPE CANONIZES JEW WHO BECAME NUN AND DIED AT AUSCHWITZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ALESSANDRA STANLEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Describing her as ``an eminent daughter of Israel and a
faithful daughter of the church,'' Pope John Paul II on Sunday
canonized Edith Stein, a Jewish intellectual who became a Carmelite
nun and died at Auschwitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because she was Jewish, Edith Stein was deported with her
sister Rosa and many other Jews,'' the pope said at a solemn Mass
in St. Peter's Square before tens of thousands of people. ``In
celebrating now and later the memory of the new saint, we will be
unable not to also remember year after year the Shoah, that savage
plan to eliminate a people, which cost millions of our Jewish
brothers and sisters their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The statement was the closest the pope has come to suggesting
that the Vatican might order an annual commemoration of the
Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   In recalling Edith Stein's Jewish roots and the suffering of
Jews in the Holocaust in a Mass that is one of the holiest rituals
of the Roman Catholic Church, John Paul sought to address the anger
and concern of many Jewish groups, which have protested the
Vatican's decision to honor Edith Stein as a Christian martyr of
the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein's is one of the most contested canonizations of this
papacy, which celebrates its 20th year this week. She was deported
in 1942 from a convent in Echt, the Netherlands, where she had
sought refuge from Hitler's Germany. After Dutch bishops denounced
the Nazis' policy of deportation in the occupied Netherlands, the
Nazis retaliated by rounding up Jewish converts, who had until then
been spared the fate of other Jews. That led the Vatican to
conclude that Edith Stein had been killed to punish the Catholic
Church in the Netherlands and was therefore a martyr to her faith.
</P>
<P>
   Many Jewish associations and some of her relatives who attended
the ceremony Sunday have questioned the Vatican's logic and
sensitivity, insisting that she died in a gas chamber because she
was Jewish, not became she was a Roman Catholic nun.
</P>
<P>
   John Paul, who has made reconciliation between Catholics and
Jews one of the hallmarks of his papacy, clearly hoped that by
acknowledging in his homily that Edith Stein was killed because she
was a Jew, he could lay the controversy to rest.
</P>
<P>
   The pope spoke beneath a giant portrait of Edith Stein in her
Carmelite wimple. She was canonized in the name she adopted when
she took her vows, Saint Teresia Benedicta of the Cross. Before an
audience that included the outgoing German chancellor, Helmut Kohl,
the pope said, ``The value of her testimony is to render ever more
firm the bridge of mutual understanding between Christians and
Jews.''
</P>
<P>
   But many representatives of Jewish groups were not mollified by
the pope's words. ``She was killed because she was born to Jewish
parents, and that is what needed to be emphasized in any statement
about her death,'' Rabbi David Rosen, director of the Israeli
office of the Anti-Defamation League told Reuters on Sunday. ``It
was not adequately emphasized. There is a sense that the Catholic
Church has been portrayed exclusively as a victim of Nazi
atrocities rather than as a collaborator at times.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein is thought to be the first Jewish-born saint since
the time of the Apostles and early Christian martyrs, but
incomplete records, as well as the numbers of early conversions,
forced or voluntary, make that impossible for the Vatican to
confirm.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Edith Stein's canonization follows the beatification earlier
this month of Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac, a Croatian who was
persecuted by the Communists during the Cold War. Although the
Vatican maintained that he saved hundreds of Jewish and Serbian
lives during World War II, he is viewed by Serbs and many Jews as a
symbol of the Catholic Church's complicity with the Fascist regime
that ruled Croatia from 1941 to 1945.
</P>
<P>
   A miracle is required for canonization. In Edith Stein's case,
it was the recovery of Benedicta McCarthy, the American child whose
parents prayed to Sister Teresia Benedicta when she swallowed a
fatal dose of Tylenol as a toddler in 1987; the church recognized
that as a miracle in 1997. Benedicta and her entire family attended
the service, at which Benedicta received the communion wafer from
the pope.
</P>
<P>
   Later, her father, the Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a
Catholic priest in the Melkite branch of the church, which allows
priests to marry, said he hoped that the canonization would lead to
a period of contrition for the church. ``The last thing she would
want,'' he told The Associated Press, ``would be that the
canonization somehow was part of a means to hide the atrocities of
Christians in relation to the Jewish people during the Second World
War.''
</P>
<P>
   Edith Stein was born on Yom Kippur in 1891 into an Orthodox
family in Breslau, Germany (now Wroclaw, Poland). A brilliant
philosopher and atheist, she converted to Catholicism in 1922. In
1933, she was forced to quit her teaching position in Muenster by a
Nazi decree banning Jews from academia. That year she entered a
Carmelite convent in Cologne, where she continued her theological
writings.
</P>
<P>
   In 1938, after Kristallnacht, she fled with her sister Rosa to a
convent in the Netherlands. After the bishops' letter denouncing
the Nazis was made public, she was arrested. ``Come Rosa,'' a
witness recalled her saying, ``we are going for our people.''
</P>
<P>
   She died at Auschwitz on Aug. 9, 1942. &QL;

KENYAN BREAKS U.S. MARATHON RECORD IN WINNING CHICAGO 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The Chicago Marathon demonstrated emphatically Sunday
that the marathon is really two races, with the first 20 miles
bearing little resemblance to the final 6.2 miles, when aching
bodies grow exhausted and resolve can sag as the temperature rises.
</P>
<P>
   In the 26th mile, just when it looked as if he would have to
settle for the anonymity of second or third place, Ondoro Osoro of
Kenya weaved his way through a group of wheelchair racers and
suddenly found himself in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   He had never run a marathon before, but once he got to the front
he knew exactly what to do. Pulling away from the defending
champion, Khalid Khannouchi of Morocco, Osoro won in 2 hours 6
minutes 54 seconds, the third-fastest marathon ever. It was also
the fastest debut marathon in history and the fastest marathon ever
run in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   His time was 49 seconds off the world record of 2:06:05 set on
Sept. 20 at the Berlin Marathon by Ronaldo da Costa of Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who trains in Ossining, N.Y., had patiently stayed
with the lead pack, then made a break and surged into first place
by running Mile 22 in 4:42, but he could never shake the cluster of
African runners behind him. As the temperature rose to 60 degrees
on a humid morning, Khannouchi's lead over Osoro was only five
seconds after 25 miles, and he seemed to be limping and listing
slightly to his left. The Kenyan darted past him and did not
relinquish the lead. While Osoro seared through Mile 26 in 4:48,
Khannouchi struggled through in 5:08.
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi finished second in 2:07:19, but left the finish line
on a medical cart. Gert Thys of South Africa took third in 2:07:43.
Joseph Kahugu of Kenya finished fourth in 2:07:57. It was the first
time four runners had gone under 2:08 in the same marathon.
</P>
<P>
   The women's race produced an even more startling finish as Joyce
Chepchumba, 28, of Kenya made up a 19-second gap in the 22nd mile
to overtake Colleen de Reuck of South Africa. Chepchumba ran Mile
22 in 5:28 to take the lead and began steadily drawing away to win
in 2:23:57, the 15th-fastest women's marathon ever.
</P>
<P>
   De Reuck took the lead in Mile 3 and built a margin of 39
seconds over Chepchumba after 19 miles. But de Reuck then began to
run heavy-legged, and when Chepchumba made her move, the South
African had nothing in her reserve tank and finished second in
2:27:04.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans produced what has become unfailing disappointment
in the marathon. Jerry Lawson of Jacksonville, Fla., had expected
to break the American record of 2:09:35 and collect a $1 million
bonus from the New Balance athletic shoe company. But Lawson
aggravated an injury in his right hamstring muscle at Mile 4 and
dropped out at Mile 6. The top American finisher was Rod DeHaven of
Madison, Wis., who finished 15th in 2:13:01.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the race was left to a 30-year-old Kenyan rookie,
Osoro, who trains in Boulder, Colo., and who shocked the more
seasoned contenders in his debut.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing that a first-time marathoner ran as fast as he
did,'' said Keith Brantly of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a 1996 Olympian
who dropped out Sunday just before the midpoint. ``It truly blows
me away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``It's really nice to be naive sometimes and run like
it's a distance run and sprint at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   Osoro's victory was worth $105,000 in prize and bonus money. The
flat course perfectly suited his background as a track,
cross-country and road runner. In 1991, he won a bronze medal in
the African Games at 5,000 meters. But his career had been
seriously threatened on May 30, 1995, when Osoro was involved in a
head-on collision with a 12-ton truck in Kenya that left him
unconscious briefly and hospitalized for two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered a broken arm, deep head cuts and a chest injury that
gave him problems breathing in cold weather. It was not until
February 1997 that Osoro began running seriously again. He set a
world record for 10 miles on a loop course of 45 minutes 36
seconds, but this year, when his agent suggested that he run the
Chicago Marathon, Osoro balked.
</P>
<P>
   He had never run a marathon, so he would not rate an appearance
fee, and he decided he would not run 26.2 miles for nothing more
than travel expenses. He reconsidered, though, and when Khannouchi
lagged Sunday, Osoro pounced. He knew Khannouchi's speed well from
the road-racing circuit, and his plan was to hang back then make a
decisive move so that Khannouchi's finishing kick would be futile.
The plan worked perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I do something,'' Osoro said of his decision to enter
Chicago, ``I do it to the maximum.''

SPORTS COLUMN: WAS THERE OR WASN'T THERE A SPY?

   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ You can call it espionage, or you can
call it surveillance. But in pro football, a spy by any other name
would smell as sour.
</P>
<P>
   As the Giants confronted the Atlanta Falcons Sunday night, part
of the story line was the Giants' suspicion during the week that
Dan Reeves, the former Giants coach who now tutors the Falcons, had
a spy peering at the Giants' outdoor practice field from high in
the nearby Sheraton Meadowlands Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Giants official, a Falcon assistant coach who had
been on Reeves' Giants staff, Joe DeCamillis, was suspected of
being involved in the plot.
</P>
<P>
   DeCamillis, who is also Reeves' son-in-law, denied any
involvement, saying: ``I ain't doing anything like that. Coach
Reeves would be angry if he knew someone did that.'' But as the
Giants' coach for four seasons, Reeves realized the Sheraton and an
adjacent high-rise office building afforded a clear view of
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan wanted to put up a wall to block that view of the practice
field,'' a former Giants official recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Reeves did or didn't do last week, the Giants had a
security official with high-powered binoculars surveying the
windows of the hotel and the office building during practice. Coach
Jim Fassel also took the team inside the team's practice bubble to
go through the new plays designed for the Falcon game.
</P>
<P>
   Such paranoia by Giant coaches isn't new. The week before a 1991
game with the Washington Redskins, Coach Ray Handley had similar
fears.
</P>
<P>
   ``There have been times,'' Handley said then, ``when teams were
very well advised of things that we were doing in games that we
thought were new and would surprise them, but it did not surprise
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever did or did not occur during practice that week, the
Giants lost that game, 17-13, in what was an 8-8 season.
</P>
<P>
   Spying, or the suspicion of spying, is not new among National
Football League coaches. Whenever a helicopter flew anywhere near
the Jets' practice in the week before a game with the Oakland
Raiders three decades ago, Coach Weeb Ewbank glared at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Davis has somebody up there watching us,'' Ewbank growled,
referring to the Raiders' managing general genius. ``Don't do
anything until that copter leaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Then and now, Davis enjoyed a sinister reputation. Harland
Svare, the San Diego Chargers' coach who had been a Giants
linebacker, once sat in the visiting locker room at the Oakland
Coliseum and shouted at a light fixture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know you're up there, Al Davis,'' Svare said. ``I know
you're up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Told later of Svare's accusation, Davis didn't hesitate to
perpetuate his sinister reputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing wasn't in the light fixture,'' Davis said. ``I'll
tell you that much.''
</P>
<P>
   To thwart the possibility of spying, each NFL team now has a
security guard, if not several guards, at its practice complex. As
the Los Angeles Rams' coach three decades ago, George Allen was the
first coach to take that precaution, hiring Ed Boynton, a retired
Long Beach, Calif., policeman.
</P>
<P>
   Known as ``Double O,'' Boynton accompanied Allen to the
Redskins. He once chased a suspect from the chemical lab of the
high school near the Redskin training camp in Carlisle, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   At least a decade before Double O arrived, Paul Brown, the Hall
of Fame coach of the Cleveland Browns, was his own security
officer. Whenever the Browns practiced in cavernous Cleveland
Stadium, if a stranger suddenly appeared, Brown would stop practice
and have the stranger ushered out.
</P>
<P>
   Ewbank, a Browns' assistant under Brown, took that distrust to
Baltimore as the Colts' coach _ even a distrust of Brown himself.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, when the defending champion Colts were about to play
the Browns, Ewbank sent the equipment manager, Fred Schubach,
across the street from the open end of Baltimore's old Memorial
Stadium to check for suspicious strangers in the Ednor Garden
houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're all Colt fans here,'' one resident told Schubach, ``but
if Coach Ewbank feels that strongly about it, come in and look
around.''
</P>
<P>
   No suspicious strangers were found, but the Colts lost, 38-31,
one of their three defeats that season in repeating as NFL
champions.
</P>
<P>
   Most coaches, not only Jim Fassel, still think a suspicious
stranger might be out there somewhere watching practice. And it's
easier for a spy now. For years, some NFL teams didn't wear numbers
on their practice jerseys to thwart the possibility of spies. But
when each team began filming practices, numbers were necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Spies or no spies. &QL;

   VOSKRESENSK, Russia _ Slender birch trees, their leaves turning
gold and orange in the early autumn air, line roads leading to this
humble, fraying town about 50 miles southeast of Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But closer to Voskresensk, the fresh country air turns acrid
with the noxious odor of fumes belched from smokestacks atop one of
Russia's largest fertilizer plants.
</P>
<P>
   Menatep, a Moscow bank that is now insolvent, bought the
decrepit plant in 1995 and was supposed to modernize it, bringing
it into the vanguard of Russia's march into modern capitalism. But
little has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've worked here a long time, and it's never gotten better, no
matter who owns it,'' said Vasily Yevdokimov, 70, a machinist who
has worked at the plant, now know as Voskresenskiye Joint Stock
Co., for 50 years. ``They haven't spent anything renovating this
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   There are legions of workers across Russia who can make the same
claim.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia began a vast selloff of formerly state-owned
companies three years ago, Russian banks were among the biggest
buyers. Today, there is little evidence to suggest that banks did
anything other than use the factories to fill their own coffers.
Indeed, many in Russia suspect that more money was taken out of the
companies than was ever put in.
</P>
<P>
   Modernizing Russia's antiquated industrial base is in fact a
Herculean task. Many factories are too outmoded and have long since
passed the point of becoming profitable. And decades of state
subsidies for workers and their families in factory towns cannot be
undone without creating wrenching social problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Russian banks accepted these challenges when they began
buying the factories, and Voskresensk, a town of about 150,000, is
one example of the human impact of this squandered opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I visit my friends working there, and it's gotten
much worse since I left,'' said Alexander Devyatkin, who worked at
the fertilizer plant from 1994 to 1996 and is now a fireman. ``The
air was very polluted and it was very hard to breathe. Acid was
everywhere. I think you make a lot of money if you own the factory
but not if you work there.''
</P>
<P>
   Menatep, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, chairman of Rosprom, the
holding company that controls the bank, declined repeated requests
for an interview. The management of the fertilizer plant refused
requests for a tour.
</P>
<P>
   Voskresensk is a well-known hockey town, and residents proudly
remind visitors that Igor Larionov left here to become a star
center for the Detroit Red Wings. When Menatep bought the
fertilizer plant, it also got the title to Khimik, the local hockey
team. An outwardly impressive hockey stadium dominates the center
of town and residents' social calendars.
</P>
<P>
   But Khimik is struggling from a lack of funds. Inside the hockey
stadium, above large, colorful murals depicting the team in action,
tiles are peeling away from the ceiling and pockmarks are visible
in parts of the roof. A regional governor recently took over the
team, promising, residents said, to spend more money on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the only thing in town that we take pride in,'' said
Vladimir Vasilyev, the hockey team's coach. ``There is nothing to
be proud of about the chemical plant. The most important thing in
Russia now is to be paid, and the plant is hardly paying people
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Yevdokimov, the machinist, said that the average salary at the
fertilizer factory is the equivalent of about $100 a month,
although he said he is paid about $47 a month. Or at least that was
what he was once paid. Yevdokimov said his wages are now a month
overdue.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that about 50 percent of the plant's 5,000 workers
had been laid off since Russia's economic crisis began in
mid-August, a much larger number than the town's elders
acknowledge.
</P>
<P>
   Yevgeny Simonov, Voskresensk's mayor, said that only about 100
people had been laid off from the plant. ``People are worried, but
at the same time I'm an optimist,'' he said brightly.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Simonov enthusiastically distributes a brochure published by the
fertilizer plant. The leaflet shares the mayor's rosy outlook,
noting that the factory houses ``remarkable imported equipment and
state-of-the-art technologies.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while Simonov notes that a French company took over a nearby
concrete factory and made great strides modernizing it, he is hard
pressed to offer comparable examples of how the Voskresenskiye
plant has been upgraded. Indeed, Simonov eventually became angered
by repeated requests for a tour of the plant and hustled visitors
out of his office.
</P>
<P>
   But walks around the outside of the sprawling factory, and
interviews with residents of Voskresensk, indicate that there is
very little that is state of the art about the plant. Large parts
of its superstructure are rusting and some heavy equipment visible
through the gates looks as if it has been idle for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are very hard because of the ruble's collapse, and now
less people are working at the factory,'' said Yevgeny Ovsyankin,
another fireman who knows workers at the plant. ``It is not an
up-to-date factory. It has lots of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, with most of the country's largest banks insolvent and the
overall economy in tatters, it is unlikely that Russia will have
the resources it needs to do anything with its sagging factories
and the towns they anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Russians have a well-known ability to endure both disappointment
and hardship, and few of them seem surprised that the country's
factories were poorly served by the banks that still own them.
After all, many Russians note, there is very little they can do
about it anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Menatep was supposed to invest money in the plant, but they
took money out of it,'' said Vladimir Petrov, who sells
construction materials in Voskresensk. ``But what can we do? We
can't force them to give the money back.''

SCHOOL BOARD CONSERVATIVES RATTLE TEXAS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Del., Minn.)  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now, Texas is a state that likes a good
political brawl almost as much as a slice of mesquite-smoked
brisket smothered in sauce. Yet here it is, a month before the
election, Gov. George W. Bush is about 50 points ahead in the polls
and seems set for a big wet kiss from voters on his way to a
possible presidential run in 2000. So where's the rumpus?
</P>
<P>
   Not at the top of the ballot, it seems, but far, far below, well
under the public radar, where the juiciest and most far-reaching
race may be the one for control of the once-obscure Texas State
Board of Education. A coalition of Christian conservatives, who
have gradually gained members on the board since 1992 and
transformed it into the state's most reliable producer of political
theater and partisan discord, have a solid shot at becoming a
majority on the 15-member board, which oversees the nation's
second-largest public school system, 3.9 million students strong.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is unnerving some Texas politicians, leading others
to talk about disempowering or abolishing the elected board and
causing discomfort to a governor who has made public education the
centerpiece of his campaign and who does not really need right-wing
members of his own party berating his administration for being
insufficiently committed to the conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
   A little more sauce on that brisket, honey?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Christie, the Republican chairman of the state board, says
he considers himself a devout Christian and an ardent conservative,
but he has had about enough of the hard-line Christian
conservatives he works with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time trying to placate these people,'' he
said. ``I was in Israel recently on a trip with a diverse group of
Christians and Jews. We met with the No. 2 guy in the PLO, and I
felt, when I was sitting there, that I could negotiate better with
him than I could with some of these people on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, right-wing members of the board have
chastised the governor for lack of leadership and Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock for ``meddling'' in education issues; frequently criticized
the appointed state education commissioner; demanded Christie's
removal as board chairman; been called racists by other members of
the board; publicly ripped up a textbook they considered too easy;
demanded the sale of more than $40 million of Disney stock from the
permanent education fund, and altogether transformed the board into
a great big thorn in the establishment's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said before that I thought they were an embarrassment
for the state of Texas and the Legislature and the governor,'' said
State Sen. Bill Ratliff, a Republican and former chairman of the
Senate's education committee. ``And I happen to believe that public
education is suffering from it. You just can't have a board that
runs amok.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives respond that they are interested only in high
standards, local school control and fiscal accountability; prayer
in the schools and creationism are not their main focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education establishment is totally unaccustomed to anyone
who is not a part of their inside loop,'' said Donna Ballard, a
conservative housewife who is trying to reclaim a spot on the board
after giving up her old seat, in suburban Houston, when her
husband, a preacher, moved the family to West Texas. ``We're
holding them accountable, which they're furious about.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics on the board and in state government say the hard-line
conservatives are insatiable, dissembling and utterly resistant to
compromise. ``I believe their hidden agenda is to make public
education look as bad as possible so they can get support from
citizens of Texas for a full-blown voucher system,'' said Rene
Nunez, a Democrat who after 10 years on the board finds himself in
a tight race with Mrs. Ballard in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a bunch of name-calling,'' said Bob Offut, a
leader of the board's right-wing bloc. ``We're five people who are
not into the Austin bureaucracy's political gamesmanship. We're
pretty ideological-type of people who, just because the governor
calls and asks for support, doesn't mean that it's going to happen.
They are driven by their hatred of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the governor describe him as annoyed, even angry
with the activities of right-wingers on the board who might,
paradoxically, find their numbers increased in November on Bush's
coattails. But they say that the rancor does not indicate any
significant gap between the governor and the party's overall right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, a top Bush adviser, said that Bush had been
``unremittingly conservative'' as governor and had put together a
``broad coalition'' of Republicans that included prominent members
of the far right. The extreme attitudes of hard-line conservatives
like those on the education board represent only a tiny percentage
of Republicans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a right-winger, but these people are far out
there,'' said Rove, who described the tension between the governor
and the board's conservatives as a minor sideshow. ``In the
carnival of life,'' he said, ``they are in a very distant booth.''
</P>
<P>
   The once obscure Texas education board has crept gradually into
the spotlight in the six years since Offut became the first member
of the conservative voting bloc to be elected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Offut said he decided that his best path was
to try to recruit like-minded conservatives to run for seats on the
board in other districts. By 1996, there were six in Offut's voting
bloc on the board, including Mrs. Ballard, whose move to Midland
reduced the bloc to five.
</P>
<P>
   But Offut said the bloc was certain to increase by at least one
in November because ``another one of us won a primary and is
unopposed'' in the Texas Panhandle. And Offut said he had strong
hopes that Mrs. Ballard would rejoin the board by beating Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they would need to win only one more race, perhaps in East
Texas, or to convince one of the more moderate Republicans already
on the board to join their bloc, to make up a majority of the 15
members. Only five seats are up this year, as the terms are
staggered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Elliot Shapleigh spoke last week to a few dozen
supporters of Nunez who were munching tamales on a flag-draped
veranda beside the Rio Grande in El Paso. Shapleigh said he
intended to do as much as he could to get Nunez re-elected. ``The
consequences on this state are huge,'' he said. ``We cannot allow
the reckless right to handicap our public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ballard said she intended to campaign as a concerned
housewife and mother and resented efforts by opponents to demonize
her by linking her to a right-wing conspiracy that she said did not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have horns,'' Mrs. Ballard said. ``And I don't see why
they keep trying to make this a religious issue. We all go to
different churches. One of us doesn't go to any church at all. The
thing that threads us together is a real determination to save our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the efforts of her and others, she said,
``discipline and phonics are not dirty words anymore'' in Texas
schools and there is the beginning of a return to higher standards.
(The right-wingers on the board joined governor Bush last year in
calling for a rewrite of a first draft of the new standards for
Texas schools, going as far as to pick their own consultants to
help, but then they stunned the board and enraged the governor by
announcing at the last minute that the rewritten standards were
still insufficiently tough for their taste. ``These people cannot
take yes for an answer,'' one state official said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here are two different philosophies,'' Mrs.
Ballard said. ``One says that we tell children what is right, how
to spell a word, what the correct answer is. The other is that
we're going to have general statements and let children discover
when they're ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with secret religious conspiracies, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four children in four years,'' Mrs. Ballard said. ``I
put a list on the refrigerator, what they got a swat for and what
they didn't get a swat for. Those were the rules of the house. You
obeyed those rules or you didn't. There were times you could show
mercy, but you must have that structure. That's not heartless.
Sometimes, it takes a mom to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that similar battles were being
fought in many states where social conservatives have recognized
that low-profile school-board races are an easy gateway into
government and a prime platform for pushing the issues dearest to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, in particular, may well see religious conservatives
become a majority on the state education board in November, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend is not entirely one-sided. Moderates appear to be
staging a comeback in some states where there had been conservative
inroads in the 1990s. ``If anything, I see a swing back to the
middle,'' Ms. Welburn said.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, like Delaware, where officials have grown weary
of partisan bickering over education, state boards have seen their
powers whittled back. In Minnesota, the Legislature has voted to
abolish the state board next year.
</P>
<P>
   This is similar to the path that officials have taken in Texas.
In 1995, the Legislature voted to severely curtail the board's
powers, particularly taking away the power, cherished by the social
conservatives, of editing textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Since this has done little to quiet the rancor on the state
board, some Texas officials are now arguing that its powers should
be even further curtailed in the next legislative session, perhaps
even transforming it into an appointed board.
</P>
<P>
   It all could depend on whether the conservatives win a majority
on the board in November. If they do, several state officials
predicted, legislation will be pushed through to further limit the
board's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think they're going to win a majority this
election,'' Christie said. ``I think the pendulum is going to swing
back instead.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he said, the Democrats and moderate Republicans on
the board will simply continue with a strategy that they believe
was beginning to work in recent board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get along with them, but we gave up,'' Christie
said. ``We've gotten word from the upper echelons of state
government that we should just go ahead and not worry about these
sideshows.''

   PHOENICIAN-SHIPS (Undated) _ The Phoenicians were the master
seafarers of antiquity, but modern scholarship knows little of the

This new generation of forensic DNA techniques promises to be so
efficient that some civil libertarians fear the data bases will be

   RURAL-AIDS (Lowry City, Mo.) _ Rural America is becoming a new
frontier for AIDS, as the experience of patients and people trying

poverty and lack of education. And, as the HIV virus becomes more
common in women nationally, health experts are especially worried
about rural women because they are often more isolated, less
independent and less assertive. By Pam Belluck.

   TEXAS-SCHOOLS (Houston) _ A coalition of Christian
conservatives, favoring home-schooling, vouchers, the mandated
teaching of creationism, heavy editing of textbooks and a breaking
down of the wall between church and state, at least as far as
public schools are involved, now control five seats on the Texas
state school board. Because of a fluke, they are guaranteed a sixth
after the election in November. This means that they only need to
win one more to have control of the state board, and they have two
or three opportunities to get it. Many political professionals
believe this, not the Bush race for governor, which is a foregone
conclusion, is the most significant election in Texas this fall. By

Yorkers, especially the well-to-do suits who populate much of

FOR THOSE WITH TOO MUCH ON THEIR PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suppose a waiter walked up to your table, delivered a curt nod,
removed the plates and saucers, then proceeded to dump a pan of hot
porridge on your tablecloth.
</P>
<P>
   What would you do?
</P>
<P>
   The truth is you would probably send your compliments to the
chef and leave the waiter a big tip. After all, you ordered the
mess.
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe you didn't, because culinary trends move slowly from
New York to Newhalem.
</P>
<P>
   According to reports received in the Intermediate Eater's
dispatch center (known as Indigestion Central), they are serving
the aforementioned mess at Le Cirque 2000 in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's not porridge,but the Italian mush known as
polenta.
</P>
<P>
   At Le Cirque, they haul the pot out and splash about two quarts
onto the tablecloth. The waiter then scatters a few beans and hunks
of sausage over the steaming polenta and equips everybody at the
table with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   In the olden days, kings and barons demanded new gustatory
thrills each night from their castle kitchens. It got to the point
where harried chefs would stuff a canary inside a dove and stuff
the dove inside a duck and stuff the duck inside a giant goose,
then bake the whole thing for three hours only to discover that the
king had to fight a war and was grabbing a burrito at Taco Bell.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago Manhattan chefs exhausted their recipes for
stuff-stuffs and in desperation began to move in the other
direction on the culinary ladder. Apparently, at Le Cirque they
have reached the level of ``authentic'' Italian peasant food. In
another year they'll be charging $35.95 for an order of chicken
feet and collard greens. And they'll probably dump it in your lap.
</P>
<P>
   For a child growing up in Montana, ``peasant food'' translated
into tuna casseroles or macaroni and cheese. Will these items soon
appear on the menu at Le Cirque 2000?
</P>
<P>
   If so, I might get in line, because I really like tuna
casseroles and macaroni with cheese. Particularly if they are
prepared like this:
</P>
<P>
   Tuna Tres Chic
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces noodles
</P>
<P>
   2 9-ounce cans solid-pack tuna
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   One-half pound sliced fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   1 red or green pepper, seeded and cubed
</P>
<P>
   2 10-ounce packages French-style frozen green beans
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sliced celery
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken bouillon cube
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dill weed
</P>
<P>
   2 cups skim milk
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons Wondra flour
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup reduced-fat Velveeta
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup light mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Thaw the green beans, then plunk them into a large casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the noodles in a large kettle of salted water. You might
add a bit of oil to the pot so the noodles won't stick together.
Drain, then dump them into the casserole with the beans. (If the
noodles stuck together, go back two spaces. Do not pass Go. Do not
collect $200.)
</P>
<P>
   While the noodles are cooking, heat the oil in a large skillet
and add the onion, mushrooms, celery and sweet pepper. When the
onion is soft, dump all the veggies into the casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Pour the milk into the same skillet, drop in the bouillon cube
and stir in the Wondra flour. Heat, stirring, until the milk
thickens, then stir in the Velveeta, cubed. When it has melted,
pour this sludge into the casserole, too. Add the dill weed and
mayonnaise, then moosh everything around. Gently stir in the tuna.
</P>
<P>
   If you want, you can sprinkle the top of the casserole with some
dry bread crumbs. If you have some leftover olives in the fridge,
plunk them into the top. If you use the olives to create a happy
face on top of the casserole, don't tell your guests you got this
recipe from me.
</P>
<P>
   Shove the casserole into a 350-degree oven for 30 minutes and
this should serve six.
</P>
<P>
   Macaroni for Millionaires
</P>
<P>
   10 ounces dried macaroni
</P>
<P>
   1 can cream of mushroom soup
</P>
<P>
   1 cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup green pepper, chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups medium cheddar cheese, grated
</P>
<P>
   Cajun seasoning
</P>
<P>
   5 Ritz crackers
</P>
<P>
   Butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cubed ham (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is called Macaroni for Millionaires because I
specified that the crackers must be Ritz.
</P>
<P>
   These days I use low-fat mayonnaise and cheese but _ as with the
tuna casserole _ the end result is about the same.
</P>
<P>
   Cook the macaroni in boiling, salted water until done. Drain,
pour warm water over the top, drain again then dump into a
casserole.
</P>
<P>
   Add the undiluted soup, the mayo, green pepper, onion and
cheese. Sprinkle heavily with Cajun seasoning or lightly with
cayenne pepper. Moosh everything around.
</P>
<P>
   Crumble the crackers in your fist and scatter over the top of
the casserole. Dot with butter or whatever, then shove into a
375-degree oven for 30 minutes. This will serve four.
</P>
<P>
   Since I am technically no longer a peasant, I usually sneak some
cubes of ham into this casserole before mooshing and heating.
</P>
<P>
   I also serve it on a plate.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Phoenicians were the master seafarers of antiquity, the
first to knit the Mediterranean into a trading state.
Contemporaries knew them well. Homer derided them as ``greedy
rogues,'' and the Bible praised their ships of oak and cedar as
works that ``did sing.''
</P>
<P>
   But modern scholarship knows little of the vanished people and
almost nothing of the empire's basis, its merchant ships. No ships
that are clearly Phoenician have come to light, and only a few
images of the trading vessels have come down through the ages.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, the cold depths of the Mediterranean have yielded
a bonanza that might change all that _ if archaeologists and
treasure hunters can learn to work together.
</P>
<P>
   The episode began last month as entrepreneurs based in Tampa,
Fla., were searching the deep western Mediterranean for lost gold
and silver. In the inky darkness, a half-mile down, the team's
robot suddenly lit up hundreds of amphoras, the clay storage jars
of antiquity. What the robot had revealed was clearly a very old
shipwreck.
</P>
<P>
   Thrilled, Greg Stemm, director of operations for Odyssey Marine
Exploration Inc., had videotapes of the amphoras studied by
nautical archaeologists. They tentatively identified the earthen
jars as typical of the Phoenician colony of Carthage around the
fifth century B.C., near the peak of Phoenician influence in the
ancient world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an incredible find,'' Stemm said in an interview. ``It's
the oldest deep wreck ever found. We're very excited.''
</P>
<P>
   The discovery is already stirring great scholarly interest
because so little is known of the ancient mariners.
</P>
<P>
   During the first millennium B.C., the Phoenicians, sailing
mainly out of the area that is now Lebanon, spread colonies along
some of the Mediterranean's best land and prospered because of
their enormous commercial zeal.
</P>
<P>
   They traded in textiles, dyes, jewelry, glass, wine, perfumes
and wood. Rivals often hated them. Plutarch, a Greek, scorned them
as ``a people full of bitterness'' and ``so strict as to dislike
all humor and kindness.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Phoenicians' early success, subsequent waves of
civilization wiped out most traces of their cities and artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the deep wreck appears to be pristine. A striking
color video made by the Odyssey team shows a jumble of brown and
red amphoras much as they must have lain shortly after the ship,
perhaps wrecked by one of the Mediterranean's squalls, settled into
the ooze.
</P>
<P>
   The amphoras are about 3 feet long. Some are broken, but most
seem to be intact, dotted by delicate sea fans and inhabited by
snakelike fish.
</P>
<P>
   Amphoras were the all-purpose shipping vessels of antiquity,
holding wine, olive oil, honey, fish sauce and other trade
products.
</P>
<P>
   What lies beneath the amphoras and the muck _ whether the ship's
wooden hull, tools, personal items and perhaps coins, which would
help pinpoint the date of the sinking _ can only be learned by
excavation. The frigidity and low oxygen levels of the deep sea are
known to keep many old items remarkably well preserved.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to learn more, and happy to admit the profit motive, Stemm
is seeking to team up with archaeologists to explore the wreck with
scholarly rigor and to make the project pay for itself by selling
film rights and organizing museum shows.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, considering past enmity, scholars are showing
considerable interest in the proposed venture, seeing the wreck as
a good test of the feasibility of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's got tremendous potential as a way to bring archaeology
into the business world,'' said Cheryl Ward, a professor at the
Institute of Nautical Archaeology of Texas A&AMP;M University. ``This
is an exciting ship because it is from a time that is poorly known
and a culture that is known to us only from land excavations and
the accounts of their enemies.''
</P>
<P>
   William Murray, chairman of the underwater archaeology committee
of the Archaeological Institute of America, a top professional
group, said he would urge his colleagues to consider the venture
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``If academic archaeologists are going to deal with deep-water
shipwrecks, it's going to have to be through cooperative efforts
like this,'' he said in an interview. ``We need to explore the
possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades, archaeologists and treasure hunters battled one
another over shipwrecks in shallow waters. Both sides could visit
and excavate the ruins by means of relatively inexpensive scuba
gear, which allows divers to go down 100 feet or so.
</P>
<P>
   But advanced technology is moving the action deeper, sometimes
miles deeper, into dark areas of icy temperatures and crushing
pressures. The high cost of the equipment means commercial
interests tend to have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   No archaeologist can afford the millions of dollars it takes to
probe the sea's sunless depths thoroughly, even though many
shipwrecks beckon and much is yet to be learned of humanity's past.
</P>
<P>
   A lucky few have worked with Robert Ballard, an oceanographer
and former Navy officer who uses military gear to hunt deep wrecks.
Last year he announced the discovery in the Mediterranean of five
ancient Roman ships, the oldest dating to about 100 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   Scholars have given mixed reviews to some commercial
deep-recovery efforts, like the raising of Titanic artifacts. But
in their previous excavations, Stemm and his business partner, John
Morris, have shown serious interest in learning archaeology and
scrutinizing lost ships to illuminate the human past.
</P>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, they recovered a 17th-century Spanish
merchant ship from the depths of the Gulf of Mexico, and won praise
from archaeologists for their care. Their deep-diving robot brought
up not only pearls, gold bars and jewelry but wooden beams, olive
jars and ballast stones, recording each item's position for
archaeological analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Stemm and his team stumbled on the new wreck last month while
searching for a British warship that sank in the Mediterranean more
than 300 years ago when it was transporting a large cargo of coins
valued today at up to $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   Their expedition, begun in July and code-named Cambridge, is a
cooperative venture between Odyssey, a publicly traded company, and
the Royal Naval Museum in Portsmouth, England, a public institution
partly financed by the Royal Navy.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>

</P>
<P>
   The Odyssey team used a 90-foot boat to tow a sonar over the
distant seabed, finding dozens of potential targets. Then a
desk-sized robot with lights and cameras was lowered on a long
tether to examine interesting sites close up.
</P>
<P>
   The ancient wreck was found Sept. 17. The overall site, nearly
3,000 feet down, was measured as about 50 feet long and 25 feet
wide, with at least 200 amphoras visible above the mud.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ages, amphora styles changed from region to region,
aiding their dating and identification today. Experts say the newly
discovered ones are clearly rare, half body and half neck, with
small, ear-shaped handles.
</P>
<P>
   Jenette Flow, a marine archaeologist in Tampa who consults for
Odyssey, worked with top experts to identify the amphoras. Similar
ones had been found in Morocco, Spain and Greece, where clay jars
of this style were recovered with other materials that were dated
to about 450 B.C. In general the amphora style is known as Punic,
or Carthaginian, as it seems to have arisen in Phoenicia's western
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm jumping up and down,'' Ms. Flow said in a telephone
interview. ``It really looks like an exciting site to me. It's
intact.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts caution that a distinctive load of trade goods can still
be deceptive in determining a ship's identity, since ancient
cargoes were picked up at various ports. So a ship with a Punic
cargo might have begun its voyages in Phoenicia proper or another
ancient land.
</P>
<P>
   Stemm said he was already talking with top archaeologists and
was confident an alliance would be worked out. Less certain, he
said, was whether Odyssey could raise the money for the underwater
dig, which he estimated might cost up to $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary work could begin as soon as the spring, Stemm said.
But he stressed that the pace would be determined by archaeological
factors, not commercial ones.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, much of the surviving ship and its cargo could be
raised and preserved. If so, he said, nothing of the reclaimed ship
would be sold individually. ``It's too old and rare,'' Stemm said.
``It should be kept together as a collection'' that the general
public could view, he said, perhaps in a touring exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey has posted videos and pictures of the wreck site at
www.shipwreck.net on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The find is likely to stir debate over how to save the sea's
lost cultural treasures.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations, spurred by advances in ocean exploration, is
drafting a protection treaty that so far tends to favor scholarly
over commercial efforts _ to the chagrin of Stemm, who as a member
of the U.S. delegation to a recent expert meeting on the proposed
treaty argued otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The archaeologists can't get access'' to the deep's cultural
riches, Stemm said in an interview. ``And we have to find a way to
justify the expense.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ward of the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, while
supportive of the idea of joint work by scholars and treasure
hunters on deep-sea projects, urged caution.
</P>
<P>
   Archaeology is ``a luxury, like music or art,'' Dr. Ward said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard,'' she said, ``to make it pay for itself without
losing some of its foundations.''

   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ For a piece of history, the building is
not much to look at: a glass-sided ergonomics furniture showroom
with a stucco facade. It sits along a fast road crowded with
shopping plazas, office parks and condo developments, commanding as
much attention as a 7-Eleven.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the building, officials of this sprawling city of 75,000
next door to Palo Alto say, is nothing less than the ``Birthplace
of Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter that Palo Alto has already claimed a site _ the
one-car garage where Bill Hewlett and William Packard hatched their
electronics empire _ as the Birthplace of Silicon Valley (complete
with a plaque and a state historic-site designation). Or that
Stanford, home of the first research park in the valley,
unofficially claims the title.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View has applied to the state to make the ergonomics
store building a state historic site. Meanwhile, later this month,
the City Council is planning to declare the building a historic
site.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're so proud that this is where it all started, ``said Ralph
Faravalli, Mountain View's mayor and the president of the
historical society. ``Palo Alto may say it has the birthplace, but
we know better.''
</P>
<P>
   Sparring over the Birthplace of Silicon Valley is a sign of the
times.
</P>
<P>
   There is a growing movement throughout the valley to step back,
catch a breath and marvel at the institutions that helped shape
what has become a high-tech world of mythic proportions (a place so
central to life as we know it that Microsoft, which is in Redmond,
Wash., is building a 32-acre corporate campus here just to be in
the thick of things).
</P>
<P>
   The biggest, splashiest manifestation of this is the $91 million
Tech Museum of Innovation, set to open in San Jose at the end of
the month. The museum, financed in part by Silicon Valley's biggest
wigs, promises to trace the history of the gadgets and gizmos that,
its press release says, ``put Silicon Valley at the leading edge of
the technological revolution.''
</P>
<P>
   And more and more, Silicon Valley is officially recognizing the
sites, often lowly buildings at the edges of civilization, where
technological innovations occurred. Palo Alto already has three
official Silicon Valley-related historic sites: the Hewlett-Packard
garage, an early Pioneer electronics research laboratory, and the
Fairchild Semiconductor building.
</P>
<P>
   There is talk of recognizing at least three more places: the
Stanford laboratory of Fred Terman, who conceived the idea of
turning the valley into a world of research and innovation; the
garage where Apple Computer Inc. was born, even the Wagon Wheel
restaurant, the Mountain View watering hole where Fairchild
Semiconductor's scientists kicked back at the end of their long
days.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View's claim stems from the glass and stucco building's
incarnation as Shockley Transistor Co. William Shockley, one of the
inventors of the transistor, relocated here after leaving Bell Labs
in New Jersey in 1956. He then recruited some of the best
scientists in the country.
</P>
<P>
   When eight of Shockley's employees defected to Fairchild
Semiconductor, they invented the integrated circuit, which spawned
the computer revolution and the big boom in the Silicon Valley
universe.
</P>
<P>
   Mountain View officials want to place a standing plaque at the
site, if not a boulder, something big that will command the world's
attention. ``We've wanted to do this for a long time,'' Faravalli
said.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, 11 years ago, when Jacques Beaudouin, a retired
Stanford University engineer who had worked for Shockley, first
proposed the idea of recognizing the lab, he was ignored. Beaudouin
says he tried again a few years after Shockley died in 1989 of
prostate cancer; nothing happened then, either.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, Shockley, who had shared in the Nobel Prize for
the transistor, was far better known for his racist genetic
theories claiming that blacks are inferior to whites. That,
Beaudouin says, tainted any efforts to recognize his scientific
legacy.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``I've always said that the one thing should have nothing to do
with his scientific contributions,'' Beaudouin said, as he walked
through the cavernous ergonomics furniture showroom, reminiscing
about the old days.
</P>
<P>
   No one disputes Shockley's contribution to Silicon Valley. But
Steven Staiger, the historian for the Palo Alto Historical
Association, said calling Shockley's lab, or even the
Hewlett-Packard garage, the birthplace of Silicon Valley might be a
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since Silicon Valley is an idea rather than a thing, and
historical landmarks tend to be things, how do you put the two
together?'' he said. To really recognize the birthplace, he added,
one would have to visit the grave of Fred Terman, or the house
where he was born. ``He was really the one who came up with the
idea of Silicon Valley. And if you start recognizing places like
the Wagon Wheel, then where will it end?''
</P>
<P>
   The possibilities, like those in Silicon Valley itself, may be
limitless. As Beaudouin put it when he heard that the Wagon Wheel
Restaurant might be recognized as a historic site: ``If you
recognize the Wagon Wheel, then what about Kirk's Burgers? That's
where Bill Shockley liked to eat lunch all the time. He would take
us there to eat and take out a napkin and start scribbling
formulas. Ideas were born in that burger joint.''

   XIAMEN, China _ From the bluffs along the edge of this booming
Chinese city, you can easily peer into Taiwan's western frontier, a
small island only half a mile away.
</P>
<P>
   From the early 1950s to 1979, artillery here ritually pounded
the nearby islands of Jinmen, known in the West as Quemoy, and
other locations.
</P>
<P>
   On these same bluffs today stand giant red characters that
repeat, for the benefit of nearby islanders who might gaze west
with binoculars, China's proposal for luring ``renegade'' Taiwan
back into the fold: ``One Country, Two Systems to Reunify China.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the water Taiwan, in response, has put up a huge white
billboard calling for reunification according to the ``Three
People's Principles'' propounded early this century by the founder
of the Republic of China, Sun Yat-sen: nationalism, democracy and
better livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   The dueling signs, erected last year, express the continuing
test of wills between China and Taiwan _ a struggle that will enter
a new phase on Wednesday with the first high-level contact in five
years between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
   Although Taiwan and China these days exchange symbolic gestures,
even smiles, rather than artillery shots, the visit of a senior
Taiwan official to Shanghai and Beijing is so sensitive that the
two sides have not publicly agreed what they will discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Wary officials on Taiwan insist on calling this ``a visit, not
talks.'' They may agree on little more than to talk again in the
future. But because the stakes are so high, people on both sides of
the Taiwan Strait, as well as in Washington, will be scrutinizing
every inflection.
</P>
<P>
   China sees recovering sovereignty over Taiwan as the unfinished
business of the bloody civil war that brought Communist victory on
the mainland in 1949. China ceaselessly calls the recovery of
Taiwan its overriding foreign policy goal.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, which has created prosperity and a humming democracy, no
longer claims, as it once did, to house the true government of all
China. More and more, its 22 million people say they feel an
independent identity.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's leaders, mindful of the glowering colossus nearby,
still profess to want reunification _ some day far in the future,
when China, too, is prosperous and democratic. For now they insist
that China and the world must recognize Taiwan as a separate
entity.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical speech on Saturday, the president of Taiwan, Lee
Teng-hui, called for a ``gradualist approach'' toward unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking forward to constructive dialogue between the
two sides of the Taiwan Strait based on the reality of divided
rule,'' he said, promising continued efforts to break free of the
diplomatic strangulation pursued by Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting China from Oct. 14 to 19 will be Koo Chen-fu, head of
the semiofficial Straits Exchange Foundation. He is to meet with
his Chinese counterpart, Wang Daohan, head of China's Association
for Relations Across the Taiwan Strait. In what is seen as a
good-will gesture by Beijing, Koo is also to meet Chinese President
Jiang Zemin on Oct. 18.
</P>
<P>
   Koo and Wang held their first, and only, official talks in
Singapore in 1993. Their next scheduled meeting, in 1995, was
canceled by China when it was angered by Lee's visit to a class
reunion at Cornell University, seen as a perfidious effort to
bolster Taiwan's independent status.
</P>
<P>
   The next year, relations became more tense when China conducted
missile tests near Taiwan during the island's presidential election
and the United States sent aircraft carriers into the region.
</P>
<P>
   Since then the United States, worried about being dragged into a
conflict, has encouraged both sides to resume talks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their diverging goals, both sides may feel that their
interests are served by meeting, said a Western diplomat in
Beijing. ``For Taiwan, if China is talking it's not attacking, and
for China, if Taiwan is talking then it's not declaring
independence,'' the diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
   The dance between China and Taiwan is an awkward one, with China
pressing for a quick and full embrace and Taiwan holding out a
stiff arm in resistance.
</P>
<P>
   China has called for immediate discussions of the political
future, offering a deal looser than Hong Kong's in which Taiwan
could keep its democracy and even its army but come under Chinese
sovereignty. Taiwan wants to fend off political negotiations,
limiting talks for now to practical issues like fishing and
immigration disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the matter, China and Taiwan are increasingly
intertwined economically and socially, a process China encourages
and Taiwan is struggling to limit.
</P>
<P>
   The ties are apparent here in Xiamen, one of China's thriving
``special economic zones'' that is host to many Taiwan factories,
real estate developments and tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Just in the last few days, among hundreds of other visiting
``compatriots,'' as they are always called here, were 24 members of
a Taipei golf club who came to play Xiamen's three golf courses and
sightsee.
</P>
<P>
   Also visiting, at the invitation of the Elders' Society of
Xiamen, were 21 men and women from a Taiwan senior citizens' group,
who are performing folk songs and dances in several cities. ``We've
been very warmly welcomed,'' said the group leader, Hsieh Sai-kun.
``I don't know much about politics, but I hope there will be more
cultural exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a million business executives and tourists from Taiwan
visit China each year, and some 50,000 live here, the Western
diplomat said. In contrast, Taiwan strictly limits visitors from
the mainland.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan's investment and trade in the mainland are large and
climbing, even as its government tries to enforce its slogan of
``Go slow; be patient.''
</P>
<P>
   The Taiwan government has refused to allow large, showcase
investments like multibillion-dollar petrochemical and power
projects in Fujian Province that were planned by the giant Formosa
Plastics Group.
</P>
<P>
   Many Taiwan businesses are chafing at the policy, and the
Formosa Group's chairman, Wang Yung-ching, has publicly urged his
government to relax it. ``We fear we will lose our opportunity'' in
China, he said in a recent speech.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Most important, Taiwan does not allow direct transportation,
postal or communications links with the mainland. This slows
cross-strait business by adding costs and forces travelers to spend
hundreds of extra dollars looping through Hong Kong or Macao.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Yao Ming-fu of the Taiwan-owned ship Uni-Pioneer, in
Xiamen harbor this weekend to pick up cargo that will eventually go
to Japan or Southeast Asia, expressed the frustrations of shippers
and businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   Taking goods directly from here to Taiwan's main harbor takes
about 12 hours, he said. But his ship can only carry Chinese-made
goods for reshipment onward; none can be imported into Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
   Transporting Chinese goods to Taiwan itself requires a 24-hour
boat trip to Hong Kong, some bothersome paperwork, then another
14-hour journey to Taiwan, said Yao. His parent company, Evergreen
Group, is one of the world's largest shippers.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan officials have not been able to contain small-scale
direct commerce in both directions among adjacent islands around
Xiamen, and people from Taiwan even make one- to five-day visits
across these waters, say local press reports and scholars.
</P>
<P>
   How long this strange dance between China and Taiwan can
continue is unknown. China has warned that if Taiwan formally
declares independence, it will mount a military attack _ a regional
catastrophe. Short of such a declaration, what action by Taiwan
might touch off a harsh response? How long will China's patience
hold?
</P>
<P>
   Major agreement in the next three to five years seems unlikely,
Fan Xihou, director of the Taiwan Research Institute of Xiamen
University, said in an interview. But after that, he suggested,
``time will be against Taiwan'' as China's military and economic
strength builds.
</P>
<P>
   Taiwan, for its part, hopes that it can continue mustering
enough strength at home and abroad to shape the terms of its future
relationship with the would-be motherland.

A FORMER BUSINESSMAN STRUGGLES TO LEAD AN ECONOMICALLY AILING HONG
KONG 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MARK LANDLER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ After a year of economic despair, relentless
criticism and mounting doubts about his leadership, Hong Kong's
chief executive, Tung Chee-hwa, finally got a break last week.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, making his first visit
here since this former British colony reverted to China, praised
Tung for how steadily he was leading Hong Kong through the Asian
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
   That the chief executive's most prominent defender these days is
the former colonial ruler of this territory must be cold comfort to
Tung, a 61-year-old former shipping tycoon who took over Hong Kong
when it was the pulsing heart of the Asian economy and has watched
as it has gone into cardiac arrest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I frustrated?'' asked Tung in a rare interview Friday. ``At
times, I would say. But the important thing is to zero in on the
things you can do, and also zero in on the longterm perspective,
because the turmoil will be over.''
</P>
<P>
   As if to underscore his point, Tung showed off a scroll that
China's president, Jiang Zemin, painted and gave to Hong Kong as a
gift during the handover. ``Hong Kong will be better tomorrow,'' it
says in Chinese calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
   To many people here, however, the economic crisis has settled
into a debilitating illness, with little hope of a cure. Hong
Kong's stock market has fallen by roughly half since its peak in
August 1997, property prices have plummeted by as much as 60
percent, and unemployment is soaring.
</P>
<P>
   ``People respect Tung as a sincere, elderly person,'' said
Joseph Cheng, a professor of political science at the City
University of Hong Kong. ``His heart is in the right place, but
people are looking for results.''
</P>
<P>
   As the man China chose to run Hong Kong, Tung faces a quandary
unique among Asian leaders. He does not have a popular mandate, yet
he must serve two very different constituencies: the 6.6 million
people of Hong Kong and the Communist bosses in Beijing. Unless he
comes to grips with the economic crisis, his critics say, Tung
risks losing the faith of both groups.
</P>
<P>
   With its economy in a free-fall, some observers said they also
feared that Hong Kong was turning away from the global market. In
August, the government intervened massively in the stock market in
order to foil overseas hedge funds, which it accused of improperly
manipulating Hong Kong's markets.
</P>
<P>
   In defending the intervention, senior officials played heavily
on fears of unnamed ``foreign traders,'' while a prominent member
of the Legislature referred to foreigners by a derogatory Cantonese
word.
</P>
<P>
   Tung said such remarks reflected public ``frustration'' with the
hedge funds, which he said had destabilized Hong Kong's economy.
But as someone who lived in Boston and New York for nine years and
watches the football games of his favorite team, the San Francisco
49ers, on videocassette, Tung seemed disturbed by suggestions that
Hong Kong had become xenophobic.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole of Hong Kong overwhelmingly understands that Hong
Kong is an international city, and the future of Hong Kong, the
success of Hong Kong, is closely tied to being an international
city,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to domestic issues, critics said Tung seems to
miss the forest for the trees. In his annual policy address last
week, the chief executive proposed to turn Hong Kong into a center
for Chinese medicine, but offered no major remedies for restoring
the property market. During a radio call-in show with Tung after
the 135-minute speech, one caller bluntly told him to resign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, you can understand it when the public is unhappy,''
Tung said. But he added, ``Hong Kong is a very free-market economy,
and what the government can do is really not a lot.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some politicians here said Tung may be miscast in his role.
Before the handover, when Hong Kong was booming, a conservative
businessman might have seemed an obvious choice to keep the cash
registers ringing. Now, with the economy in a shambles and Hong
Kong's confidence shaken, people here are yearning for more than
Tung's grey-flannel style.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would make an excellent chief executive in Singapore, where
the people are Chinese, but are more old-fashioned,'' said Martin
Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy politician.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his British predecessor, Christopher Patten, who was a
Tory party leader before coming to Hong Kong, Tung does not relish
kissing babies, glad-handing on the street or racing to the scene
of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one area in which I really have to learn a whole lot
more _ transforming myself from a businessman,'' Tung said. ``Could
I communicate better? Yes, I can and I will communicate better.''
</P>
<P>
   But while Tung wants to hone his political skills, he is not
about to embrace the rough-and-tumble of democracy. Hong Kong held
direct elections for one-third of the seats in its legislature last
May, and pro-democracy candidates, who did well, are pressing for a
speedier transition to full democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Tung, however, said the economic crisis made him more determined
than ever to stick the existing timetable, which would not put his
job, or the full legislature, up for election until after 2007.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we just have too many things going on,'' he said.
``If you look at the changes that are around us, we need a stable
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   In the final analysis, Tung's future depends on his relationship
with the leaders in Beijing. And despite Hong Kong's travails,
there is no evidence yet that he has lost their faith. Likewise,
Tung's support among Hong Kong's powerful property tycoons remains
generally solid.
</P>
<P>
   Tung has worked hard to establish his credentials as the leader
of a Chinese city. In his speech last week, he said Hong Kong
people should be inspired by their brethren in China, who labored
to build earthen walls to hold back the waters during the recent
epic floods on the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
   As critics point out, however, the flood would not have been so
calamitous if China had protected its environment. Hong Kong, they
said, needed policies that avoid disaster, rather than appeals to
heroism after disaster has already struck.

HARDSHIPS OF AIDS ONLY GET WORSE IN SMALL TOWN, USA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mo.)  (js) 
 By PAM BELLUCK    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOWRY CITY, Mo. _ Ronda Elliott's 6-year-old daughter often
comes home in tears after fending off taunts about her mother on
the school bus. Her 10-year-son got so fed up with being picked on
that he got into a brawl. And the man who owned the trailer Ms.
Elliott was living in abruptly told her to find a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't want people with the disease in his trailer
house,'' Ms. Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease she has is AIDS, and in this dusty country town
brushing the Ozarks, she has found it to be something people have a
hard time accepting. Indeed, Ms. Elliott, 30, tried to keep it
quiet, but with a population of only 700, she said, if ``you know
something, the other side of town knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rural America is becoming a new frontier for AIDS as social
taboos, remote locations, poverty and lack of education aggravate
the experience of patients and of those trying to help them. And,
as the HIV virus becomes more common in women nationally, health
experts are especially worried about rural women because they are
often more isolated, less independent and less assertive than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the rural areas and small
cities,'' said Gary West, a deputy director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's division of HIV/AIDS prevention.
``The impact in the urban areas is actually coming down a bit,
whereas the impact in rural areas and small cities is actually
going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rural AIDS victims make up an increasing share of the nation's
AIDS cases, partly because people in cities have more knowledge
about and access to methods of prevention and treatment and partly
because there is more migration between city and country than there
used to be. While the numbers are small compared with cities _
rural cases rose from 5 percent in 1990 to more than 7 percent of
the total cases in 1997 _ the particular problems associated with
AIDS in rural communities have made health experts believe the
situation warrants special attention.
</P>
<P>
   Rural health experts say the incidence of AIDS in these
communities may actually be higher because some people go to cities
to get tested.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Nushawn Williams, the Brooklyn man accused last year
of infecting 13 women in Chautauqua County, N.Y., was an egregious
example of the vulnerability of people in rural communities.
Experts say various obstacles impede teaching prevention or giving
rural AIDS patients emotional support and information about
complying with the often-intricate new drug regimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inability to keep things confidential in small communities
is a major, major problem,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
National Center for HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and
Tuberculosis Prevention. ``Everybody knows everybody's mother,
sister, brother, father. You could drive by the parking lot and
look at everybody's car and say, `Why does so-and-so need to go to
an HIV prevention meeting?'''

</P>
<P>
   Living in a stretch of Ozark cattle and hog country, Lynn, who
asked that she be identified only by her middle name, is so fearful
her AIDS will be discovered that she travels 100 miles to see a
doctor in Springfield. She is too nervous to attend a support group
there because even in the state's third-largest city, ``there's a
chance that someone might know someone you know.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tennessee children's hospital where she takes her
3-year-old daughter, who also has AIDS, she will not even tell
other patients what the girl's illness is. And while Lynn, 29,
would like to use the Internet to read up on news about AIDS, she
will not, because the computer is at the school where her husband
works. She said she and her husband ``have reason to believe'' that
whispers about her AIDS cost him his teaching job in the last rural
town they lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she said, ``I told a few close friends, and a lot of
those people are not my friends anymore. People still think in
their mind `I don't want to be around that person, I don't want to
drink from the same cup or I don't want to use the bathroom after
you.' This is the Bible Belt of the Midwest and morally and
religiously and everything, it's just not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because AIDS patients keep themselves so invisible,
experts say, people in rural areas do not always see it as a
threat. Not only do people not see as much of a need for AIDS
education in their area, but people who are infected may wait until
they exhibit symptoms to get tested, thereby increasing the chances
that they may infect someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was in big cities that it happened,'' said
Teresa B., 24, who was told two years ago that she and her
daughter, 4, both have AIDS. She recently attended a meeting for
AIDS patients in southeastern Missouri, the first time state
counselors have held one anywhere near her home in Cairo, Ill., she
said. Some of the people with AIDS there ``didn't even know what it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In poor rural Missouri, AIDS counselors and medical
professionals said, traditional efforts to educate people about
prevention do not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``IV drug users are not going to walk down to the square in
rural Missouri and pick up needles,'' said Stephen Fuhr, the former
medical clinic administrator for the Joplin health department who
said owners of pool halls, arcades and other teen hangouts in the
city barred him from putting up informational posters. ``Gay men
are not going to walk down Main Street in Small Town, USA, and
start talking about AIDS prevention. Condom distributions are not a
real popular idea in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rural schools are so uncomfortable with anything related to
sex that they make it nearly impossible for AIDS to be discussed.
Jim House, education director for the AIDS Project of the Ozarks in
Springfield, said several schools told him he was welcome ``as long
as you don't mention anything about homosexuality or condoms.'' One
principal told him not to bring a fellow speaker who had AIDS
because ``he might use the bathroom or take a drink at the
fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   At Norwood High School, about 50 miles east of Springfield,
House had to preview his presentation before a meeting of the
school board, mayor, town officials and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them, `How many of you are concerned because your kids
are sexually active?' and they said, `Mr. House, you have to
understand, we have an abstinence-only program here,''' he
recalled. They let him speak to students only after ``I asked them
how many pregnancies there were and they said eight, and I said,
`Oh, are those test-tube babies from the biology lab?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Pendergrass, the Norwood superintendent, said the school
board feels homosexuality and birth control are ``not acceptable
topics.'' He said that made health education difficult in a county
with one of the highest rates of teen-age pregnancy in the state.
``It's just a matter of time'' until his district has an
HIV-positive student, he said, ``and with the amount of teen-age
drinking that we have and the sexually permissive atmosphere that
exists, if we had one, we could have 20 pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say education about sexual transmission of AIDS is
especially important for both rural men and women because they are
more likely to get AIDS from heterosexual sex and less likely to be
infected by intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of low-income women in Missouri found rural
women were much less likely to use condoms than urban women because
they believed they were unnecessary or had trouble asking their
partners to use them, said William Yarber, senior director of the
Rural Center for AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention at
Indiana University and one of the study's authors. Nearly half the
women thought that as long as they were unable to get pregnant,
either because of a tubal ligation or another method of birth
control, they did not have to use a condom to protect them from
contracting the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa O., 23, who lives in Portageville, Mo., said she did not
always use condoms because her partners did not want to. Ms.
Elliott said that with her boyfriend of seven years, she used
condoms for quite a while, ``until he told me that he couldn't have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some patients travel long distances to find doctors who feel
comfortable or experienced enough to treat them. For rural people
in poverty, scant bus service and inability to afford even a tank
of gas can mean they only get help when they can get a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, Medicaid pays for both Teresa B. and Teresa O. to
visit doctors in St. Louis, roughly 200 miles from each of their
homes. Teresa O., whose 10-month-old daughter is also infected,
said she has found no knowledgeable doctors near her southeastern
Missouri town. Teresa B., who has had trouble sticking to some
medications because she hates the side effects, believes most of
the doctors in a Cairo medical clinic are ``scared to treat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott is lucky that her local physician, Dr. Scott Turner,
agreed to treat her, but even he says he must consult infectious
disease specialists because ``if a doctor has only a few AIDS
patients, it's very, very difficult to keep up with all the AIDS
research going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of access to support systems can exacerbate other problems.
Melissa Smith, client services director for the AIDS Project of the
Ozarks, said many patients she sees are poor and may have trouble
with substance abuse or domestic violence. Some women, including
Ms. Elliott, said that when they were told they had AIDS, they
entertained thoughts of suicide. Others, like Teresa B., are
wracked with guilt for infecting their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression is a huge problem for HIV-positive women here _
disconnecting with life, hopelessness, isolation,'' Ms. Smith said.
Urban women may get just as depressed but they are more likely to
have access to counselors, support groups and open-minded friends.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the AIDS Project had a telephone support group,
where people did not even have to give their names, but the grant
for that program ran out.
</P>
<P>
   West at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more
money was needed for rural programs and new approaches might be
tried, like telephone consultations and greater use of the
Internet. He said officials are considering asking a national AIDS
organization to focus on rural communities, but the search has been
complicated, he said, because most national groups are used to
working in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sue, 26, who lives in the tiny community of Dunawig, near
Joplin, finds the secrecy and isolation especially trying because
her 12-year-old daughter is at an age where she needs to talk to
someone about the illness both her parents have. The girl recently
asked to write a paper on AIDS for school, a way to focus on the
subject without betraying her parents' secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who did not want her town mentioned, wonders how to tell
her 3-year-old daughter and whether to notify schools and the
parents of playmates.
</P>
<P>
   An articulate, personable woman with a girl-next-door face and a
wholesome background, Lynn wishes she felt free to speak to others
about AIDS so ``they could see a normal person that's married and
has a family and is normal and someone they've known all their
lives and they like. I feel bad because I could really be helping a
lot of people.''

A MOVING SATURDAY IN COLLEGE FOOTBALL
</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moving day in pro golf is Saturday, the day after the cut when
the players try to make their move on the leader board. Saturday
was moving day in college football.
</P>
<P>
   Moving up: UCLA, Tennessee, Kansas State. Moving down: Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers, after their shocking 28-21 loss at Texas A&AMP;M,
fell from No. 2 to No. 8 in both the Associated Press (media) poll
and the ESPN/''USA Today'' (coaches) polls.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska's loss means that Kansas State, which moved from No. 5
to No. 4, is the Big 12 Conference's best hope for a national
championship. The Wildcats won their first game against a ranked
team this season, struggling to win at Colorado, 16-9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think our team is very pleased with the way we won
this ballgame,'' Kansas State coach Bill Snyder said. ``If there
really is such a thing as an ugly win, then you've witnessed one.
You're not going to hear a joyous locker room, that's for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's next major test comes in a month when the
Wildcats play host to Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA and Tennessee won difficult conference road games even
though both teams were without their starting tailbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins, who moved up to No. 2 behind top-ranked Ohio State,
used a 28-point second blitz to beat Arizona, 52-28. UCLA was
playing without tailback Jermaine Lewis, who was suspended last
week.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA quarterback Cade McNown said the Bruins are more concerned
about Saturday's game against No. 11 Oregon than it is about its
No. 2 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season is said and done and we're there at the top,
that's good. But right now we've only played four games,'' McNown
said. ``We've still got a lot of work to do, and we're not
convinced of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The Volunteers moved up to No. 3 off their 22-3 victory at
Georgia. Tennessee won without sophomore tailback Jamal Lewis, who
is out for the season with a knee injury.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Al Wilson returned to the lineup to boost a Tennessee
defense that has been stingy this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an emotional lift getting Al Wilson back, but we also
knew a lot of guys had to step up with Jamal Lewis out,'' Tennessee
coach Phillip Fulmer said.
Looking ahead
</P>
<P>
   ``Fort Worth Star-Telegram'' college football writer Wendell
Barnhouse takes a look at this week's top games:
</P>
<P>
   No. 11 Oregon at No. 2 UCLA: The Ducks are averaging 50.5 points
per game; the Bruins are averaging 48 points. First team to 50
wins.
</P>
<P>
   No. 7 Virginia at No. 25 Georgia Tech: A showdown in the
Atlantic Coast Conference. The Cavalivers' defense must slow a
Georgia Tech offense that has scored 40 points in four consecutive
games.
</P>
<P>
   No. 22 Texas Tech at No. 19 Colorado: The Red Raiders get
another chance to prove they're for real. The Buffaloes must show
that their 5-0 start wasn't a fluke.

SALINAS' BROTHER DENIES SWISS CLAIM THAT HE LAUNDERED DRUG MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By TIM GOLDEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost from the moment that detectives in Switzerland discovered
a huge, hidden fortune that belonged to Raul Salinas de Gortari, a
brother of Mexico's former president, Salinas has said the money
belonged to an investment fund that he had assembled with big
Mexican entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, investigators in Switzerland have arrived at a
different explanation. They say although some of Salinas' millions
did come from executives, much of that was drug money that he had
laundered with help from an old friend who is one of Mexico's
richest men.
</P>
<P>
   In a secret report, the Swiss police suggest that the friend,
Carlos Peralta Quintero, helped hide protection money that they
assert drug traffickers had paid to Salinas. Salinas is the elder
brother of former President Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transactions described by Carlos Peralta were designed in
their entirety for one purpose only, namely, the laundering of
money,'' the report states. A partial copy of the 369-page document
was obtained by The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The case was bolstered this month when the Mexican authorities
announced that they had linked Raul Salinas to an additional $119
million in a maze of Mexican and foreign accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Mexico also said they will try to interview the
witnesses developed by Swiss and American investigators, raising
the possibility that they might add drug-trafficking accusations to
the murder and graft charges on which Salinas has been jailed there
since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But the the investigative report and other documents suggest
that the Swiss explanation of the money may have problems of its
own.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta, the 46-year-old heir to an industrial and
telecommunications conglomerate, denied the allegations against him
as outrageous. And lawyers for Salinas describe the Swiss
accusations against the industrialist as one of the most obvious
fictions among what they say are a litany of unsustainable claims
against their client.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money of Carlos Peralta is absolutely legitimate,'' Raul
Salinas' lead attorney, Eduardo Luengo Creel, said in an interview.
``We have demonstrated its movement from start to finish. But the
stance of the Swiss prosecutor and the police is to ignore any
evidence that contradicts their theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the investigators' report, the Swiss authorities are
expected to confiscate the more than $100 million they have kept
frozen in Salinas' 15 accounts there. Once that happens, Salinas'
lawyers say they will go to the country's Supreme Court to sue for
its release.
</P>
<P>
   The Swiss report quotes a series of witnesses who recount
meetings at which Raul Salinas and other Mexican politicians
purportedly cut deals with drug traffickers and picked up suitcases
filled with cash. Most of those informants appear to be convicted
drug traffickers themselves or former aides, security guards or
associates of the Salinas brothers, and nearly all of them are
identified only by pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   Although it often refers to appendices that may contain further
detail, the report itself offers accounts of Salinas' purported
dealings that are often general and sometimes vague. There is
little explanation of how he might have exercised influence with
police and military agencies to allow the smugglers to operate
freely.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Peralta is something of an exception. That part of
the report quotes a convicted drug trafficker named Marco Enrique
Torres as saying he gave the industrialist a kilogram package of
cocaine _ 2.2 pounds, or about $20,000 worth on the New York
wholesale market _ as a Christmas gift from Raul Salinas in 1993.
Torres said he handed the drugs to Peralta on Dec. 25 ``in front of
the restaurant Casserola at Paseo de la Reforma in Mexico City.''
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant, however, is in a different part of town. And
travel documents provided to the Swiss by Peralta appear to show
that he was on vacation in Florida from Dec. 19 until Dec. 26, when
he took off with relatives on a week-long Caribbean cruise.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
Andrew Lluberes, confirmed that Peralta entered the United States
on Dec. 19, but said the agency did not record his departure.
</P>
<P>
   On the Swiss' larger claim, that Raul Salinas gave Peralta $50
million to hide the fact that it came from drug traffickers, the
Swiss do not appear to have any hard evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Peralta said that he had loaned the money to Salinas for future
investments, and the report raises a series of doubts about that
explanation. For example, it notes that a loan agreement was not
drawn up until October 1996 _ 2{ years after the funds were
transferred.
</P>
<P>
   The report also says that Salinas, Peralta and the other
businessmen who supposedly joined the investment fund never
discussed what investments they would make. It also says that
Salinas' wife once told a Swiss banker her husband got the money by
selling stock in Peralta's cellular-telephone company, Grupo
Iusacell.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever investments Salinas might have planned, the report
states, he gave about $10 million of the Peralta money to his own
wife as a wedding present.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transactions in the loan/investment business of Carlos
Peralta make no economic sense and cannot be reconstructed in any
logical way,'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the report takes no note of the roughly 500 pages
of documentation that Peralta's lawyers presented to the Swiss
authorities. Among other things, that evidence indicates that
Peralta received the $50 million he sent to Salinas from the sale
of Iusacell stock to Bell Atlantic Corp., and that he paid about
$10 million in taxes on the money in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The man who led the Swiss police investigation, Valentin
Roschacher, said in a telephone interview that Peralta's
information was effectively irrelevant because he was not a focus
of the inquiry. In order to confiscate the frozen funds, Roschacher
added, Swiss law requires only that the authorities demonstrate
that Salinas received drug bribes adding up to more than the amount
in his accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The report includes what it calls ``a cautious estimate'' that
Salinas earned at least $500 million from drug traffickers.
</P>
<P>
   But the Swiss offer no proof that Salinas transferred any money
to Peralta in the first place. In fact, the only evidence that he
might have been the original source of the $50 million comes in the
statements of four witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Torres, whom both Peralta and Salinas deny ever
having met. The other three, all of whom are identified by aliases,
appear to be former bodyguards or associates. They are quoted as
saying that they heard either directly or second-hand that Salinas
planned to invest or did invest some drug money in Peralta's
cellular-telephone empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is all a terrible lie,'' Peralta said. ``We were going to
make investments to take advantage of the good connections, the
good relations that Raul Salinas was going to have when his brother
left the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally in Mexico, the presidents and their families
continue to have some power.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Five months ago, people here triumphantly
celebrated in the streets when the Hindu nationalist-led government
conducted nuclear tests. In recent days, thousands of Delhiites
have again poured into the streets, but this time they are cursing
the very same political party.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that angers them and that threatens to topple Hindu
nationalist state governments in Delhi and Rajasthan in November
elections has nothing to do with nuclear politics and everything to
do with the stomachs and tastebuds of voters.
</P>
<P>
   It is the price of the lowly onion _ an essential ingredient of
the flavor base, or masala, of almost every dish cooked here _
which on some days has touched a record 60 rupees a kilo, or about
$1.45 for 2.2 pounds, a price that is seven times higher than it
was this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate effort to appease angry voters, the state and
national governments, both headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party,
are selling a limited supply of onions in New Delhi from flatbed
trucks and government-run cooperative stores for just 10 rupees, or
about 25 cents, a kilo.
</P>
<P>
   The national government also decided on Thursday to import
10,000 tons of onions from the Middle East and to suspend exports
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers on long lines waiting to buy the subsidized onions
are still spitting mad. Most of the hundreds of people who mob each
truck and store earn only a few dollars a day. Often, they have to
wait two, four, even six hours in the onion lines to save $2 on
their 2 kilo allotment, about a week's supply for a typical family
_ and sometimes the onions sell out before they get to the head of
the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sweating here just to buy the bloody onions and I didn't
even get any,'' said Gursharn Kaur, a 56-year-old housewife whose
husband works in a bottle cap factory, as the truck pulled away.
``The prime minister has eaten them all.''
</P>
<P>
   People are so restive and angry that on Thursday the city began
sending police escorts to guard each truck. At one site, policemen
waved their lathis _ thick bamboo sticks _ at the crowd that surged
to the front of the line, even as they unloaded their own private
stores of onions from the truck into a police jeep.
</P>
<P>
   The price of onions, a staple food of all classes, castes and
religions, has an almost mystical political significance here.
Indira Gandhi, defeated after she suspended democracy from 1975 to
1977, swept back into power in 1980 by turning the price of onions
into a populist rallying cry. Waving garlands of onions at
political gatherings, she assailed the government for its failure
to control prices.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is not just the price of onions that is up, but
also that of cauliflower, peas, coriander, chilies and other
vegetables. An unusually hot summer and late monsoon rains have
damaged harvests and contributed to shortages.
</P>
<P>
   The state and national governments here have responded with the
heavily subsidized onions, which newspapers are calling a sop to
the voters. Many economists consider the move a gimmick that could
artificially lower the price of onions, discouraging farmers from
planting more of the crop next season.
</P>
<P>
   But the politicians know their audience. Surveys over the years
have consistently shown that inflation is the most important issue
for voters, a sort of proxy measure of economic well-being in a
country where money is the scarcest commodity for most people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onions are a metaphor for the world turned upside down,'' said
Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist at the Center for the Study
of Developing Societies, a research institution in New Delhi.
``They become a symbol of what is happening to the basic things of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The November elections are the first to take place since the
Bharatiya Janata Party came to power in March in New Delhi and
Indira Gandhi's daughter-in-law, Sonia, became president of the
opposition Congress Party.
</P>
<P>
   The Hindu nationalists face tough races in the contested
elections in both Delhi and Rajasthan, the states where they hold
power _ two of the four state elections being held in November.
Polls taken last week by the Center for Media Studies, a New
Delhi-based organization that does random-sample surveys, show them
losing decisively to the Congress Party in both places.
</P>
<P>
   The high price of vegetables, as well as a shortage of drinking
water and electricity, weigh more heavily with voters than either
the nuclear tests or the Hindu nationalists' brand of cultural
politics, the poll takers found.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the decade, the Hindu party effectively used the
crusade to build a temple to Lord Rama, an incarnation of the Hindu
God Vishnu, on the site of a 15th century mosque as a vote-getting
issue, but it has been unable to pursue that agenda now that it is
in power because of resistance from its often cranky, demanding
coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   Jagjit Kaur, a government clerk waiting in an onion line last
week, said she supported the nuclear tests, but would still vote
against the Hindu nationalists this time because of the price of
onions. ``How do the nuclear blasts affect our day-to-day life?''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   At a rally in Jodphur last weekend to launch the Hindu party's
state elections in Rajasthan, Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee
boasted that the nuclear blasts staged in the state's Pokhran
desert had raised the country's international prestige, but as he
spoke, The Hindu newspaper reported, there was a rumbling in the
audience about the price of onions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   While the November elections are only for state offices,
political analysts say that a rejection of candidates from the
governing party would be a sign of its declining popularity, even
among its core supporters, who are drawn from the ranks of middle
class, upper-caste Hindus.
</P>
<P>
   The party's promise that it would bring effective governance has
been undermined in New Delhi by persistent, lengthy power outages,
water shortages, a rising crime rate and news that mustard oil, a
favorite cooking ingredient, had been widely adulterated with oil
from the seeds of a poppy plant, causing more than 60 people here
to die of dropsy.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, wholesale onion prices did come down somewhat,
and the weather will also cool off in coming weeks, lessening the
pressure on the city's overwhelmed power grid. ``By voting time, we
will overcome the people's anger,'' said Mange Ram Garg, the
party's president in New Delhi.
</P>
<P>
   There is a lot of it to overcome. At the Super Bazaar, a federal
government cooperative in New Delhi, hundreds of people, many
mothers toting small children, waited for hours in the sun on a
recent day, sweat pooling on their upper lips and streaming down
their faces.
</P>
<P>
   When lunchtime arrived, the government workers behind the
counter pulled down the rattling metal shutter on the shop and took
a nearly two-hour-long break while the people outside were unable
even to go the bathroom for fear of losing their spots in line.
</P>
<P>
   After more than an hour with no onion sale, the crush of people
began banging on the closed metal shutter. When the government
cashier finally raised it, revealing piles of bulging burlap sacks,
the maddened crowd roared for onions.

</P>
<P>
   In a preface to the anti-drug pamphlet ``How Parents Can Help
Children Live Marijuana Free,'' Senator  &UR; Orrin Hatch &LR; , R-Utah,
writes that our ``morally deprived society ... has chosen to
embrace, rather than attack, this plague'' of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The pamphlet -- written by University of Utah criminologist
 &UR; Gerald Smith &LR; , cited in the Washington Post and harvested for
Personals by  &UR; Carol Mitchell &LR;  -- goes on to list warning signs for
parents of children who may be using marijuana: A teenager who
``avoids the family while at home'' may be a kid at risk; watch
out, too, for ``interest in Ras Tafari religion''; most insidious
of all is ``excessive preoccupation with social causes, race
relations, environmental issues, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GETTING AND SPENDING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - The New York Observer says that playwright  &UR; David Mamet &LR;  is
producing a line of outerwear that will be sold at Banana Republic
under the label ``Joseph Morse Company'' but couldn't quite get him
to confirm. Mamet's only comment: ``All the proceeds go to  &UR; Paul
Newman &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Angela Weber &LR;  forwards an item from Vroom, the Official
Catalog of Rock and Roll: ``Some people make toilet seats and some
make guitars.  &UR; Marvin Maxwell &LR;  and a few of his friends are the
only ones I know who do both.''
</P>
<P>
   The product is a $149 toilet seat with a lid shaped like a
guitar, and it's owned by the likes of  &UR; Willie Nelson &LR; ,  &UR; Merle &LR; 
 &UR; Haggard  &LR; and  &UR; Howard Stern &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   And with that, Personals launches the 1998 Holiday Catalog
Quest. Volunteers are asked to send clippings of the most
surprising catalog treasures they find this season. Vote early.
</P>
<P>
   (Meanwhile, the C.F. Martin Co. is selling a limited edition
``Nelson Trigger,'' a copy of a guitar Willie Nelson bought in 1969
and named after  &UR; Roy Rogers &LR; ' horse.)
</P>
<P>
   - Don's Pampered Pet in Millbrae, Ca., is selling D-Dog
Aerobics, a $75 swing-away apparatus attached to a treadmill that
turns it into an automatic walker for an unsuspecting harnessed
dog. ``The dog can walk for miles while its owners relax, make
dinner, watch TV,'' according to promotional materials.
</P>
<P>
   - The ``Dog Tag Silencer'' is a gummy rectangle the size of a
dog tag, intended for affixing to the back of the tag to
``eliminate clanking'' against another. No price is available on
this useful item, because the only evidence that it exists is one
found by a reader on a BART platform.
</P>
<P>
   - Wild Eyes, contact lenses newly available at a number of local
opticians, turn one's eyeballs into works of art. The options:
Cateye, Redeye, Hypnotica, Wildfire, White-out, Pool Shark,
Starry-eyed and Zoomin'.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; FLASH  &LR;   &UR; - Heidi Lang &LR;  was saddened by a poignant obituary in
last week's San Rafael/Terra Linda News Pointer: The deceased, a
much-admired, civic-minded woman, met her husband ``at a Pt. Reyes
Nature Seminar,'' said the newspaper, ``and they shared a love of
pornography and the outdoors.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; - Johnny Carson &LR; ,  &UR; James Caan &LR; ,  &UR; Gary Coleman &LR; ,  &UR; James Belushi &LR; 
and  &UR; Steven Bochco &LR;  have licenses to carry loaded handguns, says
the latest issue of People magazine. Many celebrity gun-toters
receive their licenses in Culver City, where the Police Department
issued 320 permits in 1997. Los Angeles, which has a population 89
times that of Culver City, issued 158 permits over four years.
</P>
<P>
   - ``Those Navy men sure are cruising Polk Street,'' a man who
emerged from a bar to see the Blue Angels whiz by twice told
 &UR; Robert Cromey &LR; . Meanwhile, when a diamond-shaped formation flew
directly westward over Haight Street toward Golden Gate Park on
Saturday, one jet, out of formation and way off to the left, looked
downright symbolic.

   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;   &UR; ``Charlotte, 32 and a 36B, lives in New &LR; 
 &UR; York City, but sometimes &LR;

parents of children who may be using marijuana: A teenager who
``avoids the family while at home'' may be a kid at risk; watch

of all is ``excessive preoccupation with social causes, race

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DECANI, Yugoslavia _ The black robes and black toque cap
unmistakably signify that the Rev. Sava Janjic is a monk of the
ancient Serbian Orthodox Church. But his language and his study in
southern Kosovo, with three computers, a scanner and the latest
Internet connection, are unquestionably of the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a war between extremists,'' he said, speaking in
fluent English of the conflict in Serbia's province as he sat on a
wide veranda overlooking a 14th-century frescoed church kept in
pristine condition. ``On one side is a totalitarian regime, and on
the other, secessionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Father Sava, as he is known, is a rare voice of public
opposition to hard-line Serbian positions, a thorn of conscience
amid the hate-filled speeches in the Serbian Parliament and the
unrelenting repression by the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, against Kosovo's majority ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   In voicing his opposition to Milosevic in Washington, where he
visited officials in September, and in the rustic quiet of his
monastery, Janjic, 33, has no compunction in using tough language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Mladic and Karadzic were in The Hague court that would only
be a start,'' he said, referring to Ratko Mladic and Radovan
Karadzic, respectively the military and civilian leaders of the
Bosnian Serbs during the 1992-95 Bosnian war. ``The main bosses
remain free.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I see Tudjman and Milosevic in The Hague, I'll be
happy,'' he said, referring to the president of Croatia, Franjo
Tudjman, and the Yugoslav leader.
</P>
<P>
   Such radical talk is startling from a man of religion, but
Janjic says he sees himself and his monastery as a bridge: between
the extremist Serbs and extremist Albanians, between ordinary Serbs
and the outside world. And for that, his expertise in computers,
acquired step by step over the last several years, is a perfect
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a wonderful media,'' he said, patting his new
Compaq laptop, a gift from the Convention of Serbian Unity Congress
in Washington. ``It gives us the opportunity to spread the ideas of
the opposition in Kosovo and to get information out about the
church. It is all very well to wish well. We want to do
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Every night, he sends e-mails around the world, many of them
Western newspaper reports about the war in Kosovo, some of them
statements from Bishop Artimije of Kosovo, some of them accounts of
how the Milosevic government is harassing the independent media in
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, he has sent a blizzard of e-mails on what
he sees as the folly of NATO bombing against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Military intervention will only homogenize people around the
hardline Serbian policies and destroy the prospects for
democracy,'' he said. ``The psychology of the Serbs is such that if
they are attacked, they become very resentful to the attackers and
foreign countries. The regime can use this.''
</P>
<P>
   That was an allusion to Milosevic's control of powerful media
like state television that give most of the overwhelmingly rural
people of Serbia their news.
</P>
<P>
   The Decani monastery, one of the most fabled of the beautiful
Orthodox monasteries that tell Kosovo's history as the heartland of
the Serbs' medieval empire, opposed Milosevic's wars in Croatia and
Bosnia, arguing that Yugoslavia should stay intact and orient
itself toward the West.
</P>
<P>
   Since the conflict in Kosovo started in March, the bishop has
called for a cease-fire and the start of talks. For this stance,
Artimije, unlike other senior bishops in Serbia, has never been
invited to meet the Yugoslav leader. ``Doors are open to him in
Washington, London, Paris and Moscow, but not in Belgrade,'' Janjic
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The bishop took over the Kosovo diocese in 1991, and attracted a
new generation of monks to the monastery, whose church was built
between 1327 and 1335 by Prince Stephan Dusan, who became King of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   Janjic, who was born in Dubrovnik, Croatia, and is a graduate of
the University of Belgrade, is one of the 21 monks who spend up to
six hours in prayer every day. The order of service on the pulpit
is about the only contemporary object in the church: a printout
from Janjic's computer done in a 19th-century style type font.
</P>
<P>
   Because he is so media-savvy, Janjic understands how the
manipulation of state-run television and newspapers by Milosevic's
governing Socialist Party affects the mind-set of ordinary Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people in Serbia who want to make democratic change
in Serbia,'' he said. ``Some of us met with Robert Gelbhard, the
American diplomat, in June. But how is it possible to work for
change when there is no free media?''
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a free press in Yugoslavia worries him for another
reason. When there are reports in the Serbian press of atrocities
committed against Serbian civilians in Kosovo by ethnic Albanian
guerrillas, the West discredits the accounts, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer, when the separatist Kosovo Liberation Army was at
the peak of its strength, the sound of fighting between the
guerrillas and Serbian forces resounded in the hills above the
monastery. ``We were here, shut inside the monastery with shooting
all around,'' he said. ``But there were no attempts to attack the
monastery and no damage to Serb Orthodox churches in this area.''
</P>
<P>
   What would he do if the guerrillas came to the monastery _ as
the Serbian police often do? (The police are required to leave
their weapons under the fir tree in the garden.) ``We'd open the
door and ask them to have a cup of coffee,'' the priest replied.
``If they want to kill us, we have to be ready as Christians and
monks. But I don't think that will happen.''
</P>
<P>
   And which side does God take in this conflict? ``God is on the
side of the suffering people, the people who were killed in Gornje
Obrinje and in Glodjane,'' he said, referring to a site where
Albanians were massacred by Serbs and a site where 34 Serbs were
massacred by Albanians. ``And that's my side too.''

ANALYSIS: AS CLINTON IS BESIEGED, OBJECTIONS MOUNT ON POLICIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With President Clinton distracted and besieged and
his moral authority questioned after an affair with Monica
Lewinsky, there is much room for America's allies, its Congress and
even its energy companies to ignore, deflect or defy his will.
</P>
<P>
   The president has been forced to drag NATO closer and closer to
the brink of bombing Serbia, an outcome no one wants, to have
President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia take Washington
seriously.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of a global economic crisis, Clinton was
negotiating down to the wire this weekend with congressional
Republicans to fulfill American financial obligations to the
International Monetary Fund and the United Nations, organizations
that Washington insists on trying to lead even though it will not
pay its bills to them.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appears to have lost his two-year campaign to persuade
major oil companies to build a pipeline from the Caspian Sea
through Turkey, even though he had declared it an American
strategic priority.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, in what Clinton will hail as a foreign-policy
triumph, he is expected to preside over an interim
Israeli-Palestinian agreement that is coming so late, and is being
accomplished so grudgingly, that both sides fear that it will fall
apart a few weeks after it is signed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes moments of truth arrive,'' David Calleo of the Johns
Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies said. ``It's hard
to distinguish between a lack of credibility that comes from the
discrediting of an individual president and that coming from a
certain accretion of realism. The administration has been trying to
make water run uphill and make policy by declaration. But both the
president and the policies are running out of gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples abound of how it is simply easier to say ``no'' to a
wounded president, to delay, prevaricate or even reject his
declared policies.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Caspian pipeline, the oil companies argued
that at today's petroleum prices the multibillion-dollar project
made no economic sense. But a stronger or more focused president
might have made a persuasive case, perhaps directly to the public,
that the pipeline was not about transporting oil today, but about
America's energy security and its political influence well into the
next century. And such a president might have organized the
financial resources required to make it happen.
</P>
<P>
   This president's commitment to foreign policy has always been
secondary. Clinton has rarely shown much boldness or even the
willingness to punish those like Milosevic, Saddam Hussein of Iraq
or even Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel who taunt and
defy him. That is especially true with Israel, because White House
punishment of Israel threatens core Democratic Party
constituencies.
</P>
<P>
   In dealing with the Caucasus region and the Middle East, Calleo
said, ``the world doesn't see much leadership of a sustained
positive kind.'' The Middle East encompasses issues other than the
Israeli-Palestinian relationship, ``and to be on the outs with both
Iraq and Iran at the same time isn't much of a strategy, and yet it
just goes on and on,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Balkans the American effort to re-create a kind of
multiethnic Hapsburg empire is too ambitious, but would certainly
require lots of troops on the ground in Kosovo. ``We have these
policies but don't want to pay the price to sustain them, and
everyone knows it,'' Calleo said. ``If you can't or won't follow
through on your threats, it's not much good to make them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., bluntly said Sunday in a discussion
of Kosovo on ``Fox News Sunday,'' ``I think we have been diverted
by the Lewinsky matter. There is still no long-term plan, a good
description of what our objectives are.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain added about Clinton: ``He is putting our young people in
danger. Any president must go to the American people and explain
what is going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, to order a bombing campaign because of the Kosovo
crisis would be a failure of American and NATO policy, which is to
threaten Milosevic into meeting some set of American objectives.
But bombing would only make it harder to stave off a humanitarian
disaster among the nearly 300,000 ethnic Albanian refugees and make
it more likely that NATO ground troops would have to be introduced,
senior administration officials concede.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO knows this, but Milosevic knows it, too,'' one senior
American official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Add
that to Lewinsky and you get a real credibility problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagan, of the Carnegie Endowment, says that the lack of
American decisiveness inevitably produces an unwillingness of other
countries and actors to follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be simple to say that because of Lewinsky this
president is distracted,'' Kagan said. ``But the problem of
credibility transcends the Lewinsky affair, though it only
exacerbates the problems.'' The matter is especially acute in an
altering world of economic crisis where bilateral policies are less
important than multilateral ones, ``when we really do need some
concentrated leadership of an unusual kind.''
</P>
<P>
   International indecisiveness in NATO, the United Nations and
global financial institutions starts with American indecisiveness,
Kagan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a Cabinet secretary'' _ such as Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright _ ``issuing threats while it is soon clear that
the administration will not follow through,'' he said, whether the
topic is the Middle East or Kosovo. ``You have the secretary of
defense,'' William Cohen, ``speaking for the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
and they don't want to go into Kosovo.'' And Clinton ``doesn't have
the moral authority to order them to go on the one hand, or provide
them the budget that makes it easier for them to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He described the situation as ``a simple paradox: If it were
clearer that we were prepared to take action, it would be easier
for others to get on board.''
</P>
<P>
   For Richard Haass, foreign policy director for the Brookings
Institution, Clinton's ``unwillingness to level with Congress and
the American people over Bosnia has a bad aftertaste'' and
resonates with negative implications for Kosovo, Haass said, where
``we've dithered for months.''
</P>
<P>
   There are similar gaps between rhetoric and action over Iraq,
Haass said. He compared Clinton's statements in February when he
talked of going to war over access for arms inspectors to the
administration's willingness now to let the United Nations solve
the problem. ``They blinked in February,'' Haass said, ``and now
we're reluctant to bring the crisis to a head.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, he said, ``We've allowed matters to drift in the
Middle East, and Clinton has lost respect. He hasn't been willing
to blow the whistle or speak the truth publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cumulative effect is that this is an administration that
friends and foes alike can ignore,'' Haass said. ``That is
dangerous.''

AFTER IMPEACHMENT VOTE, CONGRESS TURNS TO NOVEMBER ELECTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three weeks before the midterm election, with the
vote on an impeachment inquiry finally behind them, congressional
Democrats acted this weekend like the best place to campaign was
right here in the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Adopting their own version of a president's traditional ``Rose
Garden strategy,'' they used the ornate backdrops of the Capitol
and the White House to highlight their own election themes and
accuse the Republicans who lead Congress of doing nothing _ except,
of course, talking about President Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   From a White House Cabinet room and at Clinton's side, House
Minority Leader Dick Gephardt took advantage of the slow-moving
spending negotiations that kept Congress working through a weekend
session to fire away about issues left undone by the Republican
majority.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress has been here probably less than most
Congresses,'' said the Missouri Democrat. ``But what I'm worried
about is not when they're not here; what I am worried about is when
they are here. They've killed campaign reform. They've killed the
tobacco bill. They've killed the patient bill of rights.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the themes that for months the Democrats have been
struggling, largely without success, to amplify over the din of the
scandal engulfing the president. And this weekend they found that
the spending negotiations gave them the opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton rebuked Congress, saying that it ``could have been and
should have been'' focused on the American people this year rather
than on his troubles. He said the November election should not be a
referendum on him. ``First of all,'' Clinton said, ``I'm not
running.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans shot back with accusations that they had to
negotiate with a do-nothing president distracted by his legal
problems and his incessant fund-raising for the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president, quite frankly, has been AWOL all year long,''
House Majority Leader Dick Armey, of Texas, said Sunday on ABC's
``This Week.'' ``He's about to take tomorrow his 100th campaign
trip to go up to New York for a million-dollar fund-raiser for
Chuck Schumer, a member of the Judiciary Committee, which I think
is a rather interesting thing,'' referring to the Brooklyn Democrat
who is trying to unseat Republican Sen. Alfonse D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans, who are expecting to pick up seats in the House
and Senate because of the Clinton scandal, were trying to avoid
being goaded into a misstep. They remained well aware of the
political backlash they suffered three years ago when they provoked
a government shutdown in attempting to force Clinton to sign into
law key elements of the new Republican majority's agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican strategists said they thought it was actually to
their benefit to keep Democrats in Washington, the capital of the
Monica Lewinsky scandal, instead of having them in their home
districts campaigning.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's fevered political positioning came just days after
the House voted, in a highly partisan split, to open an impeachment
inquiry. Only 31 Democrats voted for a Republican resolution to
open a broad inquiry into Clinton. Both parties believe that what
is at stake is not just Clinton's fate, but the outcome of the
November elections and, perhaps, the presidential election in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, when independent counsel Kenneth Starr reported to
Congress that Clinton may have committed 11 impeachable offenses,
Rep. Henry Hyde, the Judiciary Committee chairman, said, ``Any
impeachment cannot succeed unless it is done in a bipartisan or
nonpartisan way.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was before it became clear how hard Democrats would
work to portray the inquiry as a partisan effort to unseat an
elected president. It was also before positions in Congress had
solidified.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans now openly lean toward impeachment, saying
Clinton undermined the nation's legal system and abused his office
in his attempts to hide his affair with Ms. Lewinsky. And with the
first shock of the Starr referral now passed, most Democrats
condemn the affair and the president's dissembling about it _ but
say bad private behavior does not rise to the level of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The first tests of whether common ground can be found in this
environment comes in the next two weeks. As early as this week,
committee lawyers will begin exploring whether all sides would be
willing to attest to the truth of some of Starr's evidence in order
to speed the inquiry along. A week later, a subcommittee begins
hearing scholars and legal experts cite history and precedent on
what kind of offense merits a president's removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Craig, a White House special counsel, welcomed the upcoming
hearing. ``Our position is that the discussion of standards is an
absolutely essential element for a fair impeachment inquiry to go
forward,'' he said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Sunday on CBS' ``Face the Nation,'' Craig said
that Clinton's behavior ``does not rise to the level of impeachable
offense standard that we have used throughout history, and we lower
that standard at our peril.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, trying to sense where public opinion will move, the
political parties have undergone an odd role reversal in just the
few days since the House vote to open an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Though they had held out for an unlimited investigation,
Republicans are leaning toward a restrained inquiry, perhaps
without any public questioning of Ms. Lewinsky and with much of the
investigation conducted behind closed doors in an acknowledgment
that the public does not want to see a circus.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, who had called for a limited inquiry with a timeline,
are now seeking public questioning of a wide cast of characters,
from Ms. Lewinsky to her mother to Starr. They are looking for ways
to cloud Starr's case.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There were some signs Sunday that if the Republicans sweep to
victory in the November elections, some kind of compromise could
emerge. A bipartisan rump group of four members of the House
Judiciary Committee that has been meeting quietly in search of
compromise has now grown to 10 of the panel's 37 lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J., recommended Sunday that
Clinton settle the Paul Jones sexual misconduct case. He also urged
the president's attorneys to write to the grand jury to ``correct
the record'' of Clinton's testimony in order to set the groundwork
for a punishment short of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said Clinton also needed to answer
accustions by Kathleen Willey, a former White House aide, that he
groped her, a charge he has denied. And Hatch conceded that the
Senate, as currently constituted with 55 Republicans and 45
Democrats, does not have the 67 votes to remove Clinton from
office.
</P>
<P>
   But he added, ''I think this is way too early. We don't know all
the facts.''

WELCOME WAGON TO MAKE ITS VISITS VIA POST OFFICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., N.J., Tenn.)  (lb) 
 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS

<P>
   The Welcome Wagon is rolling up the welcome mat.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1920s, Welcome Wagon's sales representatives, almost
always women, have gone from house to house visiting newlyweds and
the newly moved-in, bearing greeting baskets laden with coupons,
magnets, ballpoint pens and other items sponsored by the local
locksmith, the town optometrist and other merchants.
</P>
<P>
   But these old-fashioned visits are coming to an end, in a
testament to changing lifestyles or perhaps that traditional
corporate desire to cut costs.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of the Welcome Wagon, Cendant Corp., is dismissing
most of its 2,200 representatives and will replace them with direct
marketing through the mail.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than a lengthy visit with the possibility of real-time
conversation, each of Welcome Wagon's targeted households will get
a bound directory delivered to the doorstep, in which businesses
will have paid to advertise. The point is to reach more people,
Cendant spokesmen say, and these days, people are not at home as
much as they used to be, because of busier families and a surge in
the number of working mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Cendant, which also owns Avis car rentals and Howard Johnson
hotels, has found itself in financial turmoil this year, but the
company says its problems are not related to its decision to change
the Welcome Wagon.
</P>
<P>
   This change, however, appears to have taken many sales
representatives by surprise and was met with sorrow by some of
them. Although they were paid for their work, certain
representatives regarded it as more of a social mission than a
marketing one. For decades, Welcome Wagon thrived on that very
ambiguity, getting over the threshold thanks to its neighborly
demeanor when other marketers might not.
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart is in these home visits,'' said Dee Strilowich, the
company's top-performing salesperson, who has worked for Welcome
Wagon in Ridgefield, Conn., and nearby Redding for the last four
years. ``I loved giving the welcome and greeting to those new
movers, new parents, engaged women.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cendant insisted that times had changed, which is why it
decided last month to end the visits and lay off its
representatives. ``It's a different world today,'' said Elliot
Bloom, a spokesman for Cendant in Parsippany, N.J. ``In the past,
20 years ago, when you knocked on people's doors, Mom was home. Now
she's in the work force.''
</P>
<P>
   A vice president for Welcome Wagon, Dinah Watson, agreed. ``We
had representatives who were beating their heads against the wall
because they had the names of several people to go and visit but
could never find them at home,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was offered a severance package, which she will be
taking, and added that the 250 representatives she supervised have
until the end of this month to decide whether they will stay with
the company.
</P>
<P>
   About 500 people will be retained to work in ad sales for
Welcome Wagon, Bloom said. It is being combined with another
Cendant company, called Getting to Know You, that specializes in
direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you make a change like this, there is some
displacement,'' said Christopher Jones, another Cendant spokesman.
Representatives have until the end of the year to make their
visits, and after that, ``we've asked them to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Strilowich, who was greeted herself by a Welcome Wagon
representative when she moved to Ridgefield 28 years ago, said she
had about 200 visits scheduled through December and would complete
them all.
</P>
<P>
   She said most of the representatives she had spoken to were
sorry to see their jobs end so suddenly. ``A lot of them are in the
same situation I was,'' she said, adding that she is the primary
earner in her family. ``They were looking for at least two or three
more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Welcome Wagon representatives expressed anger over the loss
of their jobs and the end of their visits with families. ``Cendant
sacrificed us for the bottom line,'' said Wendy Amundsen, one of
the company's top-selling representatives, in Stamford, Conn.
``Sometimes there are just more important things in life than
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Cendant has been struggling this year with other, much larger
business problems, including an accounting error that stripped $115
million from its 1997 earnings, the subsequent resignations of a
host of senior executives, and a stock price that has plunged from
$41.69 in April to $9 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But Bloom dismissed as ``absolute nonsense'' any suggestion that
Cendant's wider problems had led to the switch in strategy for
Welcome Wagon. He said that the company had peaked in 1968 with 1.5
million visits a year, but that the number had fallen to 580,000
last year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Still, Cendant had thought enough of the company to pay $20
million to acquire it in 1995, when Cendant was known as CUC
International and the number of visits was estimated at 500,000 a
year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, CUC said it planned to expand the sales force, and
it did so, adding some 800 positions by this year. The company saw
Welcome Wagon as a marketing device for a personal credit-history
business it already owned. With little overhead beyond the
100-person management staff, a toll-free number and a World Wide
Web site, profits were substantial.
</P>
<P>
   And sales representatives, who were paid by the amount of
business they solicited from area merchants, could earn as much as
$70,000 a year. Many received benefits as well.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome Wagon took its name from 19th century Conestoga covered
wagons that would greet frontier settlers as they arrived, bringing
food and fresh water from the nearest village. The company was
founded in 1928 in Memphis, Tenn. This summer, to mark its 70th
anniversary, the governors of several states declared part of July
``Welcome Wagon Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You will visit households when they're celebrating a move, or
an engagement, or the birth of a new child,'' promises the Welcome
Wagon Web site, which so far has not been altered to reflect the
newly impersonal nature of the operation. ``You will also introduce
local businesses to Welcome Wagon's unique, personalized
advertising program. What could be more fun.''
</P>
<P>
   But now the fun is over. ``I thought Welcome Wagon would go on
forever,'' Ms. Amundsen said. ``Welcome Wagon is like apple pie,
baseball, hot dogs. It's an American institution. I thought I would
retire in this job.''

MARKET DECLINE MAKES AFFLUENT FAMILIES MORE CAUTIOUS SPENDERS

(sw) 
 By LOUIS UCHITELLE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The global financial crisis and the plunging stock market are
beginning to unnerve the nation's more affluent families and make
them more cautious in their spending.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer spending, particularly among families with annual
incomes above $50,000, is far and away the biggest source of
economic growth in the United States. Through months of turmoil,
this consumption has remained strong, even as other pillars of
economic growth have faded: exports and profits, for example, and
spending on the machinery and equipment that allows business to
thrive. Now the first crack has appeared in the will to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The crack is most evident in recent consumer surveys that ask
specifically about a household's ``financial situation''; that is,
its savings, stock portfolios and real estate holdings _ its wealth
_ as well as its income from wages.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last several months, families with lower incomes, and
little exposure to the stock market, have showed no change in their
level of optimism. In sharp contrast, households with incomes above
$50,000 were optimistic about their financial situation before the
summer's sharp selloff in the stock market, but then in September
their optimism fell significantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are starting to see consumers who feel nervous about the
stock market and are becoming more cautious in their spending
behavior,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the University of
Michigan's Consumer Surveys, whose monthly polls are widely
followed by economists as the most reliable indicators of consumer
sentiment. ``What we have found consistently over the years is that
such changes in sentiment precede significant changes in actual
spending by six to nine months.''
</P>
<P>
   As such, this would point to a considerable slowdown in the
economy sometime next spring.
</P>
<P>
   The consumers in question are people like Ellen Elias, a partner
in an upscale Manhattan appliance store, Elgot, a woman in her
forties who says she ``owns enough stock to be concerned.'' She is
hoping that stock prices will rebound by the time she needs the
money. Since mid-July, when the selloff began, American stocks have
lost $1.5 trillion of their value, Alan Greenspan, chairman of the
Federal Reserve, estimated last week. If this decline continues,
Ms. Elias said, she may have second thoughts about some of her
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Doubt has already touched Andrew Kozinn, a 46-year-old men's
suit manufacturer and haberdasher, with a store on Manhattan's Park
Avenue. He has a stock portfolio approaching seven figures, he
says, but he lives within his annual income from his business, not
his stock market gains. Besides, he said, his stocks are still
worth more than they were a year or so ago, before the big run-up
in stock prices that ended in July. Still, Kozinn admits to a
glimmer of uneasiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have just bought a new car, and I am putting a new bathroom
in my summer home,'' he said, ``and you start to wonder what you
should have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher-income families, the people who invested most heavily in
stocks and felt wealthier as stock prices rose, account for only 28
percent of the nation's households. The remaining 72 percent, all
families earning less than $50,000 a year, invest their savings
mainly in their homes, not the stock market, various studies show,
and their feelings about their financial situation have not shown
any change in recent consumer polls.
</P>
<P>
   But they are not the biggest spenders. Higher-income households
are. Those with incomes above $50,000 a year account for nearly
half of all consumer spending, the Census Bureau and Labor
Department report. Households earning above $70,000, while
representing less than 20 percent of all households, account for
nearly 30 percent of all the spending. When signs of economic
trouble appear, their mood swings are much more pronounced than
those of the poor.
</P>
<P>
   During good times, more affluent families are notably more
optimistic about the economy than lower-income Americans, according
to Thomas Riehl, a partner at Peter Hart Research Associates, a
public opinion polling firm. In June 1997, for example, Hart
Research found that only 12 percent of those earning $50,000 to
$100,000 a year expected a recession in the next 12 months, while
25 percent of those with incomes under $20,000 saw recession around
the corner. The 12 percent shot up to 33 percent in a similar poll
last month, but the outlook among poor families hardly changed.
Twenty-seven percent saw recession within a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a good period for the economy ends,'' Riehl said,
``optimism at the high end comes down closer to what lower-income
people express, even in the best of times.''
</P>
<P>
   And high-end spending is the first to be affected. The nation's
total consumption is still strong, and many luxury goods _ Volvos
and Mercedes-Benz cars, for example _ are still being snapped up.
But hints of weakening at the high end have begun to appear.
Discount stores, catering mainly to the less affluent, reported
last week that September sales climbed smartly. But stores like
Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus that sell more luxury goods
said sales had fallen last month.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Land's End, whose catalogues offer high-priced casual wear, says
its sales, after posting strong gains earlier in the year, ``have
been relatively flat in recent weeks.'' The ISI Group and Goldman
Sachs &AMP; Co., Wall Street firms that track retail sales on their
own, both report a softening. And the U.S. Home Corp.,
headquartered in Houston, which builds 9,000 homes a year at an
average price of $176,000 apiece, says that while sales are still
rising, they are doing so ``at a declining rate of increase.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The traffic count of potential customers through our model
homes is down, and we are not converting as many of them to
buyers,'' said Robert Strudler, chairman of U.S. Home. ``With
mortgage rates so low, that is more a reflection of a decline in
consumer confidence than affordability.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtin, director of the University of Michigan survey, agrees.
The nation's two major consumer confidence surveys, Michigan's and
one conducted by the Conference Board, a business organization,
both find that while consumer confidence is still at a high level,
there were significant declines in August and September. Curtin
blames the September drop on families with annual incomes above
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   All year, he notes, more than 60 percent of the households in
this category had expressed optimism about their own financial
situation. And then in September, the percentage suddenly fell to
50. That mood change did not show up among households earning less
than $50,000. From January through August, the proportion of
optimistic households in this category ranged between 40 percent
and 48 percent, and in September the number was a typical 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the less than $50,000-a-year crowd,'' Curtin said, ``their
primary concern is not the stock market, but the impact from
falling exports and layoffs, and that they have not felt yet.''
</P>
<P>
   The main issue for this group is jobs, and the demand for
workers until now has been quite strong. Layoffs have begun to pick
up lately, but the nation's unemployment rate is still at an
unusually low 4.6 percent.

IT ALL GOES RIGHT FOR THE PATRIOTS IN 40-10 ROMP OVER CHIEFS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBORO, Mass. _ Let's figure what went wrong for Kansas City
and what went right for New England in a 40-10 Patriots rout here
Sunday afternoon. It was a victory that left 59,749 fans at Foxboro
Stadium giddy over what this means in the long run for the home
team.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots scored first on a 1-yard touchdown run by rookie
running back Robert Edwards with 4 minutes 53 seconds left in the
first quarter. Two Chiefs penalties contributed to the 40-yard
drive. And then later in the quarter Kansas City tried a
fourth-and-1 run near midfield that lost a yard.
</P>
<P>
   Those were things that went wrong for the Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Seldom have Coach Marty Schottenheimer's Chiefs been thrashed so
thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot went wrong and we have to be held accountable for it,''
Schottenheimer said. ``I mean, we can't blame it on the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   New England's Adam Vinatieri hit a 32-yard field goal in the
second quarter and then appeared to have another one, from 37
yards. But Donnie Edwards was penalized for delay of game, for
flinching and waving illegally before the kick, and New England
received a first down at the Kansas City 15 instead of the field
goal. And the Patriots took that second chance and scored on Drew
Bledsoe's 15-yard touchdown pass to Robert Edwards to make it 17-0
with 9:11 left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, the Chiefs roughed the punter and gave the
Patriots another chance and the Patriots scored another touchdown
instead of ending their series with a punt, and it was 24-0 with
2:48 left before halftime. It was 27-0 at halftime.
</P>
<P>
   Those were some of the things that went right for New England.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City scored its only touchdown with 52 seconds left in
the third quarter. By then, New England had scored the game's first
37 points.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the game, little went right for Kansas City (4-2) and
little went wrong for New England (4-1). The Chiefs played as if
their bodies were here but their minds were back in Kansas City. A
mental funk. The Patriots sensed their vulnerability and pounded
them mercilessly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We played a lousy game in their house,'' linebacker Derrick
Thomas said. ``There were a lot of problems but we have a lot of
people with pride. We'll get 'em back.''
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Andre Rison said payback was not the issue, but
improvement was. ``They did look good,'' he said. ``Any time this
happens you have to realize where you are. We have 10 games left.
The future is the focus.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Patriots? What does their future hold? Are
they so good that they can whip a good team like the Chiefs? Do
they have that kind of killer instinct? Is Bledsoe (17 for 26 for
226 yards and 3 touchdowns) reaching a new level, a new plateau of
expertise? Is Edwards (23 rushes for 104 yards; 3 receptions for 32
yards) rising to become the running back who was so good last year
at Georgia?
</P>
<P>
   Are the Patriots Super Bowl material?
</P>
<P>
   A 40-10 victory over Kansas City makes people ask those kind of
questions, even with the season less than half over.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not in shock,'' said Patriots safety Willie Clay.,
</P>
<P>
   They certainly did not expect to beat Kansas City by 30 points.
But afterward, they acted like they had.
</P>
<P>
   ``We beat them in every phase of the game,'' said Patriots
cornerback Ty Law. ``They like to bump-and-run and press on
receivers. We took advantage of that. They challenged us on fourth
downs. Our defense took care of that. Really early, our front lines
hammered them. That kind of took their breath away for the rest of
the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The numbers were stunning. New England led in first downs, 31-9.
In total yards, 438-134. In plays, 82-44. And there were 54 New
England rushing plays. That makes for a long, long day for the
Kansas City defense.
</P>
<P>
   New England dominated in rushing yards, 206-14. It dominated in
possession time, 41:48-18:12. The Patriots earned four sacks, a
fumble recovery and an interception.
</P>
<P>
   Stunning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of things go right,'' said Patriots Coach Pete
Carroll. ``When it happens like that, how can you go wrong?'' &QL;

A POLITICIAN STANDS ACCUSED AS VILLAIN IN SOUTH KOREA'S ECONOMIC
DISASTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ Kang Kyong-shik used to have South Korea at
his fingertips, and as deputy prime minister and a renowned
economic planner he enjoyed influence and glory that seemed able to
take him anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   They did _ to prison. After South Korea's economic collapse late
last year, the country turned angrily on its top economic
officials, and Kang was arrested for economic mismanagement and
neglect of duty. Now he is on trial, facing the possibility of many
years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   Kang, 62, released on bail in September, is a broken man.
Puzzled by the country's ire, and deeply hurt by it, Kang has spent
many days asking God why he is being vilified for what he remembers
as the most hectic and productive eight-and-a-half months of his
public service life.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are fingering me; it's very convenient for them,'' said
Kang, his voice measured and filled with resignation as he spoke in
his fluent English. ``I lived through those times, anyhow. And I
still succeeded in keeping my health.''
</P>
<P>
   Kang's trial underscores not only the depth of suffering and
anger in South Korea, as it struggles to comprehend how a miracle
economy faltered, but also the efforts of a young democracy to
figure out how to apply the rule of law, even to its leaders. It
would be difficult to imagine a U.S. Cabinet official going on
trial for policy failures, but South Korea has already sent two
former presidents to jail for corruption and is reluctant to accept
excuses for catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
   So prosecutors have charged Kang on several counts, focusing on
neglect of duty while he ran Korea's economy but also including
abuse of power, for pressuring a bank to lend to his friends. South
Koreans seem to feel overwhelmingly that Kang is partly responsible
for the country's pain and that he should bear the penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that we could have escaped economic disaster if the
then-government had had the right direction, made the right
decisions in the economic crisis,'' said Chung Dong-young, the
spokesman for the governing National Congress for New Politics. He
insisted that it was appropriate for Kang to be tried.
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper editorials have excoriated him, unemployed workers
blame him for their predicament and even scholars argue that the
nation's elite bureaucrats _ long protected and insulated from
insult and injury _ should be held more accountable for their
actions.
</P>
<P>
   Kim In-ho, the former chief economic secretary to the president,
is facing similar criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kim Dae-jung inherited a very difficult situation,'' Kang
said, referring to the new president, who took office in February.
``It's quite natural he should find someone to blame for the
economic situation.
</P>
<P>
   Kang, a solid man who is very subdued these days, asked that
this interview be held in his office in the National Assembly. He
said it was the first time in many months that he had come to his
office, and he wore a somber black suit, a drastic change from the
blue uniform, with No. 1199 sewn onto it, that he wore for 110 days
in prison.
</P>
<P>
   He had his own cell, and his wife, Cho Sam-jin, 58, brought him
books every day _ gifts of food were not allowed _ and took his
laundry to spare him the task of having to wash it himself.
</P>
<P>
   During those dreary days, Kang says, he pored over economic
literature to see if scholars believed that Korea's economic crisis
was the result of his actions. He says he was deeply relieved that
experts did not seem to blame him.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many Koreans say that he lied to the nation, painting a
picture of a basically healthy economy just as it was falling apart
beneath him. Some say that he delayed confronting the problems and
seeking help in part to improve the prospects that his party would
win the presidential elections last December.
</P>
<P>
   If this was his intention, it failed. He was fired in late
November as the economy continued to sink, and in December, South
Korea reached agreement on a $58 billion economic rescue package
from the International Monetary Fund. Partly as a result, Kang's
party lost power and Kim Dae-jung became the first Korean
opposition leader to be elected president.
</P>

<P>
   ``Koreans feel that he deceived the public by telling them that
Korea would not have to go to the IMF, even though he knew clearly
then that Korea was headed that way,'' said Hwang Joo-hwan, a
36-year-old advertising account executive.
</P>
<P>
   For some, though, putting Kang and Kim In-ho on trial sets a
frightening precedent and could potentially inhibit policymakers.
Others say that some compromise should be attempted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very much perplexed,'' said Moon Chung-in, a politics
professor at Yonsei University. ``We've got to see bureaucrats held
accountable, so this sends a very good political signal. But on the
other hand, was it fair to arrest him and put him in jail?''
</P>
<P>
   As for Kang, one of his frustrations is that the focus on him
and Kim In-ho is drawing attention away from tackling the reforms
needed in the economy, and he worries that very little political
effort seems to be going in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I go through these difficulties and we go to the right
track, then I'll accept the difficulties,'' Kang said. ``This is
the most frustrating to me. Even though I have a hard time, this
difficulty is not contributing to the good of the future economy.
It's only a waste.''

U.S. SEEKING OTHERS' INPUT ON NEW RULES FOR IMF 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wis., Texas)  (lb) 
 By PHILIP SHENON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration has begun to consult
foreign governments about changes that will be demanded of the
International Monetary Fund under a deal with Congress to provide
the fund with $18 billion, administration and congressional
officials said Sunday. The administration requested the infusion of
capital to deal with the global economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said compromise legislation now being hammered out by
the White House and Republican congressional leaders would provide
full financing for the fund, but would also demand greater openness
in its decision-making and new restrictions on its loans.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has traditionally made its decisions about loans to
foreign governments in secret.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has portrayed the $18 billion as vital to the
IMF as it seeks to avert an international financial meltdown. After
a weekend of negotiations, White House officials and members of
Congress said they were optimistic about a deal as part of a larger
budget agreement that is meant to prevent a shutdown of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been constructive bipartisan discussion,'' said Gene
Sperling, President Clinton's national economic adviser. ``All
parties are increasingly confident that both full funding and
substantial reforms will be part of the final agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Obey, D-Wis., who is involved in the negotiations,
said he believed a deal would be announced soon. ``You can see a
solution to that on the horizon,'' he said, describing the talks on
the fund as the ``one area'' in the budget talks ``where we're
moving much closer to agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   The details of the compromise have not been made public, and
administration and congressional officials said at least a handful
of issues remained unresolved, specifically about the type of
lending conditions that the United States can try to impose.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans, who had blocked all but $3.4 billion of the
$18 billion request, have been seeking a variety of changes in how
the fund is run, including an end to loans at below-market interest
rates and a requirement that loans be repaid within a year.
Republican leaders say new lending conditions would provide more
incentive to foreign governments to pursue sound economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has warned that some of the demands made by
congressional Republicans would be impossible to force on the IMF,
which has 182 members.
</P>
<P>
   Administration and congressional officials said the
administration had begun to consult with other nations that are key
donors to head off the possibility that the IMF might balk at new
lending conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The $18 billion from the United States would replenish accounts
depleted by the fund's efforts to bail out the economies of Russia
and three Asian nations. Other important donor nations are waiting
for Washington to act before chipping in their shares.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Dick Armey of Texas, the House Republican majority leader,
said on the ABC News program ``This Week'' that the talks between
the White House and Congress were still a ``very rigorous
business.''
</P>
<P>
   He did not predict when the deal might be reached. ``We're
working out the details now,'' he said. ``We're working hard on the
language and we'll just have to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Armey led efforts in the House earlier this year to block full
financing for the IMF, and on Sunday he repeated the criticism
often heard on Capitol Hill, from both Republicans and Democrats,
that the fund had mishandled the financial crisis that has swept
across much of the world in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seems to be now a growing consensus of understanding,
even given lip service by the president himself, that the IMF has
very likely done more harm in places like Thailand and Russia than
they've done good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody understands the IMF can have American tax dollars if
the IMF is responsible and productive in the world economy,'' Armey
said. ``But we will not continue to give them money to do the kind
of harm they've done. If you've got a fire, you don't subsidize the
arsonist.''

RAMOS DOING RIGHT BY BOXERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The RBF is one of boxing's jumble of
three-lettered organizations we can feel good about.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Ramos, the indefatigable former fighter who started the
Retired Boxers Foundation a few years ago to help down-and-out
boxers, appears to be on his way to providing a much needed safety
net for those in need.
</P>
<P>
   The RBF's Inaugural Gala and Awards Benefit is scheduled for
Dec. 10 at the Playboy Mansion in Beverly Hills, a kickoff
fundraiser that Ramos and those working with him hope will bring in
$300,000 and allow the organization to begin providing substantial
benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos and others already are providing some counseling to needy
former fighters and are in contact with similar upstart
organizations in an effort to pool resources.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, however, he plans to help establish a meaningful
pension and drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, medical
services, youth boxing programs and _ perhaps Ramos' biggest dream
_ a village for homeless boxers.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos plans to hold a second awards dinner in Puerto Rico next
year on what he calls his ``World Tour.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm working hard because there are a lot of fighters on the
street out there, champions. They're lost out there,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos, a member of the 1980 Olympic team that wasn't allowed to
compete in Moscow and a former championship contender, was a
down-and-out fighter himself.
</P>
<P>
   He fell victim to drugs and alcohol and ultimately ended up in
prison for 22 months for assault with a deadly weapon and false
imprisonment involving an ex-girlfriend in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   He subsequently beat his addictions, found religion and
discovered a passion _ the RBF. His unbounded enthusiasm and
bottomless reservoir of energy have inspired all those who have
worked with him _ all volunteers _ since the project began.
</P>
<P>
   He has received the endorsement of many big names in the boxing
and entertainment businesses, including Hugh Hefner.
</P>
<P>
   He has also received assistance from a few dozen volunteers.
Among them: doctors, psychologists, lawyers, computer experts,
event organizers and fundraisers.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant volunteer has been grant writer Jacqueline
Richardson, who has worked virtually full-time with Ramos to put
together the awards dinner. Richardson has provided the expertise
that has allowed the dinner to become a reality.
</P>
<P>
   ``She believes in what I'm doing,'' Ramos said.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people do. But Ramos and others like him have a long
way to go. The boxing community will have to play a major role if
the pension is going to become a reality. The role of the RBF will
be to lobby the powers that be to set aside a portion of every
purse for the pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   And he's going to need a lot of money to initiate significant
services.
</P>
<P>
   But the dinner is a start.
</P>
<P>
   Ramos is expecting at least 50 former and current champions and
many boxing officials and members of the media, most of whom have
expressed support and admiration for Ramos' efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this even goes exactly as we want, if we're able to raise
$300,000, that would be ideal. We'd be able to help a lot of
people,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult, though. We have to demonstrate we're able to
pull this off first. That's why this event is so important.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's big day: The Nevada Supreme Court is expected to rule
today on whether to allow only the Nevada State Athletic Commission
to see the fighter's psychological records.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson's advisers have said they will submit the records to the
commission even if the court rules against Tyson because the
commission must receive them by 5 p.m. if it is to consider his
request to be re-licensed on Oct. 19, as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Also today, Tyson is scheduled to go on trial for allegedly
assaulting two men in a Washington D.C. suburb, although his
lawyers are trying to settle out of court.
</P>
<P>
   These two events will determine whether he receives his license.
</P>
<P>
   More Tyson: Given the fact Tyson's life has been an open book,
his advisers' efforts to keep his records from the public are
curious.
</P>
<P>
   How could he possibly be more embarrassed?
</P>
<P>
   Bad luck: Gabriel Ruelas, the former WBC super featherweight
champ from Sylmar, lost a big opportunity when James Leija had to
pull out of their Oct. 24 matchup because of a rib injury.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas defeated Leija to win the title. A rematch would have
grabbed the attention of the boxing world, which is the goal of all
fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas' handlers are looking for another opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty disappointed,'' Ruelas said. ``But with all the
experience I have, all the fights I've had, I've gone through this
before. What can you do? You just go on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm ready to fight whoever they get me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ruelas doesn't want to face a big-name opponent, in part because
he had geared up for Leija.
</P>
<P>
   More Ruelas: Many fighters are angling for a shot at undefeated
WBC 130-pound champ Sugar Shane Mosley.
</P>
<P>
   Among the possibilities: The winner of the Angel Manfredy-Floyd
Mayweather match was to face the Ruelas-Leija winner for a shot at
Mosley. That could mean Ruelas will face the Manfredy-Mayweather
winner for another opportunity to fight for a world championship _
if everything goes his way.
</P>
<P>
   Viva la difference?: A New Jersey judge forbade the WBA from
awarding its vacant welterweight title to the winner of this past
Saturday's welterweight bout between No. 1 contender Andrei
Pestriaev and No. 3 James Page, won by Page.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a day before the fight, a judge in Paris, France _ the
site of the fight _ overturned the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Uh, what about No. 2 Jose Luis Lopez?
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican fighter challenged the sanctioning, and rightfully
so: It's only right and logical that the top two contenders fight
for a vacant title.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the credibility of boxing has suffered.
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Page's promoter is Don King.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just another case of King trying to ram something down
the throat of boxing,'' Dino Duva, Lopez's promoter, said before
the Paris judge's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The WBA title was vacated by Ike Quartey, who will face WBC
champ Oscar De La Hoya on Nov. 21. &QL;

L.A.'S RELAXED RULES ALLOW CITY EMPLOYEES TO MAKE A LITTLE EXTRA ON
THE SIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BETH BARRETT  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Thousands of Los Angeles city workers find time
and energy to moonlight on second jobs after hours or weekends,
according to records obtained by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of moonlighting has expanded since the City Council
eased rules for employees six years ago at the same time elected
officials were being barred from earning outside money.
</P>
<P>
   City employees spend their off hours in private law practices;
in engineering, planning and architectural consulting businesses;
and in real estate. They teach, do other people's taxes and work in
medical offices. They deal rare books, and run photography studios
and boutiques. Some even get extra cash selling tickets or ushering
at Dodger games.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other major cities, there is no central oversight of
moonlighting in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Potentially haphazard supervision and record-keeping does little
to ensure the city is protected from conflicts of interest or that
outside work does not interfere with city employment.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to imagine how people can spend a
large amount of time on a second job and efficiently do their first
job,'' said Tim Lynch, administrative deputy in the City
Controller's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no way people can work full time, live a normal life
and do this. If it's more than a few hours a week, people are going
to be completely distracted from their city functions. It has to
encroach.''
</P>
<P>
   Fully 14.7 percent of workers in surveyed city departments
moonlight, according to a review of the two-thirds of the general
city work force for which records could be obtained.
</P>
<P>
   That's more than double the 5.9 percent rate at which all
employed Americans moonlighted during 1997, according to U.S.
Department of Labor statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 3,000 of the 20,000 workers in the surveyed L.A. city
departments _ police, City Attorney's Office, general services,
information technology agency, and engineering and sanitation
bureaus _ have permission to moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   The number could be even higher because each department sets its
own rules and records often are not kept at a central point.
</P>
<P>
   The city's 3,000 firefighters, who have the most flexibility in
their city schedules to moonlight, aren't kept tabs on through a
master list, for instance, fire officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The figures also exclude the Library, Recreation and Parks,
Utilities, Airports, and Harbor departments.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-fourth of the Los Angeles Police Department's 12,600
sworn officers and civilian employees find a way to make money on
the side, records show. That's a rate more than double the national
average for similar ``protective service'' jobs, according to
federal labor statistics.
</P>
<P>
   At the City Attorney's Office, one out of every dozen lawyers,
who commonly make six-figure public salaries, do private legal work
on the side or operate other kinds of businesses, ranging from a
carwash to a fast-food stand.
</P>
<P>
   Even four members of Mayor Richard Riordan's staff moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' rules on moonlighting were rewritten in 1992 as
part of a broad revision of the city's ethics rules, in response to
a suit brought by a group of city employee unions challenging the
constitutionality of financial disclosure requirements, said
Rebecca Avila, the Ethics Commission's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations banned moonlighting among elected officials, and
required strict disclosures by several thousand bureaucrats in
decision-making posts, but left wide discretion in handling others
who moonlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ethics law was to get at the elected official and the
high-level official who might have a conflict, rather than concern
about employees earning outside income,'' said Robert M. Stern,
co-director of the Los Angeles-based Center for Government Studies.
</P>
<P>
   (2nd take to follow)
</P>
<P>
   With new discretion on lower-ranking employees, City Attorney
James Hahn, for instance, reversed the office's longstanding
practice of forbidding city attorneys from taking on outside legal
work, concluding the new law mandated a case-by-case review
instead, said Chief Administrative Officer Matt Middlebrook.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty city attorneys now have authorization to work on private
cases, while 11 have received permission to moonlight as outside
arbitrators, according to office records.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago and San Francisco are among local governments that
continue to prohibit city attorneys from doing outside legal work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was just too much potential for a conflict,'' said
Jennifer Hoyle, spokeswoman for Chicago's Law Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``Besides, there are logistic problems. How can you conduct an
outside practice with court hearings between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. and
not have it interfere with your city work?''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley has banned moonlighting by his
staff altogether, said John Camper, deputy press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   There is no such restriction in Riordan's office, where one
mayoral aide runs a pay phone business after hours, another has a
band, and a couple teach night classes in Los Angeles Unified
School District.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where the government doesn't even demand regular
reviews of its employees' city job performances, there has been no
political will to confront the unions with closer scrutiny of
workers' moonlighting habits.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, San Francisco's city and county charter mandates
strict moonlighting accounting, with all non-emergency employees
required to file requests with the umbrella Department of Human
Resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``This, in essence, is the check and balance for making sure the
outside work is not in conflict with the scope of their city
work,'' said Alice Villagomez, San Francisco deputy director of
employee relations.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond Allen, assistant general manager of the city's Personnel
Department, said the issue of moonlighting and how to keep tabs on
it has never been comprehensively addressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The issue has never come up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of better controls, problems usually aren't
detected until a member of the public complains.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a deputy city attorney was ordered to stop using a
city phone number and fax while working on an outside civil case.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney, Deborah Breithaupt, declined comment except to say
she is no longer handling the private litigation for a client in a
dispute involving the sale of a truck.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Assistant City Attorney Dan Woodard said he ordered
Breithaupt to stop using city equipment, but declined to say
whether she had been disciplined.
</P>
<P>
   Her case illustrates what internal audits have shown elsewhere
in the city _ that forms intended to track moonlighting often are
filled out incompletely or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   Middlebrook said Breithaupt's request did not state she would be
appearing on behalf of private clients in court, an omission she
was ordered to correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously a court appearance has to be in someone's request,
and she made a court appearance without the request,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The city controller last year, in response to public concern,
audited the Bureau of Engineering to try to determine whether
customers were being steered to city engineers' private firms.
</P>
<P>
   The audit found record keeping was so lax it was impossible to
determine whether abuses were in fact occurring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The outside employment for some of your employees may be in
conflict with their present official duties if fully disclosed as
required in your outside employment policy or the city Ethics
Commission guidelines,'' the audit concluded.
</P>
<P>
   John Franco, the bureau's chief management analyst, said
moonlighting is more tightly monitored now to guarantee workers
aren't too fatigued by extracurricular jobs to perform their city
duties.
</P>
<P>
   Eighty-four engineering employees have filed outside employment
forms, the majority for consulting businesses. Together, they
reported they would be working up to 750 hours per week, or an
average of about nine hours per week each outside their city jobs.

LOS ANGELES: their city jobs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish said the majority of the department's
officers follow the rules. Those restrictions prohibit moonlighting
in certain businesses, like bars, and restrict outside work to 20
hours per week, among other rules intended to prevent conflicts
with officers' city duties.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't want to be disciplined and there is no reason for
them not to comply,'' Kalish aid.
</P>
<P>
   The department has approved work permits for 1,615 security
jobs, 391 movie set jobs, 119 instruction positions, 82 sales
positions and 511 other kinds of work, LAPD computer-generated
records show. The number of officers with multiple permits could
not be determined, police officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers like Chris Cortijo say that legitimate off-duty work
helps make up for reductions in city overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a lot of overtime coming out of the city now and
this is a good way to make something extra on my days off,'' said
Cortijo, who for years has done traffic control for movie companies
through the private Hollywood firm, Pacific Production Services.
</P>
<P>
   Still, since Jan. 1, 1997, nine officers were found to be
working without authorization in connection with more serious
matters, from associating with known felons to running illegal
pyramid schemes for which they were disciplined, LAPD records show.
</P>
<P>
   Officers have been caught using city equipment _ including
phones, faxes, computers, radios and other gear _ in connection
with their outside businesses, disciplinary records reveal.
</P>
<P>
   For many, moonlighting has become an essential part of their
economic lives. Some say they have to supplement city wages, others
hope to make enough on the outside to leave the public sector
someday, while still others say it is the way to a better
lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   For the last 15 years, Claudia Summers, a civil engineering
drafting technician has worked 40 hours a week for the city, and 13
or so more in a medical office.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible, because she works four 10-hour shifts for the
city, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do I do it? I don't know. My husband says I work too much,
but it's just been that way forever. Sometimes you wonder if it's
worth it. You have to pay all those taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Attorney George Garikian helps run the family-owned
California Car Wash in Glendale. It's mostly weekend work, as well
as the handling of minor legal matters, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just help oversee it after work hours and make sure
everything is running as it should,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Kalustian, a deputy attorney assigned to a North
Hills-area gang unit, said his photography hobby has turned into a
small business that mostly involves snapping pictures of kids on
sports teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like I could make a living doing it. But after
working with the gang unit during the week, spending the weekends
with smiling kids swimming and playing flag football relaxes me.''
</P>
<P>
   Titus Wong, a bureau of sanitation management assistant, said he
has kept his old college job as an usher for the Dodgers to help
pay off his new home in Huntington Beach.
</P>
<P>
   While he loves baseball, Wong, like most city moonlighters, said
there's one overriding consideration.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's financial.''

   LOWRY CITY, Mo. _ Ronda Elliott's 6-year-old daughter often
comes home in tears after fending off taunts about her mother on
the school bus. Her 10-year-son got so fed up with being picked on
that he got into a brawl. And the man who owned the trailer Ms.
Elliott was living in abruptly told her to find a new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he didn't want people with the disease in his trailer
house,'' Ms. Elliott said.
</P>
<P>
   The disease she has is AIDS, and in this dusty country town
brushing the Ozarks, she has found it to be something people have a
hard time accepting. Indeed, Ms. Elliott, 30, tried to keep it
quiet, but with a population of only 700, she said, if ``you know
something, the other side of town knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rural America is becoming a new frontier for AIDS as social
taboos, remote locations, poverty and lack of education aggravate
the experience of patients and of those trying to help them. And,
as the HIV virus becomes more common in women nationally, health
experts are especially worried about rural women because they are
often more isolated, less independent and less assertive than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about the rural areas and small
cities,'' said Gary West, a deputy director of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's division of HIV/AIDS prevention.
``The impact in the urban areas is actually coming down a bit,
whereas the impact in rural areas and small cities is actually
going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rural AIDS victims make up an increasing share of the nation's
AIDS cases, partly because people in cities have more knowledge
about and access to methods of prevention and treatment and partly
because there is more migration between city and country than there
used to be. While the numbers are small compared with cities _
rural cases rose from 5 percent in 1990 to more than 7 percent of
the total cases in 1997 _ the particular problems associated with
AIDS in rural communities have made health experts believe the
situation warrants special attention.
</P>
<P>
   Rural health experts say the incidence of AIDS in these
communities may actually be higher because some people go to cities
to get tested.
</P>
<P>
   The case of Nushawn Williams, the Brooklyn man accused last year
of infecting 13 women in Chautauqua County, N.Y., was an egregious
example of the vulnerability of people in rural communities.
Experts say various obstacles impede teaching prevention or giving
rural AIDS patients emotional support and information about
complying with the often-intricate new drug regimens.
</P>
<P>
   ``The inability to keep things confidential in small communities
is a major, major problem,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
National Center for HIV, Sexually Transmitted Diseases and
Tuberculosis Prevention. ``Everybody knows everybody's mother,
sister, brother, father. You could drive by the parking lot and
look at everybody's car and say, `Why does so-and-so need to go to
an HIV prevention meeting?'''
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Living in a stretch of Ozark cattle and hog country, Lynn, who
asked that she be identified only by her middle name, is so fearful
her AIDS will be discovered that she travels 100 miles to see a
doctor in Springfield. She is too nervous to attend a support group
there because even in the state's third-largest city, ``there's a
chance that someone might know someone you know.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Tennessee children's hospital where she takes her
3-year-old daughter, who also has AIDS, she will not even tell
other patients what the girl's illness is. And while Lynn, 29,
would like to use the Internet to read up on news about AIDS, she
will not, because the computer is at the school where her husband
works. She said she and her husband ``have reason to believe'' that
whispers about her AIDS cost him his teaching job in the last rural
town they lived in.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, she said, ``I told a few close friends, and a lot of
those people are not my friends anymore. People still think in
their mind `I don't want to be around that person, I don't want to
drink from the same cup or I don't want to use the bathroom after
you.' This is the Bible Belt of the Midwest and morally and
religiously and everything, it's just not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   In part because AIDS patients keep themselves so invisible,
experts say, people in rural areas do not always see it as a
threat. Not only do people not see as much of a need for AIDS
education in their area, but people who are infected may wait until
they exhibit symptoms to get tested, thereby increasing the chances
that they may infect someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just thought it was in big cities that it happened,'' said
Teresa B., 24, who was told two years ago that she and her
daughter, 4, both have AIDS. She recently attended a meeting for
AIDS patients in southeastern Missouri, the first time state
counselors have held one anywhere near her home in Cairo, Ill., she
said. Some of the people with AIDS there ``didn't even know what it
is,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In poor rural Missouri, AIDS counselors and medical
professionals said, traditional efforts to educate people about
prevention do not work.
</P>
<P>
   ``IV drug users are not going to walk down to the square in
rural Missouri and pick up needles,'' said Stephen Fuhr, the former
medical clinic administrator for the Joplin health department who
said owners of pool halls, arcades and other teen hangouts in the
city barred him from putting up informational posters. ``Gay men
are not going to walk down Main Street in Small Town, USA, and
start talking about AIDS prevention. Condom distributions are not a
real popular idea in schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Some rural schools are so uncomfortable with anything related to
sex that they make it nearly impossible for AIDS to be discussed.
Jim House, education director for the AIDS Project of the Ozarks in
Springfield, said several schools told him he was welcome ``as long
as you don't mention anything about homosexuality or condoms.'' One
principal told him not to bring a fellow speaker who had AIDS
because ``he might use the bathroom or take a drink at the
fountain.''
</P>
<P>
   At Norwood High School, about 50 miles east of Springfield,
House had to preview his presentation before a meeting of the
school board, mayor, town officials and parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them, `How many of you are concerned because your kids
are sexually active?' and they said, `Mr. House, you have to
understand, we have an abstinence-only program here,''' he
recalled. They let him speak to students only after ``I asked them
how many pregnancies there were and they said eight, and I said,
`Oh, are those test-tube babies from the biology lab?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Pendergrass, the Norwood superintendent, said the school
board feels homosexuality and birth control are ``not acceptable
topics.'' He said that made health education difficult in a county
with one of the highest rates of teen-age pregnancy in the state.
``It's just a matter of time'' until his district has an
HIV-positive student, he said, ``and with the amount of teen-age
drinking that we have and the sexually permissive atmosphere that
exists, if we had one, we could have 20 pretty quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Experts say education about sexual transmission of AIDS is
especially important for both rural men and women because they are
more likely to get AIDS from heterosexual sex and less likely to be
infected by intravenous drug use.
</P>
<P>
   A recent survey of low-income women in Missouri found rural
women were much less likely to use condoms than urban women because
they believed they were unnecessary or had trouble asking their
partners to use them, said William Yarber, senior director of the
Rural Center for AIDS/Sexually Transmitted Disease Prevention at
Indiana University and one of the study's authors. Nearly half the
women thought that as long as they were unable to get pregnant,
either because of a tubal ligation or another method of birth
control, they did not have to use a condom to protect them from
contracting the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa O., 23, who lives in Portageville, Mo., said she did not
always use condoms because her partners did not want to. Ms.
Elliott said that with her boyfriend of seven years, she used
condoms for quite a while, ``until he told me that he couldn't have
kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Some patients travel long distances to find doctors who feel
comfortable or experienced enough to treat them. For rural people
in poverty, scant bus service and inability to afford even a tank
of gas can mean they only get help when they can get a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Once a month, Medicaid pays for both Teresa B. and Teresa O. to
visit doctors in St. Louis, roughly 200 miles from each of their
homes. Teresa O., whose 10-month-old daughter is also infected,
said she has found no knowledgeable doctors near her southeastern
Missouri town. Teresa B., who has had trouble sticking to some
medications because she hates the side effects, believes most of
the doctors in a Cairo medical clinic are ``scared to treat me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Elliott is lucky that her local physician, Dr. Scott Turner,
agreed to treat her, but even he says he must consult infectious
disease specialists because ``if a doctor has only a few AIDS
patients, it's very, very difficult to keep up with all the AIDS
research going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of access to support systems can exacerbate other problems.
Melissa Smith, client services director for the AIDS Project of the
Ozarks, said many patients she sees are poor and may have trouble
with substance abuse or domestic violence. Some women, including
Ms. Elliott, said that when they were told they had AIDS, they
entertained thoughts of suicide. Others, like Teresa B., are
wracked with guilt for infecting their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depression is a huge problem for HIV-positive women here _
disconnecting with life, hopelessness, isolation,'' Ms. Smith said.
Urban women may get just as depressed but they are more likely to
have access to counselors, support groups and open-minded friends.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, the AIDS Project had a telephone support group,
where people did not even have to give their names, but the grant
for that program ran out.
</P>
<P>
   West at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said more
money was needed for rural programs and new approaches might be
tried, like telephone consultations and greater use of the
Internet. He said officials are considering asking a national AIDS
organization to focus on rural communities, but the search has been
complicated, he said, because most national groups are used to
working in cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sue, 26, who lives in the tiny community of Dunawig, near
Joplin, finds the secrecy and isolation especially trying because
her 12-year-old daughter is at an age where she needs to talk to
someone about the illness both her parents have. The girl recently
asked to write a paper on AIDS for school, a way to focus on the
subject without betraying her parents' secret.
</P>
<P>
   Lynn, who did not want her town mentioned, wonders how to tell
her 3-year-old daughter and whether to notify schools and the
parents of playmates.
</P>
<P>
   An articulate, personable woman with a girl-next-door face and a
wholesome background, Lynn wishes she felt free to speak to others
about AIDS so ``they could see a normal person that's married and
has a family and is normal and someone they've known all their
lives and they like. I feel bad because I could really be helping a
lot of people.''

AT HOME, GORE FINDS FRIENDS APLENTY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHELBYVILLE, Tenn. _ This is the kind of place where they just
call him Al.
</P>
<P>
   If a politician needed a respite from the scandal in Washington,
it could be found here Sunday afternoon, at the Gore family
barbecue, where nearly everyone, it seemed, was related to Vice
President Al Gore, knew him personally or knew a close member of
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I campaigned with Al the first day he ran for Congress,'' said
Mark Farrar, a cattleman who recalled offering his home in
Shelbyville to Gore that night in 1976. ``While we were getting
ready to go out, he sat there on the couch and fed my daughter her
bottle.'' Her name, by the way, is Mary Elizabeth, which is the
given name of Gore's wife, Tipper. But Farrar said that was just a
coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence or not, a visit to his home state and the daylong
celebration in a horse-showing arena seemed to give Gore a break
from worries foreign, domestic and personal, three weeks before
midterm elections that are now laden with extra meaning because of
impeachment proceedings in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Even his mild Southern accent took on an added degree of twang.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, the son of a former senator, Albert Gore, is a
presidential aspirant in 2000 and has been campaigning around the
country virtually nonstop in recent months. According to the White
House's political strategy, Gore is primarily responsible for
generating support for House candidates in the Democratic Party's
effort to keep the electoral cost of the Monica Lewinsky scandal to
a minimum.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule for Sunday called for a visit to a district where
Democrats are fighting to regain a seat they lost in 1994. Dressed
in a plaid shirt, khaki slacks and black cowboy boots, Gore pressed
the idea at a fund-raising event before the barbecue. He addressed
a crowd of about 100 people, who contributed some $50,000 to the
campaign of Jerry Cooper, a Democratic state legislator who is
trying to unseat Van Hilleary, a two-term Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said a victory for Cooper would help Democrats pick up the
11 seats they need ``to kick Newt Gingrich out of that speaker's
chair.''
</P>
<P>
   As he normally does, Gore avoided any direct reference to
President Clinton's problems other than a few swipes at the
Republican majority in Congress, whose actions against Clinton he
said reflect ``an extremist ideology that is not supported by the
American people.''
</P>
<P>
   But the main business of the day followed, in the arena next
door, where Gore wandered among 4,000 people for several hours,
signing autographs, posing for pictures and chatting with families.
Later, he went on stage for a speech and a few verses of ``I Saw
the Light'' with a local country-and-western band.
</P>
<P>
   While it was fundamental retail politics, it was a highly
unusual setting for Gore in that almost all his public appearances
are rigidly scripted, with tight crowd control. Here, he stood in
the middle of a throng of people, moving slowly about, twisting and
turning to greet people approaching from all sides.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most just wanted to have a picture snapped, but others had
messages to deliver. Some had buttons that said ``Gore 2000,'' and
some had signs that said ``I adore Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Dixon, 46, a high school teacher, nudged her way to the
front with her 9-year-old son, Jason, who was wearing a T-shirt
that said ``Preserve Our Prairies.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wore it just for you,'' Ms. Dixon told the vice president,
who has made protecting the environment one of his major issues.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Forsythe, 31, a house mover from Bell Buckle, Tenn., threw
an arm around the vice president and placed his head on his
shoulder so they could pray. Gore obliged.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I pray for him and Bill Clinton, too,'' Forsythe
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a crowd with so many Gore supporters, including his mother,
Pauline, and his oldest daughter, Karenna, it was hard to find
anyone who thought the president ought to resign or be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Dentici, 73, a retired city official in Nashville and a
Navy veteran, offered a response typical of voters here who are
trying to balance Clinton's predicament with the interests of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to hear about the president's problems anymore,''
he said. ``The whole country is disgusted with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Najanna Coleman, a bank executive in Milan, Tenn., who
served as a campaign volunteer for Gore when he ran for president
in 1988, one problem lingers. She said she worries that Clinton's
problems might somehow harm Gore in his bid to succeed the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my man,'' Ms. Coleman said of the vice president. ``I'm
sure it could have some effect, but people are tired of hearing
about the situation in Washington. It's time to move on, and Al can
take us where we need to go.''

SKIP AWAY INJURY NOT SERIOUS, TRAINER SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the morning after he ran third in the Jockey Club
Gold Cup at Belmont Park and lost for the first time in 10 races,
Skip Away was nursing a swollen right front ankle on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But his trainer, Sonny Hine, said he was ``95 percent sure''
that Skip Away would run in the $4 million Breeders' Cup Classic
and pursue his goal to become racing's richest horse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Skippy's ankle blew up three or four times as big as it was
after the race,'' Hine said. ``There's a lot of heat and
inflammation, but he's sound. If we go to the Breeders' Cup will
depend on what I can accomplish in a week, but I'm 95 percent sure
we'll run there.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away's loss was his first in a year, and it came after a
grinding duel on a muddy track with Gentlemen, the West Coast
superstar. They ran 1-2 in the Woodward three weeks ago and were
expected to dominate the Gold Cup. But after flying a mile in 1:34
1/5, they were caught from behind by Wagon Limit, a 34-1 long shot
who had been racing in last place for most of the way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry Bailey told me that Skippy leaped a path over by the
chute where they turn the tractors,'' Hine said. ``That must have
been where he hurt himself. He had a little filling last night, and
we expected it to blow up, but not as much as it did. We didn't
give him anything because we didn't want to mask anything. We
wanted to know exactly what it was we had to deal with.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope to get him back on track in a week or so, but he may
not let me wait that long. He chased me out of his stall this
morning. He's sound, believe me, we just have to get rid of the
filling.''
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away won $110,000 for running third, leaving him with
career earnings of $9.6 million. He needs about $400,000 to pass
Cigar's record of just under $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Wagon Limit, who pulled off the upset with a cunning ride by
Robbie Davis, also might return for a rematch in the Classic. But
his trainer, Allen Jerkens, the man who has engineered upsets over
Secretariat and Kelso and now Skip Away, sounded modest in victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just goes to show,'' he said, ``that when you're lucky and
you have a horse that's ready, anything can happen. I've seen it so
many times over the years at Belmont. You had two horses going at
it, and they went the first quarter in 23 3/5 seconds, they did a
half-mile in 46 2/5 and three-quarters in 1:09 3/5. That's going to
take a toll on any horse.''

INDIA'S HOTTEST POLITICAL ISSUE: THE PRICE OF ONIONS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CELIA W. DUGGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ Five months ago, people here triumphantly
celebrated in the streets when the Hindu nationalist-led government
conducted nuclear tests. In recent days, thousands of Delhiites
have again poured into the streets, but this time they are cursing
the very same political party.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that angers them is the price of the lowly onion _ an
essential ingredient of the flavor base, or masala, of almost every
dish cooked here.
</P>
<P>
   On some days, onions have reached a record 60 rupees a kilo, or
about $1.45 for 2.2 pounds, a price that is seven times higher than
it was this time last year.
</P>
<P>
   In a desperate effort to appease angry voters, the state and
national governments, both headed by the Bharatiya Janata Party,
are selling a limited supply of onions in New Delhi for just 10
rupees, or about 25 cents, a kilo.
</P>
<P>
   The national government also decided on Thursday to import
10,000 tons of onions from the Middle East and to suspend exports
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   But shoppers on long lines waiting to buy the subsidized onions
are still spitting mad. Most of them often have to wait two, four,
even six hours in the onion lines _ and sometimes they sell out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sweating here just to buy the bloody onions and I didn't
even get any,'' said Gursharn Kaur, a 56-year-old housewife, as a
government truck pulled away.
</P>
<P>
   An unusually hot summer and late monsoon rains have damaged
harvests and contributed to shortages, driving up the price of
onions, cauliflower, peas, coriander, chilies and other vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   The state and national governments here have responded with the
heavily subsidized onions, which newspapers are calling a sop to
voters and many economists consider a gimmick.
</P>
<P>
   But the politicians know their audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Onions are a metaphor for the world turned upside down,'' said
Yogendra Yadav, a political scientist at the Center for the Study
of Developing Societies, a research institution in New Delhi.
``They become a symbol of what is happening to the basic things of
life.''

COMMENTARY: SHATTERING SHIBBOLETHS 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Let's cut to impeachment's chase.
</P>
<P>
   Impeachment myth No. 1: Congress will never vote to impeach or
remove a president in the teeth of opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   Reality: Here comes the impeachment election. If Democrats take
the House, Clinton's conduct is effectively condoned. Contrariwise,
if Republican majorities grow, that vote would stand as the voice
of the people no matter what opinion polls show.
</P>
<P>
   2. The shortened attention span of the American people dictates
Henry Hyde's ``New Year's Resolution'' _ hasty hearings and a snap
decision from this Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
   No Thanksgiving break? No Christmas? This sordid story is hungry
for heroes, and as Congress provides new household names, a new
cast of characters _ white hats as well as villains _ will achieve
fame and fascinate us all. The civic debate should become more
elevated and less prurient as weighty constitutional issues unfold
on television.
</P>
<P>
   3. The Judiciary Committee will limit itself to digesting and
acting upon only the evidence submitted so far by the independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican House ignoring new information about abuses of
power in Travelgate and Filegate and obstruction in Whitewater? A
newly expanded Judiciary staff refusing to examine evidence of
bribery (a most impeachable offense) in illegal campaign
fund-raising from Asia? C'mon.
</P>
<P>
   4. People are tired of lies about sex and want to move on.
</P>
<P>
   That may be what people say while transfixed by the drama of
egregious misconduct at the top. Sex perjury by itself may not be
cause enough to remove a president, but abuses add up, and the
prospect of Jane Doe No. 5 or Intern No. 2 or some other ``harassed
from the past'' gives Democrats the Willeys.
</P>
<P>
   5. Democrats will call Ken Starr as a witness and turn hearings
into a circus investigating the investigator.
</P>
<P>
   The maligned independent counsel may turn out to be a cool,
persuasive witness and not a priggish Savonarola. Monica may
exhibit unexpected dignity. And if prosecutor and chief witness are
called before Congress, why not the grand jury forewoman _ on the
theory that seeking truth about a potential presidential
conspirator takes precedence over indictments?
</P>
<P>
   6. The simple pleasures of Monicagate can't hold a candle to the
serious abuses of Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   That's because we've only just begun. Watergate is remembered
for Nixon's cover-up that came to light long after a break-in he
knew nothing about. Starr has much to report or miscreants to
indict after Nov. 3. The committee has not yet started taking
depositions, and President Clinton cannot claim privilege for aides
like Lindsey and Blumenthal, or his lawyers' hired
privacy-penetrators Terry Lenzner and Jack Palladino, without
adding fuel to the impeachment fires.
</P>
<P>
   7. Democrats will easily find 34 loyalist votes in the Senate to
resist removal in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The most ominous sentence of last week came from the veteran
Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd, leading preserver of the legislative
branch's prerogatives. After Clintonites foolishly tried to
assemble 34 senatorial signatures to prejudge and moot a House
impeachment inquiry, he warned: ``Don't tamper with this jury.'' On
constitutional matters, Byrd has a small but respectful Democratic
following in the Senate club; they are not in anybody's bag.
</P>
<P>
   8. With Asia and Russia in economic turmoil, refugees about to
freeze in Kosovo and Saddam building weapons while thumbing his
nose at the United Nations, we cannot afford the distraction of
firing our reckless leader.
</P>
<P>
   A superpower should be able to walk and chew up a president at
the same time. Turn the myth on its head: Clinton, who studiously
avoided dealing with these crises before the impeachment inquiry,
may finally have an incentive to address them _ if only to look
presidential. Advocates of his ouster will support him _ if only to
appear nonpartisan.
</P>
<P>
   9. Cool heads will prevail to levy punishment short of removal.
</P>
<P>
   Congress may cluck-cluck at, but is forbidden to punish, a
nonmember. Clinton, who still thinks he can deny his way out of
anything, will not further weaken the presidency by bargaining for
extra-constitutional humiliation. He stands ready, to his credit,
to take his chances on a Senate trial. If he loses, he will gain
what he has sought all his life: a unique and indelible place in
American history.

 By ALAN TRUEX  
 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
IRVING _ For the first time this season, the Dallas Cowboys have
clamped two wins together. But they almost let the second one slip
away Sunday afternoon at Texas Stadium. The Carolina Panthers were
in death throes, and the Cowboys had trouble finishing them off.
<TEXT>
<P>
   They did it in the nick of time. Prime Time, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas offense was almost flawless. Jason Garrett continued
to improve as understudy to injured quarterback Troy Aikman. And
the rejuvenated offensive line gave Garrett eons to throw and
gouged out canyons for Emmitt Smith to explore.
</P>
<P>
   But then there was the Dallas defense. The Cowboys held Carolina
to 29 yards rushing, but except for Deion Sanders, they couldn't
defend the pass.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina's Steve Beuerlein made his first start of the season
and couldn't have done better throwing in his back yard. He
completed 18 of his first 19 attempts. Not until Sanders
intercepted him with two minutes left in the game were the Cowboys
assured of their 27-20 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deion knows the distance he can be from a player and still
make a play,'' Carolina coach Dom Capers observed, noting how the
Neon One lured Beuerlein into a fatal trap.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, pro football's most versatile performer, also was a key
to his team's go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   At the Panthers' six-yard line, the Cowboys deployed Sanders as
a flanker. They sent him in motion, drawing defenders with him and
creating a gap in the middle. Garrett then shuffled a pass to
running back Chris Warren, who had an easy path to the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense was supposed to key on me,'' Sanders said, ``and
it worked out great.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been times this season when Sanders was about the
only weapon the Cowboys had. But Sunday, there were others. Garrett
completed 14 of 22 passes for 287 yards and two touchdowns. Michael
Irvin caught six passes for 146 yards, and Ernie Mills five for
110.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Smith had his second consecutive 100-yard rushing
day, with 21 carries for 112 yards and a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Emmitt ran the ball as well as we've ever seen him
run,'' said Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Cowboys were happy to jump off the roller coaster
and raise their record to 4-2, there was little glory in struggling
against an 0-5 team.
</P>
<P>
   Beuerlein played only because Kerry Collins asked to be benched,
and Dallas coach Chan Gailey said, ``You would hope he's rusty and
antsy and doesn't see things quickly. But a situation like that can
be a rallying point.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was. Beuerlein completed his first 12 passes
before he missed under pressure from blitzing linebacker Fred
Strickland.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina forged a 14-3 lead with touchdown passes of 35 and 16
yards from Beuerlein to Rocket Ismail.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys came back with an acrobatic catch by Mills in the
end zone. He leaned backward to pull down an 18-yard fade from
Garrett, who makes up with touch what he lacks in arm strength.
</P>
<P>
   With two minutes remaining in the first half, the Panthers faked
a punt. Ken Walter made the first down across midfield, but the
play was nullified by an illegal-formation penalty. The Panthers
were said to have only six players on the line of scrimmage, though
a television replay indicated otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   After exiting the field to booing over their 14-10 halftime
deficit, the Cowboys showed more intensity in the third quarter.
Two minutes into it, Kevin Mathis recovered a fumble by Carolina
running back Anthony Johnson on the Panthers' 19-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the shuffle pass _ and the last shuffling of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ran that look last week to Deion,'' Gailey said. ``We
thought if we ran the same look, they may run over to that side of
the field, and they did.''
</P>
<P>
   A two-yard TD run by Smith gave Dallas a 24-14 lead, and a
38-yard field goal by Richie Cunningham stretched it to 27-14 in
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But a couple of lapses let Carolina back into the game.
</P>
<P>
   First, a Garrett fumble on a quarterback sneak was returned 35
yards by cornerback Rod Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to bleed the clock out and not give the ball
away,'' Garrett said. ``But I dived into the crease, and the ball
just kind of disappeared on me. I don't know if somebody knocked it
away or what.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Cowboys snafu followed as safety Darren Woodson, beaten
deep, committed a 40-yard interference penalty. That set up a
three-yard touchdown pass from Beuerlein to fullback William Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The Panthers would have closed to within six points, but Chad
Hennings blocked John Kasay's conversion try.
</P>
<P>
   ``From watching films, I knew they had a PAT blocked from that
side,'' Hennings said. ``So I thought I had a chance to get
penetration and get my hands up and see what happens.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Cowboys were not out of trouble until the Sanders
interception on the left sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had been beating us all day with four receivers going
vertical,'' Sanders said. ``This time, my man broke it off and ran
an out. I was cheating inside, so I could run back to the ball and
make the play.''
</P>
<P>
   With a recent commitment to Christianity and humility, Sanders
has eschewed his Prime Time moniker. But he has lost none of his
flair for the dramatic. Certainly there could not have been a more
opportune moment for Prime Time to reappear for the Cowboys.

BUDGET TALKS END ROUND WITH AMITY BUT NO DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Fla., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Top-level budget negotiators for congressional
Republicans and the White House concluded yet another bargaining
session late Sunday afternoon with plans to resume talks on Monday
morning and probably extend their midnight Monday deadline for
another day or two.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were amiable as they emerged from a two-hour session,
but they had little to report and indicated that their relatively
early departure, compared with the last three nights, should not be
interpreted as a sign of crisis or of imminent peace in the budget
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's discussions focused on education and President
Clinton's request for $1.1 billion to hire 100,000 teachers, but
aides said the bargainers did not delve into much detail and
nothing was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we made some real progress today, but we still have a
significant difference in the area of education,'' said Erskine
Bowles, Clinton's chief of staff and top negotiator, after Sunday's
meeting. ``We're going to try to plow through that over the next
two days.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how far apart the two sides were on education, Rep. Dick
Armey of Texas, the Republican majority leader, replied: ``I don't
know. We're not together.'' He said the two sides had made ``some
progress, but not enough.''
</P>
<P>
   The talks came during another day of escalated political
confrontation as congressional Democrats and Republicans, painfully
aware that they have three weeks until Election Day, tried to take
advantage of the static budget situation.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has passed only six of the 13 required spending bills
and are negotiating now with the White House on a final omnibus
package that will contain the remaining seven bills and major
issues including how to conduct the census in the year 2000, how
much money to provide the International Monetary Fund and under
what conditions it should be provided, and how much emergency money
to provide for items like increased security at U.S. embassies
around the world and for American farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Also to be resolved are a host of issues that have little to do
with financing and more to do with ideology, including
environmental matters, contraception and national student testing.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said the president had been disengaged from the
process, and they were irked at what they said was his swooping in
at the 11th hour and pushing his education agenda in an apparently
successful portrayal of himself as the guardian of that popular
topic.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats countered that the Republican-led Congress had done
nothing all year, and cast the Republicans as extremists for
blocking the president's plea for more money to hire teachers and
modernize schools.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Republican bargainers said Saturday night that they
would provide the money if local governments, not Washington, could
decide how the money would be used.
</P>
<P>
   Armey was one of many who castigated the president for apparent
disengagement, an indirect reminder that Clinton has been steeped
in a sex scandal and is facing an impeachment inquiry in the House.
</P>
<P>
   The scant number of congressional Republicans who did not leave
town for the weekend used the House floor to press this same
message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about the president?'' asked Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the
majority whip. ``Maybe in Martha's Vineyard? Aspen? Camp David?
Where is the president? I bet the American people don't know that
he spent 152 days out of the 283 days this year fund raising,
traveling and on vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said that Clinton had participated in 98
fund-raising events so far this year and that two events on Monday
in New York, supporting the Senate campaign of Rep. Charles
Schumer, would bring him to 100.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said at the White House that he was ``prepared to do
whatever it takes'' to reach a resolution over the spending bills,
and dispatched his aides to Capitol Hill. He also said he would
postpone from Monday morning until Monday afternoon his departure
for his fund-raising tour in New York, and he canceled a
fund-raising appearance in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   But as the high-level budget bargaining concluded Sunday
afternoon, both sides agreed they would need to extend their
deadline beyond midnight Monday, when temporary financing for the
government expires for the third time since the Oct. 1 start of the
fiscal year.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Congressional Democrats struck back at the Republicans, saying
they have held a slack schedule themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., said Congress had been in session
only 108 days so far this year, an unusually abbreviated period and
one consumed for more than a month by the drive to hold impeachment
hearings on the president. Most Americans, Miller said, had worked
more than 225 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say, `Where is the president?''' Miller said. ``The
president has been waiting for the budget. This is the first
Congress since 1974 that has no budget,'' he said, referring to the
broad blueprint that is supposed to guide spending. ``This is a
Congress that can't pass seven of its appropriations bills,'' he
said, largely because of divisive splits among conservative and
moderate Republicans.

PENALTIES WILL CATCH UP TO NORTHRIDGE

   NORTHRIDGE, Calif. _ Right now the penalties are just hurting
Cal State Northridge. But if those penalties continue, eventually
it will kill the Matadors.
</P>
<P>
   So far talent and tenacity has overcome the holds and illegal
formations and late hits and delay of games. But at some point that
will stop and CSUN will be lamenting about a wasted opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth straight week the Matadors won, a 21-7 decision
against No.18 Montana. But for the third straight week No.23 CSUN
reached double digits in penalties. The Matadors were flagged 11
times for 100 yards Saturday, which is also the third time they've
had more penalties than their opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like we were trying to lose the dang game for a
while,'' CSUN coach Ron Ponciano said. ``The number of penalties
was so heavy on our side it was just absolutely ridiculous. I don't
understand, and I still cannot accept that foolishness.''
</P>
<P>
   Rare is the time when a penalty is a good thing (to prevent a
blindside sack or an easy touchdown reception fit the bill). And
right now the Matadors (4-1) are playing well enough to overcome
the penalties. However, that won't last the rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   On each of their scoring drives against Montana, the Matadors
had to go extra yards to make up for miscues.
</P>
<P>
   Before Marcus Brady and Jimmy Greninger got together on a
51-yard touchdown pass on the first possession of the third
quarter, CSUN had a substitution infraction that moved the ball
back 5 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Sort of a prelude to the doozy that turned into the game-winning
drive.
</P>
<P>
   First, there was an illegal use of the hands called against
CSUN. So on second-and-20 from its own 43, Brady scrambled and then
connected with Aaron Arnold for a 57-yard touchdown strike.
</P>
<P>
   For naught. Holding was called.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Matadors went from second-and-33 to getting the first
down, and eventually the touchdown. But not before the penalties
wiped out huge plays.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like a dagger. I was heartbroken when that one got
called back,'' Brady said. ``I didn't see it. After I threw it I
was sitting there cheering, jumping up and down, ready to
celebrate. And I saw a yellow flag on the ground, and it just kind
of hurt inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like we threw three touchdown passes just to score
one.''
</P>
<P>
   Even on the game-clinching drive, a modest 20-yarder after
Montana was stopped on fourth down, there was a penalty, this time
for delay of game.
</P>
<P>
   And the penalties aren't relegated to the offense. Twice in the
first half the Matadors defense was penalized on key third-down
plays that extended Montana drives. Two other times CSUN defensive
penalties resulted in first downs for the Grizzlies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order for us to continue to improve we have got to stop
doing those stupid penalties,'' Ponciano said. ``I mean, it's on
both sides of the ball, and that is 100 percent unacceptable. But I
tend to forget that we won a football game that was very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Ponciano knows a week is coming where CSUN will lose a football
game thanks to penalties. The last three weeks the North Campus
Stadium field was littered with yellow hankies. An average of 10.7
flags for 91.7 yards per game.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the yellow flags catch up to a team. Eventually,
those flags will shatter a team's hopes for a Big Sky championship
or playoff bid.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, CSUN will lose if the penalties continue.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Was it really only three months ago that the economic
sky was blue? That life was lush? That everything was coming up
roses, even in the asphalt jungle of New York?
</P>
<P>
   Now, storm clouds seem to be piling up on the horizons of many
New Yorkers, especially the well-to-do suits who populate much of
Manhattan. Vacations are being postponed, apartment prices are
being cut, purchases are being put off. The elegant Four Seasons
restaurant is trying to come up with a cheaper menu.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of all this anxiety is, of course, Wall Street, which
is suffering one of its worst patches in a decade. Blue-chip stocks
have fallen more than 15 percent since July, bond markets around
the globe have imploded and some big Wall Street firms have
admitted to losing hundreds of millions of dollars in the last
three months.
</P>
<P>
   Things have suddenly gotten so bad in the world of stocks and
bonds that Merrill Lynch, a major New York employer and the biggest
brokerage firm in the country, is widely expected to announce this
week that it will lay off 1,000 workers or more. Other firms are
expected to follow suit next week. (Spokespeople for the firms
declined to comment.)
</P>
<P>
   This is bad news in a city where securities firms employ almost
164,000 people in the metropolitan region. While these workers
account for less than 5 percent of the labor force here, they make
an enormous amount of money (an average of $172,000 a year, as
opposed to $43,000 for the average worker in other industries,
according to statistics from the governor's office). That money
gets spread around through the taxes they pay, the things they buy,
and the restaurants and bars they frequent.
</P>
<P>
   And many New Yorkers work at companies that do a lot of business
with Wall Street firms. Accountants, office cleaners, lawyers,
printers, caterers, limousine drivers, computer technicians,
temporary workers, all depend in large part on financial firms for
their livelihoods. From 1995 to 1997, the boom of Wall Street
resulted in $1 billion of additional sales for suppliers and
created 7,800 jobs outside the securities industry, according to a
recent report by the state comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   Even those whose jobs have little to do with Wall Street may
well be feeling gloomy over the stock market's malaise. Almost half
of Americans have some money in the stock market, directly or
through their retirement plans. For the first time in many years,
their accounts are starting to show big losses, which are prompting
a decline in consumer confidence among the well-to-do, according to
surveys that track American sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who owns a co-op apartment in Manhattan is probably aware
of the effect Wall Street's gloom is having on the high-end housing
market. In September, sellers cut their asking prices on 1,292
apartments _ almost 19 percent of the listings of the Corcoran
Group, a real estate brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   The mood among sellers has changed, said Barbara Corcoran,
chairwoman of the company. Although few are jumping at the low bids
put in by potential buyers, at least now they are listening, she
said. ``Before, they weren't even civil.''
</P>
<P>
   The declines on Wall Street may even affect people who are
impoverished or otherwise in need. That is because many charities
in New York depend heavily on donations from the financial sector.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross of Greater New York, for one, is
definitely worried about the state of its donors. ``If they feel
less wealthy, they feel less able to make major gifts,'' said
Dolores Swirin, the senior director of development. ``We are
counting on the stock market, which until now was making people
feel more charitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Stores that sell expensive items, from silk ties to personal
computers, are already seeing a decline. Sales at Neiman Marcus,
which also owns Bergdorf Goodman, fell more than 7 percent last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the art auction houses are expecting strong sales of
masterpieces, which is how they make most of their money. But they
are worrying about what, for their customers, are almost impulse
purchases. ``The real question is not how the great Renoir will do,
but how a good Renoir, at a half million, will do,'' said Diana
Brooks, the chief executive of Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers appear to be cutting back on other luxuries, like
the rare cigars that Richard Hu sometimes gets in stock at his
shop, Wall Street Humidor. In August, Hu said, he was able to
unload a shipment by calling just seven of his best customers. But
in recent weeks, he has had to make 25 or 30 calls. ``A lot of my
investment bankers are starting to worry about their jobs,'' Hu
said.
</P>
<P>
   This sudden surge in gloom may prove to be an overreaction to
temporary trouble. After all, some firms on Wall Street, including
Lehman Brothers and the giant Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, say they
have no plans to cut jobs.
</P>
<P>
   It may simply be that New Yorkers are coming down to earth, with
a bit of a Champagne hangover, after an astounding period in which
hundreds of Wall Street executives received annual bonuses of $1
million or more.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sales of luxury cars at BMW of Manhattan, which stalled in
August and September, are now now on an upswing as new models come
in, though customers are in a slightly more cautious mood, said
William Kehoe, president and general manager. ``We don't notice
people looking for less expensive models,'' he said, ``but they are
a lot more calculating and conservative in shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists and government officials argue that all this
emphasis on Wall Street is overblown. Sure, businesses that depend
on financial firms for orders will be affected, as will those that
depend on spending by people with very high incomes, said Stephen
Kagann, chief economist for Gov. George E. Pataki. ``But not by a
long shot does that define the typical New York City resident,''
Kagann said.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, there is no denying that in lower Manhattan,
anxiety is on the rise. Richard Nemeroff of Garden City, N.Y., who
works in technical support at Merrill Lynch, said on Friday that he
is not sure whether he will take his wife on a vacation to Key West
in Florida early next year. ``I'm going to hold off and see what
happens in the fourth quarter,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And among the investment bankers and hotshot traders, the mood
is more like panic. Not only have securities firms' profits
tumbled, chopping the money available for bonuses, but their stock
prices have plunged by more than half since July. This comes as a
blow to executives, who have much of their net worth tied up in
their employers' stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody lost their bonus in August, and they can't believe
it,'' said one executive, who spoke on the condition that neither
his name nor his firm appear in print. He had just come from a
meeting in which he was told his division was cutting back on
hiring and was ``reviewing staffing,'' which he said was code for
contemplating layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A sort of defiant gloom has set in among some of Wall Street's
younger workers, like the young men drinking late on Friday night
at the Cub Room, a popular SoHo nightspot. ``I'm an analyst at
Merrill Lynch, and I'm sure I'm going to lose my job next week _
positive,'' said one man, who would not give his name because, he
said, appearing in the newspaper would doom any chance that he
would keep his job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if they fire me,'' he added. ``I'm just going to
go to law school. I'll be making money again in another few
years.''
</P>
<P>
   John Cogland said that his firm, which he would not name, is not
firing people, but he has heard rumors of layoffs elsewhere on Wall
Street.``Maybe I should make dinner tomorrow night and save some
money, just in case,'' he said. ``I probably should _ but I
won't.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who have been watching Wall Street the longest sound the
gloomiest. This month's round of layoff announcements ``will be
neither the last nor the largest,'' said John Keefe, a former Wall
Street analyst who now works as a consultant to the securities
industry. ``It'll continue for some time, all over different
companies, different departments, big people and little.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that forecast a little, well, dire? ``I've seen it
before,'' Keefe said.
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, the financial firms did slash employment after
1987, when the stock market fell 20 percent in one day, and made
further cuts after the bond market collapsed in 1990. Between July
of 1987 and January of 1990, Wall Street employment fell by 20,000
jobs, to 142,000; by October of 1991, employment dropped by an
additional 14,000 jobs, to 128,000.
</P>
<P>
   The city suffered, too. Overall employment in the private sector
fell from more than 3 million in 1987 to about 2.7 million in 1991.
Businesses failed, stores went bankrupt, office towers stood empty.
Pessimism seemed almost universal.
</P>
<P>
   Those days may seem long gone, but in some parts of New York,
they are hard to forget. Take Delmonico's, the fabled restaurant on
Beaver Street in the financial district that folded in 1990, in
part because its Wall Street customers could not pay their tabs.
After reopening five months ago, the restaurant has been doing a
booming business, though lunch was a little slow late last week,
said Patricia Economo, the catering manager.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the restaurant is being very careful about allowing
young traders to open house accounts, she said, adding, ``You know
these guys _ they take some big risks.''
</P>
<P>
   The Four Seasons in midtown is far less dependent on Wall Street
for its customers, who have been packing the place, said Julian
Niccolini, one of the restaurant's owners. Nevertheless, on Friday
he met with his chef to discuss a new menu for the grill room,
where a prix fixe meal costs $75, a price he hopes to bring down to
between $55 and $65.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the change, Niccolini said, was his experience
after the stock market crash of 1987, when his sales fell
substantially. ``In the past, we waited too long to react,'' he
said. ``And we had a very hard time.''

EXPERTS DIFFER ON ODDS OF RECOVERY BY STRAWBERRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., Texas, Ga., Ohio)  (mk) 
 By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Since Darryl Strawberry, the 36-year-old Yankees
outfielder, had surgery to remove a cancer from his colon on Oct.
3, his doctors and the Yankees have painted an optimistic picture
of his chances for a long-term cure.
</P>
<P>
   However, a number of cancer experts not connected with
Strawberry's case were more cautious in their optimism about his
future, because the detection of cancerous cells in even one of the
36 lymph nodes removed from his abdomen during the operation meant
the cancer had spread. The finding meant Strawberry's
post-operative course would include chemotherapy; if none of the
lymph nodes had shown evidence of cancerous cells, presumably
Strawberry would not have needed chemotherapy. The finding also
substantially reduced the odds of a five-year cure, from the
approximately 90 percent that could have been expected if the
cancer had not spread.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry, described as ``still weak'' Sunday by Dr. Stuart
Hershon, the Yankees' team physician, remains at
Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Hershon, a specialist in bone
and joint surgery, said Strawberry ``needs to get his strength.
He'll go home when he's ready.'' Hershon said an earlier news
release from Columbia-Presbyterian that said Strawberry would leave
the hospital Sunday should not have said that.
</P>
<P>
   In the same news release, the hospital said that ``doctors are
optimistic that he will make a complete recovery and return to full
activities including playing major league baseball next season.''
There was no statistical information about his future.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts, when asked about the odds of Strawberry's
longer-term survival, said they appeared to be in his favor. But
they gave widely ranging figures _ from 75 to 35 percent _ for the
prospects of Strawberry being cured of colon cancer in five years.
The figures were based on large studies of patients with colon
cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stanley Hamilton, head of pathology at the University of
Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, and Dr. Alfred Cohen,
a colon cancer surgeon at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan, said that Strawberry had a 70 percent to 75 percent
five-year survival rate with adjuvant chemotherapy and about a 60
percent rate without such therapy.
</P>
<P>
   However, Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief medical officer of the American
Cancer Society in Atlanta, gave a survival rate of 50 percent to 65
percent. Dr. Mark Arnold, a colon cancer surgeon at Ohio State
University Hospital in Columbus, gave a 35 percent to 50 percent
figure.
</P>
<P>
   Other cancer experts who asked not to be identified gave figures
similar to those offered by Eyre and Arnold.
</P>
<P>
   The wide variation reflects several factors.
</P>
<P>
   One is that the odds depend on specific factors involved in a
particular case. Strawberry's doctors at Columbia-Presbyterian
Medical Center in Manhattan have not discussed his case publicly,
and news releases from the medical center have given few medical
details of the type that doctors generally rely on in making such
prognoses.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, predicting an individual patient's prognosis is
an inexact science because it can be extremely difficult to apply
information derived from studies involving large numbers of
patients to one person.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are clearly people who are in the highest adverse group
who survive and people who are in the highly favorable group who do
not,'' Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all get fooled,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Eyre said that even the limited available
information about Strawberry's case makes his ``a very serious
tumor.''
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's doctors have said they expect him to play next
season. However, at what point in the season that might happen
remains to be determined, because Strawberry will be taking
chemotherapy over the next six months and it is possible that he
will experience unwanted symptoms from the anti-cancer drugs.
</P>
<P>
   In one sense, the finding of only one cancerous lymph node among
the 36 was good news for Strawberry because it indicated that the
spread was limited. However, the spread to just one node has put
Strawberry in a more serious category of the standard cancer
staging systems than his wife, Charisse, said they expected before
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Charisse Strawberry said the doctors expected
Darryl to be in one of the two most favorable categories _ A or B
(or I or II in another, more commonly used system). Such staging
can be made only after pathologists examine the cancer and other
tissue removed in surgery.
</P>
<P>
   A news release from Columbia-Presbyterian last Thursday citing
the doctors' optimism did not cite the staging for Strawberry's
cancer. But by definition, the detection of just the one cancerous
node put him in the third-worst category _ either C or III,
depending on the system.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors rely heavily on such staging systems to give prognoses.
For example, Ronald Reagan's colon cancer was classified as a B
when it was removed while he was president in 1985. The colon
cancer is not known to have recurred.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's case of colon cancer has drawn exceptional
attention because he is so young. Colon cancers are rare in people
his age. Only 1,700, or 2.5 percent, of the 62,900 colon cancer
cases expected to be diagnosed in men in this country this year
will be among men 40 and under.
</P>
<P>
   Although Strawberry had experienced abdominal cramping pains for
several weeks, his cancer was detected and removed within the space
of a few days just before the start of the major league baseball
playoffs. Not only was Strawberry forced out of the lineup at a
crucial stage in the season, but it jolted his teammates.
</P>
<P>
   Also, publicity about Strawberry's case comes at a time when
scientists are calling for larger budgets for cancer research. But
Congress and the White House are pressing cancer doctors to show
what has been done with the billions of dollars that taxpayers have
invested in cancer over recent decades.
</P>
<P>
   The outlook for individuals with colon cancer has improved as
the death rate has declined over the last two decades, the American
Cancer Society said. Nevertheless, the estimates are that more than
130,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colon and rectal cancer
this year and that they will cause 47,700 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   When dealing with publicity about serious illnesses of
celebrities, doctors and hospitals are mindful that such patients
and their families will read or hear news reports about their
cases. And sports organizations like the Yankees often try to put a
favorable spin on the news for morale reasons.
</P>
<P>
   With respect to the sketchy news releases in Strawberry's case,
Hamilton said: ``Very obviously, it is not a complete picture. They
have filtered what they want'' to disclose.
</P>
<P>
   One hospital news release said that there was no evidence of
cancer in the margins of the 16-inch piece that was removed from
Strawberry's colon. But that was to be expected because if
cancerous cells were present at the margins, the surgeons would
have just removed a longer piece.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer experts said it was more important to know about the
margins of the cancer itself, whether the cancer had penetrated
deep into the walls of the tubular bowel or through it into
adjacent tissues. But that information was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the operation, Charisse Strawberry said Darryl might need
``a sprinkling'' of radiation. However, the news releases have said
nothing about radiation.
</P>
<P>
   The news releases said nothing about special tests that
pathologists can perform on the cancerous tissue removed to
determine special characteristics of its basic molecular makeup.
Strawberry's prognosis could be slightly better depending on the
findings from such tests, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Arnold said that for Strawberry ``it was better to have
cancerous cells in one node instead of five or six.'' Arnold said
that while he understood that people wanted Strawberry to have a
favorable prognosis, he suspected ``it is not as good as they
said.''
</P>
<P>
   The news releases said Strawberry is expected to take adjuvant
chemotherapy. It is aimed at destroying any cancer cells that
doctors could not see in the operation but that might remain in his
body. A few years ago, doctors began prescribing adjuvant therapy
for patients with type C or III colon cancers because that group
has shown substantial benefit, Hamilton and Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   A current standard course of adjuvant chemotherapy for colon
cancer includes a six-month course of two drugs: 5-fluorouracil and
leucovorin for six months. Cohen of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer
Center said that the drugs could be taken either once a week, or
for four or five consecutive days once a month.
</P>
<P>
   Many people tolerate adjuvant chemotherapy with fewer unwanted
side-effects than standard chemotherapy. But some do not, and the
symptoms usually include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. The
symptoms can often be moderated by reducing the amount of the
drugs. Strength usually is regained quickly after the therapy is
stopped, Cohen said.
</P>
<P>
   If Strawberry suffers such symptoms, they might be alleviated by
reducing the amount of the drugs. Strawberry's chemotherapy could
be expected to begin in November. If Strawberry begins chemotherapy
next month and suffers symptoms from it, it is questionable whether
he would play in spring training.
</P>
<P>
   The Baltimore Orioles' Eric Davis, who grew up with Strawberry
in Los Angeles, underwent surgery for colon cancer last year and
came back to play for the Baltimore Orioles three months later,
while still undergoing weekly chemotherapy treatments.
</P>
<P>
   If colon cancer recurs, it is generally within the first five
years of diagnosis, and usually within the first three years.

JETS' MISTAKES GIVE RAMS A 30-10 VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS _ The New York Jets' worst turnover performance in the
Bill Parcells regime sent Glenn Foley to the bench and handed the
Rams a 30-10 victory Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The loss ended a modest two-game winning streak. And unless
Parcells is able to stanch the speculation, the defeat could create
a week of quarterback uncertainty as the Jets (2-3) prepare to face
the New England Patriots (4-1) next Monday night in Foxboro, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams benefited from five turnovers, all of them leading to
points _ 27 from three touchdowns and a pair of field goals.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets were without Curtis Martin, the running back who had
starred in consecutive victories with 100-yard performances, with
Vinny Testaverde at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   While Foley was able to return on Sunday from a rib injury,
Martin remained back in New York with a thigh bruise. Leon Johnson
had his usual versatile offensive day, including 56 yards on 13
carries. But the Jets couldn't get the ball often enough.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Parcells had decided to bench Foley late in the
third quarter, Foley had tossed two interceptions, fumbled once and
completed only 5 of 15 passes for 76 yards. The Jets got only a
field goal during his two-plus quarters.
</P>
<P>
   Once again Foley failed to execute a start-to-finish victory. He
is now 1-7 as a starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   The triumph gave the Rams (2-3) to their first home victory
after eight straight losses dating to last season.
</P>
<P>
   Amp Lee, playing a prominent role at running back because of
injuries to other players, ran for two touchdowns, St. Louis played
turnover-free ball and its quarterback, Tony Banks was 18 for 24
for 171 yards and a touchdown with 15-straight completions in one
stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, normally the Rams' third-down back, got every-down status
after Robert Holcombe strained his Achilles' tendon and Jerald
Moore hurt his shoulder, even though both eventually returned. Lee
finished with 53 yards on 9 carries, plus 6 catches for 62 yards.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets, the league's third-best yardage producers coming in to
the game, couldn't generate much of anything after losing the ball
three times in the first half.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams gained a 17-3 lead, with all their scores coming
following Jets' turnovers. Until those moments, the crowd at Trans
World Dome made little noise. But sound is magnified here,
especially when cannons reverberate after a Rams' score.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't much noise when the Jets opened the scoring on John
Hall's 54-yard field goal in the first quarter. Even that shot
wasn't solely a result of the Jets' offense. The Jets were going to
punt on fourth down, but benefited from an offside penalty that
moved the ball 5 yards closer.
</P>
<P>
   From there, Hall kicked the longest field goal anyone has ever
kicked against the Rams franchise. In his two-season career Hall
has attempted six field goals from the 50 to the 59 and has
converted five of them.
</P>
<P>
   But he never got another chance the rest of the half, from any
distance.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the quarter, Foley was hit by Todd Lyght at the Jets'
14, fumbled and lost the ball to Mike Jones. Foley missed a tackle,
and Jones was stopped at the Jets' 7 by Johnson. Banks soon hit
Derrick Harris on a 7-yard scoring pass.
</P>
<P>
   Foley got the Jets back down to the St. Louis 27. He was looking
for Wayne Chrebet in the end zone, but Kevin Carter tipped the pass
and it was picked off by Eric Hill. A face-mask penalty by Chrebet
was tacked on. The turnover led to a 52-yard field goal by Jeff
Wilkins.
</P>
<P>
   Even a positive moment for the Jets was turned into a negative
before halftime. Banks, running, was hit and fumbled. Mo Lewis
retrieved it. He did not appear to have solid possession, though.
He attempted to run, was hit and lost the ball on the Rams' 39.
From there St. Louis began a drive that ended with Lee's 1-yard
scoring run.
</P>
<P>
   The Rams finally got points they created on their own with a
third-quarter drive that led to a 30-yard Wilkins field goal and a
20-3 lead. Within minutes, though, another interception of Foley,
by Dexter McCleon, positioned yet another score _ and signaled the
end, for Sunday at any rate, of Foley. The Rams turned that
interception into a 34-yard field goal and a 23-3 edge.
</P>
<P>
   These were hardly the Jets of the previous two games, when
Martin generated 100-yard rushing performances and Testaverde
benefited by having defenses not knowing whether to be aggressive
or passive.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde, who came in late in the third quarter, didn't do
much better, going 9 of 18 for 96 yards and another big turnover.
Desperate to get back into the game on his first drive, the Jets
tried a pitch back, Johnson to Testaverde. But before the
quarterback could find a receiver he was hit by two Rams and lost
the ball, which was recovered by D'Marco Farr, who returned it 16
yards to the Jets' 11. This, one, too, was converted into a score
as Lee eventually went over from 2 yards out early in the final
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   But on the following kickoff, Glenn returned the ball 55 yards,
giving the Jets a rare glimpse of life in Rams' territory.
Testaverde (9 for 18 for 96 yards) and Johnson took advantage of
the look as they teamed up on a 16-yard touchdown pass. &QL;

AFTER BEATING OF GAY MAN, TOWN LOOKS AT ITS ATTITUDES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)  (js) 
 By JAMES BROOKE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo._ As a gay college student lay hospitalized in
critical condition after a severe beating here, this small city,
which bills itself as ``Wyoming's hometown,'' wrestled with its
attitudes towards gay men.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, at the University of Wyoming's annual homecoming
parade, ``Pistol Pete'' and his uniformed brass band were
overshadowed by a larger group of marchers _ 450 people, many
wearing yellow armbands and carrying signs in support of the
21-year-old student, Matthew Shepard, who suffered severe head
injuries in the attack last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hate is not a Small Town Value _ No to Violence and Evil,''
read one sign, as watchers applauded. With passersby spontaneously
joining the protest group, two women held another sign that read,
``No Hate Crimes in Wyoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Two candlelight vigils were held Sunday night at churches near
the campus. At the Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo.,
where Shepard's health continued to deteriorate, the hospital has
received so many flowers that nurses have started to distribute
bouquets to other patients. A vigil at the hospital on Saturday
evening drew about 500 people.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in the Equality State,'' Shannon Rexroat wrote Friday
in a special edition of the Branding Iron, the campus newspaper.
Referring to Wyoming's pioneer heritage as the first state to grant
women the right to vote, Ms. Rexroat, the campus newspaper's editor
added: ``That means nothing to me anymore. We live in a state where
a young man was brutally beaten because he is gay.''
</P>
<P>
   But others recalled another side of ``Wyoming's hometown,''which
has a population of more than 26,000. Jamie Lewis, another editor,
said that on Friday he was handing out copies of the special
edition when a passerby backed away from him and used an anti-gay
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's brutal assault bubbled out of an ongoing climate of
hostility toward gay men and lesbians, leaders of the local
Unitarian church said in a letter published Sunday in the city's
newspaper, The Laramie Daily Boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   ``This incident was atypical in its brutality, but not in its
underlying motive,'' wrote Jeffrey Lockwood and Stephen Johnson.
Gay people in Laramie, they wrote, ``are frequently assaulted with
derision, intolerance, insult and hostility _ if not guns and
ropes.''
</P>
<P>
   Ric Turley, who dropped out of college here after one year in
the 1970s, recalled driving here to see his family for Christmas in
1993 and seeing a vandalized billboard on the main highway. Under a
brace of pistols, an advertising appeal for a state history museum
had been changed, he said, from ``Shoot a Day or Two,'' to ``Shoot
a Gay or Two.''
</P>
<P>
   Turley, who is gay and said he only came out after he had left
Wyoming, said that he immediately complained to the museum. But
returning a month later, he found the message had not been erased.
After complaining to the museum for a second time, he said he took
a can of black spray paint and blotted out the word ``gay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was this kind of complacency and apathy that allowed this
to happen,'' he said of the beating in which two local men have
been charged, Russell Henderson and Aaron McKinney.
</P>
<P>
   According to the local police and prosecutors, the two men lured
Shepard out of a bar by saying they were gay. Then, the Laramie
police say, the pair kidnapped Shepard, pistol-whipped him with a
.357 Magnum and left him tied to a ranch fence for 18 hours until a
passing bicyclist spotted Shepard, who was unconscious.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Sunday, the Laramie police said that McKinney had been
arrested on Thursday at the same hospital in Fort Collins where
Shepard was being treated. McKinney was being treated for a
``minor'' skull fracture unrelated to the fracas with Shepard, said
Ben Fritzen, a Laramie police detective.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has condemned the attack, saying on Saturday,
``I was deeply grieved by the act of violence perpetrated against
Matthew Shepard.'' Clinton urged Congress to pass the federal Hate
Crimes Prevention Act, saying, ``There is nothing more important to
the future of this country than our standing together against
intolerance, prejudice and violent bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming is one of 10 states that does not have a hate crime law.
The latest attempt died in the state Legislature in Cheyenne in
February. On Saturday, Wyoming's governor, Jim Geringer, said he
was ``outraged and sickened'' by the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Laramie, McKinney's father, Bill, also condemned the
attack. His pickup truck was apparently used in the kidnapping. But
he also complained about the massive attention by the national
media.
</P>
<P>
   The national press ``blew it totally out of proportion because
it involved a homosexual,'' McKinney told The Denver Post. `Had
this been a heterosexual these two boys decided to take out and
rob, this never would have made the national news.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard grew up in Casper until his sophomore year in high
school, when his father, an oil rig safety engineer, was
transferred to Saudi Arabia. The young man completed high school at
a boarding school in Lugano, Switzerland, where he learned Italian
and German.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, his parents, Dennis and Judy Shepard, released a
statement from Fort Collins thanking ``the American public for
their kind thoughts about Matthew.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a trusting person who takes everybody at face value and
he does not see the bad side of anyone,'' the Shepards wrote. ``He
has always strongly felt that all people are the same, regardless
of their sexual preference, race or religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Noting that their son was born prematurely and that his ``life
has often been a struggle,'' they added, ``He is physically short
in stature, but we believe he is a giant when it comes to
respecting the worth of others.''

FBI TO OPEN NATIONAL DNA DATA BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: The 2ndTAKE will move within 15 minutes.) 
(sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a computer at a secret location, the FBI will open a national
DNA data base on Tuesday that advocates say could significantly
reduce rape and other crimes by helping to catch repeat offenders
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The data base, with a new generation of forensic DNA techniques,
promises to be so efficient that some civil libertarians fear it
will be expanded from people convicted of crimes to include almost
everyone, giving the government inordinate investigative powers
over citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The national DNA data base consists of 50 data bases run by the
states but unified by common test procedures and software designed
by the FBI. As of Tuesday, it will be possible to compare a DNA
sample from a suspect or crime scene in one state with all others
in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The national data base has been nearly a decade in the making.
The final pieces fell into place in June when Rhode Island became
the last state to set up a DNA data base.
</P>
<P>
   But the system still faces many unresolved issues, which are
likely to play out according to the reaction from the public and
the courts. One such issue is what types of offenders should be
included. Another is whether the mass screening of suspects' DNA
will prove constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, the chemical that embodies a person's genetic programming,
can be found almost everywhere. People shed a constant torrent of
dead skin cells. Criminals leave blood when breaking and entering;
they shed hair and skin cells in fights, deposit saliva on glasses
and leave sweat stains in head bands. From only a few cells in such
sources, enough DNA can be extracted to identify the owner. A DNA
database of sufficient size could presumably help solve many
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-fighting potential of DNA data bases is becoming
evident from the experiences of Britain, which started earlier and
has had fewer administrative and constitutional hurdles to
overcome. The data base there initially focused on sex offenses but
has spread to include burglaries and car theft because of the high
number of DNA matches that police forces were obtaining. Moreover,
there was considerable crossover at least in Britain, among
different kinds of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who commit serious crime very often have convictions
for petty crime in their history, so if you could get them on the
data base early you may prevent serious crime,'' said David
Werrett, manager of the DNA data base for England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The English DNA data base includes entries from crime scenes and
from everyone convicted of a crime, as well as from suspects in
unresolved cases. Since the system's debut in 1995, it has matched
28,000 people to crime scenes and has made 6,000 links between
crime scenes. The data base now holds 360,000 entries and Werrett
said he expected it would eventually include one third of all
English men between 16 and 30, the principal ages for committing
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Werrett said that the data base has grown because police forces
in England, which pay $55 for a DNA analysis, are finding it cost
effective. Recently the Police Superintendents Association called
for the entire population to be DNA tested.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic use of DNA in the United States is unlikely to go as
fast or as far as in Britain.

   NEW YORK _
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   On a warm Sunday afternoon, my husband, Richard, and I, both
native New Yorkers, were entertaining my cousin Kate and her
boyfriend, Paul, from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the afternoon, after trekking around the city, we
decided to enjoy the view and some refreshments from the top of the
World Trade Center. We were stopped by the lobby elevator
attendant, who said we couldn't go up because Kate was wearing
sneakers, and no sneakers were allowed after 4 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   He also informed us that there was a ``real cheap'' shoe store
in the mall just outside the lobby. We went searching, but the
cheapest shoes we could find were $50. OK, we thought, we'll try
the observation deck. Admission for four (without drinks) was $48.
We were stymied.
</P>
<P>
   Then Paul had a brilliant idea. We left Kate in the lobby while
the rest of us went up to the bar at Windows on the World. After
being seated at a table with a spectacular view, we slipped my
shoes into Paul's knapsack. My long, flowing pants covered my bare
feet, not that anyone was looking.
</P>
<P>
   Paul took my shoes down to Kate. The Foot Police never noticed
that the same shoes walked by him twice. The tab for the view,
drinks and hors d'oeuvres for four: $62.
</P>

   George Banks' daughter, Karen, a high school sophomore, was
preparing for a world history test, and her father offered to help
her study. ``No thanks, Dad,'' she said. ``Your history was a long
time ago. Newer things have happened that you're not aware of.''
</P>
<P>
   GO AHEAD AND SPREAD IT
</P>
<P>
   How much easier it would be

<P>
   Robert J. Hubsmith enjoyed this switch on the usual _ a
handwritten sign at a Duracell battery display in a Home Depot
store: TOYS NOT INCLUDED.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those days. Martin Hason's first appointment was
at 7:30 a.m., and by 9 a.m. he was an hour behind schedule. He
pushed and shoved through the morning, and by early afternoon was
at his desk with three calls to return.
</P>
<P>
   He was on one of them when call-waiting beeped. He picked up. An
unfamiliar caller with a cheery voice introduced himself as a
broker for an investment firm. The caller went on, ``I'd like to
offer you an outstanding issue of municipal ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry, I'm busy,'' Hason said, and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Hason answered the phone and heard the same voice,
but this time the caller was a little less cheery. ``I don't have
time for you,'' the caller said _ and clicked off.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: A recent matinee of ``Sideman.''
</P>
<P>
   The time: Intermission.
</P>
<P>
   The players: Richard W. Barr, seated beside one matron and in
front of another.
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: (sitting behind Barr and calling out to Woman No.
2, seated beside him) ``Marge, is that you?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Helen, where were you? I waited in the lobby
until the last minute.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``There were heavy rains out my way and I barely
made it here on time.''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 2: ``Why did you wait until now to speak to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Woman No. 1: ``I didn't recognize you. You've changed your hair.
It was only when I saw your rings as you were applauding at the end
of the act that I realized it was you.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   My friend Gary Goldsmith came home very late from work and
realized that his wallet was missing. After searching everywhere,
including the grocery store he had just come from, he went to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Early the next morning, his phone rang. A voice asked, ``Mr.
Goldsmith, did you lose something?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You found my wallet?'' Gary responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look outside your door,'' the voice said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gary could say, ``I'd like to give you a reward,'' the
voice continued: ``Don't worry about a reward. I've helped myself
to one.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside his door, Gary found his wallet, neatly wrapped, with
his credit cards and license intact. But the wallet was $173
lighter.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Two elderly gentlemen, obviously friends, were on a crosstown
bus, sitting near Hy Farber. They began discussing their health
problems, and one went into great detail about his bout with the
flu.
</P>
<P>
   The other man commented that it was fortunate that the friend
had been attended to by a doctor. ``With those symptoms, a person
could die young,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His friend's answer was succinct: ``It's too late for me to die
young.''
</P>
<P>
   Cynthia Pader saw a pedestal she liked in the window of an
antiques store on Madison Avenue. She ran into the store and asked
the salesman if the pedestal was real marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want it, it's real marble,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Continental Airlines flight from Paris last month was over the
Atlantic when one engine had to be shut off. The pilot reversed
course and headed toward Shannon Airport in Ireland, one and a half
hours away.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement of the change in destination, a few
passengers were extremely upset.
</P>
<P>
   While the cabin crew started going through the manuals to start
the required procedures, one of the flight attendants had her own
method of calming passengers. Among the people in her vicinity was
Dr. David A. Loomar, who heard her announce loudly and in no
uncertain terms: ``This plane is going to be fine. I'm getting
married in a couple of months, I am still a virgin, and I have no
intention of dying before I have sex!''
</P>
<P>
   She was absolutely right _ the plane was fine and, said Loomar,
``I would love to be a guest at that wedding.''
</P>
<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   As a volunteer who visits the elderly in their homes to help
with their daily activities, I'm often regaled with fascinating
stories of their earlier lives.
</P>
<P>
   Recently one of my elderly friends told me that when she worked
as a personal secretary to a woman who had been Greta Garbo's
live-in companion for 10 years, she discovered numerous bank
passbooks belonging to Ms. Garbo. All of the accounts contained
single deposit entries of varying amounts but no subsequent
activities.
</P>
<P>
   When she inquired about these inactive Garbo bank accounts, she
was told that they had all been opened during the era when banks
offered new customers gifts like toasters, irons and cutlery.

ANALYSIS: GONE ARE POLITICAL WISE MEN AND THE CULTURE THAT BRED
THEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many weeks now, as the storm clouds of impeachment have
gathered on Bill Clinton's horizon, those who value his presidency
or fear the political trauma of removing him from office have been
looking for an honest broker who could cut a deal between the White
House and Republicans in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   So far, they have utterly failed to find one. Honest brokers are
in short supply these days.
</P>
<P>
   The perfect man for the job in days gone by _ on most days, as a
matter of fact, in the last half-century _ would have been Clark
Clifford, who died on Saturday at age 91. Clifford's reputation was
marred in his final years by his involvement in the collapse of the
Bank of Credit and Commerce International and the financial
reverses suffered by one of his law office's clients, the late
Pamela Harriman, but whatever his failings in business, nobody
questioned his political skills.
</P>
<P>
   He was the man, after all, who concluded early in 1948 that his
fellow Missourian, Harry S. Truman, had a far better chance than
anyone thought to defeat Thomas E. Dewey for president. He set out
his ideas on how to do it in a memorandum that became almost as
famous in political circles as George F. Kennan's roughly
contemporaneous memorandum from Moscow on Soviet containment became
among diplomats.
</P>
<P>
   So great was his reputation for sound advice and unlimited
access that Democratic presidents from Truman to Kennedy to Johnson
to Carter turned to him when they got into tight spots. He made
something of a career, as the columnist James Reston once said, of
rescuing U.S. leaders from disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford, who wrote the legislation establishing the CIA, was
almost the last survivor of the remarkable generation of men who
helped build the post-war world, a group that included Dean
Acheson, John J. McCloy, Charles F. Bohlen and Robert A. Lovett.
Only Kennan and Paul Nitze remain from that original band of Cold
War policy-makers.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Clinton needed Clifford or someone like him, he had
exhausted his political capital. He was too old and sick to help.
And he never really had any progeny as indispensable men in the
corridors of power.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons for that. For one thing, Clifford and the
other Wise Men were not always wise. Some of them helped steer the
United States into the morass of the Vietnam War, though some of
them, notably Clifford, helped to steer it back out again. Their
aura of infallibility began cracking when the national aura of
invulnerability began to crack.
</P>
<P>
   The very cohesion that helped them mold a bipartisan foreign
policy prompted them to mute their voices when the policy did not
work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Washington political culture has changed
radically since the heyday of Clifford and his friends. Gone are
the times when the president, a few senators and House members, a
few Cabinet members, a few presidential intimates and a few
journalists were the only people who mattered.
</P>
<P>
   Those were the perfect circumstances for a Clark Clifford. He
could meet discreetly with the heavy hitters, exuding confidence,
perfectly turned out in one of his beautiful double-breasted suits,
tie tightly knotted, every wavy hair in place. He could fold his
fingers into a little tent and spin out his advice in that mellow
Midwestern baritone and soon you would come on board.
</P>
<P>
   Now nobody really controls Congress. Lawmakers are subject to
far more rapid, far more direct influence from the public, through
both organized and spontaneous campaigns by fax, phone and e-mail.
Party discipline counts for much less. Every issue requires the
building of new coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the kind of bipartisanship that prevailed during
World War II and the Cold War has all but vanished, as Thursday's
party-line vote on impeachment hearings showed.
</P>
<P>
   Much of today's business in the capital is carried on in public.
Hearings and congressional sessions are televised, as are White
House briefings and sometimes even photo opportunities. In a sense,
television has become the national political forum. One House
member said during the impeachment debate that he was going to save
most of his remarks for the Larry King program that evening.
</P>
<P>
   After the cultural revolution of the 1960s, another consequence
of the Vietnam War, people demand more information about what
happens in Washington. They devour stories about politicians'
private lives, even as they bemoan the cult of celebrity that has
infected Washington in the last decade or so.
</P>
<P>
   In this new world, working behind the scenes is difficult. Even
when he served as secretary of defense, Clifford shunned the
spotlight. But today's presidential counselors rapidly become
public figures, whether on television, like Clinton's attack dog,
James Carville, or on the golf course and at Georgetown soirees,
like Vernon E. Jordan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington lawyer Lloyd N. Cutler, who served presidents
Carter and Clinton as counsel, is probably Clifford's closest
counterpart in present-day Washington _ a Democratic insider with
the reputation for calm, cogent thinking, the head of one of the
city's best law firms, a man with a million-dollar Rolodex. At 81,
he is certainly experienced enough, as are other senior Democrats
like former Sen. Sam Nunn and Robert Strauss, the former party
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   But power is diffused now. It is also far more multicultural
than in the era of the old all-white, all-male, all-WASP
Establishment; if it were not, Jordan, who is black, would not have
ascended to the right hand of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the old Cold War imperatives of pulling together,
closing ranks and keeping one's eye on the enemy have disappeared.
Not even Lloyd Cutler, Bob Strauss or Sam Nunn, not even if they
tried their hardest, has the capacity to make Kosovo and the
international monetary crisis seem as compelling an argument for
national unity as containing the Soviet Union _ at least not yet.

EDITORIAL: A WIN-WIN ON HOUSING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress, the new
majority has struggled with the Clinton administration over the
issue of low-income housing. Last week the two sides came together
and passed a measure that blends conservative and liberal concerns.
It is a major achievement for both the administration and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans have long wanted to give low-income working people a
greater share of subsidized housing, while Democrats wanted to
favor the poorest of the poor, who have no resources to obtain
shelter at market rates.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides had a point. Housing projects need to include stable
families with working adults who can serve as role models for other
residents. When homelessness exploded in the 1980s, too many
apartments in some projects were turned over to extremely indigent
families, tipping the community balance.
</P>
<P>
   But the Republicans' proposed solutions went too far. One
particularly bad idea was to change the income mix eligible for
rent-subsidy vouchers, a program that does not suffer from the same
problems as traditional housing projects. Unlike public housing
residents, who live in a closed community, people who receive the
vouchers are dispersed throughout the private housing market.
</P>
<P>
   To the delight of housing advocates, the final bill creates
90,000 much-needed new vouchers and requires that 75 percent go to
the poorest of the poor. The bill relaxes some of the income limits
for housing projects to make room for more of the working poor,
although many units must still be reserved for the very poor.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, 40 percent of project residents would have to
have incomes at or below $15,000, but other residents would be able
to make up to $40,150.
</P>
<P>
   Other compromises were equally sensible. The Republicans got
concessions aimed at rewarding effort, including very modest
community service requirements. Democrats got additional controls
to make sure that allowing more high-income families does not lead
to racial or economic segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The bill bows to the animal lobby's demand that all public
housing residents be allowed to keep animals, but officials in
cities like New York, where vicious dogs have long terrorized
residents of some large projects, will now apparently be able to
impose reasonable restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo and Rep. Rick Lazio of Long
Island, N.Y., the Republican point man on housing issues, have
represented two poles in this long struggle. This bill is a win for
both men. Cuomo and his predecessor Henry Cisneros have given what
was known as the federal government's worst-run bureaucracy some
credibility with Congress. Lazio has finally won his long battle to
make public housing a bipartisan issue.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans will always have an ideological objection
to federal housing subsidies, Lazio has always argued that many
others can be brought around, once they are convinced that the
system is well run and aimed at encouraging self-sufficiency. We
believe he is right, and this bill may be a big step in that
direction.

 UNDATED: in Britain.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Their system makes a tremendous amount of sense the way they
approach it, but in the United States we have a different
perspective on privacy and on the extent to which we would be
willing to depend on a data base,'' said Christopher Asplen,
executive director of the national Commission on the Future of DNA
Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One major privacy safeguard in the FBI's system is that only a
minute fraction of a person's genetic endowment becomes part of the
data base. Under a new DNA profiling system known as STR's, for
short tandem repeats, a person's DNA is tested at 13 specific sites
at which a short length of DNA is repeated in a kind of stutter.
The number of repeats is highly variable from one person to
another, so that measuring the number of repeats at the 13
designated sites gives a way of identifying each individual with a
probability of one in several billion.
</P>
<P>
   The blood or other samples donated by individuals are retained
by the states in collections known as DNA banks. All that goes into
the computerized DNA data bases is the set of 13 numbers from the
STR measurements. Only identifying information, and nothing about a
person's health or appearance, can be divined from the STR's.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the DNA data base is permitted only for law
enforcement purposes, with a $100,000 fine for unauthorized
disclosures. No known breaches of the system have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One major unresolved issue is that of the types of offenders
from whom DNA profiles should be taken. All states require people
convicted of serious sexual offenses to donate blood samples, but
differ on requiring samples from other groups such as people
convicted of violent felonies, juvenile offenders and parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Virginia, Wyoming, New Mexico and Alabama _
require all people convicted of a felony to provide samples for DNA
profiling. Louisiana allows DNA to be taken from people merely
arrested in a crime, a practice that has not been tested in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   State laws establishing DNA data bases have been challenged in
13 jurisdictions and have been upheld in all but one, in
Massachusetts. Some states have revised their original legislation
to add offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the trend is that 10 years from now all felonies will
be covered,'' said M. Dawn Herkenham, chief of the FBI's Forensic
Science Systems Unit in Washington. ``We recommend that all violent
felonies, burglaries, juveniles and retroactivity for people on
parole be included.''
</P>
<P>
   From his office in Birmingham, England, last week, Werrett said,
``Today we have issued matches on three murders, five rapes, nine
serious robberies, two abductions and two violent burglaries.''
</P>
<P>
   No state DNA data base has acquired the critical mass to furnish
such a hit rate. Many state laboratories are understaffed and have
large backlogs of DNA samples to analyze. The backlogs are
particularly worrisome in the case of rapes where specimens may lie
unanalyzed while the rapist assaults more victims. ``People may be
appalled to know how many rape suspect kits are out there
untouched,'' Ms. Herkenham of the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hit ratio depends on whether we can go back and examine
all the evidence that comes in the door,'' said Dr. Barry Duceman,
director of biological science in the New York State Police
Forensic Investigation Center in Albany. ``We are trying to address
a crushing case backlog and to get the technology on line _ you'd
be hard pressed to say we are overstaffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The case backlog problem is compounded because state
laboratories are switching to the STR method of DNA profiling from
an older method of analysis called RFLP (for restriction fragment
length polymorphism). All the samples analyzed by RFLP must be
redone by STR if they are to be searchable in the new data base.
</P>
<P>
   When these teething problems are overcome, many experts believe
that the state and national DNA data base systems may have a
significant effect, particularly in reducing crimes like rape that
often involve repeat offenders. By scoring a ``cold hit'' between
crime scene data and a person, DNA data bases can be particularly
effective in solving cases with no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get that infrastructure in place and start getting
those hits, the benefits will lead to higher utilization,'' Asplen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But like other experts involved with DNA testing, he expressed
concern that DNA profiling be developed in a publicly acceptable
way. ``The public does need to have a trust level with this and be
assured that law enforcement is not going to abuse this powerful
tool,'' he said. One practice likely to raise eyebrows, if not
hackles, is mass screening, which is widely used in the United
Kingdom but not yet commonplace here.
</P>
<P>
   In high profile crime cases, police in Britain often ask, and
can require, all members of a town or building to give DNA samples
so as to prove themselves guiltless and help narrow the search for
the culprit. The National Commission on the Future of DNA Testing
is examining under what circumstances the donation of samples can
be considered voluntary. In an office, where employees who declined
to donate a sample might be fired, a police request for DNA might
be coercive.
</P>
<P>
   A future use of DNA testing is that of phenotypic analysis. It
will soon be technically possible to infer from the genes in a
person's DNA many probable aspects of their appearance, such as
hair, skin and eye color. Werrett said the main problem with such
predictions would lie in training police to understand their
probabilistic nature: told there is a 90 percent chance that the
suspect has red hair, investigators should not ignore the 10
percent chance that he does not.
</P>
<P>
   DNA reveals so much about a person that behavioral geneticists
might wish to search through state data banks for genetic variants
linked to criminal behavior. Most states say their DNA data banks
can be accessed only for law enforcement purposes, like the data
bases. But Alabama authorizes the use of its samples for
``educational research or medical research or development,'' an
apparent invitation to genetic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   An impending issue is whether states should retain their DNA
samples once the information has been entered into the DNA data
base. Forensic managers like to retain samples as a hedge against
changing technology. Others say the DNA sample banks create an
opportunity for abuse, and that if there is another change in
technology the government should just rebuild its data base from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Because DNA can be found at so many crime scenes, DNA data bases
promise to be powerful aids in catching criminals. But what thrills
forensic experts tends to chill civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA data base started out with pariahs _ the sex offenders
_ but has already been enlarged to include other felons and will
probably be extended to include everyone, giving elites the power
to control `unruly' citizens,'' said Philip Bereano a professor of
technology and public policy at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Juengst, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland and a member of the FBI's DNA Advisory
Board, said the original policy in setting up the DNA data base was
that it was ``suitable only for our most serious category of
criminals,'' and that it would be a breach of that policy to expand
its scope.
</P>
<P>
   The risks raised by Bereano are worth watching, Juengst said,
``but as a society we have to learn how to control powerful tools
of all kinds, like nuclear power. I don't see it as an endless
slippery slope.''

NATO MILITARY BUILDUP ACCOMPANIES TALKS WITH YUGOSLAV LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also KOSOVO-SERB-OPPOSITION) 
(js) 
 By JANE PERLEZ    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ As U.S. bombers landed in Britain for a
buildup of NATO forces ready to strike against Slobodan Milosevic,
Richard Holbrooke, the U.S. envoy, Sunday pressed the Yugoslav
leader for a sixth day to back down in his confrontation with the
West over Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Milosevic is expected to reach its peak on
Monday when the 16 representatives to NATO in Brussels are
scheduled to approve an activation order, authorizing the use of
air strikes against Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Once the activation order is approved, the supreme allied
commander of NATO, Gen. Wesley Clark of the United States, can
order the deployment of forces at any time.
</P>
<P>
   As NATO raised the stakes against Milosevic, a senior Russian
military official broached the possibility that Moscow would assist
Serbia if it is hit by NATO air strikes. The Russian government, a
traditional ally of Serbia because of common Orthodox and Slavic
roots, called its ambassador to Brussels and its NATO
representative back to Moscow over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The head of Russia's Defense Ministry's department for
international cooperation, Gen. Leonid Ivashov, said Russia would
have the right to a ``full-scale military cooperation'' with Serbia
if NATO attacked.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major sticking points in the talks between Holbrooke
and Milosevic appeared to be winning the Yugoslav leader's
agreement to an international force in the province of Kosovo,
where Serbian forces have waged a brutal offensive against
ethnic-Albanian separatists.
</P>
<P>
   Before meeting Milosevic on Sunday morning, Holbrooke said he
was trying to get him to agree to a ``fully verifiable compliance
system'' as an alternative to NATO strikes.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 10 hours of talks, Holbrooke declined to talk to
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   He spent considerable time in between his two sessions with
Milosevic talking by telephone to Washington, apparently sorting
through possibilities for a monitoring force in Kosovo that would
be tough enough for the West but still acceptable to the Yugoslav
leader.
</P>
<P>
   The West has stressed that it doubts Milosevic's pledges about
withdrawing troops and storing heavy weapons and says an
international force is required to check his compliance.
</P>
<P>
   But the composition of the force _ civilian or military, or a
mixture of the two; European or American, or a combination _ still
appeared to be a matter of discussion, not only with Milosevic but
also within the Western alliance.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration's national security adviser, Sandy
Berger, said in an interview on CNN that ``we have no plans for
United States combat forces'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He added, however, that ``the verification mission on the
ground'' in Kosovo would consist largely of civilian monitors with
``some NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   A NATO official said in Brussels on Sunday that Milosevic had
made plain in his talks with Holbrooke that he did not want NATO
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav leader has suggested that he would agree to about
1,600 unarmed civilian monitors from the 29-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe, which has monitored progress
toward peace and organized elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials have said an unarmed international
presence would not be sufficiently serious to deal with the
Yugoslav Army and units of the Serbian Interior Ministry's police
in Kosovo, which Milosevic has ruled repressively since stripping
the ethnic-Albanian majority there of virtual autonomy in 1989.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Washington was still working on ``what they can afford
politically'' to contribute to a monitoring mission, the NATO
official said. Washington would like Europe to take the lead, but
is aware that the less the Americans contribute to the mission, the
more reluctant the Europeans would be, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military commanders have drafted plans for a series of
options in Kosovo, including a ground force that would enforce a
ceasefire. Last week, Secretary of Defense William Cohen said he
opposed using U.S. troops in such a force, and it remains unclear
whether the military operation force would come under the command
of NATO or of some other international or European organization.
Pentagon officials said Sunday that the military deployment
Holbrooke was discussing in his weekend meetings was much smaller
than a top option of 26,000 mostly NATO troops.
</P>
<P>
   It was also envisioned, the NATO official said, that the
international mission in Kosovo could be involved in assisting
relief agencies helping refugees get through the coming winter.
</P>
<P>
   About 250,000 ethnic Albanians have fled their homes in the face
of a Serbian offensive in the last three months. Many of those
refugees are afraid to return to their villages because of the
continuing presence of the police.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on Milosevic seemed carefully orchestrated Sunday,
as six A-10 Thunderbird jet fighters flew from Germany to Aviano
Air Base in Italy and six B52 bombers landed at Fairford base in
Britain. The landings were widely televised, both in Serbia and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   The British foreign secretary, Robin Cook, who has been among
the staunchest European advocates of using force if Milosevic does
not meet Western demands, said Sunday that NATO unity was
``complete.'' If Holbrooke cannot produce results from Milosevic,
NATO will act, he said.
</P>
<P>
   On CNN, Berger had similar words: ``The ball is in Milosevic's
court. He can come into compliance or he can face NATO military
action.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a show of support that did not please Serbia or Russia,
the presidents of Bulgaria and Romania, both former Soviet-bloc
nations, said Sunday that they would make their air space available
for NATO planes involved in missions against Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   The departing Cabinet of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany was
scheduled to meet on Monday to approve participation in NATO
strikes, NATO officials said. Once Germany does that, the 16
representatives to NATO will meet to approve the activation order,
they said.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government remained mostly silent about the drama.
But in an effort to reassure the population that Serbia was not
without friends, state-controlled television has featured reports
in the last three nights that tell of Russia's support.
</P>
<P>
   Privately owned BK Television, often sympathetic to Milosevic,
aired a Russian television interview with the Russian foreign
Minister, Igor Ivanov, about Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In the rebroadcast here, Ivanov's statement that the Serbian
leadership was also responsible for the conflict in Kosovo _ along
with the ethnic Albanians _ was censored.

EDITORIAL: SPAIN JOINS THE MARCH TO PEACE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   The visit of the Irish republican leader Gerry Adams to Spain's
Basque country last week suggests that peace can be contagious.
</P>
<P>
   Adams' visit came three weeks after the Basque nationalist
terror group, ETA, for the first time announced an unconditional
and indefinite cease-fire. The ETA's apparent decision to pursue
its goal of independence for the Basque country through politics
alone, after a 30-year conflict that has killed 800 people, seems
in part inspired by Northern Ireland's peace effort. Now the
Spanish government should respond with conciliatory gestures to
create lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   Contacts between Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish
Republican Army, and ETA's political wing, Herri Batasuna, began a
dozen years ago, and members of the two organizations have visited
each other frequently. The turn toward politics was helped by the
ETA's recent military decline, and its drop in public support after
several recent brutal murders of popular Basque and Spanish
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   Basques were repressed under Spain's dictator, Gen. Francisco
Franco. Children, for example, were punished for speaking the
Basque language in school.
</P>
<P>
   Though democratic Spanish governments have resorted to terror
tactics to fight the ETA, they have also granted substantial
autonomy to the three-province region known as the Basque Country.
It has its own police, taxes, language and parliament, now led by a
nonviolent Basque nationalist party.
</P>
<P>
   Separatists, however, want a referendum on independence.
Although it is likely that nationalists would lose a referendum,
Madrid has never permitted one. Spain's constitution does not
provide for such votes, and Madrid is afraid of independence fever
spreading to Catalonia, another autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
   Spain is right to insist on its territorial integrity. But it
should not treat the ETA's cease-fire as unconditional surrender.
Now that the ETA apparently has renounced violence, Spain should
begin a real peace process _ including humanitarian gestures like
moving ETA prisoners, who are scattered throughout Spain, closer to
their families in the Basque country.
</P>
<P>
   It should also release the 23 Herri Batasuna leaders sentenced
last year to seven-year terms for showing a pro-ETA video on
television. Such moves will encourage the ETA to disarm, and help
prevent the rise of splinter groups.

 EDITORIAL: REGIONAL RETREAT ON CAR POOLING 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Oct. 12:
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey may soon be positioned to convert its car-pool lanes
on Interstate 287 into regular lanes, thanks to the footwork of
some members of its congressional delegation. They crafted
legislative language that would relieve New Jersey of the
obligation to repay Washington $140 million in federal money spent
building the lanes.
</P>
<P>
   This maneuver is the latest expression of growing opposition in
New Jersey and Long Island, N.Y., to special lanes for car pools _
an unfortunate attitude in a region of congested roads and poor air
quality. Instead, officials ought to be emulating cities elsewhere
that have found ways to get more out of underutilized car-pool
lanes.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego region provides a good example of how market
forces can cut congestion. On Interstate 15, an eight-mile stretch
is free for buses, vans and car pools of two or more. Solo
motorists pay a toll, generally from 50 cents to $4, pegged to the
time of day and congestion.
</P>
<P>
   By purchasing access to lanes that speed one's commute, these
motorists, along with car poolers, free up space in regular lanes.
Revenue from this creative pricing finances bus service in the I-15
corridor.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a long-range study or two, the New York region has
not begun to address managing demand in an equally imaginative
fashion. Instead, some politicians want to turn high-occupancy
vehicle, or HOV, lanes on the Long Island Expressway into
general-occupancy lanes. Jerseyans want to end HOV lanes on I-287
and I-80. None of this augurs well for a region that hopes to add
tens of thousands of jobs _ and thus commuters _ in the years
ahead.

EDITORIAL: PRAIRIE MONDAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   I found myself one recent Monday on a stretch of rural highway
in eastern Colorado at the time of morning when round bales lying
in the hayfields look like cattle grazing, and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   I was driving toward the sunrise, still only a premonition in
the distance. The horizon in that direction was a long, low
ridgeline dotted either with trees that resembled a band of clouds
or clouds that had affixed themselves with stems to earth or
possibly very large sheep moving single file with a grim and
stately purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Over the ridge and into the next swale rode the pickup, and
there I saw a small corral with four horses, all of them looking
intently _ wishfully, I suspect _ at the kitchen light that had
just been switched on in a dark ranch house across the barnyard.
</P>
<P>
   On a fence post near the road sat a red-tailed hawk,
surprisingly bulbous. The rising light caught in his eye, and to me
he looked dour, hungry for a diet less rich in rodents, a
palate-cleansing carrot perhaps or a plate of watercress.
</P>
<P>
   I've always loved the crescendo Monday brings, but I've always
thought of it in strictly urban terms. By the time darkness has
begun to wear away on a New York Monday morning, the city has
rumbled to life, shaking off Sunday like a distant childhood. Soon
the streets are filled with people, some of whom look as though
their coattails had caught in the city's gears and dragged them
headlong from their beds. Millions of weekday morning habits
iterate themselves anew, yet even the familiarity of it all seems
somehow fresh.
</P>
<P>
   But in deep country, near, say, Last Chance, Colo., the week
evolves more slowly. Monday's chores look much like Sunday's. The
headlong rush to get kids off to school is no different on the
Colorado plains from anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   But once the school bus has come and gone, once the high school
kids have driven themselves off to class in a neighboring town,
silence falls over the highway again. The low angle of the sun
seems to give every object it strikes a higher profile. Its light
throws the long shadow of a pickup and horse trailer into the far
ditch, where the driver waves to himself.
</P>
<P>
   On yet another fence post, another hawk preens, and on the
unplowed side of the road antelope move stiffly up a ridge and out
of sight. Then the highway is still, except for the wind, and what
day of the week it is is anybody's guess until the next vehicle
passes, when, for a moment _ in the presence of a service truck or
a postal carrier or a delivery van _ Monday reappears.

RANKINGS TAKE LEFT TURN AFTER NEBRASKA LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RON DICKER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Toledo and Cade McNown doth protest too much.
</P>
<P>
   For all the one-game-at-a-time rhetoric from UCLA's coach and
quarterback, they would have difficulty ignoring that the football
cosmos shifted dramatically toward the West Coast this past
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins (4-0 overall, 2-0 Pacific 10) have been winning
impressively but needed outside help for a chance at the national
championship. They got it on Saturday when Nebraska lost. Those two
words had not been uttered in 19 games.
</P>
<P>
   So UCLA, a 52-28 winner over Arizona, jumped to second in the
Associated Press and USA Today/CNN polls and in the New York Times
computer ranking, behind No. 1 Ohio State. It is the highest
ranking since 1988 for the Bruins, who in 1954 tied with the
Buckeyes for their only national title.
</P>
<P>
   At least one Bruin was excited. Running back Keith Brown, who
ran for 91 yards and two touchdowns, was expecting to return to the
state of Arizona for the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 4. ``Whether or not
we're No. 1, we're still going to play Ohio State in the Fiesta
Bowl if we keep winning like this,'' Brown said, ``so we'll be No.
1 once we win that game.''
</P>
<P>
   Toledo said: ``That's the farthest thing from my mind at this
point. Next week, we've got a talented Oregon team coming to our
house.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ducks, behind Akili Smith, the nation's leading passer, are
5-0 (2-0 Pacific-10) after defeating Washington State, 51-29. That
sets up the only battle of the unbeatens on Saturday at the Rose
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   True, the season is barely to the midway point. But who would
have thought that the Ducks (ranked seventh by the Times computer
and 11th by the AP) would be playing the Bruins in an important
game?
</P>
<P>
   That is how profoundly Nebraska's 28-21 defeat at Texas A&AMP;M
altered the rankings. Nebraska fell to eighth, and A&AMP;M rose to 10th
in the AP poll and to 12th in the Times ranking.
</P>
<P>
   The Cornhuskers have shared or won outright three of the last
four national championships. But they showed their vulnerability
the week before when they needed a goal-line stand to beat Oklahoma
State, and they showed their mortality against an A&AMP;M squad that
ran over them with 113 yards from Dante Hall and 110 yards from
Ja'Mar Toombs.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee made an emphatic statement to remain in the title
picture. The Volunteers blitzed Georgia's freshman quarterback,
Quincy Carter, into 14-of-38 passing with two interceptions, and
won easily, 22-3. Travis Stephens rushed for 107 yards and Travis
Henry added 53, easing concern about their running game after Jamal
Lewis tore up his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee can also take a heartening look at its schedule. The
Volunteers, who climbed a notch to third in the AP poll and moved
up three spots for fourth in the Times computer ranking, play four
of their remaining six games at home. Only one opponent, Arkansas,
is ranked in the Top 20.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State's schedule only gets tougher. The Wildcats, who won
unimpressively by 16-9 over Colorado (No. 19 AP, No. 7 Times),
still must play Oklahoma State, Nebraska and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas State (No. 4 AP, No. 3 Times) had been winning by an
average score of 62-5 playing weak teams. ``I don't pay that much
attention to margins of victory,'' Kansas State coach Bill Snyder
said after Saturday's game, ``but I don't think we played as well
as we're capable of playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind by 7 on Saturday night, Colorado had a chance for one
last drive until coach Rick Neuheisel and Bob Hauck, his special
teams coach, both inserted punt returners, giving the Buffaloes 12
men on the field. ``Our fans deserved 37 seconds to see what might
have happened,'' Neuheisel said.
</P>
<P>
   No such mistakes helped decide Ohio State's fate. The Buckeyes
put a clamp on their top ranking with a 41-0 pasting of Illinois.
Quarterback Joe Germaine threw for 307 yards and three touchdowns,
and the defense limited Illinois to 57 yards rushing.
</P>
<P>
   The Buckeyes do not have a Top 25 opponent left on their
schedule. One of the emerging teams they avoid is Wisconsin. The
Badgers ascended three rungs to ninth in the AP and the coaches'
poll and six spots to 13th in the Times computer after they
survived a record 83 throwing attempts by Purdue's Drew Brees in a
31-24 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Wisconsin coach Barry Alvarez took the UCLA approach to his
team's lofty rating. ``Are we ranked as high as we should be?'' he
asked. ``I don't know, and I don't really care.''

RUSSIAN BALLET SCHOOL: A PEEK AT RUSSIANS OF THE STANISLAVSKY
TROUPE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is more to ballet in Russia than its best-known companies,
the Bolshoi and the Kirov. The second major troupe in Moscow, after
the Bolshoi, is the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Ballet,
to make its U.S. debut on Dec. 19 at the John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   There was a glimpse of the Stanislavsky's leading dancers in the
New York area, thanks to a presentation of the Russian Ballet
School in Sea Cliff, N.Y., on Thursday night. Natalya Ledovskaya, a
strong, beautifully schooled ballerina who exudes a feminine
perfume, and Vladimir Kirillov, a superb partner with Romantic good
looks, appeared as guests in a showcase at the school.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Uralsky, a former dancer in the Bolshoi who was
artistic director of Ballet Iowa in Des Moines from 1991 to 1997,
and his wife, Irina Vassileni-Uralsky, also once in the Bolshoi,
invited Russian-trained dancers who lived either in the United
States or in Russia for this official opening of their school.
Uralsky also announced plans for a professional chamber ballet
troupe and introduced Olga Lepeshinskaya, whose career at the
Bolshoi from 1933 to 1963 made her one of Soviet ballet's
best-known stars.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lepeshinskaya, 86, came from Moscow as president of the
Russian Dance Association to declare the Uralsky School accredited.
</P>
<P>
   It is up to Americans to decide whether certificates make a
difference. But the dancers on view made a case for Russian
training.
</P>
<P>
   Ekaterina Shelkanova, formerly with the Kirov and now a soloist
in American Ballet Theater, danced the adagio from ``Le Corsaire''
with Alexander Kedrov, formerly of the Bolshoi and the Boston
Ballet (he also performed a solo from Uralsky's ``Petrouchka'').
Anatoly Barzov, dean of the dance division of the New University of
Humanities in Moscow presented three fresh and impeccably drilled
13-year-olds identified as Mariya, Yuliya and Andrei, in excerpts.
One was the pas de trois from Vassily Vainonen's ``Nutcracker,'' in
which Ms. Ledovskaya is to star.
</P>
<P>
   At this showing, she was seen in contemporary choreography,
including a duet from ``The Phantom Ball'' set to Chopin. Dmitri
Briantsev, the Stanislavsky's artistic director, is not strong on
transitions or organic flow. But Ms. Ledovskaya and Kirillov looked
perfectly at ease in this mix of the romantic and the acrobatic.
Partings and embraces, full of twists, were serenely rendered by
the dancers. At heart, they were dramatically intense and they made
something out of the lifts and slides, recalling skating images, in
``On the Edge,'' choreographed by Alex Ursuliak of the Stuttgart
Ballet Academy, to music from the film ``Titanic.'' One looks
forward to seeing them in Washington.

JARRETT KEEPS THE CRASHES, AND GORDON, IN HIS REARVIEW MIRROR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala.)  (js)

<P>
   TALLADEGA, Ala. _ At the biggest, fastest track on the Winston
Cup circuit, avoiding the big wreck can be the determining factor.
And there is always a big wreck at Talladega Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   With some 50 laps left in the Winston 500 Sunday, tires were
screeching and fenders were flying in an 11-car series of crashes
that sent Ernie Irvan to the hospital. And when the smoke cleared,
Mark Martin's title chase had taken a devastating hit, Jeff Gordon
was back on the lead lap, and Dale Jarrett's bank account was about
to get much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic finish, Jarrett barely held off a hard-charging
Gordon at the line to win and collect the Winston $1 million bonus.
Terry Labonte, Gordon's teammate, finished third. Martin, who was
unable to continue after the late-race wreck, finished 34th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked in the mirror more than looked ahead,'' said Jarrett,
whose Ford reached the victory lane for the third time this season
and for the first time in his career at Talladega. ``Those guys
were right behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a nail-biter.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett took the lead on the 173rd of 188 laps. Ten laps later,
a fingernail wouldn't fit between Jarrett's rear bumper and the
grill of Gordon's Chevy, which led a tightly knit group of
challengers _ Labonte, Jimmy Spencer and Jeremy Mayfield _ to the
line. If there had been 189 laps, Gordon, who finished just .14
seconds behind Jarrett, might have won.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great race car,'' Gordon said. ``We had to fight hard
today. This car was really, really fast. We were really cooking
there at the end. I thought we had a shot at it.''
</P>
<P>
   So, with four races to go, Gordon has nearly secured his second
straight Winston Cup title, which would be his third in six years.
He has a 288-point lead on Martin, the only driver with any chance
of catching him. Gordon can finish 16th in each of the remaining
races and still win the championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's typical restrictor plate racing,'' said Martin, who
started Sunday's race 174 points behind Gordon. ``It's great for
the fans, but it's not very good for the competitors. It's not real
racing because you can't separate yourself from the guys who don't
have the equipment, don't have the skills, or the experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Restrictor plate racing may not be ideal, but Gordon made the
best of his horsepower-starved car. After leading for 49 laps
early, he dropped back to 23rd after falling out of lead draft. By
Lap 130, he was one lap down, but he never stopped racing. With the
aerodynamic help of Labonte, he drove his way back onto the lead
lap just moments before the big wreck.
</P>
<P>
   The series of crashes occurred on Lap 136, with Martin running
sixth and Gordon 18th. Had the race ended then, Martin would have
moved to within 125 points of Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Sterling Marlin spun Irvan around, setting off a chain reaction.
Irvan's Pontiac, caroming off the wall and back into the middle of
the track, was broadsided near the passenger side by Dick Trickle
and then hit Martin's Ford, tearing up the rear of that car. After
making repairs, Martin was able to finish the race running, but he
was now miles from the championship.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the series of crashes, Gordon said: ``You hate to
see something like that. I really wanted this championship to come
down to just pure fighting on the race track. I hate to see
something like that happen to Mark, but anything can happen to us
in the final four laps just as it did to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's race was the third of four restrictor plate races this
season. The plates are small pieces of metal, which are placed over
the carburetor to constrict the flow of air and cut horsepower in
half. They are used at Talladega and Daytona in the interest of
safety. Restrictor plates also make for closer races and
unpredictable finishes. The restrictor plates will be on the cars
next week at Daytona for the Daytona night race, which had been
postponed because of forest fires.
</P>
<P>
   PIT STOPS
</P>
<P>
   ERNIE IRVAN was airlifted to Carraway Methodist Hospital in
Birmingham, Ala., after his Pontiac was pounded on the side by DICK
TRICKLE on Lap 136. He was admitted to the intensive care unit, but
preliminary reports were positive. He was awake and alert and
sustained no broken bones.

NEW YORK CITY UNIONS SAY THEY WON'T TAKE ANOTHER PAY FREEZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unhappy about the two-year pay freeze in their
contracts, New York City's municipal unions are warning that they
will not accept such a freeze again, while several labor leaders
are demanding an end to pattern bargaining, in which every union
receives the same percentage raise.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-day meeting last week in which they mapped their
bargaining strategy, municipal union leaders said their members
were angry that they had not reaped any benefits from the city's
record $2 billion budget surplus, which their pay freeze helped
create.
</P>
<P>
   Indicating another area of friction in future labor talks,
leaders of the powerful teachers and police unions vowed to
increase their efforts to scrap pattern bargaining, insisting that
it has left their members earning considerably less than their
suburban counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   These leaders insisted that unless the city gives teachers and
police officers larger percentage raises than other municipal
workers, the city would find it increasingly difficult to attract
qualified teachers and police officers.
</P>
<P>
   But an end to pattern bargaining faces major obstacles,
including the opposition of many city unions and the likelihood
that City Hall would tie any raises above the pattern to
concessions that the police and teachers would find hard to accept.
</P>
<P>
   With contract negotiations expected to begin next year, the
leaders of the city's unions signaled a tough new stance, insisting
they would seek higher raises now that the city's finances have
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Under their current five-year contracts, the municipal unions,
representing more than 200,000 city workers, accepted a two-year
pay freeze and then a 13 percent wage increase during the final
three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not take any more zeroes,'' said Stanley Hill,
chairman of the multi-union bargaining committee and executive
director of District Council 37, the giant union representing
120,000 city workers. ``We made a tremendous sacrifice in this
contract, and we feel very strongly that now there is a surplus, we
should be rewarded because we have helped make this a better
city.''
</P>
<P>
   The tougher tone comes after Hill was embarrassed by an
investigation into allegations of kickbacks and embezzlement at the
union's locals. It also comes at a time when many union members are
complaining that their wage increases have not kept up with prices
or the city's soaring rents.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall officials said it was too early to discuss negotiating
strategy because any resumption of bargaining was months away. They
also noted that District Council 37's contract does not expire
until 2000.
</P>
<P>
   One city official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity,
said the union leaders were indulging in sour grapes because they
accepted a frugal contract in 1995, when the city faced tough
budgetary times, only to see the city's coffers fill up soon after
the negotiations, thanks to the multi-year boom on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in the middle of a contract,'' the official said.
``This sounds like general posturing.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders said they fear that with Wall Street's current
troubles and the economy slowing, the city, notwithstanding its
current surplus, will argue in future negotiations that economic
times are difficult and the workers must again make sacrifices.

FBI TO OPEN NATIONAL DNA DATA BASE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDS: Repeating for all needing. Combines previous takes.)  (sw) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a computer at a secret location, the FBI will open a national
DNA data base on Tuesday that advocates say could significantly
reduce rape and other crimes by helping to catch repeat offenders
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The data base, with a new generation of forensic DNA techniques,
promises to be so efficient that some civil libertarians fear it
will be expanded from people convicted of crimes to include almost
everyone, giving the government inordinate investigative powers
over citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The national DNA data base consists of 50 data bases run by the
states but unified by common test procedures and software designed
by the FBI. As of Tuesday, it will be possible to compare a DNA
sample from a suspect or crime scene in one state with all others
in the system.
</P>
<P>
   The national data base has been nearly a decade in the making.
The final pieces fell into place in June when Rhode Island became
the last state to set up a DNA data base.
</P>
<P>
   But the system still faces many unresolved issues, which are
likely to play out according to the reaction from the public and
the courts. One such issue is what types of offenders should be
included. Another is whether the mass screening of suspects' DNA
will prove constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   DNA, the chemical that embodies a person's genetic programming,
can be found almost everywhere. People shed a constant torrent of
dead skin cells. Criminals leave blood when breaking and entering;
they shed hair and skin cells in fights, deposit saliva on glasses
and leave sweat stains in head bands. From only a few cells in such
sources, enough DNA can be extracted to identify the owner. A DNA
database of sufficient size could presumably help solve many
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   The crime-fighting potential of DNA data bases is becoming
evident from the experiences of Britain, which started earlier and
has had fewer administrative and constitutional hurdles to
overcome. The data base there initially focused on sex offenses but
has spread to include burglaries and car theft because of the high
number of DNA matches that police forces were obtaining. Moreover,
there was considerable crossover at least in Britain, among
different kinds of offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who commit serious crime very often have convictions
for petty crime in their history, so if you could get them on the
data base early you may prevent serious crime,'' said David
Werrett, manager of the DNA data base for England and Wales.
</P>
<P>
   The English DNA data base includes entries from crime scenes and
from everyone convicted of a crime, as well as from suspects in
unresolved cases. Since the system's debut in 1995, it has matched
28,000 people to crime scenes and has made 6,000 links between
crime scenes. The data base now holds 360,000 entries and Werrett
said he expected it would eventually include one third of all
English men between 16 and 30, the principal ages for committing
crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Werrett said that the data base has grown because police forces
in England, which pay $55 for a DNA analysis, are finding it cost
effective. Recently the Police Superintendents Association called
for the entire population to be DNA tested.
</P>
<P>
   Forensic use of DNA in the United States is unlikely to go as
fast or as far as in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Their system makes a tremendous amount of sense the way they
approach it, but in the United States we have a different
perspective on privacy and on the extent to which we would be
willing to depend on a data base,'' said Christopher Asplen,
executive director of the national Commission on the Future of DNA
Evidence.
</P>
<P>
   One major privacy safeguard in the FBI's system is that only a
minute fraction of a person's genetic endowment becomes part of the
data base. Under a new DNA profiling system known as STR's, for
short tandem repeats, a person's DNA is tested at 13 specific sites
at which a short length of DNA is repeated in a kind of stutter.
The number of repeats is highly variable from one person to
another, so that measuring the number of repeats at the 13
designated sites gives a way of identifying each individual with a
probability of one in several billion.
</P>
<P>
   The blood or other samples donated by individuals are retained
by the states in collections known as DNA banks. All that goes into
the computerized DNA data bases is the set of 13 numbers from the
STR measurements. Only identifying information, and nothing about a
person's health or appearance, can be divined from the STR's.
</P>
<P>
   Access to the DNA data base is permitted only for law
enforcement purposes, with a $100,000 fine for unauthorized
disclosures. No known breaches of the system have occurred.
</P>
<P>
   One major unresolved issue is that of the types of offenders
from whom DNA profiles should be taken. All states require people
convicted of serious sexual offenses to donate blood samples, but
differ on requiring samples from other groups such as people
convicted of violent felonies, juvenile offenders and parolees.
</P>
<P>
   Four states _ Virginia, Wyoming, New Mexico and Alabama _
require all people convicted of a felony to provide samples for DNA
profiling. Louisiana allows DNA to be taken from people merely
arrested in a crime, a practice that has not been tested in the
courts.
</P>
<P>
   State laws establishing DNA data bases have been challenged in
13 jurisdictions and have been upheld in all but one, in
Massachusetts. Some states have revised their original legislation
to add offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the trend is that 10 years from now all felonies will
be covered,'' said M. Dawn Herkenham, chief of the FBI's Forensic
Science Systems Unit in Washington. ``We recommend that all violent
felonies, burglaries, juveniles and retroactivity for people on
parole be included.''
</P>
<P>
   From his office in Birmingham, England, last week, Werrett said,
``Today we have issued matches on three murders, five rapes, nine
serious robberies, two abductions and two violent burglaries.''
</P>
<P>
   No state DNA data base has acquired the critical mass to furnish
such a hit rate. Many state laboratories are understaffed and have
large backlogs of DNA samples to analyze. The backlogs are
particularly worrisome in the case of rapes where specimens may lie
unanalyzed while the rapist assaults more victims. ``People may be
appalled to know how many rape suspect kits are out there
untouched,'' Ms. Herkenham of the FBI said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hit ratio depends on whether we can go back and examine
all the evidence that comes in the door,'' said Dr. Barry Duceman,
director of biological science in the New York State Police
Forensic Investigation Center in Albany. ``We are trying to address
a crushing case backlog and to get the technology on line _ you'd
be hard pressed to say we are overstaffed.''
</P>
<P>
   The case backlog problem is compounded because state
laboratories are switching to the STR method of DNA profiling from
an older method of analysis called RFLP (for restriction fragment
length polymorphism). All the samples analyzed by RFLP must be
redone by STR if they are to be searchable in the new data base.
</P>
<P>
   When these teething problems are overcome, many experts believe
that the state and national DNA data base systems may have a
significant effect, particularly in reducing crimes like rape that
often involve repeat offenders. By scoring a ``cold hit'' between
crime scene data and a person, DNA data bases can be particularly
effective in solving cases with no suspects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get that infrastructure in place and start getting
those hits, the benefits will lead to higher utilization,'' Asplen
said.
</P>
<P>
   But like other experts involved with DNA testing, he expressed
concern that DNA profiling be developed in a publicly acceptable
way. ``The public does need to have a trust level with this and be
assured that law enforcement is not going to abuse this powerful
tool,'' he said. One practice likely to raise eyebrows, if not
hackles, is mass screening, which is widely used in the United
Kingdom but not yet commonplace here.
</P>
<P>
   In high profile crime cases, police in Britain often ask, and
can require, all members of a town or building to give DNA samples
so as to prove themselves guiltless and help narrow the search for
the culprit. The National Commission on the Future of DNA Testing
is examining under what circumstances the donation of samples can
be considered voluntary. In an office, where employees who declined
to donate a sample might be fired, a police request for DNA might
be coercive.
</P>
<P>
   A future use of DNA testing is that of phenotypic analysis. It
will soon be technically possible to infer from the genes in a
person's DNA many probable aspects of their appearance, such as
hair, skin and eye color. Werrett said the main problem with such
predictions would lie in training police to understand their
probabilistic nature: told there is a 90 percent chance that the
suspect has red hair, investigators should not ignore the 10
percent chance that he does not.
</P>
<P>
   DNA reveals so much about a person that behavioral geneticists
might wish to search through state data banks for genetic variants
linked to criminal behavior. Most states say their DNA data banks
can be accessed only for law enforcement purposes, like the data
bases. But Alabama authorizes the use of its samples for
``educational research or medical research or development,'' an
apparent invitation to genetic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   An impending issue is whether states should retain their DNA
samples once the information has been entered into the DNA data
base. Forensic managers like to retain samples as a hedge against
changing technology. Others say the DNA sample banks create an
opportunity for abuse, and that if there is another change in
technology the government should just rebuild its data base from
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Because DNA can be found at so many crime scenes, DNA data bases
promise to be powerful aids in catching criminals. But what thrills
forensic experts tends to chill civil libertarians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA data base started out with pariahs _ the sex offenders
_ but has already been enlarged to include other felons and will
probably be extended to include everyone, giving elites the power
to control `unruly' citizens,'' said Philip Bereano a professor of
technology and public policy at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Eric Juengst, a bioethicist at Case Western Reserve
University in Cleveland and a member of the FBI's DNA Advisory
Board, said the original policy in setting up the DNA data base was
that it was ``suitable only for our most serious category of
criminals,'' and that it would be a breach of that policy to expand
its scope.
</P>
<P>
   The risks raised by Bereano are worth watching, Juengst said,
``but as a society we have to learn how to control powerful tools
of all kinds, like nuclear power. I don't see it as an endless
slippery slope.''

VANITY FAIR WON'T RUN STORY ON REPRESENTATIVE  
 WHEN AN EDITOR TAKES A POLITICAL STANCE  
 THREE PRODUCERS SEE POTENTIAL IN HOLLYWOOD TALE  
 DEFENDANT IN CNN SUIT HIRES HER OWN LAWYER 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana, the Republican chairman of the
Government Reform and Oversight Committee, found out that Vanity
Fair magazine was planning to run a story revealing that he was the
father of an illegitimate child, he decided to beat the magazine to
the punch. On Aug. 31, he announced at news conferences in Indiana
that Vanity Fair would soon be producing a ``scandal story'' about
his sexual life.
</P>
<P>
   But Vanity Fair, having arguably generated more buzz than any
other magazine in history for an article that had not yet been
published, is no longer planning to publish the article, which was
to be written by the freelance writer Russ Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Baker will be paid his entire fee for the article, which is
Vanity Fair's general practice when stories do not run. Staffers at
Vanity Fair, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that the
Vanity Fair editor Graydon Carter wanted Baker to change the
emphasis and spend less space exploring the personal history of
Burton.
</P>
<P>
   The senior articles editor Doug Stumpf, who assigned the piece
to Baker, did say, ``We hadn't yet scheduled the piece and since
Russ felt strongly that it be published before the election in
November, we told him he was free to take it elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker asked Charles Lane, the editor of The New Republic, to
look at his 6,000-word manuscript.
</P>
<P>
   ``He shopped it to us,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   But before Baker sent him the manuscript, Baker took it to Mike
Wallace's producing team at ``60 Minutes.'' Baker and Jonathan
Wells, a member of Wallace's team, confirmed that they were indeed
working together.

   When an Editor Takes a Political Stance
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Last Thursday, The New York Post pointed out with no
small measure of delight that Harold Evans _ editorial director and
vice chairman of The Daily News of New York, U.S. News &AMP; World
Report, The Atlantic Monthly and Fast Co., a business magazine _
had added his name to a full-page advertisement in The New York
Times, calling for censure, not impeachment, of the president.
</P>
<P>
   The ad, which was paid for by a group called the Committee for
Censure, Not Impeachment, included Evans' name on a list of 84
luminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Should an editor with responsibility over news pages be taking a
public position? Joan Konner, publisher of the Columbia Journalism
Review and dean emerita of the Columbia University School of
Journalism, said, ``Ordinarily, a journalist should not be on that
document.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``Traditional journalistic ethics say that you are an
outsider on every journalistic controversy. If you are reporting on
the story, you must be an outsider.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans responded by saying that he was ``massively unperturbed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are we supposed to do?'' he asked. ``Skulk in our tents?
An ethical problem would have been for an editor or editorial
director to persuade a journalist working for him to write
something he didn't believe in.''
</P>
<P>
   Evans said he did not think that any reporter or columnist
reporting to him would be troubled by Evans' belief that the
president should not be impeached.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the journalists at the Daily News and U.S News are
made of sterner stuff than the hand-wringers outside who have not
had a professional job in 100 years,'' he said. ``Ask anybody in
the Daily News if they are intimidated by my signature, and you
will find they are not.''

   Three Producers See Potential in a Hollywood Tale
</P>
<P>
   ``Indecent Exposure,'' David McClintick's 1982 best-selling saga
of greed and glory in Hollywood, may finally make it onto the
screen. The tale, which started with a check forged by David
Begelman, then president of Columbia Pictures, and ended with
Begelman's ouster, was perhaps the first book in which the daily
history of a business crisis was recreated by an author.
</P>
<P>
   Noted books of this genre that followed included ``Barbarians at
the Gate,'' which recounted the takeover battle for R.J. Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   During the Columbia battle, Begelman was defended by Ray Stark,
the powerful producer, and Herbert Allen, the head of Allen &AMP; Co.,
an investment banking firm with a stake in Columbia. His critics
included Columbia's chief executive, Alan Hirschfield, and the
actor Cliff Robertson, whose name Begelman had forged on the check.
</P>
<P>
   Now Edward Pressman and Ken Lipper have bought an interest in
the rights to the book from the producer Elliott Kastner as well as
the rights to McClintick's 1996 article in Vanity Fair in which he
described Begelman's difficult final years and eventual suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The three men are negotiating with Film Four, the film division
of Channel Four of Britain, to finance the production. That company
has financed about 18 films a year, including ``Trainspotting.''
</P>
<P>
   Kastner said this might be a good time to produce ``Indecent
Exposure'' as a movie, because audiences are more sophisticated
about boardroom issues. Pressman describes the project as ```The
Godfather' of the movie business'' because it involves so many
highly placed film executives in such a visible fight.

   Defendant in CNN Suit Hires Her Own Lawyer
</P>
<P>
   Talk about strange bedfellows.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout from CNN's discredited Tailwind broadcast continues
to accumulate. One defamation suit has been settled, three are
pending and at least one more has been threatened.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting suit was filed in Washington by Maj.
Gen. John Singlaub of the Army, who commanded the Studies and
Observations Group special forces units in Vietnam. It is the only
suit that names April Oliver, the lead producer on the report, as
an individual defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble is, Ms. Oliver and Time Warner, CNN's corporate parent,
are co-defendants without much of a common cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Oliver is looking for vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner's goal is less clear, though it would be logical to
assume it has a strategic retreat in mind, since during the summer
it decided to settle a defamation suit brought by Adm. Thomas
Moorer for a sum that one CNN executive, who declined to be
identified, estimated to be ``around $200,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for support, Ms. Oliver has retained Martin Garbus, an
aggressive lawyer who has worked both for and against Time Warner
in earlier legal battles.
</P>
<P>
   Time Warner, under its libel insurance policy, must insure Ms.
Oliver, both sides agree. It is less clear whether the policy would
cover a separate lawyer for Ms. Oliver _ even though her claim of
truthfulness is directly at odds with Time Warner's repudiation of
her work.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's spokesman, Steve Haworth, had no comment. But Ms. Oliver
said that Time Warner's lawyers had made it clear that they were
disinclined to allow Garbus in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of the other pending lawsuits name Ms. Oliver as an
individual defendant. They include a suit filed in Florida by one
of the soldiers who did reconnaissance on the Tailwind mission and
a California suit filed by veterans of the Special Operations
Group. CNN's report charged that the Special Forces used nerve gas
in a mission targeting deserters.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Ms. Oliver is drafting a 2,000-word response to
a round-table discussion about Tailwind published in the magazine
Brill's Content. All the parties involved in the round table shared
the view that the story should not have been broadcast.

SCHOOL BOARD CONSERVATIVES RATTLE TEXAS POLITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to move up 9th and 10th grafs, making them 7th and 8th)  (mk) 
 By RICK LYMAN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Now, Texas is a state that likes a good
political brawl almost as much as a slice of mesquite-smoked
brisket smothered in sauce. Yet here it is, a month before the
election, Gov. George W. Bush is about 50 points ahead in the polls
and seems set for a big wet kiss from voters on his way to a
possible presidential run in 2000. So where's the rumpus?
</P>
<P>
   Not at the top of the ballot, it seems, but far, far below, well
under the public radar, where the juiciest and most far-reaching
race may be the one for control of the once-obscure Texas State
Board of Education. A coalition of Christian conservatives, who
have gradually gained members on the board since 1992 and
transformed it into the state's most reliable producer of political
theater and partisan discord, have a solid shot at becoming a
majority on the 15-member board, which oversees the nation's
second-largest public school system, 3.9 million students strong.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect is unnerving some Texas politicians, leading others
to talk about disempowering or abolishing the elected board and
causing discomfort to a governor who has made public education the
centerpiece of his campaign and who does not really need right-wing
members of his own party berating his administration for being
insufficiently committed to the conservative cause.
</P>
<P>
   A little more sauce on that brisket, honey?
</P>
<P>
   Jack Christie, the Republican chairman of the state board, says
he considers himself a devout Christian and an ardent conservative,
but he has had about enough of the hard-line Christian
conservatives he works with.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a waste of time trying to placate these people,'' he
said. ``I was in Israel recently on a trip with a diverse group of
Christians and Jews. We met with the No. 2 guy in the PLO, and I
felt, when I was sitting there, that I could negotiate better with
him than I could with some of these people on the board.''
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives respond that they are interested only in high
standards, local school control and fiscal accountability; prayer
in the schools and creationism are not their main focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The education establishment is totally unaccustomed to anyone
who is not a part of their inside loop,'' said Donna Ballard, a
conservative housewife who is trying to reclaim a spot on the board
after giving up her old seat, in suburban Houston, when her
husband, a preacher, moved the family to West Texas. ``We're
holding them accountable, which they're furious about.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, right-wing members of the board have
chastised the governor for lack of leadership and Lt. Gov. Bob
Bullock for ``meddling'' in education issues; frequently criticized
the appointed state education commissioner; demanded Christie's
removal as board chairman; been called racists by other members of
the board; publicly ripped up a textbook they considered too easy;
demanded the sale of more than $40 million of Disney stock from the
permanent education fund, and altogether transformed the board into
a great big thorn in the establishment's side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have said before that I thought they were an embarrassment
for the state of Texas and the Legislature and the governor,'' said
State Sen. Bill Ratliff, a Republican and former chairman of the
Senate's education committee. ``And I happen to believe that public
education is suffering from it. You just can't have a board that
runs amok.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics on the board and in state government say the hard-line
conservatives are insatiable, dissembling and utterly resistant to
compromise. ``I believe their hidden agenda is to make public
education look as bad as possible so they can get support from
citizens of Texas for a full-blown voucher system,'' said Rene
Nunez, a Democrat who after 10 years on the board finds himself in
a tight race with Mrs. Ballard in West Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's just a bunch of name-calling,'' said Bob Offut, a
leader of the board's right-wing bloc. ``We're five people who are
not into the Austin bureaucracy's political gamesmanship. We're
pretty ideological-type of people who, just because the governor
calls and asks for support, doesn't mean that it's going to happen.
They are driven by their hatred of us.''
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the governor describe him as annoyed, even angry
with the activities of right-wingers on the board who might,
paradoxically, find their numbers increased in November on Bush's
coattails. But they say that the rancor does not indicate any
significant gap between the governor and the party's overall right
wing.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Rove, a top Bush adviser, said that Bush had been
``unremittingly conservative'' as governor and had put together a
``broad coalition'' of Republicans that included prominent members
of the far right. The extreme attitudes of hard-line conservatives
like those on the education board represent only a tiny percentage
of Republicans, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was a right-winger, but these people are far out
there,'' said Rove, who described the tension between the governor
and the board's conservatives as a minor sideshow. ``In the
carnival of life,'' he said, ``they are in a very distant booth.''
</P>
<P>
   The once obscure Texas education board has crept gradually into
the spotlight in the six years since Offut became the first member
of the conservative voting bloc to be elected to it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, Offut said he decided that his best path was
to try to recruit like-minded conservatives to run for seats on the
board in other districts. By 1996, there were six in Offut's voting
bloc on the board, including Mrs. Ballard, whose move to Midland
reduced the bloc to five.
</P>
<P>
   But Offut said the bloc was certain to increase by at least one
in November because ``another one of us won a primary and is
unopposed'' in the Texas Panhandle. And Offut said he had strong
hopes that Mrs. Ballard would rejoin the board by beating Nunez.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they would need to win only one more race, perhaps in East
Texas, or to convince one of the more moderate Republicans already
on the board to join their bloc, to make up a majority of the 15
members. Only five seats are up this year, as the terms are
staggered.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Elliot Shapleigh spoke last week to a few dozen
supporters of Nunez who were munching tamales on a flag-draped
veranda beside the Rio Grande in El Paso. Shapleigh said he
intended to do as much as he could to get Nunez re-elected. ``The
consequences on this state are huge,'' he said. ``We cannot allow
the reckless right to handicap our public education.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Ballard said she intended to campaign as a concerned
housewife and mother and resented efforts by opponents to demonize
her by linking her to a right-wing conspiracy that she said did not
exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have horns,'' Mrs. Ballard said. ``And I don't see why
they keep trying to make this a religious issue. We all go to
different churches. One of us doesn't go to any church at all. The
thing that threads us together is a real determination to save our
future.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the efforts of her and others, she said,
``discipline and phonics are not dirty words anymore'' in Texas
schools and there is the beginning of a return to higher standards.
(The right-wingers on the board joined governor Bush last year in
calling for a rewrite of a first draft of the new standards for
Texas schools, going as far as to pick their own consultants to
help, but then they stunned the board and enraged the governor by
announcing at the last minute that the rewritten standards were
still insufficiently tough for their taste. ``These people cannot
take yes for an answer,'' one state official said.)
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have here are two different philosophies,'' Mrs.
Ballard said. ``One says that we tell children what is right, how
to spell a word, what the correct answer is. The other is that
we're going to have general statements and let children discover
when they're ready to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   It has nothing to do with secret religious conspiracies, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had four children in four years,'' Mrs. Ballard said. ``I
put a list on the refrigerator, what they got a swat for and what
they didn't get a swat for. Those were the rules of the house. You
obeyed those rules or you didn't. There were times you could show
mercy, but you must have that structure. That's not heartless.
Sometimes, it takes a mom to figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenda Welburn, executive director of the National Association
of State Boards of Education, said that similar battles were being
fought in many states where social conservatives have recognized
that low-profile school-board races are an easy gateway into
government and a prime platform for pushing the issues dearest to
them.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, in particular, may well see religious conservatives
become a majority on the state education board in November, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   But the trend is not entirely one-sided. Moderates appear to be
staging a comeback in some states where there had been conservative
inroads in the 1990s. ``If anything, I see a swing back to the
middle,'' Ms. Welburn said.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, like Delaware, where officials have grown weary
of partisan bickering over education, state boards have seen their
powers whittled back. In Minnesota, the Legislature has voted to
abolish the state board next year.
</P>
<P>
   This is similar to the path that officials have taken in Texas.
In 1995, the Legislature voted to severely curtail the board's
powers, particularly taking away the power, cherished by the social
conservatives, of editing textbooks.
</P>
<P>
   Since this has done little to quiet the rancor on the state
board, some Texas officials are now arguing that its powers should
be even further curtailed in the next legislative session, perhaps
even transforming it into an appointed board.
</P>
<P>
   It all could depend on whether the conservatives win a majority
on the board in November. If they do, several state officials
predicted, legislation will be pushed through to further limit the
board's role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't think they're going to win a majority this
election,'' Christie said. ``I think the pendulum is going to swing
back instead.''
</P>
<P>
   In that case, he said, the Democrats and moderate Republicans on
the board will simply continue with a strategy that they believe
was beginning to work in recent board meetings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to get along with them, but we gave up,'' Christie
said. ``We've gotten word from the upper echelons of state
government that we should just go ahead and not worry about these
sideshows.''

WELLS ANSWERS HIS HECKLERS WITH A VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (sw) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ David Wells tugged at the left sleeve of his gray
Yankee jersey, tugged at the right sleeve and adjusted his pants.
He had just started to pitch in the most important game of his
career, but in the first inning on Sunday he looked more like a
frustrated hitchhiker than a post-season stalwart.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees had gift-wrapped a 3-0 lead for Wells during a wacky
top of the first, and were privately expecting him to take the
cushion, run with it and usher them back to New York in command of
the series. Give us a smooth ride, Boomer, and it will be a smooth
flight on Sunday night, the Yankees silently asked him.
</P>
<P>
   But there was nothing too smooth about the bottom of the first
for Wells, and there was a reason for his sluggishness. Wells
revealed that some Indians fans made disparaging remarks to him
about his deceased mother, Eugenia Ann, as he warmed up in the
bullpen. The words seeped inside his head and it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees regrouped and stopped the Indians, 5-3, some
teammates talked about how the fans hung over the center-field
bullpen and annoyed Wells by touching on a taboo topic before Game
5 of the American League Championship Series. During the first
inning, Wells was irritated because he was thinking about the woman
who was known as Attitude Annie, who died of heart disease related
to diabetes at the age of 58 on Jan. 4, 1997 _ the woman to whom he
prays before each start.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a bunch of clowns out there that start talking
about your mother and not knowing that my mom passed away a year
and a half ago, it really bothered me,'' Wells said. ``What got me
more was some little kids out there started to do the same thing. I
was in awe out there because I couldn't believe that could
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells did not answer the hecklers until after the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can deal with a lot of negative stuff out there, but when it
involves my mom or anyone of my family members, it really bothers
me,'' he said. ``So to those idiots out there, this one is for
you.''
</P>
<P>
   What started out as a bumpy journey turned into a smooth ride as
Wells stopped thinking about the crass comments and steered the
Yankees to a commanding 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game series.
</P>
<P>
   This was the new and improved Wells, not the Wells who used to
quit. Wells rallied by squelching the Indians on one run and five
hits, while striking out nine after the first inning. He finished
with 11 strikeouts in seven and a third innings, won his second
game in this series and is now 7-1 for his career in the
post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an animal,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ``He goes after
them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Wells had great guts,'' said George Steinbrenner, the Yankees'
principal owner. ``The guy is becoming a leader on this team. If I
would have said that three or four years ago, they would have
jailed me.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells was stunned when Torre ambled to the mound to remove him
with one out in the eighth, especially since he had just struck out
his third straight batter. He told Torre that he had only thrown
``one bad pitch,'' but the manager stayed firm as the other Yankees
chuckled. When Wells returned to the dugout amid a sea of boos, he
took his cap off and twirled it to the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just wanted to stay in the game, whether he was joking or
not,'' Chuck Knoblauch said. ``He always has something good to say.
That's why all four of us ran in there so quick to catch what he
had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The first started with the precise Wells, who had allowed as
many walks (29) as homers (29) this season, going 3-0 on Kenny
Lofton and then surrendering a homer on a 3-1 pitch. After
back-to-back singles, a wild pitch and Manny Ramirez's sacrifice
fly, the Indians trimmed the score to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   Where was the Wells who held opponents to three earned runs in
251/3 innings in his last three post-season starts? Who had
volunteered to pitch Game 4 on Saturday night? Who is ready to
pitch Game 7, if necessary, on two days of rest?
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he showed up. Maybe Wells was a little late, but he
arrived. Wells got Mark Whiten to flail at a 2-2 pitch for the
second out, but he walked Jim Thome to fill the bases. After visits
from Scott Brosius, the pitching coach Mel Stottlemyre and catcher
Jorge Posada, Wells made Richie Sexon's legs wobble with an 0-2
curve.
</P>
<P>
   How far has Wells come? Far enough to flaunt Steinbrenner's team
rules. He has not shaved his goatee before his last two starts,
something which Steinbrenner refused to criticize. The owner who
believes in clean-cut appearances and once had Don Mattingly
benched for not getting a haircut said, ``there's nothing wrong
with facial hair.'' There is also nothing wrong with having Wells
pitch an important game, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting to even like the metallic band,'' Steinbrenner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wells was walking past Steinbrenner in the crowded clubhouse and
barked, ``It's Metallica.''
</P>
<P>
   A surprised Steinbrenner said: ``I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
Metallica.'' &QL;

AFTER LOSS, GALAXY FACING ELIMINATION
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   This Major League Soccer season has become a one-game affair for
the Galaxy, which is one game from elimination after falling
Saturday to the Chicago Fire in the Western Conference finals
opener.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 90 minutes of dominance meant nothing after Chicago's
Jesse Marsch slotted home a rebound of Lubos Kubik's free kick in
the 86th minute to deliver a 1-0 victory and move the Fire to
within one win _ possibly Friday at Soldier Field _ of MLS's
championship game.
</P>
<P>
   It was a critical victory for the Fire players, who used superb
defense to nullify L.A.'s control of the match, but they're well
aware their task won't be easy in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be another hard-fought game,'' Fire coach Bob Bradley
said. ``We saw the kind of character L.A. has when they were down
two goals the last game against Dallas (and rallied in the final
10{ minutes for a 3-2 victory). This is only one game.''
</P>
<P>
   The second game in the best-of-three series could be a replica
of the first, which looked like a chess match: The Galaxy owned
possession of the ball and sought openings into the Fire box.
Chicago built a fort around its goal, waiting to take advantage of
one L.A. mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to go to Chicago and find a way to win,'' said Galaxy
defender Robin Fraser. ``If you look at the way Chicago defends,
there's no set way to beat them.... Nothing will be given to us. We
have to go there and gut out a victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough game against 11 guys who only defended, and
they had one opportunity and converted,'' said Galaxy coach Octavio
Zambrano, whose team also played superb defense for all but perhaps
three seconds, when defender Steve Jolley failed to stay with
Marsch on Kubik's free kick. ``We are not yet out of the playoffs.
We can't put our heads down, and we are going to go into Chicago
and play hard. Never in my life will I believe, or let the guys
feel, that this is over.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be soon unless L.A. takes care of its chances as Chicago
did. Twice the Galaxy got into the Fire goalmouth _ Welton from a
Carlos Hermosillo throughball in the 56th minute, and Martin Machon
on a bicycle kick during a last-minute scramble _ and neither time
could L.A. put a shot on target. The Fire managed just two shots on
goal: Kubik's free kick, slapped away by goalkeeper Kevin Hartman,
and Marsch's rebound.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be smart (in Chicago),'' Zambrano said. ``We can't
be panicky about the situation. We still have 90 minutes to play.''

BASEBALL COLUMN: YANKS' ROTATION HAS CERTAIN SYMMETRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ If you wait long enough, even in a short series, it
becomes abundantly clear why one team won 114 regular-season games
and another 89. In the swing game of the American League
Championship Series here on Sunday, Game 5, the Yankees trotted out
the author of a perfect game, while the Indians responded with the
defendant in what became a crime against Mike Hargrove's choice of
starting pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' manager went with a guy who didn't make his
Division Series roster, hoped for the best and got one and
one-third painfully dysfunctional innings. He got the Ogea trial
with no acquittal. All things considered, the weekend at Jacobs
Field turned out quite nicely for the Yankees, who won 5-3 Sunday
and have a three-games-to-two series lead going home to Yankee
Stadium on Tuesday for Game 6.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Hernandez on Saturday night. David Wells on Sunday.
David Cone on Tuesday. No wonder Joe Torre always looks so calm
sitting there next to Don Zimmer in the dugout. He does not have to
blindfold himself and throw darts at the wall to select his
starting pitcher in the heart of a championship series. He does not
have to make Game 5 choices like Chad Ogea or Jaret Wright. He does
not have to wonder which of his core starters is less likely to be
overwhelmed by the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our signature is starting pitching,'' Torre said, repeating
his mantra. ``That's been our strength and that's the reason why we
won so many games.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees aren't officially done yet with the Indians. Torre
may want Hargrove's blindfold if the Indians win Tuesday night and
the dice come up with, gulp, Andy Pettitte's number for Game 7.
Torre takes the day off Monday, not worrying about that. He knows
Cone cannot wait to take the ball Tuesday night. He knows there
will be no fear, the way there was none in Hernandez, and certainly
none in Wells.
</P>
<P>
   You can't teach a pitcher this, like the grip on a split-finger
fastball. You can't instill the desire that welled inside Hernandez
as he plotted his escape from Castro's Cuba. You can't manufacture
Wells' counter-culture life that makes him what Torre called ``a
loose horse,'' a pitcher impervious to conventional pressure. You
can't make players understand the way Cone does that an aneurysm in
your right shoulder could materialize out of nowhere to threaten
your livelihood and your life.
</P>
<P>
   These three have all lived more than a little in their 30-plus
years, overcome personal situations that are bigger, even, than
baseball. It gets to the point where center stage on the baseball
team that is owned by George Steinbrenner and belongs to New York
is not that big a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to the place in your career where you worry about not
getting the opportunity,'' Cone said in the relaxed Yankee
clubhouse. ``Boomer is like that, without a doubt, and I think his
postseason record with us the two years he's been here proves it.
El Duque, I think he was overanxious to get the chance. He felt he
should have pitched before last night.''
</P>
<P>
   How many teams in pitching-challenged baseball can trot out
three talented survivors like that? ``No, I'm not envious of
them,'' Hargrove lied after his dart, once again, landed in the
wrong place. In Game 1, he picked Wright, who got bombed for five
first-inning runs. After Ogea spotted the Yankees a 4-2 lead,
Hargrove handed the ball to Wright, who pitched six innings of
one-run ball.
</P>
<P>
   One bad break _ a double-play ball headed toward the human
vacuum, Omar Vizquel, which Ogea deflected into a base hit for Paul
O'Neill _ does not mitigate the three walks and two hit batsmen and
the fact that the laboring Ogea looked defeated from the start.
</P>
<P>
   Wells, for his part, struggled in the first inning but hardly
because of the magnitude of the moment. He said he was distracted
while warming up in the bullpen when fans, and some young ones at
that, hurled insults at him that broached the subject of his
mother, who died of cancer in January 1997. By Wells' own account,
Eugenia Ann Wells was not your standard soccer mom, but she raised
him lovingly by herself and her passing hit him hard.
</P>
<P>
   When his focus returned, the anger remained. He left a potential
third run at third base in the first inning, and later surrendered
a Jim Thome home run. Mostly, Wells bewildered the Indians' free
swingers with off-speed pitches and fanned 11 into the eighth, when
Torre decided he'd had enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those idiots out there,'' he said later, as if making a
toast, ``this one is for you.''
</P>
<P>
   All right, so Wells' story doesn't exactly have the romance of
Hernandez's, and he is not the polished, finished product, as is
Cone. Pertaining to the rigors and tensions of October, this is not
the point, which is that Wells is absolutely unafraid to fail. Like
Cone, Wells and Hernandez are survivors to the core.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can see it in a guy's body language,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Game 6, you will likely see it in Cone.

OUTPOURING FOLLOWS ANTI-GAY ATTACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LARAMIE, Wyo. _ As Matthew Shepard lay near death, the victim of
a savage hate crime, the night was young at the Fireside Lounge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fag-bashing starts later,'' a young man said, sneering as
he clutched a beer bottle in one hand, a pool cue in the other.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner did the words leave the man's mouth Saturday night
than three of his friends charged him, shoved him backward, and
berated him for his incendiary rhetoric.
</P>
<P>
   These are volatile times in Laramie, where Shepard, 22, a
first-year student at the University of Wyoming, paid dearly last
week allegedly for trusting two strangers enough at the Fireside
Lounge to tell them he is gay.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was an atrocity that rocked this city of cowboys
and college students and forced the stunned community to painfully
confront the festering evil of anti-gay hatred, as the nation and
its lawmakers watched.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the most vicious hate crimes on record against a
homosexual, the two men in the Fireside Lounge allegedly lured
Shepard to their pickup truck and pistol-whipped him as they drove
him to a deserted, windblown bluff on the edge of town. There, they
allegedly roped him to a rough-hewn wooden fence as if he were a
hunting trophy, burned him, and continued to beat him, then left
him for dead as he begged for his life.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of his black leather shoes, Shepard languished on the
fence through a frigid night and much of the next day, with the
snow-capped Rockies towering on the horizon. A passerby, who at
first mistook Shepard for a scarecrow, discovered him 18 hours
after the attack. He had hypothermia, and was comatose and severely
brain-damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Shepard's parents wrestled with the nightmare of
deciding whether their son should be taken off life-support
apparatus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so utterly repulsive and sickening that everyone feels
assaulted and insulted'' by the attack, said Ken Gerow, 42, who
teaches statistics at the University of Wyoming, as he stood on the
rocky bluff near the fence where Shepard was tortured. A lone
basket of flowers lay beneath the fence, fluttering in the wind, on
the rutted dirt road.
</P>
<P>
   The case has prompted President Clinton, Senator Edward M.
Kennedy, and other leaders to call on Congress to pass a bill that
would expand the federal hate-crime law to cover attacks based on a
victim's sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent FBI statistics on hate crimes showed more than
1,000 attacks in 1996 on individuals because of their sexual
orientation.
</P>
<P>
   However, unlike the aftermath of the racially motivated dragging
death of James Byrd Jr. last summer in Jasper, Texas, when the FBI
rushed in to lead the investigation, federal authorities have no
jurisdiction in the Shepard case because the hate-crime law does
not cover gays or lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The attack also has renewed a bitter debate about whether gays
and lesbians should be covered under a proposed hate-crime law in
Wyoming, which bills itself as the Equality State. Repeated
attempts to enact the law in recent years have failed in part
because legislative leaders have balked at extending protections to
gays and lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a tragedy that in the Equality State, you aren't equal
if you're gay,'' said Marv Johnson, executive director of the
Wyoming chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union.
</P>
<P>
   Friends described Shepard as a small man _ 5-foot-2, 105 pounds
_ with a big heart. ``He's a very loving, caring individual,'' said
Alex Trout, 21, who was involved in gay rights activities with
Shepard. ``He would do anything for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Police and prosecutors gave a chilling account of the case last
week as two men were charged with aggravated robbery, kidnapping,
and attempting to murder Shepard, and two women were accused of
trying to help cover up the men's roles in the crime.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities said Shepard, a political science major who aspired
to a career in international affairs, went alone for a drink at the
Fireside Lounge, one of the more popular taverns in a college town
where the competition includes watering holes such as the Cowboy
Saloon, Buck Horn Bar, and Wild Willie's.
</P>
<P>
   According to police, Aaron J. McKinney, 22, and Russell A.
Henderson, 21, lured Shepard to their pickup truck by telling him
they were gay after he confided his homosexuality to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt was openly gay in the sense that if he felt comfortable
with somebody and they asked him, he would tell them,'' Trout said.
``But he wasn't the type who would walk in and say, `I'm gay, deal
with it.' These guys basically set him up.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney's father, Bill, and girlfriend, Kristin L. Price, were
quoted in the Denver Post Sunday as saying McKinney and Henderson
attacked Shepard because he made a pass at them, not because they
hate homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Price was quoted as saying McKinney told her that when Shepard
revealed he was gay, ``they decided to take him out and rob him.
That was their only intention.''
</P>
<P>
   McKinney said Shepard had ``pushed himself onto him and that he
had embarrassed him and Russ in front of all their friends and
everybody at the Fireside,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Before the attack ended, the suspects allegedly stole Shepard's
shoes, wallet, and credit cards. Police found the items, as well as
a blood-stained, .357 Magnum pistol, within 48 hours of the crime
in McKinney's pickup truck and at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Price, 18, and Chastity V. Pasley, 20, were charged with being
accessories to the crime because they allegedly provided false
alibis for the suspects and helped them dispose of bloody clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Pasley is an art student at the University of Wyoming. ``She's a
good kid who got dragged into this thing because she's involved
with the guy,'' said Robyn Otterson, 27, at the Fireside Lounge
Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   As the Blind Faith song, ``Can't Find My Way Home,'' blared
through the loudspeakers, Otterson and others at the bar said
Laramie is no different from any other place in the United States,
where the actions of a few hateful individuals can tarnish a
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not redneck-ville,'' said Shannon Combs, 24, a nurse's
aide. ``Wyoming mourns when this kind of stuff happens.''
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's friend, Trout, said several random anti-gay attacks
have occurred recently in Laramie. ``Wyoming is generally a live
and let live state,'' he said. ``But every time the Legislature
takes the words `sexual orientation' out of a hate-crime bill, they
basically give people here a license to hate gays. I hold the
legislators personally responsible for Matt.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Poudre Valley Hospital in Fort Collins, Colo., 65
miles south of Laramie, said Shepard's condition has gradually
worsened since he arrived. He remains in a coma, with severe damage
to his brain stem, which controls the body's functions. His
temperature has severely fluctuated, and he cannot breathe without
a ventilator.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of marchers in the University of Wyoming's homecoming
parade Saturday, including the school's marching band, wore yellow
arm bands for Shepard. Hundreds of others held a candlelight vigil
Saturday night outside the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   And last night, on the first day of ``gay awareness week'' in
Laramie, several churches opened their doors for prayer vigils.
</P>
<P>
   Shepard's parents, Judy and Dennis, returned from Saudi Arabia,
where Dennis Shepard works for an oil company, after the attack.
They issued a statement saying Shepard's ``life has often been a
struggle in one way or another,'' including a premature birth and
childhood ailments.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is physically short in stature, but we believe he is a
giant when it comes to respecting the worth of others,'' the
Shepards said. ``We know that he thinks if he can make one person's
life better in this world, then he has succeeded.''
</P>
<P>
   They said Shepard harbored only one ``intolerance'': He hated
``when people don't accept others as they are.''

WITH WELLS TAKING CONTROL, THE YANKS BREATHE EASIER
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ Forty-eight hours changed everything for the
Yankees, 48 hours and two victories. After the Yankees beat the
Indians, 5-3, in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series
on Sunday, taking a lead of 3 games to 2, George Steinbrenner left
town playfully teasing Indians fans who had razzed him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, taunted mercilessly by fans who referred to his
deceased mother as he warmed up, pitched seven and one-third
innings for the victory. David Cone, who departed Jacobs Field with
a stony glare after the Yankees' defeat in Game 3, dressed with a
smile Sunday, preparing to fly back to New York and pitch Game 6 in
the four-of-seven-game series on Tuesday. Chuck Knoblauch, mocked
by the crowd here 48 hours ago, is grinning again after spurring a
first-inning rally that the Indians would refer to as the turning
point in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Yankees were reeling and, as Steinbrenner said,
``People were burying us.'' Now, with one more victory, the team
vying to be considered one of the best ever will move on to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians operated with a disadvantage in manpower. Catcher
Sandy Alomar, already bothered by right shoulder and left knee
pain, suffered back spasms, was forced to leave Game 4 and may be
finished for the rest of the series. Einar Diaz started in his
place Sunday, with infielder Jeff Branson anxiously fearing the
possibility that Diaz would be hurt and Branson would be needed as
an emergency catcher. Then, about two hours before Game 5,
outfielder David Justice approached Manager Mike Hargrove and asked
out of the starting lineup, saying he wouldn't feel comfortable
batting against the left-handed David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's lineup included three rookies _ Diaz, first baseman
Richie Sexson and second baseman Enrique Wilson. Chad Ogea, who was
left off the Indians' roster in their division series against the
Red Sox, was on the mound. Every aspect of this matchup favored the
Yankees, who needed to seize control immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, a favorite of the Cleveland fans since his mental
mistake allowed the Indians to score the tie-breaking run in Game
2, led off for the Yankees and took two called strikes. Ogea then
attempted to push Knoblauch away from the plate, but Knoblauch did
not flinch; the pitch bounced off his left side.
</P>
<P>
   The game began among late afternoon shadows, the plate in
darkness and an alley of light between the mound and home, and
Derek Jeter said later that he was unable to see the ball as he
struck out on five pitches. These were not the type of conditions
in which batters take full, comfortable swings, and for this
reason, among others, Yankees Manager Joe Torre may have felt
compelled to press the action.
</P>
<P>
   With Paul O'Neill batting, Knoblauch broke from first base on a
steal attempt, and shortstop Omar Vizquel began moving to cover
second. O'Neill chopped a grounder that seemed destined for second
base. ``The ball was coming right at me,'' Vizquel said. ``It was
chest-high, no doubt a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ogea jumped and reached for the bouncer, the ball glancing
off his glove and past Vizquel, into short left field, rolling far
enough for Knoblauch to scamper to third base. Ogea could have been
out of the inning. Instead, the Yankees had runners at first and
third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed everything,'' Vizquel said. ``The whole game
turned at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill stole second without a throw and Bernie Williams walked,
filling the bases; Ogea's pitch total was 18 and counting, and then
he fell behind Chili Davis, 2 balls and 1 strike. Davis then turned
on a low pitch and laced a grounder to the right side of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Through the shadows, Williams did not see the bouncer heading
directly at him. Williams started moving toward second, the ball
bearing down on him. If it had hit him, he would have been out
automatically, and the Yankees' rally would have been stunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to hit me for sure,'' Williams said.
``I don't know how it missed me.'' As Williams lifted his right
foot, the ball skipped just under his instep, a margin of perhaps
an inch, before ricocheting off the glove of Sexson and into short
right field. Knoblauch scored, O'Neill scored, and Williams charged
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Ogea hit Tino Martinez on the top of the foot with his next
pitch, loading the bases again. Tim Raines grounded to second, with
Cleveland's infield playing back, enabling Williams to rush across
the plate unencumbered. The Yankees led 3-0, having received the
initial burst of offense they needed, no matter how absurd.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Wells some room to absorb Cleveland's two runs in the
bottom of the inning. The Yankees scored single runs in the second
and fourth innings, taking a 5-2 advantage, before Jim Thome banged
his third home run of the series, a solo shot that carried 439 feet
and caused Wells to exclaim ``Wow!'' with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became serious for the Yankees in the bottom of
the eighth. Wells struck out Vizquel to lead off the inning, his
third consecutive strikeout and his 11th in the game. Wells, who
sometimes throws 130 to 135 pitches, had reached 101. But with
right-handed-batting Travis Fryman coming up, Torre strolled to the
mound to replace Wells, who was incredulous, complaining that he
had made only one bad pitch. When Wells' replacement, Jeff Nelson,
hit Fryman with a fastball to bring the tying run to the plate,
Wells violated protocol by stalking out of the dugout before the
end of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Manny Ramirez dumped a single in front of Raines, who was
playing left field, driving the crowd of 44,966 into a comeback
frenzy. Torre replaced Nelson with the closer Mariano Rivera, and
no doubt Wells was pacing somewhere in the Yankees' clubhouse _
probably wondering, like many nervous Yankees fans, whether Torre
had been guilty of over-managing.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera threw a sinking fastball and Mark Whiten bounced to
second, where Knoblauch began an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the Yankees prepared to leave for New York,
Steinbrenner walked into the bathroom, where Cone was shaving.
``Ready, buddy?'' Steinbrenner asked of his Game 6 starter. ``We're
going to kick some rear end Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   In another 48 hours. &QL;

TALKS TIE YANKEES' SALE PRICE TO POST-SEASON SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ As if Yankees players did not face enough pressure
playing for George Steinbrenner, a deal to sell the team to
Cablevision Systems could bring Steinbrenner more money depending
on how the Yankees fare in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official familiar with Steinbrenner's negotiations
with Cablevision said Sunday that the company's offer is based on
the Yankees' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much for the division series, so much for the
league series, so much for the World Series,'' said the official.
``It's not cumulative. There's a certain amount for each level.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, without offering specifics, acknowledged the
existence of different levels of payment in the offer Cablevision
has made but said: ``It's based on having a deal, and I don't have
a deal. We don't have any agreement. In the future that may be in
there, but it's not in there for this year unless we have a deal,
and we don't have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another baseball official who knew about the outline of the
multiple-tiered offer said he had heard the price could go from
$500 million to $650 million depending on how the Yankees did in
the post-season. Another official said he had heard the figures
could go from $600 million to $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the talks between Steinbrenner and Cablevision,
the Long Island-based company that owns Madison Square Garden, has
been the source of intense speculation. One person close to the
Yankee organization said he had been told the deal was complete and
would be announced after the World Series, but none of the
officials who discussed the sale prices knew whether the deal was
that far along, and Steinbrenner flatly denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Complete or not, a sale now seems more likely than ever, as hard
as that might be to believe for people who know Steinbrenner's
passion for the Yankees. Everyone who discussed it Sunday said the
sale appeared to be inevitable; they all spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that a deal would provide for Steinbrenner to
continue running the team. One of the officials who discussed the
sales figures said the deal was structured for the 68-year-old
Steinbrenner to run the team for three years. Another official said
he understood that the sale had not been completed but that a
tentative understanding about a procedure involving Steinbrenner
had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate executive who knows both Steinbrenner and Charles F.
Dolan, the head of Cablevision, said there was no question they had
been working on a deal. Dolan, the executive said, would have no
trouble letting Steinbrenner run the team and would not interfere
with him in that role.
</P>
<P>
   A team that is doing well is always more attractive than a loser
and understandably commands a higher price, but a multiple-tiered
purchase price would be novel in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is willing to pay more for a league or World Series
champion because it will be a more attractive television commodity.
Cablevision, through its purchase of the MSG Network, has rights to
the Yankees for two more seasons. If the Yankees' post-season
success created higher ratings for their cablecasts on MSG,
Cablevision could command higher rates for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the Yankees makes sense for Cablevision because it would
give the company television rights to the team as long as it was
the owner. The existing contract pays the Yankees $486 million for
12 years, and Dolan might figure that if he would have to pay more
than that in a new agreement, he might as well buy the team, not
just television rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinbrenner has rejected offers for the Yankees over
the years, it makes sense for him to sell the team now, considering
his age. He has acknowledged that neither of his sons, Henry and
Harold, nor his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, has expressed an
interest in owning the team.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Steinbrenner, who is known as Hank, was briefly involved
in the Yankee operation about a dozen years ago. Harold
Steinbrenner and Swindal are general partners of the Yankees but
have played no visible role in the operation of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has been the principal owner for 26 seasons. When
he led a group that bought the Yankees for $10 million in 1973, he
owned less than a majority, but he and family members now own 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The limited partners reportedly have heard from Steinbrenner
about a possible sale, but he is also said to have warned them not
to talk to anyone about it. One person close to the Yankees said he
understood that most of the limited partners supported the idea of
a sale.
</P>
<P>
   However, one limited partner who was reached Sunday said he had
not heard anything from Steinbrenner and did not know the status of
a possible sale.

`ANTZ' DEFENDS SPOT ATOP BOX OFFICE HILL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Moviegoers continued marching to the nation's
multiplexes for ``Antz'' as the computer-animated comedy topped the
weekend box office with an estimated $15.4 million at 2,813
theaters during Friday-Sunday, studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' the first animated film from DreamWorks SKG, has drawn
$36.3 million in 10 days after setting a record for an October
debut. It should easily top ``Beavis &AMP; Butt-head Do America's'' $63
million record as the top non-Disney animated film by the end of
its run.
</P>
<P>
   Most impressively, the weekend-to-weekend decline of ``Antz''
was a mere 11 percent as the studio added 364 theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The approval ratings on `Antz' have been over 90 percent, so
it should continue to do well and gross about $75 million,'' said
Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel Source forecasting service.
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Antz'' will benefit from many children being
out of school today for Columbus Day, which was expected to lead to
heavier-than-usual Sunday moviegoing. ``With a Monday holiday,
Sunday is almost like a Saturday for kids,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks distribution chief James Tharp said ``Antz'' is
drawing from a broad audience. ``We're getting about 50 percent
nonfamily viewers, which is pretty good for an animated film,'' he
noted.
</P>
<P>
   Holdover films took the next three slots, led by New Line's
fourth weekend of hit comedy ``Rush Hour'' with $11.2 million at
2,701 theaters to edge PolyGram's second weekend of spiritual drama
``What Dreams May Come,'' with $10.9 million at 2,526 theaters.
``Rush Hour,'' with $98.4 million in 24 days, could take in an
additional $30 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's slapstick comedy ``A Night at the Roxbury'' repeated
its fourth-place finish with $6.2 million at 2,169 sites as
moviegoers ignored some of the worst reviews of the year. With
$17.8 million after 10 days, it has already topped its estimated
$17 million production cost.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only major opening, Eddie Murphy's ``Holy Man,''
debuted in fifth place with a disappointing $5.2 million at 2,013
theaters for Disney. Bucksbaum said the comedy, with Murphy playing
a televangelist turned loose on a shopping channel, suffered from
Murphy's lack of promotional work on the movie, an ineffective
trailer and Disney's apparent focus on coming potential hits _
Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved'' and its computer-animated ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum forecast ``Holy Man'' will gross about $25 million
overall, or less than a fifth of Murphy's last entry, ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' which took in $142 million over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lackluster opening for ``Holy Man,'' the weekend
continued the market's strong performance during what is
traditionally a slow period. Weekend overall grosses were in the
$72 million range and up 8 percent over the same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like people were interested this weekend in seeing
films they missed last weekend,'' Bucksbaum observed.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of thrillers in their third weekends took the next two
spots with Sony's ``Urban Legend'' grossing $4.8 million to edge
MGM's ``Ronin'' with $4.6 million. Finishing a still-strong eighth
was ``There's Something About Mary'' with $3 million at 1,933
theaters to bring the comedy's 89-day total to $162.1 million for
20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' now in its 13th week, has become the 50th-highest
domestic grosser ever after ``Batman Returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were the fourth weekend of Universal's
family drama ``One True Thing'' with $1.9 million at 1,565 theaters
and DreamWorks' 12th weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan'' with $1.4
million at 1,230 screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' has grossed $186.3 million after 80 days
and is now the 28th-highest domestic grosser after ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratosphere's limited opening of police drama ``One Tough Cop''
generated little interest with $578,000 at 417 theaters, while
Miramax's family drama ``The Mighty'' debuted with a respectable
$86,000 at nine sites and will move into wide release later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is near $5.2 billion and 12 percent ahead
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Rush Hour'' will face
competition next weekend from the opening of ``Beloved'' and Warner
Bros.' debut of ``Practical Magic,'' a comic romance starring
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.

   CLEVELAND _ Forty-eight hours changed everything for the
Yankees, 48 hours and two victories. After the Yankees beat the
Indians, 5-3, in Game 5 of the American League Championship Series
on Sunday, taking a lead of 3 games to 2, George Steinbrenner left
town playfully teasing Indians fans who had razzed him on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   David Wells, taunted mercilessly by fans who referred to his
deceased mother as he warmed up, pitched seven and one-third
innings for the victory. David Cone, who departed Jacobs Field with
a stony glare after the Yankees' defeat in Game 3, dressed with a
smile Sunday, preparing to fly back to New York and pitch Game 6 in
the four-of-seven-game series on Tuesday. Chuck Knoblauch, mocked
by the crowd here 48 hours ago, is grinning again after spurring a
first-inning rally that the Indians would refer to as the turning
point in the game.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Yankees were reeling and, as Steinbrenner said,
``People were burying us.'' Now, with one more victory, the team
vying to be considered one of the best ever will move on to the
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians operated with a disadvantage in manpower. Catcher
Sandy Alomar, already bothered by right shoulder and left knee
pain, suffered back spasms, was forced to leave Game 4 and may be
finished for the rest of the series. Einar Diaz started in his
place Sunday, with infielder Jeff Branson anxiously fearing the
possibility that Diaz would be hurt and Branson would be needed as
an emergency catcher. Then, about two hours before Game 5,
outfielder David Justice approached Manager Mike Hargrove and asked
out of the starting lineup, saying he wouldn't feel comfortable
batting against the left-handed David Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland's lineup included three rookies _ Diaz, first baseman
Richie Sexson and second baseman Enrique Wilson. Chad Ogea, who was
left off the Indians' roster in their division series against the
Red Sox, was on the mound. Every aspect of this matchup favored the
Yankees, who needed to seize control immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch, a favorite of the Cleveland fans since his mental
mistake allowed the Indians to score the tie-breaking run in Game
2, led off for the Yankees and took two called strikes. Ogea then
attempted to push Knoblauch away from the plate, but Knoblauch did
not flinch; the pitch bounced off his left side.
</P>
<P>
   The game began among late afternoon shadows, the plate in
darkness and an alley of light between the mound and home, and
Derek Jeter said later that he was unable to see the ball as he
struck out on five pitches. These were not the type of conditions
in which batters take full, comfortable swings, and for this
reason, among others, Yankees Manager Joe Torre may have felt
compelled to press the action.
</P>
<P>
   With Paul O'Neill batting, Knoblauch broke from first base on a
steal attempt, and shortstop Omar Vizquel began moving to cover
second. O'Neill chopped a grounder that seemed destined for second
base. ``The ball was coming right at me,'' Vizquel said. ``It was
chest-high, no doubt a double play.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ogea jumped and reached for the bouncer, the ball glancing
off his glove and past Vizquel, into short left field, rolling far
enough for Knoblauch to scamper to third base. Ogea could have been
out of the inning. Instead, the Yankees had runners at first and
third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That changed everything,'' Vizquel said. ``The whole game
turned at that moment.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill stole second without a throw and Bernie Williams walked,
filling the bases; Ogea's pitch total was 18 and counting, and then
he fell behind Chili Davis, 2 balls and 1 strike. Davis then turned
on a low pitch and laced a grounder to the right side of the
infield.
</P>
<P>
   Through the shadows, Williams did not see the bouncer heading
directly at him. Williams started moving toward second, the ball
bearing down on him. If it had hit him, he would have been out
automatically, and the Yankees' rally would have been stunted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was going to hit me for sure,'' Williams said.
``I don't know how it missed me.'' As Williams lifted his right
foot, the ball skipped just under his instep, a margin of perhaps
an inch, before ricocheting off the glove of Sexson and into short
right field. Knoblauch scored, O'Neill scored, and Williams charged
to third.
</P>
<P>
   Ogea hit Tino Martinez on the top of the foot with his next
pitch, loading the bases again. Tim Raines grounded to second, with
Cleveland's infield playing back, enabling Williams to rush across
the plate unencumbered. The Yankees led 3-0, having received the
initial burst of offense they needed, no matter how absurd.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Wells some room to absorb Cleveland's two runs in the
bottom of the inning. The Yankees scored single runs in the second
and fourth innings, taking a 5-2 advantage, before Jim Thome banged
his third home run of the series, a solo shot that carried 439 feet
and caused Wells to exclaim ``Wow!'' with a smile on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The situation became serious for the Yankees in the bottom of
the eighth. Wells struck out Vizquel to lead off the inning, his
third consecutive strikeout and his 11th in the game. Wells, who
sometimes throws 130 to 135 pitches, had reached 101. But with
right-handed-batting Travis Fryman coming up, Torre strolled to the
mound to replace Wells, who was incredulous, complaining that he
had made only one bad pitch. When Wells' replacement, Jeff Nelson,
hit Fryman with a fastball to bring the tying run to the plate,
Wells violated protocol by stalking out of the dugout before the
end of the inning.
</P>

   Manny Ramirez dumped a single in front of Raines, who was
playing left field, driving the crowd of 44,966 into a comeback
frenzy. Torre replaced Nelson with the closer Mariano Rivera, and
no doubt Wells was pacing somewhere in the Yankees' clubhouse _
probably wondering, like many nervous Yankees fans, whether Torre
had been guilty of over-managing.
</P>
<P>
   But Rivera threw a sinking fastball and Mark Whiten bounced to
second, where Knoblauch began an inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Later, as the Yankees prepared to leave for New York,
Steinbrenner walked into the bathroom, where Cone was shaving.
``Ready, buddy?'' Steinbrenner asked of his Game 6 starter. ``We're
going to kick some rear end Tuesday.''

USC STRUGGLES ON SIDELINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two months ago, if you told a USC coach, player or
fan that the Trojans would be 4-2 today, and they were forced to
give an honest answer, most of those people would probably be
fairly satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   So why are so many feeling numb following Saturday's 32-31 loss
to California?
</P>
<P>
   It's a little more complicated than pinning it all on the
21-point lead that the Trojans blew in the game's final 19 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The real question is if several subtle but crucial decisions
will be made in time for USC to remain a factor in the Pacific-10
Conference race the remainder of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our team has character. We're not going to allow ourselves to
be down,'' tailback Petros Papadakis said. ``You take the good,
correct the bad and go on.''
</P>
<P>
   The good part is that the Trojans play hard and are in excellent
physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The bad part is what seems to be happening on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Too often, USC seems mired in a close-to-the-vest mentality.
Even coach Paul Hackett was second-guessing himself for kicking a
field goal with seven seconds left and the ball inside the Cal
1-yard line at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   That's plenty of time for one more pass and then the field goal.
If the Trojans had run and failed to score the touchdown, it's
unlikely too many people would fault them for their courage.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Abrams had certainly never kicked a shorter field goal in
his career, and there's a logical reason why: You go for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That one's gonna haunt me,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Hackett could have taken as much heat going for the
extra point while trailing Arizona State 24-19. The Sun Devils
committed a penalty and he changed his mind and went for two. But
Hackett said later that he had a ``momentary'' lapse by going for
two points, because the ``chart'' said you go for one point in that
situation, and you don't take points off the scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It would be interesting to see what the ``chart'' says about
teams that average 10 penalties a game. Last year, it was
considered one of the reasons John Robinson wasn't getting the job
done.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the penalty issue, we've been able to dodge the bullet,''
Hackett said. ``But tonight, we weren't able to dodge the bullet.''
</P>
<P>
   The inordinate amount of penalties the offensive line commits
will probably never improve this season, but USC has not yet
responded to this problem.
</P>
<P>
   As Florida State and even Cal proved, the Trojans can be easily
overwhelmed by a solid pass rush.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett is no fan of the shotgun, but if the offensive line is
mediocre at best, something has to be done to give the quarterback
_ whoever it is _ more time to throw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   This might have also been the first game in which the
two-quarterback system went awry. Mike Van Raaphorst lost his
rhythm and Carson Palmer never had a chance to establish one
against the Bears. No matter who was playing quarterback, he would
have been better served playing the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   And why is there so much confusion halfway through the season
that timeouts are burned and delay- of-game penalties occur in key
moments of the second half?
</P>
<P>
   Whether these issues are corrected should determine which
direction the season takes.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Hackett said Sunday he was hopeful tailback Chad Morton
would return for Saturday's game against Washington State.

2,701 theaters to edge PolyGram's second weekend of spiritual drama
``What Dreams May Come,'' with $10.9 million at 2,526 theaters.
``Rush Hour,'' with $98.4 million in 24 days, could take in an
additional $30 million by the end of its run.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's slapstick comedy ``A Night at the Roxbury'' repeated
its fourth-place finish with $6.2 million at 2,169 sites as
moviegoers ignored some of the worst reviews of the year. With
$17.8 million after 10 days, it has already topped its estimated
$17 million production cost.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend's only major opening, Eddie Murphy's ``Holy Man,''
debuted in fifth place with a disappointing $5.2 million at 2,013
theaters for Disney. Bucksbaum said the comedy, with Murphy playing
a televangelist turned loose on a shopping channel, suffered from
Murphy's lack of promotional work on the movie, an ineffective
trailer and Disney's apparent focus on coming potential hits _
Oprah Winfrey's ``Beloved'' and its computer-animated ``A Bug's
Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum forecast ``Holy Man'' will gross about $25 million
overall, or less than a fifth of Murphy's last entry, ``Dr.
Dolittle,'' which took in $142 million over the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lackluster opening for ``Holy Man,'' the weekend
continued the market's strong performance during what is
traditionally a slow period. Weekend overall grosses were in the
$72 million range and up 8 percent over the same weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like people were interested this weekend in seeing
films they missed last weekend,'' Bucksbaum observed.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of thrillers in their third weekends took the next two
spots with Sony's ``Urban Legend'' grossing $4.8 million to edge
MGM's ``Ronin'' with $4.6 million. Finishing a still-strong eighth
was ``There's Something About Mary'' with $3 million at 1,933
theaters to bring the comedy's 89-day total to $162.1 million for
20th Century Fox.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mary,'' now in its 13th week, has become the 50th-highest
domestic grosser ever after ``Batman Returns.''
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were the fourth weekend of Universal's
family drama ``One True Thing'' with $1.9 million at 1,565 theaters
and DreamWorks' 12th weekend of ``Saving Private Ryan'' with $1.4
million at 1,230 screens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' has grossed $186.3 million after 80 days
and is now the 28th-highest domestic grosser after ``Toy Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Stratosphere's limited opening of police drama ``One Tough Cop''
generated little interest with $578,000 at 417 theaters, while
Miramax's family drama ``The Mighty'' debuted with a respectable
$86,000 at nine sites and will move into wide release later this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Year-to-date business is near $5.2 billion and 12 percent ahead
of the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Antz,'' ``What Dreams May Come'' and ``Rush Hour'' will face
competition next weekend from the opening of ``Beloved'' and Warner
Bros.' debut of ``Practical Magic,'' a comic romance starring
Sandra Bullock and Nicole Kidman.

BASEBALL COLUMN: DAVIS PRODUCES AS DESIGNATED HITTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ When the designated hitter was introduced into the
World Series in 1976, the Yankees were thought to have an advantage
because they and their players, after all, had experience with the
role. But the Yankees died with their d.h.'s, while the Cincinnati
Reds, with no d.h. experience, thrived.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Driessen, performing as a d.h. for the first time, collected
five hits in 14 at-bats for a .357 average. Carlos May didn't get a
hit in nine at-bats for the Yankees, whose designated hitters over
all had one hit in 16 at-bats for an .063 average.
</P>
<P>
   Flash forward to this postseason, and nothing had changed. In
the division series against Texas, the Yankees' hitters-only, Chili
Davis and Tim Raines, had two hits in 10 chances. In the first
three games of the American League Championship Series against
Cleveland, the same players had two hits in eight at-bats. Nowhere
in there had a Yankees' designated hitter driven in a run.
</P>
<P>
   Then Davis made a breakthrough in Game 4, helping turn a 1-0
lead into a 3-0 lead by driving home a run with a double and
positioning another runner to score on an ensuing sacrifice fly.
That effort, however, turned out to be only a prelude for his
performance in Game 5 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Supplying the offensive punch the Yankees had lacked for all but
one inning in their two postseason series, d.h. Davis singled home
two runs in the first inning and hit a home run in the fourth as
the Yankees trimmed the Indians, 5-3, and took a three-games-to-two
lead home to New York.
</P>
<P>
   By driving in three runs, Davis produced more runs than the
Yankees had scored in three of their previous seven postseason
games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to score early,'' Davis said later. ``We had to have
them play catch-up baseball, and we did exactly that.''
</P>
<P>
   His first-inning single drove in the Yankees' first two runs and
his fourth-inning home run produced the last. The Indians played
catch-up, but they didn't catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whom the Yankees signed 10 months ago as a free agent,
was injured in the second game of the season and didn't catch up to
his new teammates until mid-August. An operation reconstructed a
tendon and ligaments in his right ankle, and he missed 118 games.
He didn't start his first game as a Yankee at Yankee Stadium until
Aug. 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad it happened earlier rather than later,'' Davis said.
``This club played excellent ball without me. I wondered if I was
even needed here. It's nice to be able to contribute at any time,
no matter what you've done in the regular season, if you've played
or not.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees indeed did not miss Davis, even though they had
added him to the team to be the full-time designated hitter. They
had Darryl Strawberry and Tim Raines for the d.h. spot when either
wasn't playing left field, and they kept winning, so they didn't
need the 38-year-old, switch-hitting Davis.
</P>
<P>
   But they sure needed him Sunday. When he went to bat in the
first inning against Chad Ogea, the bases were loaded and the
Yankees had one out. He drilled a shot that Richie Sexson, the
Indians' 6-foot-7-inch first baseman, dived for but couldn't snare.
The ball skipped off his glove and scooted into right field as
Chuck Knoblauch and Paul O'Neill raced home.
</P>
<P>
   ``He likes his change-up,'' Davis said of Ogea. ``He has a good
fastball. You have to pick out one of the two. I really wasn't
sitting on a change-up, but he threw one and got it up, and I
wanted something up to keep off the ground. He got it up and I hit
it pretty good. He made a pretty good play to knock it down. If he
doesn't, it could've gone down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis was not so pleased with his at-bat in the second inning.
The Yankees had scored their fourth run earlier in the inning, and
Jaret Wright, whom Ogea had replaced in the series starting
rotation, replaced Ogea in the first relief appearance of his
five-year professional career. Davis grounded into an inning-ending
double play, courtesy of a fine defensive play by Omar Vizquel, the
Indians' talented shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to get a pitch I could hit in the air,'' Davis
said. ``It was first and third and one out. I had never faced Jaret
before. The first pitch he throws probably was 98 miles an hour. I
got on top of it and hit it on the ground. Omar makes a barehanded
play. If he catches that ball with his glove, I think I have a
chance to beat it at first. I was disappointed that I hit the ball
on the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   But when he batted the next time, in the fourth inning, Davis
corrected the Wright problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just looking for something out over the plate,'' related
Davis, who hit two home runs for Minnesota in the 1991 World
Series. ``I know the young man throws hard. In fact, I found out
the next time up. He blew me away. But there I'm just looking for
something out over the plate to drive to the big part of the field.
He threw a change-up middle in, and I stayed with it and got the
big part of the bat on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis knows his limitations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are certain things I can't do, certain pitches I can't
hit,'' he said. ``You stay away from them. You try to wait for
pitches you can hit. The bat speed isn't what it used to be. You
make up for it by using your head, working counts, getting ahead in
counts and getting pitches to hit and hitting them hard.''
</P>
<P>
   His veteran knowledge far outdid his aging limitations on
Sunday.

THE BALL REMAINS IN PLAY FOR VIZQUEL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLEVELAND _ The unflinching Omar Vizquel used every inch of his
talent _ including his bare hands _ to stop the Yankees from
barging into town and swiping the feel-good atmosphere that was
swirling around the Indians' clubhouse as the weekend began.
</P>
<P>
   But the same locker room that on Thursday was alive with salsa
music in the background and filled with playful jabs after Game 3
on Friday, was eerily quiet Sunday night long after the Yankees
took Game 5, 5-3. And suddenly an Indians team with a 2-1 edge is
faced with going back to Yankee Stadium down, 3-2, in this
four-of-seven-game American League Championship Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to be easy, but this team has come from behind
before,'' Vizquel said. ``We can't hang our heads. The series has
changed a little, but we still have a chance. It's just going to
take everyone giving 110 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   That might have been an invitation to David Justice. There were
some within the Indians' clubhouse who wondered if Justice, who
took a pitch off his right elbow in Game 4, could have been in the
lineup for Game 5. But Justice took himself out before the game,
perhaps feeling less than comfortable facing David Wells. Justice,
who is a career .125 hitter against Wells, caused the Indians to
reshuffle their lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt in talking to him that he could have played,'' said
Manger Mike Hargrove, who used Justice as a pinch-hitter against
Mariano Rivera in the ninth. ``I chose to go with a right-hander in
the lineup. Based on the fact that David had been hit in the
forearm the night before and wasn't feeling really comfortable with
the left-handed pitching right now, that's the reason we changed.''
</P>
<P>
   While Justice didn't feel comfortable, Vizquel was absorbing a
punishing day for his team. After he had done everything humanly
and superhumanly possible defensively _ which included a
spectacular barehanded play on a hard bouncer by Chili Davis in the
second inning to turn a double play _ he also absorbed the sting at
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel took an inside pitch from Wells off his left hand in the
fifth inning, part of a day in which he was 2 for 3 with a run
scored. This kind of effort came on the heels of Game 4, when he
went 3 for 4. He has been one of the few consistencies at the plate
for the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in a groove right now,'' Vizquel said. ``I'm really seeing
the ball well. I hope some of the other hitters get in a groove
soon. We have to have the little guys and the big guys getting it
together at the same time.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice is one of those big guys. But he has been ineffective in
this ALCS, and Jim Thome has had to pick up the power in his
absence. Thome hit his third home run of this series Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a tough road ahead of us,'' Thome said. ``We have to
stay positive, though.''
</P>
<P>
   It's hard when so much is against them. Also hurting the Indians
is the injured Sandy Alomar, whose back stiffened up in Game 4. No
one was doubting Alomar's pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he really wants to play,'' Vizquel said. ``I hope he
can take some drugs and play.''
</P>
<P>
   Vizquel broke open in a laugh, and he was about the only one in
the Indians' clubhouse who could force a smile. Others looked
snake-bitten, including starter Chad Ogea. He was one ground ball
from ending the first inning on a double play and avoiding three
first-inning runs. Instead of letting the grounder get to Vizquel,
Ogea reached for it and deflected it so that everyone was safe.
</P>
<P>
   Ogea lasted just one and one-third innings. And in a role
reversal, Jaret Wright, the same struggling pitcher Ogea had
relieved in Game 1, came on to do the same for him. In Game 1, it
was the young Wright who was beaten up by the Yankees for five runs
in the first inning. A calm Ogea trotted in from the bullpen to
pitch five and two-thirds innings, and gave up just two runs.
</P>
<P>
   This time it was Wright's turn to pick up the pieces left by
Ogea. In his first relief appearance in his career, Wright went six
innings and gave up two hits and one earned run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt good,'' Wright said. ``The difference between today and
the last time was that I had the placement on my fastball. But I
wouldn't second-guess anyone's decision to start Chad.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogea's misfortune in the first was typical of the way things
have been going for the Indians. Cleveland has been outscored,
10-2, in the first inning by the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we've done well, we've had the pitching with us,''
Vizquel said. ``When we do the little things, we win. We have been
in situations where we've been down before and come back. We have
to believe that this time, too.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Losses are heavy in victory
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ First, the Florida Gators lost their leading
passer to a season-ending knee injury. Now they'll have to play at
least one game _ and maybe more _ without their top runner.
</P>
<P>
   Senior tailback Terry Jackson will miss Saturday's home game
against Auburn with a severly sprained ankle. Jackson, the SEC's
third-leading rusher with 577 yards, was hurt Saturday night in the
third quarter of Florida's 22-10 victory over LSU.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry's going to be out two-to-three weeks,'' UF coach Steve
Spurrier said. ``Hopefully, he'll be back for the (Oct. 31) Georgia
game. But it could be longer than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's loss isn't good news to an offense that lost starter
Jesse Palmer with a broken right clavicle in the second quarter
against LSU. He will be replacd by Robert Gillespie, a true
freshman who led UF with 13 carries for 72 yards against LSU. He
has 34 carries for 175 yards and 11 catches for 219 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said Palmer and All-America defensive tackle Ed Chester
(dislocated knee) both will miss the rest of the regular season,
though Palmer likely would be available for Florida's bowl game.
When he was hurt, Palmer was the SEC's most efficient passer (and
third in the nation), having completed 73-of-123 for 1,246 yards,
14 TDs and five interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Johnson, who alternated with Palmer the previous three
games, looked shaky against LSU. He completed 13-of-22 for 156
yards, a touchdown and no interceptions. But he had at least two
interceptions that were dropped and another that was nullifed by a
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we hadn't recovered three of our four fumbles, and they
don't drop those interceptions, we could have lost,'' Spurrier
said. ``We've got to do a better job of taking care of the
football.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier a no-show: Why the Gators threw a pass and called three
runs instead of taking a knee three times when they got the ball
back with 1:51 left remains a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier wasn't available to answer that question because he
skipped his regular Sunday teleconference with reporters. Spurrier
instead attended the Florida's soccer team's 1-1 tie with
top-ranked North Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier taped a short interview with a school official that was
made available to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Pollard update: Spurrier said he will wait until mid-week to
decide whether starting cornerback Dock Pollard will play against
Auburn. He was suspended from the LSU game by the university for
skipping classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll look during the week and see if he deserves another
(suspension) from the coaches,'' Spurrier said. ``We tell our
players to go to class and don't let your teammates down by getting
suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurrier said true freshman Robert Cromartie likely would start
against Auburn, anyway. Cromartie and sophomore Benny Alexander
both played well against LSU.

 &HT;    UM's Warren suffers seizure on trip home
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Sophomore defensive end David Warren had
a scary trip home from Miami on Saturday, but he was not
hospitalized after having a mild seizure on the airplane, FSU
spokesman Rob Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second seizure in less than 10 weeks for Warren, who
was credited unofficially with one tackle against Miami.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure happened about halfway through the 80-minute flight
from Miami to Tallahassee aboard the team plane, Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Players thought he was cramping up but then one of them yelled
he was having a seizure,'' said Wilson, who was on the plane. ``The
doctors were four or five rows away so they got to him in 20
seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   A team official stayed with Warren throughout Saturday night to
watch him.
</P>
<P>
   The Tyler, Texas, native is scheduled today to begin a battery
of tests, including an MRI, CAT scan and blood work.
</P>
<P>
   He is out of practice at least until the tests are completed,
Wilson said. Doctors also told him that if no cause for the
seizures is found, Warren will receive medication to treat them.

   The 1997 USA Today Defensive Player of the Year also had what
doctors believe was a seizure Aug.5 during two-a-day practices. His
roommate, Donald Heaven, found him unconscious on their dorm room
floor. He was released from Tallahassee Memorial Regional Hospital
after doctors found no cause.
</P>
<P>
   Neurologists and other doctors did exhaustive tests in the
following days but also found nothing. He had had no history of
seizures and was cleared to play three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said Warren, who turns 20 on Wednesday, was not
unconscious during Saturday's attack, but he ``didn't know what was
happening to him.'' Coaches and teammates were unsettled, Wilson
said, but not overwhelmed with worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never any look of panic on the doctor's faces,''
Wilson said. ``And that was reassuring.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Weinke release: Coach Bobby Bowden was so pleased with
quarterback Chris Weinke's performance in FSU's 26-14 win at Miami
that he intends to turn over more control of the offense to him in
the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing I liked best about it was we were able to throw and
kill them,'' Bowden said. ``It took the guy that has been taking
all the criticism this year and he goes out and he beats them.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Weinke's six interceptions against North Carolina State,
that hasn't been Weinke's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to take the game out of the quarterback's hands,''
he said. ``We've given it to the tailback. We've given it to the
fullback. We've faked throws more than ever before.''
</P>
<P>
   But no more, Bowden said Sunday. The Seminoles (5-1) improved to
No.6 in the Associated Press poll and No.7 in the coaches poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saturday) is the first time I felt we made a step forward,
that we might be getting to where I want us to be,'' Bowden said.
``Now (offensive coordinator Mark) Richt is going to want to put
more offense back into the quarterback's hands.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Injury report: LB Lamont Green (dislocated left elbow) is out
this week at least. Doctors will determine how much longer his
injury will need later this week. Other injuries: P Keith Cottrell
(right hip flexor strain), FS Shawn McCorkel (left shoulder
separation), FS Dexter Jackson (left hamstring reinjury), FB Billy
Rhodes (lower back bruise) and WR Ron Dugans (let hip pointer) will
be out of contact at least early this week.

laboratory in Mountain View, Calif., now a glass-sided ergonomics
furniture showroom, turned into a historic site. The building,
officials of this sprawling city of 75,000 next door to Palo Alto
say, is nothing less than the ``Birthplace of Silicon Valley.'' The
site is where Bill Hewlett and William Packard hatched their

4-year-old daughter both have AIDS, but live far from needed
services. As the HIV virus becomes more common in women nationally,
health experts are especially worried about rural women because
they are often more isolated, less independent and less assertive
than other people. Rural AIDS victims now make up an increasing
share of the nation's AIDS cases. (Bill Stover/New York Times

brushing the Ozarks, she has found it to be something people have a
hard time accepting. Ms. Elliott, a mother of two, tried to keep it
quiet, but with a population of only 700, she says, if ``you know
something, the other side of town knows it.'' Both of Ms. Elliot's
children have had to fend off taunts about their mother. (Roy

TOUGH BRUINS STEP IT UP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the most impressive win of Bob Toledo's
tenure _ yes, more impressive than USC in '96 and Washington in '97
_ one question: If not Arizona, then who?
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins took Arizona's best shot Saturday night. They
staggered momentarily, regained their balance, then responded with
a devastating fourth-quarter flurry that put an undefeated season
squarely into focus.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA lacks the type of dominating defense necessary to beat
Oregon, Washington and USC on a bad day. But if the Bruins play as
they did in Arizona Stadium _ if they avoid turnovers, make big
plays and physically overwhelm opponents _ it'll take a fabulous
performance to beat them.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely have the Bruins been more vulnerable than they were on
Saturday night, playing a hot team in a hostile environment without
their big-play receiver (Freddie Mitchell), their starting tailback
(Jermaine Lewis), their top defensive lineman (Kenyon Coleman), two
starting linebackers (Ramogi Huma and Mike Wiley).
</P>
<P>
   And yet . . .
</P>
<P>
   What made Saturday's 52-28 victory unique _ aside from being
UCLA's first in Tucson in 10 years _ was its subtlety.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-largest crowd in Arizona Stadium history (58,738)
wasn't so much disappointed as dazed. One minute, Wildcats receiver
Jeremy McDaniel makes a spectacular touchdown catch for a 28-24
lead. The next, UCLA scores on three consecutive plays and takes an
insurmountable lead.
</P>
<P>
   The game was so close for so long _ 47 minutes, to be exact _
and then, BAM! The Bruins bolted away. A long pass here, a turnover
there, and they're out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody had gone to the bathroom, they might not have
believed what happened,'' Arizona coach Dick Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins ended with a 28-0 surge and outgained Arizona 229-68
in the fourth quarter _ a marked contrast from their previous
visits, when the Bruins were not only beaten but beaten up. Above
all, this was a victory for strength coach Kevin Yoxall, who stands
behind only Toledo as the reason for UCLA's resurgence.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA was tougher and more physical, and we have to admit
that,'' Tomey said.
</P>
<P>
   More physical, and more resourceful. DeShaun Foster's
performance (118 yards) as Lewis' replacement was one example. Ryan
Nece for Huma at linebacker was another. Someone goes down, someone
fills in, the No. 2-ranked Bruins don't miss a beat. All those
September substitutions are paying dividends.
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Cade McNown's performance (10 of 24) was the subject
of much scrutiny during and after the game. But he didn't make
mistakes _ Arizona's quarterbacks were intercepted twice _ and he
made the biggest play: a 64-yard pass to Danny Farmer that gave
UCLA a 38-28 lead with 11 minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps McNown won't complete 60 percent of his passes this
season. But if he completes 45 percent of the routine plays and 90
percent of the big ones, victories will follow.
</P>
<P>
   Few people remember Jake Plummer's completion percentage in
Arizona State's 1996 comeback over UCLA. But everyone remembers
Plummer catching a trick pass and scampering through the UCLA
defense. It was the signature play of ASU's Rose Bowl season.
</P>
<P>
   So if not Arizona, then who? Oregon won't be easy. The Ducks
have one of the most potent offenses in the nation. Winning in
Husky Stadium is a chore, especially in November. USC? Anybody's
game.
</P>
<P>
   That was the theory Saturday night _ anybody's game _ and it
was. For 47 minutes. Can anyone hang with UCLA for 60?

ICE-CRUSHING BLAKE DELIVERS FOR KINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROGER PHILLIPS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ On the flight late Saturday night from Edmonton to
Vancouver, the Kings watched a video.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't watching Spice Girls, but they did see some pop in
the form of repeated replays of one of Rob Blake's greatest hits.
</P>
<P>
   Forty-seven seconds into Saturday night's season-opening 2-1
victory in Edmonton, Oilers forward Andrei Kovalenko carried the
puck into the Kings' zone while committing the cardinal hockey sin
of keeping his head down.
</P>
<P>
   Kovalenko was being covered by Mattias Norstrom, and skated to
his right. Little did he know Norstrom was setting him up. Blake
backed into Kovalenko, dropping him to the ice with a crushing but
clean check. It was several minutes before Kovalenko got up, though
he was able to remain in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get too many opportunities like that,'' said Blake,
whose team is the visitor for the Vancouver Canucks' season opener
at 2 p.m. this afternoon at GM Place. ``Mattie Norstrom brought him
right to me. It felt pretty nice. We've got to hit. That's the way
we're going to win. We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Storr to play: Stephane Fiset was excellent in goal Saturday,
but coach Larry Robinson said Jamie Storr will start today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't play him (today), we could be looking at two weeks
until we get him in again,'' Robinson said. ``I think Steph
deserves to be in the home opener (Friday against the Boston
Bruins).''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson is contemplating a couple of changes to combat the
Canucks' size. Steve McKenna, who is 6-foot-8, 247 pounds, and 6-3,
223-pound Roman Vopat may be moved into the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Rumor mill: At some point, it's expected the Kings will try to
acquire a proven goal-scorer, not only to add some punch to their
offense but to help draw fans to the Staples Center when it opens
next season.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Vancouver Province, the Kings are rumored to
have offered the New York Islanders $20 million for free-agent
winger Zigmund Palffy, who scored 45 goals last season. The
Province also reported that for holdout winger Pavel Bure, the
Kings offered the Canucks their choice of two of these three
players: Aki Berg, Olli Jokinen and Glen Murray. According to the
Province, the Canucks rejected the Kings' offer.
</P>
<P>
   Neither scenario seems in accordance with the Kings' commitment
to rebuilding. And Bure's questionable attitude, given that he has
refused to report to the Canucks despite being under contract, also
seems out of step with the Kings' focus on team chemistry.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Palffy or Bure certainly would add a
dimension the Kings lack and lift them a rung closer to being
contenders in the NHL's Western Conference.

STATES PREPARING FOR SPACE PLANE'S ROAD TRIP BACK TO LAUNCH SITE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY CHARLES F. BOSTWICK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. -- Lockheed Martin's X-33 space
plane will rocket from Southern California to Montana in 24
minutes, skimming the edge of space.
</P>
<P>
   But coming home will be almost as big an adventure -- though
considerably slower.
</P>
<P>
   As wide as eight big rigs placed side by side, the 32.5-ton
space plane will be trucked back to California over hundreds of
miles of two-lane highways -- crossing mountains, desert and the
Continental Divide, contending with overpasses, highway signs,
roadside trees and small towns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the largest load we've ever planned on moving on our
state highways,'' Department of Transportation spokesman Scott
Magruder said in Nevada, where officials may hold public hearings
to inform residents of the hamlets the behemoth will pass beginning
next summer.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly the size of the space shuttle but piloted by computers on
the ground, the wingless, wedge-shaped rocket plane will blast off
from a launch site now under construction at Edwards Air Force Base
in Southern California's Antelope Valley, north of Los Angeles. Its
purpose is to test technology needed for the VentureStar reusable
spacecraft -- Lockheed Martin's proposed entry in the commercial
space race.
</P>
<P>
   The X-33 is scheduled to make its maiden flight in late summer
to an Army air field at the Dugway Proving Grounds in western Utah.
The next five flights also will be to Dugway -- a 450-mile flight
that will take 14 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Its seventh flight will go to Malmstrom Air Force Base near
Great Falls, Mont., 950 miles from Edwards. That flight will take
24 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Rocketing in a steep arc toward Montana, the X-33 will zoom as
high as 250,000 feet -- 47 miles, or about six miles below the
280,000 feet at which the Air Force awarded its X-15 pilots
astronaut wings in the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin is not saying much about its transportation plan
for the return trip. The company is awaiting bids this week from
two unidentified companies to do the actual moving and doesn't want
to say anything until then that could affect the contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is still in a competitive nature,'' spokesman Ron Lindeke
said.
</P>
<P>
   But documents and interviews show that Lockheed Martin officials
originally planned to fly the X-33 back to Edwards piggyback on the
NASA 747 that regularly ferries space shuttles back and forth
between Florida's Kennedy Space Center and Palmdale.
</P>
<P>
   The company eventually concluded flying would cost too much, and
there were problems with the availability of the 747, Lindeke said.
</P>
<P>
   Driving the X-33 back to Edwards presents its own problems:
bridges, for example.
</P>
<P>
   As it sits atop its custom transport trailer, the craft's
vertical tail fins reach 26 feet above the pavement -- far too tall
to fit under highway bridges with an average 13 to 16 feet of
clearance, highway officials say.
</P>
<P>
   To negotiate the overpasses, an initial idea was to fabricate a
set of mobile ramps, each hauled by its own tractor-trailer. One
set of ramps would pull up to one side of an overpass, another set
to the back side.
</P>
<P>
   The X-33's tractor would drive up one set of ramps, across the
roadway atop the overpass, then down the ramps on the other side.
That idea also was rejected, again as too expensive, Lindeke said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the plan is to bypass bridges using highway on- and
off-ramps, frontage roads, secondary roads and judicious route
selection -- a map which still isn't finished.
</P>
<P>
   Entering California, for example, the space plane's trailer will
cross the state line just east of Death Valley and cruise at 25 or
30 mph for about 80 miles down lightly traveled Highway 127.
</P>
<P>
   Before the craft reaches the town of Baker on Interstate 15, it
turns west onto county roads and eventually cuts across the Army's
Fort Irwin training grounds on the last leg to Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the widest load, to the best of anybody's memory, that
we've ever had,'' said Caltrans spokesman Jim Drago.
</P>
<P>
   Highway 127 will be shut down to let the craft pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``The road is wide enough to accommodate the X-33, but not
anything else,'' Drago said.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes that Gov. Pete Wilson and the state Legislature
have recognized the commercial space industry -- of which the X-33
is a harbinger -- as important to California's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You always are going to have an impact on somebody,'' he said.
``What we do is try to minimize that impact.''
</P>
<P>
   In Nevada, the craft's likely route is Highway 95, which passes
through towns including Beatty, Tonapah and Goldfield. Nevada
highway officials said they've asked Lockheed Martin officials
whether the size of the craft will require cutting down roadside
trees or building detours, and whether it can pull over
periodically to let traffic go by.
</P>
<P>
   ``We obviously realize this is a important project and we are
trying to do everything we can to work with Lockheed Martin, but
obviously there are some concerns that need to be addressed,''
Magruder said.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, two-lane highways are typically 36 feet wide --
barely more than half the X-33's width from canted tail fin to
canted tail fin. But officials believe it will fit, though maybe at
the expense of a few trees, and all the overpasses on the projected
route can be scaled by off- and on-ramps.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had stuff heavier and taller. I don't think we have had
anything as wide,'' said Dave Galt, Montana motor carrier service
division administrator.
</P>
<P>
   But he notes: ``It's going to be a considerable undertaking.''

CALIFORNIA DESERT KEY REGION IN EFFORT TO BUILD NEW SPACECRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JIM SKEEN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The United States is about to embark on a revival
of experimental aircraft and Southern California's Antelope Valley
will play key roles in that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental aircraft taking to the air will include technology
demonstrators for a space station ``lifeboat'' and a new spaceship,
and the forerunner of a military space plane.
</P>
<P>
   ``X-vehicles are what is going to turn us into a space
transportation excellence country,'' Jess Sponable, former Air
Force program manager of DC-X, which investigated vertical takeoff
and landing spacecraft, told an audience at the weekend Space
Frontier Conference in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The most visible ``X'' program in the Antelope Valley is the
X-33, a space plane that will launch next summer to test technology
needed for a reusable spaceship. Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works
facility is building the X-33 in Palmdale, approximately 50 miles
north of Los Angeles, and expects to fly the aircraft in July from
Edwards Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to proving technologies, including the ``aerospike''
rocket engine, heat protection and design concepts, a major goal of
the X-33 program will to use ``aircraft-like'' operations.
</P>
<P>
   One of the requirements is to prepare the craft for a flight in
two days with less than 50 people, said Gene Austin, NASA's X-33
program manager.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin expects to take the technology from the program
and use it on the VentureStar reusable spaceship the company hopes
to fly in 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Another program with a major Antelope Valley connection is X-38,
aimed at developing a lifeboat for use in an emergency by the crew
of the international space station. Four X-38 vehicles will be
tested.
</P>
<P>
   The first X-38 made a successful inaugural flight March 12, but
its parafoil -- a steerable, rectangular parachute with the surface
area of a Boeing 747 wing -- twisted and ripped during its
deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Engineers believe they have solved the twisting problem and
expect to conduct two additional flights in December.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for testing an X-38 from space in November 2000. A
fully functional crew return vehicle is needed for the space
station in 2003, said John Hopper, the Johnson Space Center's
deputy X-38 program manager.
</P>
<P>
   One X program that might come to the Antelope Valley is the
X-40A, an effort to develop a spaceship for the military. The Air
Force conducted a successful test flight of the vehicle in August,
dropping it from a helicopter at 9,000 feet over Holloman Air Force
Base in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force wants to conduct a series of 10 to 20 flights
beginning in July using a B-52. The Air Force is considering
Edwards Air Force Base for those tests, said program manager Maj.
Ken Verderame.
</P>
<P>
   The Air Force has issued two $4 million contracts to Boeing and
Lockheed Martin to develop the military space plane concept. Skunk
Works is looking at the possibility of basing the military space
plane on the X-33.
</P>
<P>
   Another X program that will come to the Antelope Valley is the
X-43A, an effort to develop jet propulsion systems that will
function at extremely high speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Plans call for attaching the vehicle to a Pegasus space booster
that would be launched at 24,000 feet from a Lockheed L-1011
airliner. Program officials are shooting for a first flight in
January 2000.

TV SPORTS: FOR THE ISLANDERS' OPENER, PICTURE WAS TRULY DARK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howie Rose and Joe Micheletti sat together Saturday night in
their Fox Sports New York aerie at Nassau Coliseum. Rose was to
start his fourth season with the Islanders; Micheletti, his first.
But they had nothing to do.
</P>
<P>
   They watched the Islanders lose to Pittsburgh, 4-3. They talked
hockey to each other and to the visiting Ed Westfall, Micheletti's
predecessor. They had media guides, game programs and stat sheets.
All around the press level, where television monitors normally
showed the Islanders, the baseball playoffs were on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels like we're in a vacuum that we will ultimately be
released from,'' Rose said. ``It's unusual not to be able to
release the passion I have for the game on the night it's supposed
to be released.''
</P>
<P>
   Rose, who also calls the Mets for FSNY-TV (Fox Sports New York),
added: ``You gear up to this night for months. As involved as I am
in baseball, by Labor Day, I'm getting excited about hockey.
Opening day in baseball and opening night in hockey are two of the
365 nights a year I look forward to most.'
</P>
<P>
   Rose and Micheletti endured their one-game limbo because Madison
Square Garden, FSNY's parent, opted to show the Devils play the
Blackhawks on the cable channel and not create a second one for the
Islanders' opening night.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that in the past, when the Devils and Islanders
played at the same time, FSNY (or, its predecessor, SportsChannel
New York) did not quibble about adding a second channel. This time,
there were quiet rumblings that advertising sales for the Islanders
were poor, and that sponsors would get even worse value if the game
were shifted to Fox Sports New York 2.
</P>
<P>
   But you could also read the Garden's action as a message to the
Islanders' ownership, which is locked in a nasty, public fight with
Nassau County and SMG, the arena's landlord, over the coliseum's
safety, and a new arena.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the resolute Islander owners are unlikely to back down from
a position that apparently irks the Garden and its majority owner,
Cablevision Systems, which pays the Islanders $13 million annually
for their cable rights.
</P>
<P>
   But not carrying Saturday's game will not keep the team from
pursuing its case in federal court against SMG.. So the result of
Saturday night's action _ taken on a day's notice _ was to punish
Islander fans on opening night. This damnation is likely to
continue, as it is unlikely the Islanders will start playing like
the Flyers and become a magnet for advertisers like the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday and Saturday nights, when the Islanders and Devils
play at virtually the same times, only the Devils' game is likely
to be seen _ unless Garden officials start viewing subscribers with
anything less than disdain. Through October, two more
Islanders-Devils conflicts remain to be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   And so, Rose and Micheletti, idled Saturday night, may be hockey
announcers without hockey to announce on a semiregular basis. (With
no conflict Sunday, they will call the Islanders game from Boston
at 1:30 p.m.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people couldn't care less about hockey, but
I've always been proud to be associated with it,'' Rose said. ``Not
to have the vehicle to release the passion is disappointing. I feel
awful for the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   As Rose walked downstairs from the press box at the end of the
game, an usher shouted: ``Missed you on the game, Howie. But the
Mets start soon!''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SPONSOR SQUABBLE  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If you watched Fox's National Football League pregame show
Sunday, you saw Terry Bradshaw and Howie Long cover the ``NFL on
Fox'' logo with a Fox Sports sign. Bradshaw gabbed about wanting to
adhere to rules, and there being ``certain things you can't do.''
</P>
<P>
   What was all this unexplained business posturing about?
</P>
<P>
   A translation: This season, Energizer began sponsoring the ``Fox
Energizer Playbook,'' a weekly segment done on Fox's studio
football field. In certain shots, the Energizer field logo and an
``NFL on Fox'' wall sign can be viewed together _ a league taboo
because Energizer is not a league sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a lighthearted way of letting everyone know we're
following the terms of our contract with the NFL,'' said Fox
spokesman Vince Wladika.
</P>
<P>
   New rules that protect official sponsors bar the commingling of
the NFL name, trademark or logo with those of companies that are
not league sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate Fox's willingness to live by the same rules as
everyone else,'' said Greg Aiello, an NFL spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Fox undoubtedly believes it must find ways to earn back the $550
million a year it is paying for NFL rights. Its devotion to
Energizer was made evident by co-host James Brown, who said, ``We
love Energizer at Fox.''

TALKS TIE YANKEES' SALE PRICE TO POST-SEASON SUCCESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: UPDATES second-to-last graf to delete `reportedly'; Deletes

 By MURRAY CHASS

<P>
   CLEVELAND _ As if Yankees players did not face enough pressure
playing for George Steinbrenner, a deal to sell the team to
Cablevision Systems could bring Steinbrenner more money depending
on how the Yankees fare in the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball official familiar with Steinbrenner's negotiations
with Cablevision said Sunday that the company's offer is based on
the Yankees' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much for the division series, so much for the
league series, so much for the World Series,'' said the official.
``It's not cumulative. There's a certain amount for each level.''
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner, without offering specifics, acknowledged the
existence of different levels of payment in the offer Cablevision
has made but said: ``It's based on having a deal, and I don't have
a deal. We don't have any agreement. In the future that may be in
there, but it's not in there for this year unless we have a deal,
and we don't have a deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Another baseball official who knew about the outline of the
multiple-tiered offer said he had heard the price could go from
$500 million to $650 million depending on how the Yankees did in
the post-season. Another official said he had heard the figures
could go from $600 million to $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   The status of the talks between Steinbrenner and Cablevision,
the Long Island-based company that owns Madison Square Garden, has
been the source of intense speculation. One person close to the
Yankee organization said he had been told the deal was complete and
would be announced after the World Series, but none of the
officials who discussed the sale prices knew whether the deal was
that far along, and Steinbrenner flatly denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Complete or not, a sale now seems more likely than ever, as hard
as that might be to believe for people who know Steinbrenner's
passion for the Yankees. Everyone who discussed it Sunday said the
sale appeared to be inevitable; they all spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   It appeared that a deal would provide for Steinbrenner to
continue running the team. One of the officials who discussed the
sales figures said the deal was structured for the 68-year-old
Steinbrenner to run the team for three years. Another official said
he understood that the sale had not been completed but that a
tentative understanding about a procedure involving Steinbrenner
had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate executive who knows both Steinbrenner and Charles F.
Dolan, the head of Cablevision, said there was no question they had
been working on a deal. Dolan, the executive said, would have no
trouble letting Steinbrenner run the team and would not interfere
with him in that role.
</P>
<P>
   A team that is doing well is always more attractive than a loser
and understandably commands a higher price, but a multiple-tiered
purchase price would be novel in the sports world.
</P>
<P>
   Dolan is willing to pay more for a league or World Series
champion because it will be a more attractive television commodity.
Cablevision, through its purchase of the MSG Network, has rights to
the Yankees for two more seasons. If the Yankees' post-season
success created higher ratings for their cablecasts on MSG,
Cablevision could command higher rates for commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Buying the Yankees makes sense for Cablevision because it would
give the company television rights to the team as long as it was
the owner. The existing contract pays the Yankees $486 million for
12 years, and Dolan might figure that if he would have to pay more
than that in a new agreement, he might as well buy the team, not
just television rights.
</P>
<P>
   Although Steinbrenner has rejected offers for the Yankees over
the years, it makes sense for him to sell the team now, considering
his age. He has acknowledged that neither of his sons, Henry and
Harold, nor his son-in-law, Steve Swindal, has expressed an
interest in owning the team.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Steinbrenner, who is known as Hank, was briefly involved
in the Yankee operation about a dozen years ago. Harold
Steinbrenner and Swindal are general partners of the Yankees but
have played no visible role in the operation of the club.
</P>
<P>
   Steinbrenner has been the principal owner for 26 seasons. When
he led a group that bought the Yankees for $10 million in 1973, he
owned less than a majority, but he and family members now own 60
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The limited partners have heard from Steinbrenner about a
possible sale, but he is also said to have warned them not to talk
to anyone about it. One person close to the Yankees said he
understood that most of the limited partners supported the idea of
a sale.
