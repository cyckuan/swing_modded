 By JOSEPH DUARTE  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Chris Holt was so close to victory Thursday afternoon he could
almost reach out and touch it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But again, the Astros did everything inhumanly possible to
snatch victory from the grasp of the hard-luck righthander, losing
4-3 to the Colorado Rockies before a crowd of 25,146 at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   No offense.
</P>
<P>
   No relief.
</P>
<P>
   And one disgruntled clubhouse leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros departed on their longest road trip of the season
with their four-game winning streak a distant memory and questions
surfacing about an offensive unit suddenly weakened by a rash of
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're scoring a lot of runs, nobody's complaining,'' said
All-Star second baseman Craig Biggio, who went 0-for-5 and
committed a first-inning error that led to two unearned runs. ``But
when we're not, everyone is saying `Why, why, why.'''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio's remarks came in response to postgame comments by
manager Larry Dierker regarding the Astros' struggles at the plate
during the four-game series with the Rockies, which produced three
victories.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had just four hits Thursday and scored 13 runs in the
series while batting .224.
</P>
<P>
   And while the offense was an easy target after the Astros missed
an opportunity to sweep the Rockies, the bullpen also was culpable.
Namely, Trever Miller.
</P>
<P>
   The little-used lefthander walked three batters, threw two wild
pitches and gave up the go-ahead run on a sacrifice fly by Henry
Blanco in the ninth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deserved the loss today. I didn't get it done,'' said
Miller, who has walked seven in 9 innings this season. ``Three
walks to three lefties. Those are supposed to be guys I'm supposed
to get out. That's terrible. I've never done that my entire
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado starter Bobby Jones held the Astros to four hits and
three runs in six innings, and Jerry Dipoto (1-2) and former Astro
Dave Veres combined for three scoreless innings of relief.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the top of the Astros' batting order, Veres pitched a
perfect ninth for his fifth save. He struck out Biggio, got Bill
Spiers to line out and struck out Jeff Bagwell.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado relievers have blown nine saves this season, but Veres
was untouchable for the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting Biggio out was the key,'' Veres said. ``If he gets on
base, who knows what happens?''
</P>
<P>
   Holt, trying to snap his 0-6 start, took a 3-2 lead to the
seventh but gave up singles to Jeff Reed and pinch hitter Lenny
Harris to start the inning and was replaced by Brian Williams.
Darryl Hamilton's sacrifice fly tied the game at 3.
</P>
<P>
   Holt allowed seven hits and three runs and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got a lot of bad luck,'' said Holt, who sat out last
season recovering from shoulder surgery and hasn't won since Aug.
21, 1997. ``I've just got to go out and change it myself. It's not
like nobody's battling. It's just that the monkey's on my back
right now. I'm just snakebit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rockies snapped the 3-3 tie in the ninth when Miller (0-1)
walked Todd Helton and Chris Petersen reached on a fielder's
choice. Petersen later advanced to third on a pair of wild pitches
and Blanco drove in the eventual winning run with a fly to deep
left.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a lesson to all young kids out there: Don't walk the
leadoff batter,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker defended using Miller in the ninth inning,
saying he was cautious because his bullpen was depleted and he was
saving closer Billy Wagner for potential extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt with the hitters they had due that if Trever could
throw strikes, he would probably get them out,'' Dierker said.
``But he didn't throw strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough day at the plate. I think we missed some
opportunities against (Jones) to really give Holt some cushion
there. We just couldn't get the key hit. In the end, all the walks
and wild pitches. Once again we were right there at the end of the
game with a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Colorado took a 2-0 lead in the first inning when Hamilton led
off with a single and advanced to second on a sacrifice. Biggio
dropped shortstop Spiers' throw on Larry Walker's fielder's-choice
grounder, allowing one run to score, and Vinny Castilla doubled in
Walker.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros sliced the lead in the second on an RBI single by
Russ Johnson and went ahead in the third when Jones walked Derek
Bell with two outs and Richard Hidalgo followed with his seventh
home run. Hidalgo had seven home runs during his rookie season last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo also threw out Walker at third base in the third inning
for his league-leading eighth outfield assist.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed just one hit after the third inning _ not
exactly the desired send-off for a team that won't return home
until June 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really haven't hit the last six, seven games,'' said
Bagwell, who celebrated his 31st birthday Thursday. ``We did have
some opportunities today and just didn't get the big hit. It's been
this way lately, and we're still winning. That says a lot for our
pitching staff. We win as a team and lose as a team. We just have
to go battle. If we don't start swinging the bats a little better,
it's going to be a problem.''

   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
CRAIG Biggio made a bad error early and perhaps a worse one later.
As usual, Chris Holt couldn't buy a break _ early or late. Worse,
the wrong team got the timely hits while the home team barely got
any hits.
</P>
<P>
   Their adrenaline apparently spent from the previous evening's
ninth-inning rally, the Astros played tired and succumbed
listlessly 4-3 to the Rockies on Thursday, leaving town for what
seems forever on a sour, atypical note. This wasn't the team that
leads the National League in winning percentage.
</P>
<P>
   These guys were a bunch of impostors. Crabby ones, too. Most
uncharacteristically, perhaps unprecedentedly, an internal squabble
erupted afterward between the designated team leader, Biggio, and
his boss, Larry Dierker. Or maybe it's the other way around.
Sometimes that's open to question, given Biggio's stature in the
clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who is only the manager, expressed concern with the
Astros' recent offensive doldrums. A mere 13 runs crossed the plate
in the four Colorado games, and Dierker noted same afterward. He
also mentioned, in passing, how he had considered giving Biggio the
day off, saying: ``He's been playing hard. In hindsight, I should
have rested him.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. Nobody suffered the slings and arrows of the night-game,
early-day-game turnaround more than Biggio, whose two-out RBI
single in the ninth beat the Rockies on Wednesday. But just three
batters into Thursday's series wrap-up he was the goat-in-waiting,
erring on a routine play that led to a pair of unearned Colorado
runs.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Walker's grounder to Bill Spiers at short should have
trapped Darryl Hamilton between the bases, but Spiers' toss to
second _ it wasn't on the money, either _ smacked off Biggio's
glove and rolled into short center, allowing Hamilton to score.
Walker came home on Vinny Castilla's double.
</P>
<P>
   Because the final score was 4-3, and it also set in motion
another winless outing _ his eighth this season _ for the snakebit
Holt, tensions lingered afterward. Biggio's 0-for-5 day, which
included leaving a man on second and ended with a strikeout, put
him in a surly mood. Hence, Dierker's routine, innocuous, accurate
comments about the lack of clutch hitting must have scraped an
exposed nerve.
</P>
<P>
   They weren't specifically directed at Biggio, but you know how
that goes sometimes. Anyway, the second baseman suggested perhaps
the skipper should pick up a bat and go drive in a few runs
himself.
</P>
<P>
   No, Dierk wasn't later spied in the batting cage, taking cuts
while he waited for the bus to the airport. Nor did he so much as
raise an eyebrow about Biggio's ire. It's well-documented that ol'
Sluggo's ego is ever-manageable. The biggest upset of the season
will be if this lover's spat becomes anything more than yesterday's
news tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are things were sorted out by the time the Astros landed
in Pittsburgh late Thursday. Dierker, for his part, promised it
wouldn't become ``a New York thing,'' i.e., blown out of
proportion.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the matter is newsworthy because the Astros under Dierker
always have been, relatively speaking, the happiest of campers, a
bunch of hail fellows well met tugging in the same direction.
</P>
<P>
   Biggio and Dierk's predecessor, the tightly wound Terry Collins,
were in each other's faces on a frequent basis, but peace and quiet
has been the order of the day under the current regime.
</P>
<P>
   So why the outburst? Maybe fatigue was to blame. Well before he
had been informed of Biggio's snippy outburst, Dierker's fanny was
dragging.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got to bed at 2 (a.m.) and was up at 8,'' Dierker said. ``I
was beat, and I don't have to do anything physical. I was not that
proud of how we played today, but I can understand it. I don't
think it's a good idea to start day games at 12:30 after night
games. They must think it helps the gate, but I don't like it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the getaway-day circumstances _ Colorado headed to
Philly _ the start was mandated by baseball's rules. But 12:35, as
opposed to, say, 1:35, is management's call. To compensate, Dierker
canceled batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we did was run and play some catch to loosen up the
bones,'' he said. ``We've got a long trip coming up, too.''
</P>
<P>
   But not a particularly demanding one, given the level of the
competition. The next 12 games are divided evenly among four
sub-.500 teams _ Pittsburgh, Milwaukee, Minnesota and the Chicago
White Sox _ with no vast distances to cover between series. Even
short-handed, even with the superstar second baseman in a temporary
snit, the Astros' wheels are hardly in any grave danger of coming
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``At worst,'' Dierker said, ``we should be able to hang in
there. We've got a chance to win enough to not lose any ground.''
</P>
<P>
   We won't see the Astros live and in person again until June 11.
Hopefully, they can still be in first place and Thursday's
disharmony will be long forgotten. The smart money says it will be.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TERRY BLOUNT  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
INDIANAPOLIS _ Arie Luyendyk was no wide-eyed kid when he first
arrived at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in 1985, although his
shoulder-length blond hair made him appear younger than a man who
had been a race-car driver for 12 years.
<TEXT>
<P>
   In truth, many of the old-timers around the Brickyard looked at
Luyendyk as some kind of Dutch hippie who was out of his league
trying to compete with the likes of A.J. Foyt, Bobby and Al Unser,
Mario Andretti, Johnny Rutherford and Rick Mears.
</P>
<P>
   But looks can be deceiving. Luyendyk was 31, married and a
father. He also was a determined and quiet man who was all business
when it came to his racing career, and he had the talent to prove
it.
</P>
<P>
   From Rookie of the Year in 1985 to the Indianapolis 500 winner
in 1990 and 1997, Luyendyk is one of the best to ever make a lap at
the famous speedway. Sunday will be his 15th start at Indy and the
final race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult process, because it means walking away from
the only way of life I've ever known,'' Luyendyk said. ``I grew up
in the sport as a road racer, but people know me for winning the
Indy 500.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk holds or shares many of the records at Indianapolis,
including $5.2 million in earnings in his 14 previous starts. He
has been on the front row five times and is a three-time pole
winner, including this year. Luyendyk is the 12th driver to start
from the pole in his last Indy 500 start, but Bobby Unser is the
only driver to win from the pole in his final Indy 500 in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk holds IMS records for fastest race average speed
(185.981 mph in 1990) and fastest official lap (237.498 mph, 1996).
It was those stunning speeds three years ago that first caused
Luyendyk to consider retiring from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made it no secret that one reason I'm retiring is that at
age 45 I'm not willing to take the same risks I took in previous
years,'' Luyendyk said. ``When you come right down to it, this is a
sport where a driver is constantly weighing the risk vs. the
reward. For me, that ratio started to tip in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   With four kids, a wife of 20 years and a beautiful home in
Scottsdale, Ariz., Luyendyk's priorities were changing. The one
incident that clearly altered his outlook came when close friend
Scott Brayton was killed in a practice-session crash in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott's accident really struck me, because of who he was and
how the accident happened,'' Luyendyk said. ``It really was out of
Scott's control entirely, and I was thinking, `Man, it can happen
to me. It could have been me. It could have been anybody.'''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk told his wife, Mieke, he would retire if he won Indy
again. He lied. Not intentionally, but he didn't believe he was
ready to quit after he won the race in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel I could stop cold turkey,'' Luyendyk said.
``Driving is always going to turn me on, always going to get me
excited. But just like my wife said, `When you're 60, it's still
going to turn you on, but at 60 you shouldn't be driving a race
car.' As a driver, you always want to compete, you always want to
be part of it. But there comes a time when you have to say to
yourself, `Stop.' I don't want to wait for signs like my reaction
time isn't there anymore. I wanted to get out before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk also wanted more time with his family. Arie Jr., his
17-year-old son, is beginning his racing career and Luyendyk wants
to be there to help him.
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk also will continue to be involved in Treadway Racing
with team owner and close friend Fred Treadway. Luyendyk will be a
spokesman for Sprint PCS and will work as a commentator for Fox
Sports during the telecasts of the other Indy Racing League events
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether Luyendyk gets a third Indy 500 win Sunday,
his place in the history of the sport is set.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that Arie ranks right up there with all
of the great drivers that have won this race,'' said IMS president
Tony George. ``He is among the distinguished few who have won here
more than once. It's safe to say that when his name comes up on the
ballot for induction into the Hall of Fame, he will be elected on
the first ballot.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk is trying not to think about the finality of the moment
until after the race ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to stay focused on the racing part,'' Luyendyk said.
``I've never met John Elway, Wayne Gretzky or Michael Jordan, but
I'm certain I'm feeling the same emotions they were earlier this
year when they decided to retire. The Super Bowl provided the
perfect stage for Elway to bid farewell. Indianapolis does that for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Luyendyk wants to win, but realistically he just hopes his car
is still on the track when the checkered flag waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the high point of the emotional roller coaster will
be, hopefully, being around at the end of the race,'' Luyendyk
said. ``That's probably going to be the point where I might get a
little emotional in my helmet. Then I will realize I just drove 500
miles to my retirement.''

DiSARCINA WON'T RUSH IT 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM -- Shortstop Gary DiSarcina continues to make steady
progress toward returning to the field, but says he won't rush
himself.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina, who sustained a broken bone in his left forearm Feb.
21 and later had surgery on the arm, took batting practice Tuesday
and Wednesday for the first time since the injury. He had already
been fielding ground balls and hitting soft toss.
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina probably will begin a rehab assignment in three or
four weeks, but says as good as he's feeling it wouldn't make sense
to come back sooner than what was initially anticipated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing I'm going to do after sitting patiently for
eight weeks is to do something stupid ... like hitting off Troy
Percival,'' DiSarcina said. ``I don't want to destroy the work
that's been done by the doctors.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina took off batting practice Thursday to give his body a
chance to recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have all the spring training symptoms,'' he said. ``I have
sore feet, sore hands, a sore mid-section. For me, having those
things this time of year? Gosh, it's not right. But I've gone home
the last couple nights pretty happy. I'd rather have that soreness
than soreness in my (rear). I've picked up enough splinters to have
firewood in the offseason.''
</P>
<P>
   DiSarcina had a four-inch plate inserted into his forearm to aid
in the healing, but says now recovery is a matter of building
strength and endurance in his hand and wrist.
</P>
<P>
   Is Angels manager Terry Collins becoming senile? Although
Collins turned 50 Thursday, his lineup wasn't anything but an
effort to shake things up a little and give a few bench players an
opportunity to play.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Palmeiro started in right field and hit leadoff, bumping
regular leadoff hitter Darin Erstad to the No. 6 spot. Shorstop
Andy Sheets moved from ninth to second, and Randy Velarde went from
second to fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Huson got a rare start at first base and batted eighth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just trying to put out the best lineup I can,'' Collins
said. ``You put these guys in a situation where they've got to
perform, and it they don't get some at-bats along the way, it's
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Angels' pitchers took batting practice in preparation
for their games in National League ballparks, the Angels position
players held a hitters meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Hitting coach) Rod (Carew) wanted to get everybody together
and go over our game plan on (Orioles starter Juan) Guzman,''
Collins said. ``And they also reviewed the last couple of days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have lost to injury their Gold Glove center fielder
(Jim Edmonds) and two of the league's better defensive players in
right fielder Tim Salmon and DiSarcina.
</P>
<P>
   Yet going into Thursday's game they were tied for first in the
A.L. in fielding percentage (.985).
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played great,'' Collins said. ``Garret (Anderson) has
done the job in center, Andy Sheets at shorstop and Troy Glaus has
played tremendous at third base.''
</P>
<P>
   The pitching also has been big for the Angels. At 4.39, the team
ERA ranked second only to Boston (4.09) in the league.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Royals begin a three-game series beginning
tonight at 7:05. Chuck Finley (3-4, 4.45 ERA) will start for
Anaheim against Kansas City's Kevin Appier (5-2, 4.00).
</P>
<P>
   ANGELS VS. KANSAS CITY
</P>
<P>
   Time: 7:05 p.m. at Edison Field
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: No TV; KLAC-570, XPRS-1090
</P>
<P>
   Matchup: Chuck Finley (3-4, 4.45 ERA) is coming off his best
start of the season -- nine scoreless innings in the Angels' 4-0,
10-inning victory against Tampa Bay last Sunday. Finley has had
success vs. the Royals during his career, going 13-8 with a 2.78
ERA. Kevin Appier (5-2, 4.00) will start for Kansas City.

 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
On Wednesday, Craig Biggio was the hero, smashing the game-winning
hit in the bottom of the ninth.
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday, after going 0-for-5 and committing an error that
led to two unearned runs in the first inning, he was offended by
manager Larry Dierker's comments that he wasn't satisfied with the
team's offense in the four-game homestand against Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the game of baseball; that's the way it goes
sometimes,'' Biggio said. ``He's not complaining when we're scoring
eight or nine runs. We've got a lot of guys hurt right now. If he
can hit, let him go hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've said all along you have to win some games 2-1 and you
have to win some games 9-8. Last year, we did that pretty good. So
far, we're doing that pretty good this year. That's baseball.
That's the way it goes. Maybe there was a lack of offense right
now, but their pitchers pitched outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we'll get our offense going in Pittsburgh. Maybe
Larry (Dierker) will be hitting first.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros managed four hits in losing 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed opportunities against their starting pitcher (Bobby
Jones) that would have given (Astros starter Chris) Holt a
cushion,'' Dierker said. ``We've got to find ways to get him
wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's lack of offense came just hours after Biggio's
game-winner in a 3-for-5 performance Wednesday. After that game,
Dierker gave some of the credit to pinch runner Glen Barker for
helping Biggio get a good pitch to hit, in an at-bat in which
Biggio fouled off several two-strike pitches before delivering the
decisive hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``That whole situation at first base (pinch runner Glen Barker
playing cat-and-mouse with pitcher Pedro Astacio and eventually
stealing second), maybe Biggio got a pitch to hit because of it, or
maybe he (Astacio) just made a mistake,'' Dierker said Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, may have gotten under Biggio's skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get about four hours of sleep and you come out and try to
play today, and it's tough on both sides,'' Biggio said. ``Today we
just didn't get it done. We have a lot of guys that are hurt.
That's just the way it goes.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you score a lot of runs, nobody's complaining. When you
don't score, everybody's going, `Why, why, why?' But if we go on a
run and get hot, nobody will say anything anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the four games against the Rockies were decided by one
run. The Astros scored five runs in the opener Monday, then totaled
eight in the other three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got some good pitchers over there,'' Biggio said. ``If
he (Dierker) wants to hit, let him hit. He can hit first if he
wants. If he's so worried about our offense, let him hit for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker said he wasn't upset by Biggio's comments and said he
was willing to sit down with his second baseman on the road trip to
clear the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me,'' Dierker said. ``It doesn't bother me
at all. Biggio and I are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker considered giving Biggio the day off Thursday, and after
his leadoff hitter went 0-for-5 he second-guessed his decision not
to. Biggio, who is hitting .282 for the season, went 4-for-18
(.222) on the homestand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about giving Biggio a day off, but he'd been playing
pretty hard and swinging the bat so well,'' Dierker said. ``He was
lunging at the ball and swinging at bad pitches a week or so ago,
and I thought he had gotten out of it and gotten locked in pretty
good. Today he went back to the way he was.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros took three of four during the brief homestand, but
the expected offense was missing. The Rockies brought the National
League's worst pitching staff (team ERA of 5.92) to the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros boast the best team average, .281. That staff held
the Astros to a .224 average this week.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Astros have had a slew of injuries recently and
have recalled several players from Class AAA New Orleans. Biggio,
however, didn't want to use that as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't replace a lot of these guys who are hurt right now,
but we have a lot of guys who are good,'' Biggio said. ``But we
have a lot of guys who are really good, and they're going out and
battling. If you're in the big leagues, you're here for a reason,
and that's because you can play. It's not who's in our lineup or
who's not in our lineup.''

MILITARY SPENDING BILL CLEARS SENATE HURDLE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf to make it `recessed' stead of `adjourned')  (rk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Senate Thursday night easily passed a $289
billion military authorization bill that tightens security at the
nation's weapons laboratories. But the House, faced with a nearly
identical bill, collapsed into chaos and abruptly recessed for the
holiday weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with furious partisan bickering, Speaker Dennis Hastert of
Illinois, realizing that the Republican majority did not have the
necessary 218 votes to bring the bill to the floor, shut down the
House and sent its members home.
</P>
<P>
   House Republican leaders blamed Democrats for blocking the bill.
The Democrats, in turn, said conservative Republicans had bolted
from their leaders over a provision barring funds for ground troops
in combat or peacekeeping in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   That measure was deleted overnight by the Republicans at the
insistence of the White House, which threatened late Wednesday to
veto the entire military spending bill over the provision. That
move, in turn, infuriated conservative Republicans who wanted to
debate the issue of ground troops on the House floor.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost part of their right wing, the Republicans needed
votes from the Democrats to bring up the bill. But Democratic blocs
also walked away after the Republicans refused to consider
amendments to support steps by the Clinton administration to step
up security at the weapons laboratories, cut the number of American
forces in Europe and set aside contracts for minority groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that partisanship stopped at the water's edge,''
sighed Rep. Tillie Fowler, R-Fla., on the House Armed Services
Committee. But partisanship compounded by ideological divisions
among the Republicans approached a high water mark this week.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was halted ``due to Democrat opposition,'' said Rep.
David Dreier, R-Calif. Dreier, chairman of the House Rules
Committee, said the opposition surfaced Thursday ``despite the
assurances provided last night by the Democrat leadership and the
president's staff'' that most Democrats would support the bill.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, Jake Siewert, called Dreier's
explanation ``an excuse for ineptitude.'' The minority leader,
Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said, ``Every time the Republican
leadership finds itself unable to beat back the extreme right wing
within their own party, they blame the Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   The military authorization bill was the fourth major spending
bill Hastert had scheduled over the past three days that the House
Republicans were unable to move, due in large part to dissent
between their right wing and their moderates.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate, the military measure faced a far smoother path,
winning passage by a 92 to 3 vote Thursday night. It would
authorize $288.8 billion in military spending for next year, $8.3
billion more than the White House and the Pentagon sought.
</P>
<P>
   The measure includes $89 billion for new weapons, including $3.7
billion for various missile defense programs. It also includes a
4.8 percent raise for military personnel and blocks the military
from closing bases over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to reports of Chinese espionage aimed at the nation's
nuclear weapons laboratories, the Senate added provisions intended
to plug any leaks from the labs.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate approved, by a voice vote, measures inspired by this
week's House report on China's acquisition of American military
technology. They are intended to ``change the mindset at the
Department of Energy,'' which oversees the weapons labs said Sen.
Frank H. Murkowski, R-Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   They would tighten export controls on high-tech items, require
the Central Intelligence Agency to review applications for overseas
launches of American satellites, monitor Chinese rocket launches
and expand American launch capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to take a look at reorganizing the way the
Department of Energy as a whole operates,'' said the majority
leader, Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi. ``We need to look at some
way to reimpose the export administration regime. There's got to be
some balance between commercial desire, trade and national
security.''

INDIAN NATIONS FLOAT PLAN TO SUE TOBACCO INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Native American tribes around the nation are quietly preparing
lawsuits that could seek $1 billion in damages from tobacco
companies for tobacco-related health problems.
</P>
<P>
   The claims likely will be similar to the suits filed by states
that netted more than $200 billion in settlements from Big Tobacco,
but based on different legal arguments.
</P>
<P>
   Former Navajo Nation President Albert Hale says 35 Indian
nations have signed onto his lawsuit, which he expects to file in
late June or early July in either state or tribal courts. Hale said
several Arizona tribes have pledged support, but he declined to
name them or say how many had decided to join the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Navajo Nation officials are still considering
whether to join the effort.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, Native Americans have the highest rate of smoking of
any ethnic group. Almost 40 percent of Native Americans and Alaska
Natives smoke, according to a 1995 national survey by the Surgeon
General's Office, compared with a smoking rate of about 25 percent
nationwide. The Indian Health Service estimates that two out of
every five Native American deaths can be attributed to tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, the percentage of American Indian children who use
tobacco has been especially disturbing. Twenty-six percent of
children ages 14-15 and 33 percent of children ages 16-17 smoke,
according to a 1997 survey by the Arizona Department of Health
Services. But a 1997 survey by DHS indicated the overall rate of
smoking among Native Americans in Arizona is only 13 percent _ far
below the national average.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hale said tobacco companies have specifically targeted Indians
and other minority groups with marketing and advertising for
tobacco products, which some say has caused an increase of smoking
on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It slowly has increased smoking just because of the mass-media
approach by tobacco companies,'' said Gerry RainingBird of the
Inter Council of Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Hale said he noticed an increase in marketing toward Native
American groups about eight years ago, when tobacco companies began
to sponsor powwows and rodeos.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a conscious effort on their part after they found out
that minority groups were an untapped market,'' Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   William Maledon, a Phoenix attorney who represents tobacco giant
Philip Morris, said the lawsuit, if filed, would be another attempt
``to fashion a lawsuit out of nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Maledon said he believed a couple of tribes have already
attempted similar lawsuits with no success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure there wouldn't be much of a case,'' Maledon
said. ``But I'll wait and see what their theories are. I can't
imagine there's going to be much merit to this.''
</P>
<P>
   Hale, a St. Michaels attorney who also works in Albuquerque,
suggested the lawsuits could seek as much as $1 billion in damages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is progressing,'' he said. ``I've been traveling
extensively throughout Indian Country since January, meeting with
Indian leaders and Indian tribal councils and giving them
information about this possibility. &UR; . . . &UR; Hopefully, we'll be able
to get something for Indian nations. Certainly, they deserve it.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Native American communities did not receive any of the $206
billion settlement between 46 states and the major tobacco
companies. The agreement does not forbid Indian nations from
pursuing their own claims.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gave Indian nations the option to go after tobacco
companies on their own, which is what we're attempting to help them
with,'' Hale said.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal arguments will have to be different. One of the
main claims states made against Big Tobacco sought the recovery of
Medicare and Medicaid costs caused by tobacco use.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the states, the federal government paid for those health
care costs on Indian reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Berman, a Seattle attorney who represented Arizona and 12
other states in tobacco lawsuits, said Native Americans must come
up with another legal theory on which to base their suit.
</P>
<P>
   Berman said he is being interviewed to represent one tribe in
its own lawsuit, a tribe he declined to name. He also suggested
that Hale's estimate of $1 billion was too large.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the Native Americans have a claim,'' Berman said.
He predicted there will be several lawsuits filed against tobacco
companies by Indian nations, a strategy he said would be more
successful than a joint suit by a cluster of tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Former Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods agrees that the
tribes have a good case. But he suggested that they should also
consider adopting tough anti-smoking laws and discontinue the
practice of selling discount cigarettes on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Many reservations, including those in suburban Phoenix, sell
tax-free cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want the tobacco companies to change their ways, then
the tribes should also not be a convenient outlet for discount
selling,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   But he added that Native American youth have been bombarded with
the same advertising as other children. Nearly one-third of Native
Americans ages 16 and 17 are smokers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tribal nations were subjected to the same sort of
marketing that children outside the reservation were subjected to
and yet they don't have any of the benefits of the suits,'' Woods
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably something that the tobacco companies should
address proactively to see if they couldn't come to some sort of
resolution with all of the tribes in the country. If not, I think
they will be subjected to lawsuits.''
</P>
<P>
   Settlement money could be a windfall for some cash-starved
Indian communities, particularly those without gaming. Hale
estimated the Navajo Nation, one of the largest Indian populations
in the country, could get as much as $20 million.

SPORTS COLUMN: DELIVERING A MESSAGE, WITH A LITTLE CHIN MUSIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Roger Clemens has insisted that Thursday night's
start against the Red Sox did not have any special meaning for him.
Sure.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens has recited these words, but one wonders if he had also
crossed his fingers and toes as he spoke. No special meaning?
Sorry, Roger. That is impossible to fathom.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine being a salesman for 13 years and selling more products
than anyone else in the company. Then the company decides that it
no longer needs you. Three years later, you are still a dominant
salesman and are working for your old employer's main competitor.
Would you think there was special meaning to outselling your old
employer? Of course you would.
</P>
<P>
   The best pitcher in Red Sox history wore a Yankee uniform
Thursday night and pitched against the franchise that had no use
for him after the 1996 season. Even though there are only a handful
of players on the current team who played with Clemens in Boston,
that is irrelevant because Clemens is motivated by his disdain for
the front office. That is why there was special meaning for Clemens
after he steered the Yankees to a 4-1 victory. Stubborn on and off
the mound, he just would not concede it.
</P>
<P>
   Every win is important for us now,'' said Clemens, who addressed
reporters for a few minutes and dodged talk about the
attractiveness of the matchup.
</P>
<P>
   The night started with Elton John crooning ``Rocket Man'' over
the public address system while Clemens trotted to the mound, a
song that was indirectly suggested by Mike Stanley. After Stanley
asked the Yankees if they planned to play the song for the Rocket,
team officials stammered that they had not and then pounced on the
neat idea.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clemens claimed this was another game on the schedule,
he still pumped his fist after Stanley struck out in the fifth.
When Clemens got Damon Buford to slap into a double play to end the
inning, he clenched his fist again. It was not another game. It was
Clemens sending a high and tight message to the Red Sox after
spicing his seven powerful innings with seven strikeouts. Do you
miss me yet?
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have finished his career with the Red Sox,'' said
Bill Fischer, the pitching coach in Boston when Clemens was there.
``He's like Yastrzemski, Williams and Pesky. If you've got a Hall
of Famer, you don't treat him like a second-line citizen.''
</P>
<P>
   When Fischer, who is now the pitching coach for the Class AAA
Richmond Braves, was asked what it is like to see Clemens pitching
for the Yankees, he said, ``That's like Babe Ruth playing right
field against the Red Sox.''
</P>
<P>
   Three hours before the first pitch, John Valentin studied
videotape of Clemens from last season when he was pitching for
Toronto. It must have worked as Valentin had Boston's only two hits
and only run batted in off Clemens, who is 3-0 with a 1.64 earned
run average against the Red Sox and has also won an American League
record 19 straight decisions overall. Still, Valentin was in awe.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's most amazing about Roger is, for all the games I've
played behind him, every time I see him he's better than I think he
is,'' said Valentin. ``He's a great pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentin grew up in Jersey City and adored the Yankees, so he
understood from the time he was a boy that it is natural for Yankee
fans to hate the Red Sox and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
   He was immersed in the rivalry after joining the Red Sox in 1992
and admitted that Thursday night would make Boston fans queasy and
gave him mixed emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to realize that playing behind him and the work ethic
that he puts into each start, it's pretty incredible,'' Valentin
said. ``By doing all of that, you tend to want to play behind him.
It's a sign of respect for him. Now to face him these last three
years, it's always a tough thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   When Valentin was told that Clemens had minimized the importance
of the game, he grinned and called Clemens coy. The reason Clemens
called the game unimportant was to avoid distractions and because
it was critical.
</P>
<P>
   The first time Clemens opposed the Red Sox at Fenway Park after
signing with the Blue Jays, he struck out 16 in a 3-1 victory in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens left the game, he gazed up to a box he thought
belonged to Boston's general manager, Dan Duquette. That was
personal. It still might be personal toward the Red Sox executives
who infielder Jeff Frye said Clemens felt wronged him in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't see see eye to eye with the front office people,''
Frye said. ``Maybe he feels there's no animosity toward the
players, but he wants to show the front office they made a
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, the Red Sox got to see Clemens from 60 feet 6
inches away and in pinstripes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've never seen him in that uniform, face to face,'' Frye
said. ``It was different to see him in a Toronto uniform, but this
is magnified a little more because it's the so-called rivals. It's
going to be exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Frye sounded like Clemens and said, ``As much as people
like to read into it, it's just another game in May.''
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, Roger. Sorry, Jeff. No, it was not. &QL;

STUDENT SUSPENDED FOR JOKING ABOUT LITTLETON IS REINSTATED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Snezan Cebic, a Manhattan high school senior,
downloaded the joke a month ago from an Internet chat room
frequented by students at the University of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   It was a parody of those treacly, ubiquitous TV commercials that
invite viewers to use their Mastercards in search of ``priceless''
moments _ a father and son at a ballgame, a daughter's pilgrimage
to her ancestral home in Ireland. Only this time, the punch line
zoomed into the high-school shooting rampage in Littleton, Colo.
</P>
<P>
   On April 27, Snezan, 18, passed the joke around to several
friends and teachers on a scrap of paper.
</P>
<P>
   By fourth-period physics, he had been turned in to the dean of
discipline at Environmental Studies High School on the West Side of
Manhattan. And three days later he was suspended. The charge,
according to the official incident report: He had ``threatened his
school.''
</P>
<P>
   That suspension ended Thursday, after Snezan was summoned to a
formal hearing where witnesses were prepared to testify against
him. After Norman Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, intervened on his behalf, the charges were
dropped.
</P>
<P>
   It was just one of hundreds of suspensions for alleged threats
of violence that have been reported across the country since the
shootings in Littleton and in Conyers, Ga. On Thursday, civil
libertarians said Snezan's case illustrated the dark side of often
well-intentioned efforts by school administrators anxious to
fulfill the impossible mission of spotting violence before it
occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost all the suspensions, said Ann Beeson, a staff attorney
for the American Civil Liberties Union, are ``for behavior that in
any other environment would be considered childish pranks.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Corbluth, the principal of Environmental Sciences,
could not precisely articulate how Snezan had threatened the school
or violated any Board of Education policy. But he said the
suspension had been approved by the Manhattan high school
superintendent. ``These are extremely difficult times,'' he said.
``We have youngsters who need to be educated as to the seriousness
of this issue, and we have a responsibility to insure their
safety.''
</P>
<P>
   In a different place, a different time, Snezan Cebic would seem
the unlikeliest of potential criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Serbian immigrant, he came to this country when he
was 11, and has become perfectly assimilated, a popular boy who
listens to both Mahler and anarchist music, has won several
debating trophies and has a 95 average. He has been admitted to the
College of William and Mary in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   The only previous blemish on his record is for showing
disrespect to a school security guard, by disobeying an order to
stay in the lunchroom when he wanted to go to the library. For that
infraction, he got ``three or four demerits,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was seven days after Littleton that Snezan gleefully
circulated the credit-card parody, scribbled on a piece of notebook
paper, to friends and teachers. The punch line said, ``The feeling
you get when you blow your classmate's head off: priceless.''
</P>
<P>
   His advanced placement history teacher, Victor Greez, was among
those who read it. ``I thought it was funny, the kind of thing that
you would see passed around Wall Street,'' he said in an interview
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   But the joke found its way to Dan Andrews, a physics teacher,
who reported it to the school administration, describing it in a
statement as a ``sick thing to write.'' Andrews declined to comment
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Called in for a conference with Phyllis Sacks, a dean, Snezan at
first thought he was just being dressed down. When Ms. Sacks
complained that children these days were exposed to too much
violence, Snezan recounted, he could not resist retorting that in
her day, Westerns and World War II movies had been pretty violent,
too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does my joke threaten `violence, injury or harm' to anyone
else?'' he said Thursday, quoting from the Board of Education's
disciplinary code. ``The joke doesn't refer to anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   He stubbornly insisted on continuing to attend school, taking
three advanced placement tests over the next week or so.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Ms. Sacks confronted him, and this week, after a
preliminary hearing, Snezan agreed to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing that his suspension would damage his college plans,
Snezan called the New York Civil Liberties Union and a reporter.
Thursday morning, Siegel of the Civil Liberties Union agreed to
represent him.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours later, Snezan and his father, Nenad, made their way
from Queens to a crowded Board of Education hearing room in midtown
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel asked the Board of Education's supervising attorney,
Shirley Rowe-Gordon, for a postponement so he could prepare a brief
and call character witnesses, which Ms. Rowe-Gordon granted.
``Don't you feel this is rather cut and dried?'' wondered Ms.
Sacks, the Environmental Sciences dean.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel did not, and explained that if a scribbled parody of a
credit-card commercial was a threat, then another student might be
disciplined for bringing a newspaper article about violence into
school.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, Siegel received a call from a lawyer for
the Board of Education. The charges were being dropped, the lawyer
said, and the record of Snezan's suspension expunged.
</P>
<P>
   ``On thorough examination, this was not deemed a serious
matter,'' said Phil Russo, a spokesman for the board. ``This was a
good kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Snezan, for one, was glad the suspension was over. ``I hope this
will cause them to think a little,'' he said, ``before they put
other students through the same hassle they put me.''

   INDIANAPOLIS _ In an effort to rein in escalating speeds on
high-banked tracks, the Pep Boys Indy Racing League has mandated an
engine rules change designed to slow the cars by three mph.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with the June 12 night race at Texas Motor Speedway in
Fort Worth, IRL engines will be limited to 10,000 revolutions per
minute (RPM). IRL cars have been competing with a limiter set at
10,300 RPM this season and will operate at that figure during
Sunday's 83rd running of the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   The reduced RPM should translate into a loss of 20 to 25
horsepower, and approximately three mph, at the seven IRL events on
the schedule after Indy, IRL officials said. Two of them, including
the season-finale, are at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is if you reduce the RPMs, you slow the
cars down. We feel it will definitely slow the cars down,'' said
Leo Mehl, the IRL's executive director. ``There are obvious reasons
for doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   This change is the latest instituted by the IRL in the wake of a
three-car accident during the league's VisionAire 500 at Lowe's
Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C. Three spectators were killed and
eight injured by a wheel and flying debris that cleared a
15-foot-high fence May 1.
</P>
<P>
   feet to 6 feet to control debris at those tracks, which play
host to five IRL events. The tracks in Fort Worth, Concord and
Hampton, Ga., are 1.5-milers with 24-degree-banked turns originally
designed for stock cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just need to show Bruton and Humpy and all those guys that
we're responding to the tragedy in Charlotte,'' Mehl said. ``This
is one of the ways we're going to do it.''to here ]
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Gossage, the executive vice president and general manager
of TMS, said he was pleased by the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of speed, but the show is better when
speed is reduced,'' Gossage said. ``But four miles per hour really
makes no difference. This was in the planning stages long before
the Charlotte wreck. I don't see it being a safety issue. It's a
competition issue. Racing at 225 is blinding fast. But you won't be
able to tell the difference in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, the IRL announced implementation of its ``suspension
wheel energy management system'' of space-age cable designed to
keep parts from flying off the cars during a crash. The system will
make its racing debut in Sunday's Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   The revised RPM limit is expected to keep qualifying speeds at
TMS at around 220-221 mph for the Longhorn 500 presented by MCI
WorldCom on June 12. Last June, Tony Stewart won the pole at TMS
with a hot lap at 224.448 mph. But Billy Boat clocked the fastest
in-race lap at 227.273 mph en route to his first IRL victory.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Cheever, the reigning Indy 500 champion, said the RPM
reduction is significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you can compare lowering our revs from 10,300 to
10,000 to what they do with restrictor plates in NASCAR,'' Cheever
said. ``There is no reason in the world why you should not emulate
a successful racing series when they make decisions on safety.''
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR mandates the use of horsepower-reducing carburetor
restrictor plates for its races on the 2.5-mile Daytona
International Speedway and 2.66-mile Talladega (Ala.)
Superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Controlling speeds is a package,'' Mehl said, ``and we want to
work on all parts of the package.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For three years, the once-mighty United Farm
Workers of America has struggled to organize California's 20,000
strawberry pickers and packers _ who harvest more than 80 percent
of the nation's strawberries under often backbreaking conditions _
in an effort to revitalize the crusading spirit of the union's
founder, Cesar Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   But the union's hopes for its most important victory since
Chavez's death in 1993 were thrown into deep doubt Thursday when
the 1,500 workers of the Coastal Berry Co., the state's single
biggest strawberry employer, failed to produce a majority for
either the UFW or a rival group organized by Coastal Berry workers
last year.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome of the unionization vote, held in Watsonville and
Oxnard, Calif., raised the prospect of a runoff election, perhaps
as soon as next week, and all but guaranteed another round in the
state's long-running strawberry wars.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year alone, the dispute has produced anti-union
violence and a contested vote that the rival union group, the
Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee, won by fewer than 100 votes
last July. Those results were thrown out by state officials this
month because 162 workers who were eligible to vote had not been
notified of the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to continue in this struggle no matter how long it
takes,'' Arturo Rodriguez, president of the UFW and Chavez's
son-in-law, said in a telephone conference call with reporters
Thursday. ``We're not going any place. It's a question of
reassuring the workers that we're committed.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the UFW's fight illustrates the complex dynamics of the
state's $600 billion a year strawberry industry. The work at
strawberry companies is among the poorest paid, with wages
averaging only about $230 a week, or 12-to-16 cents a pint, and
labor so stooped and difficult that most workers are finished by
age 50.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW contends that it is hampered, after 16 years of strong
antiunion sentiment under two Republican governors, by deep
skepticism and lack of union experience among workers, most of them
Mexican immigrants, who are harassed by anti-union foremen and
fearful of losing their jobs. In the early and mid-90s, the UFW won
victories, only to have growers plow under their crops rather than
accept union representation.
</P>
<P>
   Growers counter that working conditions in the agricultural
industry have improved since Chavez began his organizing efforts
three decades ago. They say workers are better paid, more satisfied
and reluctant to surrender 2 percent of their wages to a union
whose glory days of solidarity are gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is probably the biggest black eye that the UFW
has ever suffered in its history,'' said Rob Roy, president of the
Ventura County Agricultural Association, a grower group. ``With all
the money and the effort they've put into it, they had every
conceivable opportunity to win this election and they didn't. I
don't think they've won the hearts and the minds of the workers out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the timing of the election was set by the UFW,
apparently confident of victory, after it mustered petition cards
from 50 percent of the workers last week.
</P>
<P>
   But in secret-ballot voting in the fields on Tuesday and
Wednesday, the UFW received 577 votes, compared with 646 for the
Coastal Berry Farmworkers Committee. The UFW suggests that the
Farmworkers Committee was organized with the support of antiunion
foremen and backing from other growers _ an assertion the committee
rejects.
</P>
<P>
   There were 79 votes for no union, and 60 ballots not counted
because of eligibility challenges, most of them lodged by officials
of the state Agricultural Labor Relations Board, who conducted the
election.
</P>
<P>
   The board's regional director now has 48 hours to resolve the
challenged ballots, but if neither side wins a majority of the
ballots cast and accepted, a runoff election will be held, within
seven days if possible.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Oxnard, in the coastal plain of Ventura County about 60 miles
northwest of Los Angeles, the UFW won a majority of 309 votes to
230 for the Farmworkers Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But in Watsonville, 70 miles south of San Francisco on the
fertile central coast, where antiunion sentiment is stronger and
where an antiunion group attacked UFW supporters in the fields last
summer, the Farmworkers Committee won, with 416 votes to 268 for
the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   The UFW contends that the Farmworkers Committee has taken no
steps to organize its operations and has no proven experience in
representing workers.
</P>
<P>
   One of the workers charged in the violence, Jose Guadalupe
Fernandez, became the first president of the Farmworkers Committee,
but he was later dismissed by the company and the presidency of the
group has yet to be filled.
</P>
<P>
   The group's lawyer, James Gumberg, said Thursday that the
challenged ballots alone might give the Farmworkers Committee an
outright victory, without a runoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think a runoff clearly favors the committee,'' Gumberg
said. ``I think what you're going to see is the UFW and the company
get together to do everything in their power to stall this
election.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Coastal Berry is hardly hostile to the UFW. Its average
pay of $8.40 an hour is about $2 above the statewide average. Its
owners, a group led by a suburban Washington investor, David
Gladstone, bought Coastal Berry from the Monsanto Co., with the
support of the UFW and a bevy of Democratic politicians, including
Vice President Al Gore, on a pledge of neutrality to unionization.
The powerful Western Growers Association has actually accused
Coastal of excessive sympathy for the UFW.
</P>
<P>
   ``The immediate issue is just putting some finality on a long
organizing campaign,'' Coastal's president, Ernie Farley, said
Thursday. ``We've spent an awful lot of time managing this process
rather than managing our business, and now we're right in the
middle of the harvest.''
</P>
<P>
   The UFW chose Coastal as the first big organizing target because
of the presumed sympathies of its new owners, and because it is the
industry's largest direct employer, producing 10 percent of the
national strawberry crop. But the union's real target is Driscoll's
Berries, a consortium that operates here and in Florida and
produces nearly one-third of the nation's strawberries.
</P>
<P>
   If the union had won this week, officials had hoped to begin a
public relations campaign urging consumers to buy Coastal's berries
_ and implicitly to boycott Driscoll's _ in an effort to bring
pressure on the rest of the industry. Now all such plans remain on
hold.

BABY-SELLING RING, STRETCHING FROM BORDER TO NEW YORK, BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Douglas man practicing law in Mexico and two New York women
were charged Thursday with running an adoption ring that brought 17
Mexican children illegally into the country and sold them to Long
Island couples for up to $22,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Reyes, 40, of Douglas and Arlene Lieberman, 48, and Arlene
Reingold, 47, of Medford, N.Y., were arrested late Wednesday on
charges of violating a host of U.S. immigration laws and mail and
wire fraud. The three had been working together for about 10 years,
according to the federal indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes attended high school in Douglas but went to law school in
Mexico and set up his practice, which specializes in adoptions,
only a block away from the crossing station to Douglas in Agua
Prieta, Sonora. He has dual U.S. and Mexican citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear in court papers how Reyes and the two New York
women met and began the adoption ring. But Lieberman and Reingold
presented themselves to prospective parents as adoption experts,
using business names such as Stork International and International
Adoption Consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The New York state Department of Social Services received
complaints as early as 1990 that the two were misleading potential
clients and never issued them a license to arrange adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Arizona end, court papers accuse Reyes of paying
to smuggle babies from his Agua Prieta office to his Douglas home,
commonly using Mexican women with legal U.S. crossing documents to
pose as their mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Last October, a secretary in Reyes' law firm, 26-year-old
Margarita Soto, was arrested by Mexican police and charged with
trafficking in children.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican judicial officials said at the time that Soto was part
of a ring that bought babies from pregnant women in the Mexican
states of Sonora and Sinaloa, paying for their medical expenses and
giving them a fee for the child.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers would then sign the names of the person buying the
child on birth certificates and Reyes handled the paperwork of
removing the children legally from Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   But on the U.S. end, the adoptive parents were stuck with having
illegal-immigrant children. According to Immigration and
Naturalization Service records, no visas were ever issued for any
of the 17 children to enter the United States under the names that
appeared on their birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also alleges that Reyes sent mentally challenged
and sexually abused children to prospective parents.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, after only a few days, ``the parents came to
realize that the children had no immigration status in the United
States and, in some cases, had serious, unanticipated health and
other problems,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   In one planned 1997 adoption, in which Lieberman traveled to
Arizona to pick up a 2-year-old girl, the parents refused to accept
the child. They told federal authorities that her eyes didn't
focus, her stomach was distended and that she appeared to have no
neck. She also licked the walls and awoke from sleep screaming,
according to the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Reingold then told them, ``all she needed was a little love and
good food,'' the indictment said.
</P>
<P>
   The two women ran ads in a Long Island newspaper offering
adoptions from such countries as Mexico, Guatemala, Paraguay and
Bulgaria. But, the indictment noted, when people inquired about
children from countries other than Mexico, they were steered toward
Reyes, who they said had a knack for finding attractive children
that could be adopted in days.
</P>
<P>
   The adoption ring falsely told the prospective parents that
Mexican law allowed adoptive parents to take custody of the
children before the adoption was finalized in Mexico and that they
could submit the paperwork in the United States once the Mexican
requirements were fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Court documents also said that Reyes took at least one child to
New York City and met with potential clients in Douglas, meeting
them at a gas station before ushering them to his home or office.
</P>
<P>
   The court documents said that Reyes met one couple at his Agua
Prieta office and pushed a young girl at them. When the couple
demanded to ``dot every `i' and cross every `t' '' about making the
adoption legal, Reyes said they would have to return to Douglas to
get a Mexican crossing visa.
</P>
<P>
   As he drove across the border, Reyes waived at a U.S. border
official, the couple told investigators, then looked at them and
said, ``See how easy that was?'' according to the indictment. &QL;

AVALANCHE'S ROY CLEARLY NOT BEST GOALIE IN SERIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ ``If you win on the road in the playoffs, your
goaltender has to be your best player,'' a wise coach said the
other night.
</P>
<P>
   And with each victory that moves his team closer to the Stanley
Cup finals, coach Ken Hitchcock of the Stars seems to get a little
wiser.
</P>
<P>
   His goaltender, indeed, has been the Stars' most important
player in this postseason.
</P>
<P>
   And the Colorado Avalanche's?
</P>
<P>
   ``Quel surprise.'' His name clearly hasn't been Patrick Roy.
</P>
<P>
   Cut off the head _ the old boxing axiom _ and the body follows.
Cut off Patrick Roy's smiling noggin, and what's left of the Avs?
</P>
<P>
   An intriguing question, as this Western Conference final series
swings into tonight's fourth game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's played well,'' Colorado's 41-goal scorer Joe Sakic said
after yesterday's practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's had a great playoffs for us. He's giving us a chance to
win games.''
</P>
<P>
   That praise is noteworthy because Roy, who can be ``tres''
blunt, hasn't likewise been heaping bravos toward the star center.
</P>
<P>
   Outplayed in Game 3 by Hitchcock's Ed Belfour, Roy dismissed it
yesterday by noting, ``I thought he could have played on a chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not a tough game for him. The only high shots we had
hit the crossbar and the post. And there was no traffic in front of
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy said this with no apparent malice in his heavily accented
voice. In fact, he grinned often and, at one point, professed, ``My
responsibility is to answer your questions as honestly as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, it seems, wears a mask only on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   For Stars fans, it has nonetheless been a revealing week. The
Avalanche thundered into the series having humbled the Detroit Red
Wings. The Avs' strengths, it was written, were a Hall of Fame
goaltender and talented centers like Sakic and Peter Forsberg.
</P>
<P>
   But in Game 2, the Stars carpet-bombed Monsieur Hall of Fame and
came away with four goals. In Game 3, on his home ice, the proud
Roy gave up three.
</P>
<P>
   He needs to ``make adjustments,'' Roy admitted. But neither he
nor his team, he said, is anywhere near the ropes that old teammate
Guy Carbonneau claimed after Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK, I'll turn that around,'' Roy said. ``I thought we had them
on the ropes after two periods in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things change so fast in a series. Detroit thought it had us
on the ropes after two games.''
</P>
<P>
   Verbally, Roy shoots. And in his mind, he always scores.
</P>
<P>
   This is the man who carried his Montreal Canadiens team to
Stanley Cup titles in 1986 and 1993. A native of Quebec, Roy was
more than a favorite son.
</P>
<P>
   But as the story goes, when coach Mario Tremblay left Roy in the
game one bloody night against Detroit in 1995 to absorb nine goals
in the first 32 minutes, Patrick stormed off the ice and told the
owner that his days in Montreal were done. General manager Rejean
Houle drew the line in the ice and stood by his coach and what he
called ``a century of tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy's former agent, Pierre Lacroix, now the Avalanche general
manager, was on the phone before the night was done.
</P>
<P>
   To save face, in effect, Roy walked out on a two-time Stanley
Cup winner and the most storied franchise in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   He remains no wallflower in the net, even with Joe Nieuwendyk
and Jamie Langenbrunner whizzing around him. Throughout the series,
Stars fans have seen Roy snatch a shot with his glove and then
brandish the puck high _ another trophy.
</P>
<P>
   But the act looks weak when you've given up four and three goals
in the past two games and your team looks as if it's on the verge
of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the first game, I think we were all trying to make the
perfect shot, the perfect play,'' Stars center Mike Modano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think we've been good about staying mentally strong with
whoever we face in goal. You can't start second-guessing yourself,
because that's what goalies want you to do. They want you to start
worrying about where to put the puck, rather than just getting it
on net.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever awe of Roy, it can be said, that the Stars may have had
in Game 1 has vanished by now. The emperor has no clothes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feed off his energy,'' Modano said of the Avalanche.
</P>
<P>
   But Roy has been mostly half show and only half substance in
these conference finals. You can argue over who has been the best
player in a Colorado uniform, but Roy has not even been the series'
best goaltender.
</P>
<P>
   The ``head'' has been unmasked. Now the body?

FROM A CLAIMER TO ACCLAIMED: THE SAGA OF CHARISMATIC
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The day after Charismatic won the Kentucky Derby, less than
three months after he had run in a claiming race for the second
time, the telephone rang in the Hollywood Park barn of Richard
Mandella, the world-class trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of my owners,'' Mandella recalled the other day,
with a wry little smile. ``He said he was simply calling to ask:
why didn't you claim Charismatic?''
</P>
<P>
   Mandella might have replied that nobody had claimed Charismatic
on Feb. 11, not even Bob Baffert, who had won the Kentucky Derby
the last two years before Charismatic exploded onto the scene this
year and who had even ran a horse against Charismatic in
Charismatic's first claiming race last Nov. 21.
</P>
<P>
   But Mandella knew that the owner was reacting the way any sane
person might. For the price of $62,500, any licensed trainer at
Hollywood Park last November, or at Santa Anita this past February,
could have entered a claim for Charismatic and, on behalf of a
client, taken a horse who has since won close to $2 million and
needs to win only the Belmont Stakes next Saturday to sweep the
Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   The rules of claiming races may sound complex, but they are
simple enough. Claiming races establish a relatively accessible
market for horses that are already racing, just as auctions or
private sales frequently do for younger horses and richer buyers.
</P>
<P>
   If you enter a horse in a claiming race, you stand to lose him
to anyone who enters a claim before the race. In some states, such
as California and New York, the claim can be entered by any trainer
who has run a horse at that meeting. Other states restrict the
claims to trainers who have a horse entered in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Some trainers enter a horse in a claiming race because the level
of competition is lower and the horse might gain some momentum if
he wins. Then again, the owner may lose the horse, although he may
not mind doing so.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a game of poker,'' Mandella said, meaning
the business of claimers, which is a lot like the business of
scouting and drafting baseball and football players. ``I once got
$40,000 for a filly that way, and later she won the Del Mar Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``My stable now is always so full of horses that I don't have
room or time to look for claimers. But you can't mourn the horse
that got away. If all the horses had to win the Kentucky Derby to
make your judgment stand up, you'd have one winner and 10,000
losers.''
</P>
<P>
   One winner, that's Charismatic. One huge winner. And maybe 100
trainers who did not detect his potential when he ran as a claimer
or who didn't want to spend $62,500 of somebody else's money to
claim him.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   At New York's major tracks, four or five of the nine races each
day are claiming races, run for price tags ranging from about
$10,000 to about $50,000 or more, with the price even exceeding
$100,000 on rare occasions.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Lakow, the racing secretary for the New York Racing
Association, reports that only two or three horses are claimed on
any given day. Last Nov. 21, when Charismatic won, 6 of the 10
races at Hollywood Park were claiming races.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hindsight,'' said Allen Jerkens, a New York trainer who
rarely deals in claimers. ``We put Kelly Kip in a claiming race the
first time he ran, and nobody took him. Why did we do it? His
mother hadn't produced anything yet. He had bunchy knees. We could
get $35,000 if he won the race, or if he was claimed. He won, and
broke the track record at Belmont Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more hindsight came into play later when Kelly Kip won the
Eclipse award as the country's leading sprinter. But Kelly Kip is
not the only champion who rose from the ranks of the lowly claimer.
The list is long and distinguished.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Spoon, a daughter of Citation owned by C.V. Whitney, had
a left foot that dragged and was put up for a claiming ``tag.'' She
later outran colts to win the Santa Anita Derby in 1959, and ran
fifth in the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The great John Henry ran five times as a claimer early on, then
raced until he was 9 years old, won 39 of his 83 starts and earned
$6.5 million. At one time, you could have claimed him for $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Stymie ran 12 times as a claimer for as little as $1,500, then
ran in the money 90 times in 131 starts. Seabiscuit, who started
his career with a 17-race losing streak, ran four times in claiming
races in 1935 on both coasts, then won 33 times.
</P>
<P>
   They were to racing what Don Mattingly, drafted in the 19th
round by the Yankees, was to baseball, and what Terrell Davis,
drafted in the sixth round by the Denver Broncos, was to pro
football: overlooked but marked for greatness.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So, why was Charismatic first placed in a claiming race at
Hollywood Park last Nov. 21? Probably because he had lost the first
five races of his career, had run ninth in his last race the month
before and was beginning to cost more than he was worth to his
owners, Bob and Beverly Lewis, and his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas.
Both are pillars of racing, but both realize that it costs maybe
$100 a day plus veterinary and blacksmith bills just to keep a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Bob Lewis, who has also owned Silver Charm and Serena's Song
among dozens of other star horses, put it bluntly, if a bit
ruefully, when he said, ``I just felt we had to stop the
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Wayne came to me and said: `There's an element of
risk in this. But he needs to be out front to get his confidence.'
Look, if I had picked him up for $62,500, I'd be overjoyed right
now. We paid $200,000 to buy him as a weanling. If somebody had
claimed him, we'd be getting back one-third of our investment.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas, who is closing in on the financial landmark of $200
million in earnings by his horses, admits that this one fooled him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've ever been fooled so much by a horse,'' he
said. ``I just didn't have any grasp on where I was going with him.
I felt there was something I was missing all the time. I felt I
wasn't pushing the right buttons. But I felt he hadn't won a race
and needed some confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Lukas paused, and then uttered the understatement of the year.
``We were lucky nobody took him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Chenery, the owner of Secretariat, took the high view.
``To run as a claimer tarnishes a horse's record,'' she said. ``If
Wayne had recognized Charismatic as a Secretariat-type of horse, he
wouldn't have run him in those claimers.''
</P>
<P>
   But Arthur Hancock, the owner of Menifee, who has finished
second to Charismatic in both the Kentucky Derby and the Preakness,
said with understanding: ``Horses are like people. Some kids don't
mature until college.''

MOTOROLA BEGINS EXPANSION OF WAFER  PLANT IN CHANDLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By REBECCA ROLWING  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a yearlong delay caused by a tremendous slump in the
semiconductor industry, Motorola Inc. said Thursday that it is
starting a $90 million expansion of its Chandler plant that will
ultimately create up to 500 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The construction plans are part of the previously announced $1.1
billion development of its MOS-12 waferfabrication plant. The
expansion is scheduled to be completed in 2002, and the new
employees will earn an average of $45,000 to $50,000 annually.
</P>
<P>
   ``When completed, the Chandler facility will be our largest
manufacturing campus in the world,'' said William Seiferth, chief
of staff for Motorola's Semiconductor Products Sector.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion will triple the number of processors,
microcontrollers and other devices made at the campus. The tiny
silicon devices go into everything from cars to cellular phones to
cable modems.
</P>
<P>
   The growth follows a year in which Motorola, the state's largest
private employer, slashed 2,075 jobs throughout its Valley
facilities as it implemented a brutal restructuring to save money.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts believe that after a few false starts, an
upturn in the semiconductor industry has begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The semiconductor industry has bottomed out,'' said Martin
Goslar, an analyst with Cahner's In-Stat Group in Scottsdale.
``Prices for semiconductor chips and components are starting to
come back to normal prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Motorola, the world's No. 3 chip manufacturer, already has
completed basic construction of the buildings on the 80-acre campus
at 1300 N. Alma School Road, between Warner and Ray roads.
</P>
<P>
   The company came to the site in 1983, when it built a
200,000-square-foot research and design facility.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Motorola built a 260,000-square-foot manufacturing
building and equipped the north half of it within three years. The
south half of the building wasn't fully constructed until last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the $1.1 billion expansion, Motorola said it will now
spend $50 million on robots and other technology to fully equip the
133,000-square-foot South Fab. Some equipment is already in, and
production has begun in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Motorola will spend $40 million to complete the interior
construction of the campus' 300,000-square-foot East Fab. Plans
call for installing heating, piping, gas lines and other equipment.
</P>
<P>
   The work is to begin in the next few weeks and should be
completed early next year.
</P>
<P>
   Almost $500 million will have been invested at the site by the
end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half of next year, Motorola will begin to use the
remainder of the $1.1 billion as it equips the two-story East Fab.
</P>
<P>
   The expansion project has already created about 60 jobs and is
expected to add 60 more by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola originally anticipated to complete the $1.1 billion
expansion in 2001. However, a steep drop in demand for chips
prompted the company to shelve its plans temporarily.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials didn't anticipate this phase of the expansion
to begin until later this year, but a strong demand for its chips
by the automotive and wireless industries rekindled the plans.
</P>
<P>
   Chandler Mayor Jay Tibshraeny cheered Motorola's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've kind of managed to weather the storm,'' he said. ``This
news reinforces what I'm feeling, that our economy in Chandler
remains very strong.''
</P>
<P>
   Seiferth said the new jobs have some insulation from the
fluctuations in the chip industry because they are used in a
variety of products.
</P>
<P>
   Jobs will be available for a variety of workers, including those
on the manufacturing line, process and design engineers and
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   However, many of Motorola's furloughed employees will not be
eligible to rejoin the company at this time.
</P>
<P>
   Most accepted voluntary severance packages, which prevent them
from returning to work for the company for two years. &QL;

PROSECUTORS FINISH CASE AGAINST REMAINING OFFICERS IN TORTURE
TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to add much new material and rewrite extensively following
3rd graf.)  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH P. FRIED   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The prosecution wrapped up its case Thursday against
the four police officers still on trial in the Abner Louima
brutality case, but without presenting the kind of directly
incriminating evidence that it amassed against Officer Justin
Volpe, who pleaded guilty in mid-trial this week and threw himself
on the mercy of the court.
</P>
<P>
   The case appears to be speeding toward a quick conclusion. After
the prosecution rested, just two days after Volpe pleaded guilty to
all the charges against him, the defense case began _ and quickly
ended for two of the defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer for Officer Thomas Bruder called no witnesses, and
Officer Charles Schwarz's lawyer called only one. Officer Thomas
Wiese's lawyers said they would call a couple of character
witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Only Sgt. Michael Bellomo intends to testify in his own defense,
his lawyer said. Judge Eugene Nickerson told the jurors Thursday
that closing arguments could begin on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution's case against three of the four defendants is
based in part on Louima's own account of being beaten and
brutalized in the 70th Precinct station house in Brooklyn on Aug.
9, 1997, though he did not directly identify any of the officers
aside from Volpe. Prosecutors also used testimony from fellow
officers and police records to try to tie the other defendants to
the abuse of Louima, a 32-year-old Haitian immigrant, and
subsequent efforts to cover up what happened.
</P>
<P>
   In concluding its case Thursday, the prosecutors sought to end
with a flourish by presenting what they suggested was the rest of
the broom _ bristles attached to a stick that had been broken off _
that had been used to torture Louima. It was found a week after the
torture of Louima behind a locker in the station house.
</P>
<P>
   Later, speaking with reporters, Schwarz's lawyer, Stephen Worth,
contended that the display was ``a typical prosecutorial cheap
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's absolutely no proof this is the other half of the
notorious stick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the evidence presented against the four remaining
defendants, in three weeks of testimony in U.S. District Court in
Brooklyn, focused on Schwarz. He is charged with holding Louima
down while Volpe rammed a stick into Louima's rectum, inflicting
severe internal injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Two witnesses testified that they saw Schwarz with Louima
shortly before the attack, and prosecutors sought to link him with
Volpe, who was fired from the force following his guilty plea.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Thompson, an assistant U.S. attorney in Brooklyn, told
the jury at the beginning of the trial, ``Justin Volpe and Charles
Schwarz began to inflict their own special brand of punishment,
their own special brand of torture.''
</P>
<P>
   Wiese and Bruder are charged with joining Volpe and Schwarz in
beating Louima, either after he was arrested in a melee outside a
nightclub or in a police car before he arrived at the station
house, although Louima could not identify any of the officers he
says beat him, except Volpe. Bellomo is accused of trying to cover
up the beating in the police car.
</P>
<P>
   The main evidence against Schwarz, 33, came from Louima himself
and two police officers who broke the ``blue wall of silence'' and
testified for the prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   Louima did not directly identify Schwarz, but said that the
officer who held him down during Volpe's attack in the restroom was
the same officer who had driven him to the station house. Police
records show that Schwarz was the driver.
</P>
<P>
   The two officers, Eric Turetzky and Mark Schofield, testified
that they saw Schwarz walk Louima, handcuffed and with his pants
down, toward the the restroom area.
</P>
<P>
   Worth vigorously cross-examined the prosecution's witnesses.
Worth has said that Schwarz was never in the restroom and that
Louima was wrong in saying it was the driver of the police car who
had held him down. He also underscored that Turetzky and Schofield
did not testify that they saw Schwarz taking Louima into the
restroom.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyers, Joseph Tacopina and Russell Gioiella, also
largely waged their cases through cross-examination, and when
Thursday's court session ended, they were in the midst of
presenting character witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence against Wiese, 35, includes Louima's testimony that
two of the officers who beat him in the police car were the same
officers who took him to the station house. He did not identify
those officers, but police records show that he was taken by Wiese
and Schwarz, and forensic evidence showed that DNA in blood found
in their car was consistent with Louima's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Wiese's lawyers contend that Louima's account of being beaten in
the police car could not be believed and that the blood had come
from injuries Louima received outside the nightclub.
</P>
<P>
   Bruder's lawyer, Stuart London, had told the jurors in his
statement at the start of the trial that they would not be hearing
much from him: ``There will be many witnesses in this case that I
may not cross-examine or that I may not cross-examine for a lengthy
period of time. That's not because I accept their testimony. It is
because it doesn't affect my client.''
</P>
<P>
   Louima testified that Volpe and a second officer, whom he did
not identify, approached the police car in which he said he was
beaten and joined in the assault. Police records show that Bruder,
33, was Volpe's partner that morning, and police records also place
Bruder at the scene of the reported beating.
</P>
<P>
   London also said that Louima was not credible in his account of
being beaten in the police car. He argued that the only reason his
client was even charged was that ``he was Volpe's partner that
night.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo's lawyer, John Patten, has said that he will put the
sergeant on the stand when the trial resumes on Tuesday, which
would make him the only defendant in the case to testify.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The prosecution evidence against Bellomo, 37, includes a report
he filled out about the events and a statement he later made to the
FBI, both of which prosecutors said contained false accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution also cited telephone calls the sergeant made to
other officers and investigators that they say indicate he intended
to discourage Schofield from going to investigators with his
information, and then tried to obscure that intention.
</P>
<P>
   Patten said the sergeant believed what he said in his report and
statements, and if they contained any errors it was because he had
relied on Volpe and the other defendants for information about a
chaotic situation _ the street melee. The phone calls, Patten said,
showed that the sergeant had in fact urged Schofield to cooperate
with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Bellomo was not charged in the assaults on Louima.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors, from the office of Zachary Carter, the U.S.
attorney in Brooklyn, have told the jury that Louima was beaten in
the police car and attacked in the station house restroom because
Volpe and three of the other officers mistakenly believed he had
punched Volpe in the face, knocking him down, during the street
melee.

ALICE ADAMS, 72, WRITER OF DEFT NOVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alice Adams, widely admired for her deft, elegantly observed
novels and short stories, died Thursday at her home in San
Francisco. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and
seemed to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   In 10 novels and five collections of short stories, Ms. Adams
created richly textured, artfully constructed novels about women's
lives that sometimes mirrored and sometimes anticipated changes in
the society as a whole. Admirers particularly praised her ability
to capture place and voice and the deceptively artful craft of her
writing.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams was born Aug. 14, 1926, in Fredericksburg, Va., grew
up in Chapel Hill, N.C., was educated at Harvard, and spent most of
her adult life in San Francisco, and her writing in many ways fused
the seductive intimacy of the South, the intellectual
sophistication of New England and the sense of adventure and
openness to new experiences of the West.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said
Ms. Wilson, her editor for 25 years at Knopf, where she published
all of her short-story collections and all but one of her novels.
Another novel, ``After the War,'' has been completed and will be
published next year. ``She was a master at condensing so much, with
so much resonance, into a short form,'' Ms. Wilson added.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Adams lived a life full of enough energy, contradiction
and nuance that it would have made an apt subject for her own
fiction. She was the only child of Agatha Erskine (Boyd) Adams and
Nicholson Barney Adams. Her father was a Spanish professor at the
University of North Carolina, her mother a frustrated writer full
of unfulfilled literary aspirations. Ms. Adams described her family
as ``three difficult, isolated people.''
</P>
<P>
   She graduated from high school at 15, at which point, she once
said, she ``ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that
women are supposed to be stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   She went to Radcliffe College, where she graduated at the age of
19 and soon married a fellow Harvard student, Mark Linenthal. The
couple spent their first year together in Paris, where she soon
realized the marriage was a mistake. ``I loved Paris,'' she said
later, ``except I disliked him so much.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple moved to San Francisco in 1948, where she found
little time to pursue her writing. Eventually the couple divorced
in 1958. Struggling to raise their only son, Peter, who survives
her, she began writing seriously soon after while holding a variety
of bookkeeping and clerical jobs. She published her first novel,
``Careless Love,'' to mixed reviews and after years of struggling
to establish herself published her first short story for The New
Yorker in 1969. She became one of the magazine's most distinctive
fictional voices, eventually publishing more than 25 short stories
there.
</P>
<P>
   She soon established herself as a skillful, widely admired
short-story writer, and her second novel, ``Families and
Survivors,'' the odyssey of a woman who moves from the South to San
Francisco and from relationship to relationship, was published by
Knopf in 1975. Reviewers either loved it or hated it, but it
established her as a serious literary presence. That novel was
followed by ``Listening to Billie'' in 1978 and the short-story
collection ``Beautiful Girl'' in 1979. The Washington Post Book
World compared the book to the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald ``in
both style and subject matter.'' She had her greatest success with
``Superior Women'' in 1984, which became a best seller and traced
the lives of five Radcliffe women from 1943 to 1983. Admirers saw
it as fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so enamored. Some critics found her work
mannered and humorless. But she became a consistent seller, who was
widely admired and sometimes imitated by other writers.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and
women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said Fran
Kiernan, a former New Yorker editor, who edited Ms. Adams' New
Yorker stories for 10 years, beginning with ``Beautiful Girl'' in
1977. ``She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of
life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams' stories have appeared in 22 O'Henry Awards
collections and in several volumes of ``Best American Short
Stories.'' She received an Academy and Institute Award in
Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and
Letters.
</P>
<P>
   Tall and striking-looking, with short blond hair, turning gray,
Ms. Adams was known for both her sense of style, her liberal
politics, and her wry view of life.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the difficulty of writing as one ages, she said,
``Some smart person once said that what happens is your critical
standards rise, and your talent does not necessarily increase in a
commensurate way.''

ADS GLORIFY, REWARD LACK OF JUDGMENT

 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to
promote the health benefits of drinking milk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed
Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to
do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still
be glorified.
</P>
<P>
   The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these
days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I
was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy
it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered
on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his
sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health
benefits of drinking milk.
</P>
<P>
   Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find
on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Going, going, gone. Time for milk. It's got stuff leading
sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium. That's
why I always have an ice cold glass ... as soon as I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical
question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the
steroid-producing substance androstenedione?
</P>
<P>
   He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire
summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during
last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally
unabashed in admitting his andro use. He says it ensures better
workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in
turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free
seasons in the dramatic 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for
abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and
failing on this issue is significant.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill
Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, called for
the federal government to study the health effects of
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year,
even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged
using the substance for at least one year as part of his training
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday,
former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's
leadership on this issue. And Moses was not afraid to point the
finger at McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid. Despite
all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food
supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the
influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000
teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _
have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alarming numbers are not the only story. Drug use in sport
is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean
competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be
addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who
are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still
lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a
natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by
the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his
innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply
depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial
substance now under serious scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took
place this NBA playoff season. It happened when I looked into
Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one
that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98
season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to
Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State
coach P.J. Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made
to shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm what's wrong with sports. I say I'm a
three-time NBA All-Star. People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the
camera close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine
Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since
Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model.
</P>
<P>
   Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial. It's just
pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than
to go ahead and send the wrong message.

CHESTER MIGDEN, 78, ACTORS GUILD LAWYER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Wash.)   (mk) 
 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Chester Migden, a labor lawyer whose work for the Screen Actors
Guild helped to establish the principle of paying actors for repeat
showings of the television programs, feature films and commercials
they appear in _ a practice that produces nearly $1 billion today _
died on Sunday at his home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Orsatti, the national executive director of SAG, said that
the contracts negotiated under Migden, who served as director from
1952 to 1982, ``improved the lot of actors a dozen times over.''
</P>
<P>
   As recently as the 1970s, when the weekly minimum for actors was
about $1,200, they received little or no compensation for multiple
usage of their appearances.
</P>
<P>
   In contract negotiations, Migden argued that actors should
receive a fair share of the revenue generated not only by free
television or first-time theatrical usage but by reruns and
supplemental markets like video cassettes and disks, and basic and
pay cable television.
</P>
<P>
   When negotiations failed in the fall of 1980, Migden led 60,000
actors on a 17-week-long strike, virtually shutting down Hollywood.
The dispute came close to being settled after a 21-hour day of
bargaining 10 weeks into the strike, but the meeting ended when
Migden said he was suffering from an allergic reaction to an
after-shave lotion. Some observers suspected a strategem.
</P>
<P>
   Born in New York on May 21, 1921, Migden graduated from Columbia
Law School in 1947 and became a staff attorney for the National
Labor Relations Board in New York. He soon joined SAG in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   After retiring in 1982, Migden became executive director of the
Association of Talent Agents, a position he held until his
retirement in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Dina, and three daughters, Barbara
Rosenberg of Los Angeles, Amy Olsson of Seattle and Ann Widdifield
of Santa Monica, Calif., and a grandchild.

SPORTS COLUMN: ABC AND INDIANAPOLIS 500 STILL A TWOSOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATT: Ind., N.C.)  (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When ABC Sports officials began planning their Indianapolis 500
coverage four months ago, they viewed Sunday's race, which begins
at 11 a.m. Eastern time, as possibly their last after 35 years. Fox
looked like the favorite to grab the rights.
</P>
<P>
   The interest existed despite ratings that have fallen since the
Indy Racing League and Championship Auto Racing Teams petulantly
split in 1995. Neither did the lack of Indianapolis 500 stars who
are capable of rivaling NASCAR's Jeff Gordon and Dale Earnhardt
reduce ABC's ardor.
</P>
<P>
   This remains a storied yet diminished sports event that ABC
needed to keep. Even the 5.5 Nielsen rating for last year's race
(down from 8.4 in 1995 before the IRL-CART split) is enviable these
days.
</P>
<P>
   The contractual uncertainty did not prevent the production crew,
led by Bob Goodrich, from making improvements for the viewing of
this year's 83nd edition of the race. With auto racing a terrific
laboratory for TV technology, it's almost impossible to resist
upgrading coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Twelve cars, up from six last year, will carry two cameras
apiece. Ten cameras will be placed above the pit crews, a common
perch at Nascar telecasts but never employed before at Indy. Al
Michaels will be the host, and Bob Jenkins, who called the race on
radio for 20 years, replaces Paul Page. There will also be an
attempt to talk to one or two drivers, like Arie Luyendyk, during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like Jekyll and Hyde,'' Eddie Cheever, the 1998 champion,
said in an ABC conference call. ``I don't think you'd want to hear
what I say.''
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that the enhanced production scheme led to ABC's
retention of the Indianapolis 500 through 2004 for $13 million
annually, up about 40 percent. The deal includes 10 Indy Racing
League races (half to be seen on ESPN) starting next year.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox Sports Net's nine-race IRL cable deal this season looked
like a precursor to a longer contract that would include the
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``But ABC had the right of first negotiation, and they made an
offer we couldn't refuse,'' said Barry Frank, the International
Management Group executive who negotiated the deal for the
Indianapolis Motor Speedway. ``This is a major event, no matter how
you slice it.''
</P>
<P>
   The expectation that Fox would take over undoubtedly persuaded
Jack Arute, once ABC's best reporter from the pits, to become an
analyst for Fox Sports Net's IRL races and a sideline reporter for
college football games.
</P>
<P>
   Also gone from Indianapolis 500 coverage is Page, who is calling
CART races for the network, including the Motorola 300 tomorrow. In
his place is Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the ultimate in my career,'' said Jenkins, who sounded
a smidgen boosterish about the race. ``This is the greatest
motorsports event in the world,'' he said. ``I know it. Bob
Goodrich knows it.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone does. The Indianapolis 500's slipping fortunes
since the split from CART has focused attention on the
better-marketed auto-racing domain of NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   The 9.5 rating for last February's Daytona 500 was nearly double
the 1998 Indianapolis 500's. NASCAR garners lengthy, usually
admiring treatment in magazines like Fortune and Newsweek, while
the Indianapolis 500 struggles to prove that drivers like Cheever,
Tony Stewart, Buddy Lazier and Luyendyk can maintain a one-day grip
on race fans' hearts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The level of competition in the IRL races has been very
good,'' Jenkins said. ``There is a misconception that drivers in
the Indianapolis 500 are picked off the street. They're extremely
talented drivers.''
</P>
<P>
   But the drivers, and open-wheel racing, have come under intense
scrutiny since May 1 when three spectators attending the IRL's
Visionaire 500 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., were
killed when a tire and other debris from a three-car crash carried
over a 15-foot fence.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, the IRL temporarily barred Ed Hinton of
Sports Illustrated from the Indianapolis 500 for his coverage of
the tragedy. He had the temerity to write that ``flying debris,
including loose tires that aren't contained by fenders, can be
deadly to bystanders _ especially those at oval layouts.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodrich said the I.R.L. has never chastised ABC for its
coverage of crashes or what its announcers say. ``Our only
direction is to journalistically cover what has to be covered and
do it in good taste,'' he said. ``I try to use good judgment, not
over-replay things, and do what's best.''

   KOSOVO-ASSESS (Washington) _ Publicly, the Clinton

   TEXAS-SCHOOLS-BUSH (Brownsville, Texas) _ On national

peers in other states. The trend has become so consistent that
Texas' public school system, long among the nation's most troubled,
is viewed today as an emerging model of equity, progress and
accountability. Texas children are the primary beneficiaries. But
with a presidential election next year, there will very likely be
another beneficiary: Gov. George W. Bush, who at the moment is the

   GACHET-FORGERY (Undated) _ Western attitudes to forgery have
changed over the centuries. In the 16th century, Vasari admired
Michelangelo for faking antiquities. The most famous forger in this
century, Hans Van Meegeren, went to jail for painting fake
Vermeers. Fakery thrives when people are beginning to understand an
art that they therefore prize unquestioningly, a situation akin to
new love. History being full of odd coincidences, it happens that
Van Meegeren was born right around the time when Van Gogh was
moving to a village called Auvers-sur-Oise, near Paris, where he
was to be under the care of a homeopathic physician, art collector
and amateur painter named Paul-Ferdinand Gachet. I mention Van
Meegeren because the Gachet legacy, which is the subject of a new
exhibition at the Met, ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Dr.
Gachet,'' for decades has been vexed by questions of deception and
fakery. By Michael Kimmelman.
</P>
<P>
   IMPRESSIONISTS-WINTER (New York) _ Think of the Impressionists
and chances are you think green (or possibly pink, or lavender, or
bluebird-blue in the case of Monet). They were painters of lawns,
hedges, and fertile fields, of a deciduous nature caught at full
leaf. But like artists anywhere with rents to pay and mouths to
feed, they were year-round workers. And inevitably winter
landscapes, rendered in the frosty open air or through the glass of
a studio window, figured in their repertoire. ``Impressionists in
Winter: Effects de Neige,'' which opens Friday at the Brooklyn
Museum of Art, brings together some 60 such paintings. And if ever
a show were tailor-made for summer viewing, this one is. By Holland
Cotter.
</P>
<P>
   MUSICALS (Undated) _ During rehearsals for ``I Married an
Angel,'' a 1938 musical comedy about a Hungarian banker, the show's
lyricist, Lorenz Hart, a quick-witted master of the last-minute
fix, decided to add a new number called ``At the Roxy Music Hall.''
When Joshua Logan, the director, asked anxiously how a number
filled with allusions to contemporary New York personalities could
possibly be made to fit into a comedy set in old Budapest, Hart
answered airily: ``Well, just bring up the subject of New York. You
can't sing about Budapest all night. We've got to give people a
little fun.'' To Hart's mind, no musical comedy, whatever its
putative locale, could be inhospitable to a mention of New York.
Dependent on a lavish flow of cash and illusion, too loud and
fast-moving for introspection or tragic denouements, the city is
not only the birthplace of the musical comedy form but also its
primary exemplar. By Ann Douglas.

EDITORIAL: FAILING THE TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Friday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   The dismal results of the new reading and writing test for New
York state's fourth-graders reveal how much needs to be done to
improve schools everywhere. Less than a third of New York City
students passed, and many city schools had failure rates above 90
percent. But the results are not reassuring for affluent suburban
districts either.
</P>
<P>
   The new test, replacing the multiple-choice third-grade reading
test, required students to listen to passages, read for
comprehension and respond with grammatically correct essays. This
is the first time fourth-graders have been tested on writing. The
scores may come as a shock to places like Westchester and Nassau
Counties, where nearly 95 percent of students passed the old test.
This year only 61 to 65 percent in those counties passed.
</P>
<P>
   But as disappointing as the results are in many suburban
communities, the outcomes in New York City are harrowing. Of
students there, 21 percent scored at the very lowest level,
compared with 6 percent in the rest of the state. Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani called this week for the removal of principals at the
bottom third of the city's elementary schools. Schools Chancellor
Rudy Crew should work toward that goal, but he can make headway
only if state law on principals' tenure is changed. Even dismissing
incompetent principals will not turn the whole system around. High
levels of poverty, dilapidated buildings and a shortage of
qualified teachers and principals remain huge impediments.
</P>
<P>
   The abysmal test scores suggest that Crew's proposal to end
social promotion next year may not be practical. Even spending $160
million on more summer school may not be sufficient. It may be
wiser to put off that goal until all classrooms have resources to
teach these children.
</P>
<P>
   Crew is also considering placing about 50 of the worst schools
directly under his control. That is a good idea, but the long-term
answer is to improve teacher training, increase salaries so that
the city can compete with the suburbs for staff, reduce class sizes
and provide good preschool programs.
</P>
<P>
   These costly efforts need the sustained political and financial
commitment of city leaders as well as Gov. George Pataki, who is
reneging on commitments made in 1997 to improve school financing.
State Education Commissioner Richard Mills has called the new test
an exercise in truth-telling. Part of that truth is that there is
no cheap, one-shot cure for educational failure of this magnitude.

EDITORIAL: THE CASE AGAINST MILOSEVIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   Though it may complicate peace negotiations, the indictment of
Slobodan Milosevic and four other Serbian leaders for crimes
against humanity is just and consonant with the bedrock principles
of a civilized international order. Serbia's systematic killing,
deportation and persecution of Kosovo's ethnic Albanians are surely
such crimes, and those responsible should be held accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so will not be easy, but the difficulty is no reason to
oppose the charges or their timing. The investigation and
prosecution of crimes against humanity rarely mesh smoothly with
political realities, in this instance the need for NATO to talk at
least indirectly with Serbian leaders about terms for ending the
war in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   However, if the world is committed to the humane principles the
United Nations endorsed in establishing the war crimes tribunal six
years ago, a way must be found to deal with the Kosovo conflict
without disabling the prosecution of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, that may mean negotiating with Milosevic's
government even while he is under indictment. The Clinton
administration has said it will do so, and that is the right
decision.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is the first sitting head of state in modern times to
be indicted by an international criminal tribunal. Unlike the
Allied prosecution of German and Japanese leaders after World War
II, this is not so far a case in which victorious powers can
dictate the terms of justice and compel defeated defendants to
stand trial.
</P>
<P>
   The international tribunal in The Hague, created by the Security
Council to deal with war crimes in the Balkans, is dependent on the
member states of the United Nations to arrest indicted suspects and
deliver them to the court. The tribunal has issued dozens of
indictments, sparing no ethnic group in the Balkans, but only a
handful of cases have come to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who have not been captured are Radovan Karadzic, the
Bosnian Serb leader, and his senior military officer, Gen. Ratko
Mladic, who were indicted in 1995. With Milosevic the immediate
issue is not arrest, but whether to deal with him now that he has
been indicted. Louise Arbour, the chief prosecutor for the
tribunal, warned Thursday that extensive evidence of crimes by
Milosevic makes him an unsuitable guarantor of any peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Over the long term, Ms. Arbour is right. But unless NATO is
determined to conquer Yugoslavia and remove Milosevic, which the
alliance has shown no inclination to do, he will remain in place
until his countrymen tire of his dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   That does not mean the indictment should, in effect, be waived
as part of a peace deal, or that Milosevic should feel secure from
arrest in the future. The principles involved are too vital to
sacrifice for political convenience. The indictment is not an
American action, or a NATO decision, and it ought not to be seen as
just another element in the propaganda claims and counterclaims
flying between Belgrade and Brussels.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal represents a noble effort to see that crimes
against humanity do not go unpunished. If the court is to be more
than an empty exercise, Milosevic and his colleagues must
eventually be brought to justice. &QL;

EDITORIAL: AN OLD CLONE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Friday, May 28:
</P>
<P>
   Well, maybe it won't be so easy after all to gain immortality by
cloning a replica of yourself, or to produce a whole basketball
team of Michael Jordan clones, or even a herd of super-cows. The
researchers who shocked the world by cloning a lamb known as Dolly
from the cell of an adult sheep have now discovered that Dolly is a
lot older by one measure than she ought to be.
</P>
<P>
   That unnerving discovery has given rise to macabre jokes. The
clone, some experts say, is ``a sheep in lamb's clothing,''
perversely combining the inexperience of youth with the biology of
the aged. Indeed, if the finding is true, it could pose serious
obstacles to the success of cloning.
</P>
<P>
   In the typical aging process, at least in the laboratory,
structures attached to the chromosomes _ known as telomeres _ get
shorter each time a cell divides until eventually the cell dies.
Researchers were initially jubilant when Dolly seemed normal and
produced healthy lambs. But now they have found that the telomeres
in Dolly's cells are slightly stunted, perhaps reflecting the age
of the cell from which Dolly was originally cloned. The finding
raises the disturbing possibility that cloned animals may age or
sicken prematurely, making it problematic whether cloned
super-herds (or cloned people) would last as long as hoped.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody yet knows whether the finding will hold up or be truly
important. But consternation over the report is a reminder that, as
scientists tinker with complicated bodily processes, they cannot
always predict the consequences.  &QL;

ADS GLORIFY, REWARD LACK OF JUDGMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The national dairy industry is using Mark McGwire to
promote the health benefits of drinking milk.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a rebel sneaker company called And1 has signed
Latrell Sprewell to promote the misguided notion that it is OK to
do whatever you want, including choke your coach, and you'll still
be glorified.
</P>
<P>
   The sports images in advertising are certainly eye-opening these
days, even with Dennis Rodman out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   The other day while driving on Aurora Avenue through Seattle, I
was twice stopped at a red light long enough to realize how crazy
it was to have McGwire towering over the road, his image plastered
on a billboard _ bat in hand, sleeveless shirt revealing his
sapling-sized biceps _ a veritable poster-boy for the health
benefits of drinking milk.
</P>
<P>
   Milk mustache in full view, McGwire's pitch (which you can find
on the Web at www.whymilk.com) is simple:
</P>
<P>
   ``Going, going, gone. Time for milk. It's got stuff leading
sports drinks don't _ like protein, potassium and calcium. That's
why I always have an ice cold glass ... as soon as I get home.''
</P>
<P>
   Which prompts any rational sports fan to pose the next logical
question: Does McGwire drink the milk before or after he pops the
steroid-producing substance androstenedione?
</P>
<P>
   He may have clobbered Maris and Ruth and ignited an entire
summer, but McGwire stands for something else, too.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since McGwire's andro use became public knowledge during
last season's great home-run chase, McGwire has been generally
unabashed in admitting his andro use. He says it ensures better
workouts in order for him to pump up his massive body, which in
turn probably allowed McGwire to have one of his most injury-free
seasons in the dramatic 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the incredibly generous things McGwire has done for
abused kids and for the game of baseball, his blind spot and
failing on this issue is significant.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., earlier this month, President Bill
Clinton's drug policy advisor, Gen. Barry R. McCaffrey, called for
the federal government to study the health effects of
androstenedione.
</P>
<P>
   The over-the-counter supplement's popularity soared last year,
even among school-aged children, soon after McGwire acknowledged
using the substance for at least one year as part of his training
regimen.
</P>
<P>
   In an article he wrote for The New York Times last Sunday,
former Olympic hurdler Edwin Moses said he supports McCaffrey's
leadership on this issue. And Moses was not afraid to point the
finger at McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Androstenedione, better known as andro, is a steroid. Despite
all the misinformation to the contrary, it is neither merely a food
supplement nor is it innocuous,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing anti-doping crusader, Moses is alarmed at the
influence athletes like McGwire have over the behavior of children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The National Institute of Drug Abuse estimates that 175,000
teenage girls and 325,000 teen-age boys _ that's 500,000 children _
have reported using steroids during the past year,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The alarming numbers are not the only story. Drug use in sport
is also a fraud on the public, which is promised a product _ clean
competition _ that is not ultimately delivered ...
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of drug use by elite athletes must continue to be
addressed on the federal level by General McCaffrey and others who
are responsible for children and public welfare,'' Moses said.
</P>
<P>
   Milk mustaches are one thing, but the taint of andro use still
lingers with McGwire, whose bat speed and ability made him a
natural anyway to set a new standard for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   What might have been unnatural were McGwire's workouts, aided by
the quick-recovery time andro allowed his muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That is what makes you look up at McGwire's billboard and his
innocent milk mustache and wish like heck the guy had simply
depended on the natural goodness of milk, not the controversial
substance now under serious scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   On a different front, a similar sort of head-scratching took
place this NBA playoff season. It happened when I looked into
Latrell Sprewell's eyes during his ill-advised sneaker ad _ the one
that is set to air 200 times before the NBA Finals.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell, who was suspended by the NBA for most of the 1997-98
season and who later sued everyone from the league to his agent to
Converse sneakers because of his physical assault of Golden State
coach P.J. Carlesimo, was certainly aware that his new ad was made
to shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say I'm what's wrong with sports. I say I'm a
three-time NBA All-Star. People say I'm America's worst nightmare.
I say I'm the American dream,'' the sneering Spree says into the
camera close-up.
</P>
<P>
   The new ad was predicted by the national trade magazine
Brandweek to be the most controversial sneaker endorsement since
Nike made Charles Barkley say he was no role model.
</P>
<P>
   Well, turns out Spree's ad isn't controversial. It's just
pathetic, which is what happens when you don't know any better than
to go ahead and send the wrong message.

DODGERS WIN A NAIL-BITER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ When the organization fires its pitching coach to
spark the team, a blister on the tip of a finger seems nothing more
than a hangnail-type dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe a fingernail-type dilemma.
</P>
<P>
   Ismael Valdes' latest start ended like many of the other ones
this season. He pitched well and had a low pitch count, but had to
leave the game early because of blister problems. The latest
episode came in the Dodgers' 4-3 win against the Cincinnati Reds on
Thursday at Cinergy Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was over the blister, but evidently he trimmed
his nails and that caused a big blister to come up underneath (his
middle finger),'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I don't
know about blisters. It's way over my head. I told him to get with
(Kevin) Brown and Chan Ho (Park) and see what they do. I have
enough problems without worrying about a damn blister.''
</P>
<P>
   As trite as it seems to be talking about blisters the day after
Charlie Hough was fired, it's become a main focus for any start
involving Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed two runs on four hits in five innings, but like many
of his outings, it ended prematurely. The blister pains Valdes
(5-2) particularly on his breaking pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I've done in the past I haven't done this year
(to remedy the blister),'' said a frustrated Valdes.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers won their second straight game and their first
series since they took two of three from Chicago May 10-12. But
Valdes is yet to pitch beyond the sixth inning in five outings this
month despite allowing more than three runs only once.
</P>
<P>
   It's gotten to the point where Valdes is ready to go to the
local 99-Cent Store for some press-on nails to remedy the problem.
In 1996, Valdes used an acrylic fingernail to combat a blister
problem, and he's thinking of doing it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to (the blister), but at the same time I'd like to go
deep into games,'' Valdes said. ``You do your best, but there's
always a reason something happens. We scored runs. I would have
liked to keep pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he pulled Valdes because if the blister broke it
would cost the 25-year-old at least one start, and he turned to the
bullpen. Pedro Borbon was fine for 11/3 innings, but set-up man
Alan Mills and closer Jeff Shaw had to battle. Mills walked four
and allowed a run in 12/3 innings. Shaw, the former Reds closer,
got Sean Casey to fly out to center field with two runners on in
the ninth for his 10th save.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you can go on the road and get a series, especially
the first series of a three-city road trip like we're on, it's a
good thing,'' Shaw said. ``That's how you put distance between
teams, winning the close ones.''
</P>
<P>
   First baseman Eric Karros hit his seventh homer in the fourth
for the Dodgers' first run. The Dodgers (24-22) added three runs in
the fifth to take a 4-2 lead as Eric Young doubled in two runs and
scored on Raul Mondesi's single.
</P>
<P>
   Reds starter Pete Harnisch (4-5) gave up eight hits and four
runs in 41/3 innings, his second shortest outing of the season.
</P>
<P>
   It's the Dodgers' eighth one-run win, but only their third in
May. However, it does send them to Atlanta for a three-game series
(followed by three in Pittsburgh) with a much better feeling than
they had before arriving in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won two out of the three games because we played well and
we go to Atlanta and have to try and do the same thing,'' said
Mondesi. ``We have a real good team and we're supposed to play
better than they way we've played.''

COMMENTARY: A LONG DAY OF VENTING ABOUT NEW YORK CITY'S POLICE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The issue of ``Police Practices and Civil Rights in
New York City'' seemed too deep, too massive for one hearing by the
U.S. Commission on Civil Rights in an undersized hotel meeting room
in Manhattan. The torture of Abner Louima and the shooting of
Amadou Diallo by police have made this historic issue altogether
too current. And so the hearing on Wednesday brought out a large
and unhappy crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who came to wave angry banners were penned behind
police barricades on Seventh Avenue, safely out of the way of
tourists trying to see ``Beauty and the Beast.'' Others squeezed
into a few dozen public seats in the hearing room. Their turn to
speak would come long after the cameras were gone.
</P>
<P>
   But the success of the commission's session should not be judged
entirely by the 15-hour marathon of statistics and complaints. The
real advantage may well be the commission's ability to find small,
concrete possibilities for improvement in the avalanche of
conflicting words about an emotional subject. Moreover, the
commissioners are demanding the kind of hard data about police
practices that is too often difficult to get from the New York City
Police Department and City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani started the long day by explaining why
New York City was so much safer now than when he arrived in 1995.
Amid hisses and groans from the audience, a red-faced mayor argued
that the reason so many blacks and minorities were being stopped
and frisked was that they fit the descriptions given to police by
the victims.
</P>
<P>
   While such tense moments attracted the media, commissioners were
focused on other less rhetorical matters such as a comment by James
Savage, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association.
Savage, who is running for re-election, has been arguing that
police officers are under too much pressure to increase arrests.
These quotas, he said, are designed to satisfy the city's
statisticians who want to show how well police are fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Savage argued, police ``never get a good
report for protecting someone's civil rights.'' The commission's
chairwoman, Mary Frances Berry, began taking notes and later asked
the police commissioner, Howard Safir, why there were no incentives
for protecting civil rights. Respecting a person's civil rights is
an integral part of an officer's job, Safir explained.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the possibility of asking for incentives for protecting
civil rights, the commissioners made it clear they would look at
the 48-hour rule that allows a police officer to postpone any
statements in an investigation of a police incident. They
questioned whether the Civilian Complaint Review Board was strong
and independent of police influence. Frank Wohl, the board's
chairman, argued that its independence was assured because members
were not appointed by the police commissioner but by the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoa,'' somebody in the audience yelled, as others merely
booed.
</P>
<P>
   It was a fractious crowd, its size restricted by the small room,
but the commission could hardly miss its testimony of momentous
frustration.

JOHNSON: ANOTHER BIG ERROR BY DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ You look at the catcher the Dodgers threw away and
mark it down as a big, fat ``E''. No need to check with the
official scorer on this one. It's obvious the Dodgers erred when
they traded Charles Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   It has been almost six months since the gaffe and you're still
shaking your head in disbelief. It pains you to see Todd Hundley's
labored motion to second. You miss Johnson's quick release and
cat-like reflexes.
</P>
<P>
   You think back to all the curves thrown at Johnson last season,
on the field and off, and you wonder how it was he finished with
only eight errors. That was a tad on the high side for him but
still fewer than the Dodgers' brass made in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Many nights last summer you could see the strain on Johnson's
face. It was a heavy load he carried, replacing Mike Piazza and the
death soon after the trade of a grandmother he considered his
second mom, along with the impending birth of his first child, a
son who arrived in L.A. a mere month after Johnson did.
</P>
<P>
   He did a superlative job by anybody's standards except his own,
earning his fourth consecutive Gold Glove award. That should have
been enough to make all the hardened hearts in the Dodgers' front
office crack with pride.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years had come and gone since John Roseboro, the only
other catcher on the club to be so honored, had won the second of
his two Gold Gloves. As such, you expected the Dodgers to act
swiftly, maybe commission an artist to paint a mural of Johnson at
Dodger Stadium or something.
</P>
<P>
   But erase his name from the roster? That, you didn't anticipate.
Truth to tell, neither did Johnson. He had narrowed his choice of
semi-permanent residences in L.A. to an agreeable few and was
looking forward to many more summers of high expectations and low
humidity.
</P>
<P>
   He says he was shocked when the Dodgers' new general manager
Kevin Malone telephoned him in Miami this past Dec. 1 and told him,
ever-so-politely, that the Dodgers no longer would be needing his
services.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, Johnson wanted to believe it was April 1 and this
was somebody's cruel idea of a joke. Alas, it was true. Johnson was
going to Baltimore by way of the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers got Hundley in the deal and the Orioles, well, they
got measurably better.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 27, has been everything manager Ray Miller envisioned
the four-time Gold Glove winner would be and more. Not only has he
been a dependable _ and indefatigable _ presence behind the plate,
he has been delivering  &UR; !ital! &LR; at &UR; !off! &LR;  the plate, too.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the Orioles' game against the Angels Thursday,
Johnson led Albert Belle and the rest of his teammates with 10 home
runs. ``I'm just trying to do what I can do,'' says Johnson, who
admits he pressed in an effort to produce at the plate when he was
with the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a lot more relaxed. I can truly admit that now,'' says
Johnson, who had 12 home runs in 102 games as a Dodger. ``I tried
to do too much when I was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, he's just too much. All that defense and 10 homers, too!
You'll have to forgive Miller if he feels like the guy who gets set
up at the prom with the class valedictorian, only to have her named
prom queen.
</P>
<P>
   Miller credits Orioles hitting coach Terry Crowley for Johnson's
hitting makeover. Ever since Crowley encouraged Johnson to shorten
his swing, the catcher's numbers have been anything but compact.
</P>
<P>
   After mustering just one RBI in April, Johnson has produced 19
in 21 games in May. He was batting .343 for the month before
Thursday's game against the Angels. And lest anybody had forgotten
what Johnson's real strength is, he threw a perfect strike to
second in the fifth inning to stop the Angels' Orlando Palmeiro
cold in the Orioles' 6-3 win.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had a spiteful bone in his body, he might be tempted
to send the videotape of that throw to the Dodgers. Alas, he's
nothing but class.
</P>
<P>
   You listen to him talk about his days with the Dodgers and you
start to see why Johnson didn't fit into the Dodgers' plans. He has
far too much character.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed L.A.,'' Johnson says. ``I was a little bit upset
when I found out I was being traded. It was very disappointing to
me. The Dodgers brought me over for defense and I won a Gold Glove
for the organization and yet everybody seemed to be disappointed in
my offense. I could never understand that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's easier to hit a grand slam these days than fathom the
Dodgers. Just ask Charlie Hough. &QL;

WALDO SEMON, INVENTOR OF VINYL, DIES AT 100 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Waldo Semon, a chemist and inventor who brought about the age of
vinyl, died Wednesday at a nursing home in Hudson, Ohio. He was
100.
</P>
<P>
   Though the material he developed has spread and oozed into
ubiquitous use, with 44 billion pounds a year being produced to
provide clothing, shelter, pipes, records, knickknacks, bumper
stickers, luggage, toys and automobile interiors that make new cars
smell the way they do, its discovery in 1928 did not generate
immediate enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Semon had arrived two years earlier at the B.F. Goodrich Co.
research lab in Akron and had been assigned to find ways that would
keep rubber from aging and cracking. He worked on this project, but
in his spare time he explored the qualities of vinyl polymers that
had been known for decades as useless stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``People thought of it as worthless back then,'' Semon recalled
in an interview a few years ago. ``They'd throw it in the trash.''
</P>
<P>
   In his experimentation he concocted a powdery material with a
consistency between that of sugar and flour. Combining chlorine
derived from sea water and ethylene formed from petroleum, he
thought it might serve as an adhesive for bonding rubber to metal.
That never worked. But when he mixed the polyvinyl chloride powder
in a solvent and heated the mixture at high temperatures, a
gelatinous substance emerged that could be made in batches of
greater or lesser hardness and elasticity.
</P>
<P>
   Semon found that the material, PVC for short, could easily be
molded and that it was waterproof and fire-resistant and would not
conduct electricity. Yet in the aftermath of the stock market crash
of 1929, no one seemed interested in seeking out uses for the new
plastic. Still, Semon kept looking for applications, and after
watching his wife, Marjorie, make curtains, he realized that vinyl
could be used as a fabric. Gradually he won over his superiors and
by the early 30s the company was marketing the material under the
trade name Koroseal. It soon appeared in shower curtains, umbrellas
and raincoats. In 1933 he received a patent for the material.
</P>
<P>
   Today the vinyl he came up with is second only to polyethylene
as the world's most widely used plastic and accounts for a $20
billion-a-year-industry.
</P>
<P>
   For his discovery, Semon was inducted into the National
Inventors Hall of Fame in 1995, joining Thomas Edison, Alexander
Graham Bell and about 100 others. Then 97, he mentioned in an
interview several other innovations he had helped develop in the
years until 1963 when he served as director of research for B.F.
Goodrich. Notable among the innovations was Ameripol, a synthetic
rubber introduced in 1940 after many years of research. Also called
``liberty rubber,'' it became a prototype for the petroleum-based
materials that eventually replaced natural rubber in the
manufacture of tires.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, various forms of synthetic rubber,
including many developed under Semon's supervision, came to replace
the natural rubber needed for military equipment such as plane and
Jeep tires and gas masks. Before the war, when synthetic rubber was
not yet good enough to make tires, the monthly production of
hard-rubber hair combs consumed enough rubber to outfit 375
six-wheel Army trucks with tires.
</P>
<P>
   In responding to questions about his career, Semon often took
pleasure in noting one of his inventions that met with far less
success than either vinyl or Ameripol _ synthetic rubber bubble
gum. ``It looked just like ordinary gum, except that it would blow
these great big bubbles,'' said the inventor, who failed to get the
endorsement of his superiors for further development of this
project. ``Unfortunately, B.F. Goodrich thought that this was a
defect and that nobody would buy it.'' Conventional bubble gum was
invented in 1928 by Walter Diemer, an accountant at the Fleer
Chewing Gum Co. in Philadelphia, who died last year.

MO CAN'T GET ANGELS PAST GUZMAN

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Anaheim Angels manager Terry Collins looked in
the mirror Thursday morning and saw a 50-year-old man staring back
at him.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Collins do to celebrate this milestone birthday? He
shook up his lineup, only to find out no matter how much he moved
things around, the results were similar to those when he was 49.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense sputtered again in a 6-3 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles before 24,724 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson's grand slam off Angels reliever Mike Magnante in
the seventh inning broke open a 2-1 game and paved the way for the
Orioles' second win in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Guzman (2-4) gave up one run and three hits in six innings
to get the victory over Angels starter Ken Hill (1-4).
</P>
<P>
   Collins got a few fresh bats in the game and moved some others
around in an effort to change the fortunes of an offense that went
into the game ranked 11th out of 14 American League teams in
hitting. But with Orlando Palmeiro and Jeff Huson among those
getting a chance to play, it ultimately came down to Mo Vaughn
providing the bulk of the offense once again.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn homered (No. 11) and doubled twice, driving in two runs.
Randy Velarde drove in the Angels' other run with a single in the
eighth inning, but the late rally proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had a chance to jump all over Guzman early but missed
their chance. Guzman walked three batters in the first inning and
gave up a double to Vaughn, but all the Angels had to show for it
was one run. It had to bother Collins, who before the game said the
key to getting Guzman was to get him early in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Hill went into the game having walked 41 batters, the most in
the majors. ``But even when he's walked guys this year, his stuff
has been good enough to get him through,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Through six innings, Hill walked only one, but he found trouble
in the seventh. With one out, Will Clark and Cal Ripken singled
before Hill walked Delino DeShields to load the bases. Charles
Johnson followed with a grounder that appeared headed down the
left-field line. Instead, third baseman Troy Glaus made a diving
stop, but his throw to first was too late. The runners advanced and
the Orioles had a 2-1 lead.

KANSAS CITY MAYOR'S CAMPAIGN AIDE WORKED ON PLAN TO PRIVATIZE
DEPARTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GROMER JEFFERS JR.  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The top consultant for Mayor Kay Barnes
during her campaign was working at the same time for a St. Louis
company that wants to take over the operations of the Kansas City
Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   Political consultant Pat Gray was hired to develop a plan to buy
or manage the Water Services Department if it's ``privatized,''
said Chris McKee, a director at Environmental Management Corp.
Barnes has helped lay the groundwork for privatization since taking
office April 10.
</P>
<P>
   A document outlining a plan for taking over the department was
obtained by The Kansas City Star. It called for the department to
be sold or leased by Nov. 1, 1999, to EA2//Systems, a consortium of
three companies that includes Environmental Management.
</P>
<P>
   The document included a detailed strategy to discredit the Water
Services Department's reputation so that the public would support a
private takeover. It also outlined the need to overcome opposition
from labor unions and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said the document could have been stolen from his office
and declined to comment about it. McKee confirmed that Gray worked
for his company and on the mayor's campaign at the same time.MDNM/,
but he also declined to comment on the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get into specifics about our strategy,'' McKee said.
``But we are interested. We would be crazy not to be interested.''
</P>
<P>
   Gray's involvement with both Barnes' campaign and the St. Louis
company does not violate any laws. But some city officials
privately said that it may give the appearance the company has an
unfair advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that she was aware of EA2//Systems' desire to manage
the Water Services Department, but that steps she has taken since
assuming office had nothing to do with Gray's work for the company.
She said she knew of Gray's involvement with the company during her
campaign, but would not comment on whether it was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said she could support a public//private partnership in
running the Water Services Department but opposed its sale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to maintain our employee base,'' she said. ``But
maybe there could be changes in the management and marketing
levels.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnes said that her interest in public//private partnerships
extends beyond the Water Services Department to facilities such as
Kemper Arena. But she said her position on privatization was not
influenced by Gray.
</P>
<P>
   Gray said that EA2//Systems, which operates several city-owned
water departments throughout the United States, was interested in
running the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   But he said he would not comment on a contractual relationship
or the document because it's ``part of an ongoing investigation,''
a reference to a reported break-in at his office before the
municipal election. A police report on a break-in March 5, however,
indicated only petty cash was taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why the The Star would base a story on a document
that could have been stolen,'' Gray said. ``Who knows what happened
to it? It could have been doctored.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper provided Gray with a copy of the document,
obtained anonymously through the mail, but he repeatedly refused to
look at it. ``I don't want to see it,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the plan document, Gray and Steve Glorioso, who
also worked on Barnes' campaign, would direct a public relations
effort to overcome expected resistance from labor unions and
minorities. Those groups make up a large part of the Water Services
Department's roughly 1,000-person work force.
</P>
<P>
   Listed as local advisers to EA2//Systems were Gray, political
consultant; Glorioso, news media consultant; and Jack Holland,
financial consultant. Holland, a local executive with Fahnestock &AMP;
Co., a brokerage firm that handles bond issues, has worked for
municipalities and Jackson County as a financial adviser. He also
was an informal adviser to the Barnes campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Glorioso and Holland said they had no knowledge of the document
and couldn't comment on it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael T. White, a Kansas City lawyer representing
EA2//Systems, said the company was interested in either buying or
managing the Water Services Department, but said he has not seen
the document.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole thing was stimulated by the city auditor's report a
couple of years ago,'' said White, a political supporter of Barnes.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1995 report, City Auditor Mark Funkhouser suggested
possibly selling the Water Services Department for $80 million to
$180 million. In a recent interview, however, Funkhouser said the
city could retain ownership by leasing the department's assets and
charging a large up-front fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Privatization) is a good thing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Water Services Department is one of the city's largest and
most profitable. Its operating budget is about $122 million, and it
has projected revenues of $182 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, one goal was to elect a mayor and a
majority to the Kansas City Council that favored privatization of
municipal services such as the Water Services Department, a
strategy McKee acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just waiting for some direction from the city,'' McKee
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he hired Gray 18 months ago and spoke with Barnes six
months ago about the possibility of his company managing the
department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've spoken with Kay and she understands that other cities
have benefited from outsourcing,'' said McKee, who said that he
didn't know Barnes until after hiring Gray.
</P>
<P>
   McKee also declined to comment on a copy of the plan document
given him by The Star.
</P>
<P>
   On May 6, Barnes announced that the Water Services Department
and the Public Works Department would be the first City Manager Bob
Collins would analyze in an effort to cut costs and improve
efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt those two departments are far-reaching in their
activities and that they present some unusual considerations as to
how they are run,'' Barnes told the City Council at the time.
</P>
<P>
   On May 20, the council authorized Collins to study privatizing a
full range of city services, including Kansas City International
Airport operations and the Water Services Department.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 27,000 water systems in the United States are
privately owned, including St. Louis County's water plant. It's
operated by EA2//Systems, which in addition to Environmental
Management includes a British firm, Anglican Water Co., and
American Waterworks of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The plan document obtained by The Star anticipated opposition to
privatizing Kansas City's Water Services Department. The document
listed six obstacles, including an ``If it ain't broke, don't fix
it'' public attitude and overcoming minority and union opposition.
</P>
<P>
   To sway public opinion, the document outlined a media campaign
to take place between Jan. 1 and June 30, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The document called for using ``standard media channels'' to
discredit the Water Services Department by alleging mismanagement
of funds, violation of EPA standards, deception on bond issues and
patronage.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said Thursday, however, that the department ``makes
money, is efficiently operated and is a model for the way water
companies should operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The document stated that the goal of the campaign to discredit
the department would be to ``trigger a new city audit of the Water
Services Department.'' After the audit was finished, the document
said, the department would become a major issue in the municipal
election. Other issues identified were privatization of city
services and rebuilding infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Although privatization and infrastructure became issues in this
year's municipal election, no audit was triggered.
</P>
<P>
   The plan document called for the new mayor and council to work
on privatizing the Water Services Department immediately after the
1999 election with ``the sale of the Water Services Department and
its assets to EA2//Systems taking place by Nov. 1, 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The document even contained a mock-up of a Star article about
the sale under the fictitious byline of ``Joe Shiester.''

PROPOSAL WOULD PUT BARTLE HALL NAMING RIGHTS UP FOR SALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICK ALM  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ By year's end Bartle Hall could become the
city's biggest billboard.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine ``H. Roe Bartle Hall at the Sprint Convention Center
Complex.'' Or the Hallmark complex. Or the Gateway 2000
complex...or even (shudder) H. Roe Bartle Hall at the Trump
Convention Center Complex.
</P>
<P>
   It's been happening in other cities for almost three decades,
and it could happen here if the City Council approves an idea
advanced Thursday by its Convention &AMP; Entertainment Centers
Management Advisory Authority to sell naming rights to some
deep-pockets local corporation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about six figures a year,'' said Bill LaMette,
director of the city's convention facilities. ``That's the going
price. A lot of cities are going to it. It's something we can't
afford to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   LaMette said other public buildings in Kansas City weren't under
consideration for similar deals _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we'll certainly discuss,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's action authorized a city advertising consultant to
begin soliciting reaction and preliminary proposals from interested
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year the issue could be presented to the council for
a decision on whether to proceed with a formal contract process.
</P>
<P>
   No council consensus has formed on the issue, said Councilman
Evert Asjes, chairman of the advisory authority.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at the viability of it,'' he said Thursday. ``We
want to look at the numbers and the caliber of companies interested
in buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, though, the revenue would be substantial _ more than
$500,000 a year, Asjes said.
</P>
<P>
   A consultant for the city, Ken Krogman of Des Moines, Iowa, said
preliminary survey work already had documented exactly what
name-buyers wanted to hear: that their corporate moniker on a
high-profile public building such as Bartle would generate tens of
millions of annual consumer ``impressions'' _ from news reports,
traffic driving by the facility and the millions of people who
annually attend events at Bartle Hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sponsors get more bang for their buck,'' he said of name
selling, which is one of the hottest tickets in the advertising
world right now.
</P>
<P>
   Krogman is the driving force behind new marquee signs that soon
will grace the outsides of Bartle Hall and Kemper Arena _ complete
with advertising side panels featuring Coca-Cola, Coors beer and
UMB Bank, among others.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to sell naming rights to Bartle Hall won't come
without some municipal soul-searching, LaMette said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think there may be some sensitivity toward renaming the
convention center. We don't want to tamper with the integrity of
the name....We would never stop using the name Bartle Hall.''
</P>
<P>
   Krogman said he has been there before in similar building
re-naming campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people do choose to let it turn into a billboard,'' and
that offends the local population, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas City officials already have laid down the law regarding
marquees and building names, Krogman said. ``It has to be done with
taste.''
</P>
<P>
   There is precedent in Kansas City for trading dollars for a
high-profile name.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, local banker R. Crosby Kemper Jr. donated millions to
help finance the development of an arena in the city's West Bottoms
area. The next year the Crosby Kemper Memorial Arena was named by
the council in honor of Kemper's father, R. Crosby Kemper Sr.
</P>
<P>
   Miles Prentice, the presumptive next owner of the Kansas City
Royals, has made no secret of his intention to increase advertising
revenues at the stadium _ and to take a hard look at naming rights.
</P>
<P>
   Half the teams in baseball's major leagues have sold stadium
naming rights. Major League Baseball itself is exploring whether to
sell advertising space on players' jerseys.
</P>
<P>
   And the outfield wall at Kauffman Stadium is now a collection of
billboards _ for Pepsi, Price Chopper and others _ a la
turn-of-the-century baseball parks.
</P>
<P>
   LaMette and Asjes agreed that the city certainly could use the
money that renaming rights would bring.
</P>
<P>
   It costs about $12 million a year in tax money to staff and run
Bartle Hall and its companion facilities.
</P>
<P>
   LaMette said a mayor's task force two years ago identified about
$60 million in needed or desirable repairs, upgrades and
infrastructure improvements to keep the convention property
competitive with other convention facilities in other cities. Those
needs range from new paint and carpeting to new seating and
plumbing and electrical system upgrades.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of things we need,'' LaMette said, ``and this
(corporate naming rights trend) isn't going to last forever. We
need to strike while it's hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, city officials are debating expansion plans for
Bartle Hall before the complex becomes hemmed in by other buildings
and can't grow.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the council is exploring wholesale
privatization of the management of facilities such as Bartle Hall,
parking garages and the like, which promises to put an entirely new
twist on the commercialization of public property.
</P>
<P>
   According to Amusement Business magazine, the modern era of
corporate sponsorships for public buildings began in 1973, when a
dairy company bought naming rights to Buffalo (N.Y.) Stadium and
called it Rich Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The stadium is still home to the National Football League's
Buffalo Bills. The dairy outfit reportedly paid $1.5 million over
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   The price has gone up.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996 the Tropicana beverage company agreed to pay $40 million
over 30 years to rename the Thunderdome in St. Petersburg, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A year later the Bank One corporation signed a $66 million,
30-year deal to have its name associated with the home of Major
League Baseball's Arizona Diamondbacks.
</P>
<P>
   When Columbus, Ohio, built a new civic arena, the Nationwide
insurance group stepped up to the plate with 90 percent of the
estimated $125 million construction tab _ and got to name the
place.
</P>
<P>
   One of the world's foremost practitioners of corporate vanity _
New York real estate mogul Donald Trump _ is headed to Kansas City,
perhaps just in time to put in his bid for Bartle Hall naming
rights.
</P>
<P>
   According to public records, he already operates several Trump
golf clubs, Trump Palace, Trump Plaza, Trump Tower, Trump Castle,
Trump Village and Trump Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Trump's bid to buy the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas City is
expected to be approved by the Missouri Gaming Commission sometime
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone expects him to call it Trump Casino.

DAY-CARE OWNER CHARGED IN ATTACK OF TWINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE LAMOY  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Kan. _ One felony and three misdemeanor charges
were brought Thursday against the owner-operator of a Kansas City,
Kan., day-care center where twin 6-year-old girls said they were
sodomized and raped earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   Margaret Hardridge, 55, was not in custody Thursday evening, but
she has a lawyer who has been in contact with police. Hardridge has
not cooperated in the investigation, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The felony charge _ ``aiding a felon'' _ alleges that Hardridge
tried to help two of the suspects avoid arrest, Wyandotte County
District Attorney Nick Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our allegations are that after it was made known that the
girls were sexually molested, she was able to get some of the
participants to lie and say it didn't happen,'' Tomasic said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said Hardridge was able to influence two boys who are
related to her. The boys are among five charged with numerous
counts of sexually assaulting the twins.
</P>
<P>
   The misdemeanor charges against Hardridge include two counts of
endangering the girls and one of violating state child-care
regulations. Under guidelines of the Kansas Department of Health
and Environment, which issues licenses for day-care operations, no
children over the age of 3 may play outdoors without the
supervision of an adult who remains within hearing distance at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they (the victims) were left alone out in the yard,
unsupervised, and something did happen to them,'' Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   Conviction upon the felony charge carries a maximum punishment
of nearly two years in prison. None of the misdemeanor charges
carries a punishment of more than a year in jail. Hardridge has no
record of any felony convictions in Wyandotte County.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic has said that Hardridge was on the premises when the
attack occurred but that investigators don't know where. They also
don't know if any other adults were on the premises, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody's talking,'' Tomasic said.
</P>
<P>
   Tomasic said Hardridge had retained a Kansas City, Kan., lawyer,
Marcus B. Potter Jr. Potter did not return two phone messages left
with his office Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Tomasic filed charges against four 13-year-old boys
and an 11-year-old boy alleging that all of them sodomized the
girls. One 13-year-old and the 11-year-old were charged with rape.
A sixth boy who was present but not involved was not charged.
</P>
<P>
   The five suspects, all Kansas City, Kan., residents, are in
juvenile custody. If found guilty, they could be sentenced to state
custody until they turn 21.
</P>
<P>
   Police sent the files involving the boys to Tomasic last week,
but police did not complete the investigation involving Hardridge
until this week. Tomasic said it was not unusual for cases
involving several suspects to arrive at his office in segments.
</P>
<P>
   The twins, who live with their mother in the Armourdale area of
Kansas City, Kan., told police on May 16 that they had been raped
and sodomized at the day-care center the previous day. The girls
later said that several boys attacked them in a backyard shed and
the basement of the facility, which operated in side-by-side
houses.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the attack, the boys were in the back yard of the
facility playing basketball, and the girls were playing on swings.
</P>
<P>
   The girls apparently said nothing to their mother after she
picked them up on May 15. But they did tell her the next day, when
the girls again went to the day-care center.
</P>
<P>
   The mother took the girls to the University of Kansas Medical
Center, where they were treated and examined and police were
called. Tomasic said one of the girls was traumatized.
</P>
<P>
   Hardridge had been licensed to operate the day-care center since
March 23, 1998. Under that license, she was allowed to care for up
to six children at a time, said Don Brown, spokesman for the Kansas
Department of Health and Environment.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Hardridge requested a license to keep up to 12
children at once, Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   She was granted a temporary permit to operate with the greater
number of children until the Public Health Department of Wyandotte
County's Unified Government could inspect the facility, he said.
The state agency contracts with the local department to inspect
day-care centers.
</P>
<P>
   The state agency ordered Hardridge's center closed on May 19,
two days after the allegations surfaced.

MAN ARRESTED FOR KANSAS CITY AREA CROSS-BURNING 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ A 20-year-old Lenexa, Kan., man was arrested
Thursday in a cross-burning in the yard of a black Overland Park,
Kan., family. Police were investigating whether it was a form of
retaliation for a fistfight between two teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County District Attorney Paul Morrison said a felony
charge of making a criminal threat would be filed today against
Brian J. Hoffman, who also was identified as the suspect in a
statement by Overland Park, a suburb of Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI is considering whether to seek federal hate-crime
charges against Hoffman, who is white. He was being held Thursday
night in the Johnson County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's in a lot of trouble because of an incredibly stupid,
hateful act,'' Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-year-old youth also was questioned but was not arrested.
</P>
<P>
   About 9:15 p.m. Wednesday, two males placed a cross on the front
lawn of the house, a neighbor told police. The two lighted the
cross, then ran down the street and drove off in a red car, the
neighbor said.
</P>
<P>
   The description of the car led officers to Hoffman and the
16-year-old, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Morris Harris Sr., who lives in the ranch-style house with his
two children and wife, said he thinks the two waited for the family
to leave before approaching the yard. He believes a school fight
Wednesday involving his son, Maurice, played some part in the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Maurice Harris, 17, fought with another student at
Shawnee Mission North High School. That student is not a suspect,
but all four individuals are acquaintances, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Maurice Harris said the school fight was not racially motivated.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson County authorities take cross-burnings and other hate
crimes seriously, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to ask yourself, does a person that does something
like this have any idea how bad it is or how it affects other
people?'' Morrison said. ``It never ceases to amaze me that in this
day and age people are thoughtless enough or stupid enough to do
something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Kansas does not have a specific hate crimes law, a
judge can double a sentence if it can be proved that a crime was
motivated by racial or ethnic hatred, Morrison said.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted, Hoffman could face six months to three years in
prison under state sentencing guidelines, depending on his record,
Morrison said. Hoffman does not have a criminal record in Johnson
County, according to court records.
</P>
<P>
   Federal charges would carry a sentence of up to 10 years in
prison.
</P>
<P>
   Hate crimes are increasing across the country, FBI spokesman
Jeff Lanza said. But, he said, ``I believe this is the first time
in recent history that we've had one in Johnson County.''
</P>
<P>
   Overland Park Mayor Ed Eilert called the cross-burning
despicable and vulgar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just as neighbors and friends of the Harris family find this
unbelievable to comprehend, we too have little understanding why
anyone would commit such a vicious and hateful act,'' he said. ``On
behalf of the citizens of Overland Park, I want to firmly state
that such hate crimes will not be tolerated in this community.''
</P>
<P>
   Morris Harris Sr., who recently graduated from the Overland Park
Citizens Police Academy, said the family had no intention of
leaving the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very serious act,'' he said. ``But at the same time
we're going to try to live and go on with our lives.''

FORMER CONGRESSMAN LAMENTS PERSISTENT HOUSING DISCRIMINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER MANN  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Former U.S. Rep. Louis Stokes was in Kansas
City on Thursday to talk about housing discrimination in terms the
banking community best understands: It costs everyone, including
mortgage lenders, money.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Housing and Urban Development,
2.5 million instances of housing discrimination occur against
minorities every year. Congress has earmarked $47 million for
fiscal 2000 to root out those practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's $47 million right there, right off the top, that it's
costing Americans,'' Stokes said. ``I think that figure would
appeal to mortgage lenders, particularly when they're making more
money than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes, who for 30 years represented a Cleveland district in the
U.S. House, addressed about 100 people attending ``Breaking Down
the Barriers,'' a home-ownership symposium put on by HUD and the
Economic Development Financial Corp. Stokes encouraged the crowd to
continue the crusade to right discriminatory wrongs in America.
</P>
<P>
   Discrimination in housing or any other area of life is an
attitude problem, Stokes said, and it's hard to change people's
attitudes. So, he said, some people need to be talked to on a level
they understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody who is a bigot wants to be known as a bigot,'' Stokes
said. ``But they will respond to leadership ... and regardless of
where they are in their hearts, they will understand the
economics.''
</P>
<P>
   Stokes told about an apartment manager receiving HUD money who
proudly boasted of his ability to keep African-Americans out of his
complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought when my children became adults there wouldn't
be discrimination in our society,'' said Stokes, 74. ``Instead I
have grandchildren facing the same issues I did as a young man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is difficult to believe as we enter a new century that we
are still grappling with discrimination in all facets of our
society in the greatest country in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But progress is being made, Stokes said.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year, 72.8 percent of white
households owned their own home. That compares with 46.9 percent
for black households and 46.2 percent for Hispanic households.
</P>
<P>
   Though the gap is substantial, home ownership among black and
Hispanic people is growing faster than for the population as a
whole. For instance, from 1994 to the present, 39 percent of new
homeowners were minorities, although they accounted for just under
a quarter of the total population.
</P>
<P>
   Stokes still despairs, particularly after reading a recent
series in The Kansas City Star about housing discrimination in this
area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It cited that rejection rates (for mortgages) of upper
middle-class African-Americans is tantamount to that of low-income
whites,'' Stokes said. ``To me, that showed the blatancy of
discrimination.''

HIGHER FUEL PRICES WON'T DETER MOTORISTS THIS MEMORIAL DAY
WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Moderately higher gasoline prices won't deter
motorists from hitting the road this Memorial Day weekend, predicts
Charlie Barr, assistant director of the Clay County Parks and
Recreation Department.
</P>
<P>
   The unofficial opening of the summer driving season also is the
first time in months that many families have had three days in a
row during which no one has had to be at school or work, said Barr,
who has been watching recreationists flock to Smithville Lake north
of Kansas City, Mo., each summer for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
   Upward of 45,000 people are expected there if this weekend's
weather is as pleasant as forecast.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Fourth of July or Labor Day, when travel costs
sometimes sway travel plans, ``Memorial Day is a `get me out of the
house' holiday,'' Barr said.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, a record 33.3 million Americans will travel at least
100 miles this long weekend, according to the American Automobile
Association and the Travel Industry Association of America, a trade
group in Washington. Most plan to travel by car, despite higher
gasoline prices.
</P>
<P>
   Motorists traveling in or through the Kansas City area aren't
likely to find fuel prices alarmingly higher, price watchers say.
</P>
<P>
   AAA Automobile Club of Missouri, in its most recent Kansas City
area survey, taken last week, found lead-free regular gasoline
selling for an average $1.08 a gallon at self-service pumps. That
is up from $1.01 a gallon during Memorial Day weekend last year.
</P>
<P>
   Regional prices for lead-free regular range from $1.34 in the
far western United States to $1.06 in the Southeast, according to
the auto club survey.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, production problems that contributed to an April
increase in prices at the pump now appear to have eased, said
Trilby Lundberg, Los Angeles publisher of the Lundberg Survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this time, what seems most likely is further drops in pump
prices, pre-Memorial Day and beyond,'' Lundberg said last week
after her organization's weekly poll of 10,000 service stations
across the United States found the first decrease in prices since
early March.
</P>
<P>
   But she said there were two unknowns: crude oil prices and extra
strong gasoline demand.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Energy Department forecasters in Washington say gasoline
demand this summer will increase about 2.4 percent from
year-earlier levels, mostly because more drivers will be on the
road.
</P>
<P>
   But crude oil prices generally have been falling from peaks in
April and are expected generally to stay flat or rise only slightly
through September, the forecasters say.
</P>
<P>
   Their bottom line? Retail prices will dip slowly starting next
month, but motorists on average will pay about 9 cents a gallon
more than a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Prices that motorists pay will depend on where they travel this
weekend, other observers say. Informal spot checks around Kansas
City suggest that many stations have dropped their prices a penny
or two since the auto club's most recent survey last week.
</P>
<P>
   Area residents who travel to the Lake of the Ozarks will be able
to fill up for the trip home for under 98 cents a gallon, if the
prices that prevailed at midweek don't change, said Joel Pottinger,
executive director of the Lake of the Ozarks Convention and Visitor
Bureau.

BOXER, GORE SETTING SIGHTS ON MORE GUN LEGISLATION
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By MARC SANDALOW 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  Washington _ Now that the Senate has passed modest gun control
measures, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., says she is prepared to
push for far more sweeping firearm restrictions, including a ban on
``Saturday night specials.''
<P>
   Fulfilling the gun lobby's worst fears, Boxer said that
restrictions on gun ownership approved last week, the first gun
control measures passed by the Senate in five years, are just the
beginning of a more comprehensive legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we get some commonsense gun legislation passed, we will
put forward more commonsense legislation,'' Boxer said during a
breakfast this week with California reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer's comments came as Vice President Al Gore and Democratic
leaders in the House pressed for quick passage of the Senate bill.
Approved in the wake of gun violence at schools in Colorado and
Georgia, the Senate bill would require background checks on buyers
at gun shows, ban the import of high-capacity ammunition magazines,
and prohibit ownership of assault weapons by minors, among other
things.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation was given little chance before the rash of
school violence galvanized public support. In the five years since
Republicans took control of Congress, gun control measures had
never been brought to the floor for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most everybody realizes enough is enough,'' said Gore, who as
president of the Senate cast a tie-breaking vote on one of the key
measures. ``It is time to act.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats purposely withheld some of their more controversial
proposals in hopes that more-modest measures would be impossible to
defeat. Like Boxer, Gore said the Senate bill was only a start.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that even more needs to be done than what was done in
the Senate,'' Gore said. The Clinton administration has proposed a
series of measures including a mandatory three-day waiting period
for handgun purchases and holding parents responsible for their
children's access to guns.
</P>
<P>
   In the House, Republicans rejected Democratic demands that votes
be held this week. But Republican leaders indicated that they will
take up the matter next month, and are prepared to support most of
the provisions contained in the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer presented reporters with her own gun control wish list,
which in addition to a three-day wait period, includes a ban on
``junk guns'' such as Saturday night specials; a ban on gun sales
to minors; a ban on brightly colored guns that resemble toys; a ban
on bullets that can pierce body armor used by police; a limit of
one gun purchase per month; and a law to guarantee local
governments the right to sue gunmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of these are modest, commonsense proposals,'' Boxer said.
``We did the first step, and hopefully we'll do another step.''
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said that she is meeting with a small group of Democratic
senators to plan strategy, and that no timetable for the
introduction of the additional measures has been decided upon. But
she said she expected they would all be introduced before Congress
adjourns at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives at the National Rifle Association declined to
respond to Boxer's proposals. NRA Vice President Wayne LaPierre,
testifying before the House Judiciary Committee, said that his
organization supports elements of the Senate bill, but that the
legislation as it is currently fashioned is unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
   As an example, LaPierre said the NRA is not opposed to
background checks on buyers at gun shows, as long as they are done
instantly. The bill that passed the Senate provides up to three
days to conduct the check, a process that could impede some sales.
</P>
<P>
   He blamed the media and ``made-for-TV lawmaking'' for what he
called the perception of the NRA as a ``reckless societal pathogen,
a mighty extremist empire opposed to safety, caution and reason.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a cruel and dangerous lie,'' LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   LaPierre took issue with a comment made by film director Spike
Lee, who according to a New York newspaper said of NRA President
Charlton Heston: ``Shoot him _ with a .44-caliber Bulldog.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What's unreasonable is when a new level of hate rhetoric
becomes acceptable because it's aimed at honest gun owners,''
LaPierre said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the gun lobby's most persistent arguments against gun
control measures is that any new controls lead down a slipperly
toward a ban on gun ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer said she does not support a gun ban, but she would support
mandatory registration of handguns.
</P>
<P>
   ``You register your car. What's the problem registering your
gun?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't view any of these as zealotry,'' Boxer added. ``Here's
my goal: I want to make sure that guns are kept away from
criminals, from people with mental problems, and from children.''

CLEMENS NOW A SIGHT FOR EYESORES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ This was nothing like watching Roger Clemens pitch
for the Toronto Blue Jays. This was Clemens in Yankee pinstripes.
This was swan boats in the Harlem River, Legal Seafood chowder at
P.J. Clarke's, Ted Kennedy summering in the Hamptons.
</P>
<P>
   The bad karma goes all the way back to a drunken gentlemen's
agreement struck between Red Sox owner Harry Frazee and Yankee
owner Jacob Ruppert _ both New Yorkers. It has outlasted almost
every other sports hex and frustrated Red Sox Nation for eight
decades.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees bought Babe Ruth and held the mortgage on Fenway
Park. Then they won all the games that needed to be won. There was
'49 and there was '78. Boston had a DiMaggio, but New York had the
best DiMaggio. The Yankees swiped Sparky Lyle and Luis Tiant. Bucky
``Bleeping'' Dent. Then they made us watch Wade Boggs, in
pinstripes, riding a horse after winning a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   Now Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The scoreboard reads like this: world championships won since
1920 _ Yankees 24, Red Sox 0. Sounds like a Jets-Patriots final.
</P>
<P>
   It was against the black crepe backdrop of Hub hardball history
that Clemens performed his artistry Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, beating the
Red Sox, 4-1, with seven innings of two-hit pitching.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clemens's first appearance against Boston while wearing
the uniform of the hated Yankees and gave him an American
League-record 19 consecutive wins over two seasons (the major
league record is 24 by Carl Hubbell in 1936-37). He also pulled the
Yankees within a half-game of the Sox in the AL East. Since his
furious departure from Boston, Clemens is 3-0 with a 1.64 ERA in
five starts against All Duquette's Men.
</P>
<P>
   As ever, Clemens downplayed the impact of sticking it to the
Sox. There was no Duquette executive box to glare at, and he simply
won't acknowledge that he loves to kick the spit out of his former
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every win is a nice win for me,'' he said. ``It's not just
Boston. I've pitched against Boston. They've got a good club. They
put the ball in play. Being over here, a lot of teams come at you
extremely hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Let Clemens pretend it's no big deal. It's like when Bill
Parcells tells us he gets no extra kick from continually
embarrassing the Bob Kraft Athletic Club.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Clemens in pinstripes against the Sox was a little like
watching Parcells with the Jets or Arthur Fiedler with the New York
Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   After warming up in the home team bullpen in The House That Ruth
Built, Clemens skipped around the corner to Monument Park and wiped
sweat from his brow on the Babe Ruth plaque. This was part of his
routine when he wore a Red Sox uniform. In those days, it was
Roger's humble attempt to break the Curse of the Bambino. Now his
job is to perpetuate the Curse.
</P>
<P>
   Fans were treated to a stirring national anthem by Robert
Merrill, then Clemens took the mound at 7:06 p.m. while the public
address system bounced Elton John's ``Rocket Man'' off the Yankee
Stadium facade.
</P>
<P>
   He fanned the first Sox batter, fellow Texan Jeff Frye. Patrons
upstairs pinned a special-edition Clemens K card (featuring a photo
of a space shuttle launch) to the front wall of the upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   After Frye struck out, John Valentin drilled a hard hopper to
the right of Derek Jeter. Jeter made no attempt to get in front of
the ball, and when it ricocheted off his glove, the official scorer
awarded Valentin a hit. It should have been an error. It looked as
if the scorer was protecting Jeter, but his decision would prove
controversial when Clemens allowed no other hits through the first
five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter loves playing behind Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tells the infield where they're going to hit it,'' said the
shortstop. ``He'll verbally tell you, `Here it comes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Boston starter Pat Rapp hit Chuck Knoblauch in the third, and
you didn't need Peter Gammons to tell you that some payback was en
route. Clemens could not let that go unchecked. Knoblauch is a
teammate, a Texan, and a fellow Hendricks client.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin led off the fourth, but the Rocket spared his longtime
teammate. After Valentin grounded to third, Clemens threw at Reggie
Jefferson's head on an 0-2 pitch. Jefferson ducked, saved his life,
then struck out. Clemens had five K's in the first four innings.
</P>
<P>
   He had trouble with his location in the fifth and sixth. After
two Clemens walks in the sixth, Valentin tied the game with a sharp
single to left. Clemens threw 25 pitches in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very disappointing when guys are fighting to give you one
run, then you turn around and give it back,'' he said. ``I was
fortunate to get out of that inning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was mad at himself,'' said Yankee manager Joe Torre. ``He
figured, `They got me a run; that should be enough.' That's what
the great ones do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemens got the side in order in the seventh, and that was it.
He threw 105 pitches, 62 strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee crowd was fairly tame about the whole matter. As
always, most of the emotion was being felt by folks back home in
Boston. At times, the New York-Boston rivalry is a little like the
Humphrey Bogart exchange in ``Casablanca.'' Peter Lorre
(representing Boston) says, ``You detest me, don't you, Rick?'' and
Bogart (New York) says, ``If I gave you any thought, I probably
would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the rivalry is more of a big deal to the fans now than
it is to the players,'' said Don Zimmer, a man who has played no
small role in baseball's Hatfield-McCoy feud. ``Back in the '70s
when I was coaching and managing in Boston, the Red Sox and Yankees
really hated each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Zim has been with Clemens in Boston and in New York. He knows
that New York is where the rings are won. That's why Clemens is
here, another living monument to eight decades of Boston torture at
the hands of the evil New York empire.

CLEMENS HAUNTS RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
 SOX-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a portrait in pinstripes, he was no different than
when he flaunted a Canadian bird above the bill of his cap.
</P>
<P>
   Once more with feeling, Roger Clemens reduced his former mates
to an exercise in frustration, mastering the Red Sox with the same
alacrity with which he fled Yawkey Way 29 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who in the first two seasons of his voluntary exile won
more games (41) than in his last four years in the Fens (40), beat
his old team for the first time Thursday &UR;  &LR; night as a Yankee, 4-1.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens allowed just one run and two singles, both by John
Valentin, struck out seven, and threw one pitch at somebody's head
(Reggie Jefferson) in seven innings before departing to the cheers
of 27,631 in Yankee Stadium who happily cursed his name in years
gone by.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing about Roger,'' said Valentin, who drove in the
Sox' run in the sixth. ``All those years I played behind him, but
the more I see him, the better I think he is. He's a great pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean you can't beat him. But he was quite
different when I was playing behind him. He was more of a power
pitcher, and for a couple of years, I didn't think he had the
command he now does with his offspeed pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether he would say that, I don't know. But when you've
played behind him, then see him again as a batter, you can see the
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, the Yankees had lost seven of eight, including two
straight to Boston, before El Duque, Orlando Hernandez, tamed the
Sox in Fenway. Now, after a double dose of Hernandez and Clemens in
the last two nights that ended a four-game Boston winning streak,
including the opener here, the Yankees have won five of seven to
draw within a half-game of the Sox, whose lead in the American
League East may be sorely tested by a three-day weekend in
Cleveland, the hottest team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't overmatched,'' Sox first baseman Mike Stanley said
of splitting six games in the home-and-home set against the
Bombers. ``The last two nights, we had pretty good pitching
performances against us.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, we've pitched well. We haven't been blown out of the
water. We know we can play with them.''
</P>
<P>
   But so far, they have yet to beat the Rocket, who not only
benefited from the fifth straight errorless game turned in by the
Yanks but made two fine defensive plays, barehanding a ball by Jeff
Frye in the third and starting a double play in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens, who has three wins and two no-decisions in five starts
against the Sox, extended his AL record to 19 straight decisions
without a defeat, a streak that began one year ago Saturday. He is
within five of the major league record set by another New Yorker,
Carl Hubbell of the Giants, 62 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   While he relied more on his split-fingered fastball and slider
to keep the Sox off balance, he wasn't above uncorking his fastball
at Jefferson's nose an inning after Boston starter Pat Rapp hit
Chuck Knoblauch in the back with a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson ducked out of harm's way, but there was no mistaking
the message.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the devil,'' Valentin acknowledged after first
saying that hitters can't worry about being hit by a Rocket thrust.
``It creeps in.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankee offense did some creeping of its own to score two
runs off Rapp, who was not overmatched by Clemens as much as he was
undone by New York baserunners, who stole three bases and hurried
rookie catcher Creighton Gubanich into a throwing error that led to
the go-ahead run in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees snapped a scoreless tie in the fifth, which opened
with Chili Davis's ground single up the middle. Davis broke early
for second on an apparent run-and-hit play, then came to a stop,
but his premature move went unnoticed by Rapp, who delivered to the
plate. Gubanich still nearly got him, but Davis kicked the ball out
of the glove of Nomar Garciaparra, back at shortstop after missing
a game with a finger injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see (Davis) getting edgy,'' Stanley said, ``and when
he broke early, I screamed, but I guess it was too late. How often
do you see a play like that? I think it caught (Rapp) off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   One out later, Tony Tarasco drove a single up the middle,
scoring Davis.
</P>
<P>
   With Clemens enduring a stretch in which he went to a full count
against five of six batters, Valentin tied the score in the sixth
when he drove a single through the left side to bring in rookie
Trot Nixon, who ignored Jefferson's frantic admonition to slide and
was nearly tagged out by Jorge Posada.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees seized the lead for good in the bottom of the inning
when Jeter singled, stole second, and went to third when Gubanich's
throw sailed into center field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his first day back,'' Rapp said of Gubanich. ``He
didn't get good throws down all three times. I guess he was a
little nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Rapp almost waded through, retiring the next two hitters before
Tino Martinez lined a single low off the wall in right to score
Jeter. That brought Jimy Williams out of the Sox dugout and a
summons for lefthander Mark Guthrie.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't go over well with Rapp, who hadn't walked a man all
night. He snarled at pitching coach Joe Kerrigan when approached in
the visitors' dugout, then slammed his glove against the bat rack
as he made his way to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a man on first, I didn't think I was coming out,'' Rapp
said. ``There were two outs and a chance to get an out to go to the
next inning, but Jimy made his move and we didn't give up another
run there.''
</P>
<P>
   The reprieve was short-lived. Posada homered off Guthrie in the
seventh to make it 3-1, and Bernie Williams singled home the fourth
run off Jim Corsi in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens was in the clubhouse long before three relievers,
including closer Mariano Rivera (13th save), finished off the Sox.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he was as powerful as I've seen him before,''
Valentin said. ``But he's just a polished pitcher now.''
</P>
<P>
   And that polish now glows in the Apple.
</P>

PECA SPARKS SABRES 
</HEADLINE>
 LEAFS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO _ Ottawa found out. Ditto the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Toronto's turn.
</P>
<P>
   A few too many mistakes and a little too much Michael Peca. That
combination of booboos and the relentless buzzing of Peca and his
fellow checkers did in the Maple Leafs Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, resulting
in a 4-2 Buffalo victory that gave the Sabres a 2-1 advantage in
the best-of-seven Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were the better team tonight,'' said Toronto
captain Mats Sundin, who, like Alexei Yashin and Jason Allison
before him, was silenced by Peca's dogged checking. ``There was a
stretch there of five or six minutes when they made less mistakes
than we did _ and our mistakes cost us the game.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since their opening playoff series vs. the
Senators, the Sabres were working with a full lineup. They had
Dominik Hasek back in net, along with Michal Grosek and Miroslav
Satan up front. When the night was over, they also had their 10th
victory of this playoff season, tying a franchise record and
leaving them only two victories shy of returning to the Stanley Cup
finals for the first time since 1975.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great _ I always said we're a good team when we're
healthy,'' said Buffalo coach Lindy Ruff, whose club is 10-3 in the
playoffs. ``We're still good even when we're not quite so
healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest addition was Hasek, who sat out Games 1 and 2 of
this series with a strained groin. Hasek, it turns out, reinjured
himself in Game 4 of the Boston series, which was by far the
Bruins' worst performance of the postseason. He was still hurting
in Games 5 and 6 against the Bruins. If they had been able to push
the series to the limit, Hasek might not have been able to play.
Now there's some added summer agony for Boston fans.
</P>
<P>
   Satan's return was a big boost to the Buffalo offense. He led
the club with 40 goals in the regular season but went down in Game
3 of the Ottawa series with a badly bruised ankle (courtesy of an
Alexei Zhitnik slapper). Thursday &UR;  &LR; night he touched off a
three-goal second period in which the Sabres erased a 1-0 deficit
and took a 3-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're standing and watching,'' said Leafs coach Pat Quinn,
whose club managed only three shots in the first period _ one of
them good for a Yanic Perreault goal. ``We don't pursue as well as
we'd like. All three games, we haven't done what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   In large measure, Toronto's inability to make plays and score
has been because of the Sabres' supreme checking line, centered by
Peca and with Dixon Ward and Vaclav Varada on the wings. Peca
figured in only only goal Thursday &UR;  &LR; night, a tiebreaking strike by
ex-Bruin Joe Juneau that came with Buffalo killing a penalty.
Otherwise, Peca's chief assignment was minimizing Sundin's
effectiveness. The big Toronto captain still managed five of his
club's 26 shots but didn't make the scoresheet. Sundin also fouled
Peca twice, resulting in four minutes in the penalty box for the
most valuable Maple Leaf.
</P>
<P>
   The Sabres essentially won it with their run in the second,
beginning with Satan's tying strike against Curtis Joseph at 3:07.
The Leafs were guilty of a poor pass exchange between defensemen
Sylvain Cote and Tomas Kaberle, resulting in a loose puck that
Satan swatted in with a quick backhand. Only 38 seconds later, Peca
bolted out on a penalty kill and hit CuJo with a long-range slapper
off right wing. Juneau cruised in for the easy conversion, not a
Maple Leaf defender in sight. Next, at 7:38, Stu Barnes popped in a
power-play goal (Sundin in the box for holding, you guessed it,
Peca).
</P>
<P>
   The Leafs cut it to 3-2 before the period ended when former
Ranger Alexander Karpovtsev drilled in a power-play goal while
Hasek was trying to recover his stick. With 28.1 seconds to go in
the game, Curtis Brown connected into an empty net, with CuJo
pulled for an extra attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the old-time flavor of the postseason, a nasty
punchfest broke out with 12.6 seconds to go, featuring the Sabres'
Erik Rasmussen vs. Kevyn Adams, the former Bruins first-round draft
pick. The Sabres were rankled by the fact that Quinn rolled out
tough guys Tie Domi and Kris King with the game essentially
finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classless!'' said Ruff. ``I don't think we did anything for
them to react that way. I guess they don't think they can beat us
in the goal-scoring department, so they thought they'd go about it
that way.''
</P>
<P>
   When play resumed, Dwayne Roloson was in net for Hasek. The No.
1 Buffalo netminder was already in the dressing room, the victory
safely put away.

NO GIFTS FOR SUN DEVILS  
 ASU FAILS TO SEIZE OPPORTUNITIES AT CWS 
</HEADLINE>
 ST-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ The lesson Arizona State softball should have
learned during its 8-20 Pac-10 season still is being taught at the
Women's College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to earn the game,'' ASU Coach Linda Wells said
after a deceptive 4-1 loss to Washington at Don Porter Hall of Fame
Stadium. ``We were waiting for the game to be given.''
</P>
<P>
   The 16th-ranked Sun Devils had Huskies starting pitcher Jamie
Graves of Phoenix in trouble for the first three innings Thursday
night but stranded four runners. No. 6 Washington then switched to
Jennifer Spediacci, who was mostly untouchable until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the Huskies (49-17) had four runs, all unearned off
Kirsten Voak because of a Missy Hixon throwing error in the top of
the sixth. More than enough to advance into tonight's 6:30 winner's
bracket game against No. 3 Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ASU (41-27), playing in the CWS for the first time since 1987
and still seeking its first win since '82, drops into an
elimination game against No. 17 California at 12:30 p.m. Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the game in our hand and didn't play it out,'' said
Wells, who used a pinch-runner and pinch-hitter in the second in an
attempt to push at least one run across. ``When you go to the
bench, baby, you'd better get something out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gill grounded out to the third baseman to end the first
and third innings, and pinch-hitter Jennifer Gall struck out to end
the second.
</P>
<P>
   A three-time Arizona Player of the Year for Moon Valley High
School, Graves limited the Sun Devils to one run in two
regular-season decisions.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't getting low strike calls from umpire Dan Morrow,
so Washington Coach Teresa Wilson switched to Spediacci, who like
Voak is out of Washington High School in Fremont, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out the zones were not compatible, so we switched,''
Wilson said. ``I have two really great pitchers. They really
complement each other. As a coach, I could not be luckier with what
I have to work with.''
</P>
<P>
   While Spediacci (22-8) throttled ASU with her rise ball, the
Huskies kept probing for an answer to the hard-throwing Voak
(24-14). It came after Becky Newbry reached on Hixon's error, then
stole second.
</P>
<P>
   With first base open and two outs, Voak intentionally walked
Melissa Downs only to have both runners advance on a passed ball.
That changed the dynamics as Erin Helgeland, a .220 hitter who was
0 for 2, came to bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kirsten throws a screaming ball,'' Voak said. ``With a runner
at third, you want to be careful (not to throw a wild pitch) so
you're trying to walk that line. She (Helgeland) has nothing to
lose by swinging at it.''
</P>
<P>
   The junior center fielder took a whack at an outside and high
1-2 pitch to double just fair down the left-field line. Christie
Rosenblad and Graves followed with hits, icing Washington's fourth
win in five tries vs. ASU.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to make the outs yourself,'' said Voak, not pinning
blame on her teammates. ``You can't count on anything else. You get
a couple of tough breaks and the balls get through and there you
are.''
</P>
<P>
   A single by Holly Smith, double by Erin Wardein and sacrifice
fly got the Sun Devils on the board in the seventh, but with too
little to offset the damage.
</P>
<P>
   ASU now takes a fifth crack at Cal (49-21) after previously
splitting with the Bears. Erica Beach (16-13), named to the
All-America first team as a designated player, no-hit Cal on May 2
but has pitched only seven innings in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Also making the National Fastpich Coaches Association
All-America team were Graves on the second team and Voak on the
third team. &QL;

LEE GETTING BACK IN SWING OF THINGS  
 STRUGGLING D-BACK MAKING PROGRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Travis Lee took two steps forward earlier this week before
taking another one back. But that's OK, as far as the Diamondbacks
are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   That their first baseman made progress was a welcome sign at
Bank One Ballpark during the three-game sweep over San Diego and
last week while the club was on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``God has given me a beautiful swing,'' said Lee, who celebrated
his 24th birthday Wednesday. ``But hitting a baseball is all about
all kinds of adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been obvious through the early going that pitchers have
adjusted to Lee. They're trying to pitch him high and tight with
fastballs before going away with breaking balls.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Lee's turn to return the volleys and adjust to what
he's seeing at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Lee had his first three-hit game of the season Monday night
against the Padres. He followed with another three-hit performance
on Tuesday before going 0 for 4 with three strikeouts Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Travis Lee is the last thing I worry about,'' said Manager
Buck Showalter, who will lead the Diamondbacks into the first of a
three-game series in New York tonight. ``He has great mental
toughness. I have a lot of faith in him. We just want him to be
what he's capable of being. But I don't think anyone knows yet who
he's going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, who carries the added burden of being known as the $10
million signing bonus kid, burst onto the major league scene early
last season, showing signs of being a dominant hitter early but
fading as the season progressed.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for that was a nasty groin injury that landed
him on the disabled list and then hindered his swing during the
final two months, when he hit a combined .227. Another factor was
the 162-game season, a taxing proposition for any first-year
player.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, though, Lee wound up with above-average rookie
numbers. He batted .269 with 22 home runs and 72 RBIs and finished
behind Chicago's Kerry Wood and Colorado's Todd Helton for National
League Rookie of the Year. Before combining for just five home runs
and 26 RBIs in his final 65 games, Lee was considered the
front-runner for NL rookie honors.
</P>
<P>
   He began this season showing signs of zooming again before
hitting a slump that saw his average dip below .220, a scary sign
considering he had more than 100 at-bats at the time. But a recent
surge, accompanied by a slight change in his batting mechanics, has
seen Lee's average soar to .246, still low but headed in the
direction the Diamondbacks want to see.
</P>
<P>
   Several major league scouts noticed Lee had dropped his left
elbow quite a few inches during his slump, a problem that may have
occurred if Lee was trying to hit for more power, which one
American League scout said he believed to be true.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked into a (Diamondbacks team shop) a few weeks ago and
noticed a picture of Travis with his elbow way up,'' hitting coach
Jim Presley said. ``His hands were higher in the picture. So we
immediately started working on it. He's loading up and letting it
go now.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's too good to fall too far. You don't see many Travis Lees
come down the road very often.''
</P>
<P>
   Showalter also got Lee to start lifting his front foot a bit and
straying it forward before hitting. It's used to create a kind of
pendulum effect that has his body going toward the pitcher, rather
than stationary, when he's swinging.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's ability to hit to the opposite field is what scouts
immediately noticed about him last year. But for a monthlong
stretch, Lee was pulling the ball to right field more than he
should have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 10 days or so, Lee has started using the entire
field again, an obvious sign that his approach and swing are
returning to the level he demonstrated last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I feel locked in and I'm on, it doesn't matter what they
throw,'' Lee said. ``When I'm on, I'm not really thinking about
where my elbow is, or lifting my foot. When I'm not, I'm thinking
way too much and my confidence goes down. What got me here is my
ability to hit.''

ANGELS LOSE 6-3
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Angels manager Terry Collins looked in the mirror
Thursday morning and saw a 50-year-old man staring back at him.
</P>
<P>
   So what did Collins do to celebrate this milestone birthday? He
shook up his lineup, only to find out no matter how much he moved
things around, the results were similar to those when he was 49.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels offense sputtered again in a 6-3 loss to the
Baltimore Orioles before 24,724 at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Brady Anderson's grand slam off Angels reliever Mike Magnante in
the seventh inning broke open a 2-1 game and paved the way for the
Orioles' second win in the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Guzman (2-4) gave up one run and three hits in six innings
to get the victory over Angels starter Ken Hill (1-4). Hill left
the game with one out in the seventh, the bases loaded and Anderson
due up. He said he felt good and had been throwing well all game,
but Collins and the Angels are trying to be careful with Hill, who
had elbow surgery last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a thing with him to keep making sure he doesn't
extend himself,'' Collins said. ``We want to keep him in games all
summer long.''
</P>
<P>
   Countered Hill, who threw 102 pitches: ``I understand it in
terms of pitch count. But sometimes you've got to throw it out the
window. I was throwing the ball good.... You worry about today
right now, you worry about tomorrow, tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins got a few fresh bats in the game and moved some others
around in an effort to change the fortunes of an offense that went
into the game ranked 11th out of 14 American League teams in
hitting.
</P>
<P>
   But with Orlando Palmeiro and Jeff Huson among those getting a
chance to play, it ultimately came down to Mo Vaughn providing the
bulk of the offense once again.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn homered (No.11) and doubled twice, driving in two runs.
Randy Velarde drove in the Angels' other run with a single in the
eighth inning, but the late rally proved futile.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, my game's not going to change, I'm not going to add
pressure to my game (because others aren't hitting),'' Vaughn said.
``My thing is to talk to the guys, be confident and positive with
the team. I can't do more than the situation dictates.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I've still got Garret (Anderson) behind me and he's
swinging the bat well. I'm not thinking I have to carry the load on
my back. That's how you get yourself in trouble. I've got a good
approach right now and I'm going to stay with that approach.''

ASU'S BASEBALL GLORY DAYS FADE 
</HEADLINE>
  STATE-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JAVIER MORALES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Gone are the days when Pat Brock accompanied her husband, the
late Jim Brock, on recruiting trips to sway the mothers of high
school baseball players.
</P>
<P>
   The road to Omaha is no longer paved with victories over Air
Force, Colorado State, Idaho, Weber State, Denver and Gonzaga. A
battalion of wealthy programs in Texas, Florida and the Southeast
now presents a roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Stadium, showing its age after 25 years, has lost its
standing as the crown jewel of college baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State's reputation as a pipeline of major league talent
_ funneling the likes of Rick Monday, Reggie Jackson, Floyd
Bannister, Ken Landreaux, Bob Horner and Barry Bonds into
professional prosperity _ has faded.
</P>
<P>
   An entire generation has passed since ASU last won a College
World Series title in 1981. It has only one conference title in the
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   The good old days for ASU baseball have become a distant memory.
Further evidence came in the form of another snub from the NCAA
tournament selection committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU has failed to reach the tournament three of the past five
years under Coach Pat Murphy, after it went seven of Brock's final
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``ASU is feeling the pinch like a lot of schools,'' said Texas
Coach Augie Garrido, formerly at California State-Fullerton.
Garrido said the predicament Murphy faces is not unlike what he's
come up against in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up until the mid-1970s, Southern Cal dominated college
baseball,'' he said. ``Then came scholarship limits, and
immediately, teams with the best facilities got the upper hand.
Texas dominated the game for the next decade. Then everybody
started to build great facilities. That's when Texas' dominance
began to fade.''
</P>
<P>
   Expectations remain high for the Sun Devils, but reality says
otherwise. A double-edged sword has thinned the talent pool
dramatically since the program's golden era: fewer scholarships to
give, many more quality programs competing for players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of respect for Pat Murphy because it is a tough
program to coach,'' said Jeff Pentland, a former ASU player and
assistant coach who is now the Chicago Cubs hitting instructor.
``The excellence of the program creates problems. It creates
expectations that are way off the charts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The program, in my mind, is still steeped in tradition, but
it's harder to maintain a dynasty with so few scholarships to work
with. The days of going to 11 straight College World Series, like
USC once did, are over.'' &QL; 
Reduced scholarships &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scholarships have been reduced from 25 during Brock's heyday to
11.7 in the 1990s. A total of 1.5 were allotted this season to
ASU's 14-player pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the NCAA started putting limits on things, I thought that
was totally un-American, and it drove me out of college baseball,''
said Pentland, who played at ASU for Bobby Winkles from 1966 to
1968 and coached under Brock from 1983 to 1992.
</P>
<P>
   There are other factors that have contributed to ASU's slipping
from prominence on the college baseball map:
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's increasing reliance on the Ratings Percentage Index
to determine the NCAA tournament bracket.
</P>
<P>
   Competition for top talent from major league teams, which are
now offering signing bonuses in excess of $3 million and packages
that cover college tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   Reduced participation by African-American players. Less than 4
percent of Pac-10 players are Black. ASU has a rich tradition of
exceptional Black players such as Bonds, Landreaux, Jackson, Hubie
Brooks, Alvin Davis, Oddibe McDowell, Mike Devereaux and Mike Kelly
that has seemingly expired.
</P>
<P>
   A shift of power from the West to the South, where facilities
are being built or upgraded and college baseball has less
competition for interest from the pros. &QL; 
SEC vs. Pac-10 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Southeastern Conference has five national championships this
decade _ four by Louisiana State and one by Georgia _ and none
before 1990. Pac-10 schools have one title this decade _ USC over
ASU in last year's title game _ after eight in the '70s and five in
the '80s.
</P>
<P>
   Alabama sold out its tickets before the season started and
averaged 4,007 fans a game. LSU led the nation by averaging 7,132.
Arkansas (2,496) and Auburn (2,811) each set school records for
average attendance.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Stadium, with a capacity of 4,000, averaged 2,170 fans
this season. Since leading the nation in attendance in 1984 with
3,349 fans a game, the Sun Devils have not averaged more than
2,800. They dipped to 1,356 in 1994, Brock's last year.
</P>
<P>
   Competition from the Suns, Coyotes, expanded spring training in
Arizona and the Diamondbacks has taken a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ASU officials want to help Murphy's recruiting efforts and the
atmosphere at Packard Stadium by allocating $3 million of their $20
million capital improvement campaign on renovations over the next
two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our master plan is to expand the clubhouse, with a new locker
room and training room,'' said Vic Cegles, ASU associate athletic
director for external affairs. ``We're going to build a new
entranceway with a Walk of Fame, and we're going to expand our
grandstand area.
</P>
<P>
   ``The press box will also be renovated. At Wichita State, they
are building sky boxes. We have to keep up with the times. Packard
Stadium is outdated compared to some of the SEC schools.'' &QL; 
Ratings `absurd' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASU Athletic Director Kevin White believes the most absurd
development in college baseball is the RPI, which was not in the
sport's vocabulary less than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The rating reflects strength of schedule by factoring the
winning percentage of a team and its opponents' winning
percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Without the RPI, ASU would not have been excluded the past five
years, school officials argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``The RPI was created for college basketball to provide a
national comparison because it is competed on a national scale,''
White said. ``College baseball is much more regionalized in scope.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA is using a mechanism that was created for one sport
and using it on another, and it doesn't work. It's simply wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As an example, at-large teams Northeast Louisiana and Rutgers
have better RPIs than ASU because they beat an abundance of
non-NCAA tournament teams with winning records in the South and
East.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't tell me Rutgers has a better shot at a title than
Arizona State,'' said Mikel Moreno, a former Sun Devils player who
is now an assistant coach. &QL; 
Changing course &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in the sport understands that within the different
regions, there are different levels of competitive programs,''
White said. ``Because the selection is driven by the RPI, we will
have to change our course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to travel more and import more teams with better
records. That means it will cost more money, but we can't continue
to beat up on one another in the West.''
</P>
<P>
   ASU and Arizona are the only Division I baseball programs in the
state. In Louisiana, where White was the athletic director of
Tulane, 18 schools have Division I teams.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats, in the NCAA tournament for the first time since
1993, and the Sun Devils attempt to schedule tough non-conference
teams in the West such as Cal State-Fullerton, Pepperdine, Long
Beach State, Loyola Marymount and Fresno State.
</P>
<P>
   But many of those programs schedule in-state series with USC,
Stanford, UCLA and California, and they do not stretch themselves
against the Arizona schools. Arizona and ASU are left to schedule
regional foes such as Brigham Young, Utah and New Mexico, teams
with unfavorable RPIs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You look at the Los Angeles basin, and there are a number of
good teams right there,'' Arizona Coach Jerry Stitt said. ``But
it's less expensive for those teams to drive 25 to 30 miles to
play, so they stay close to home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The closest Division I team other than ASU for us is five
hours away. We can't load up on teams close to home, like teams can
in the South and the East.'' &QL; 
Recruits go pro &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the Sun Devils want the RPI to R.I.P., they are aware
of the other elements that have diminished their dominance since
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, the face of college baseball has
changed,'' Murphy said. ``The NCAA has tried to create parity with
the RPI and the reduction in scholarships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pro baseball is doing more research, a better selling job in
the homes. They offer individualized programs, like sports
psychology and speed enhancement, that we don't have.''
</P>
<P>
   Murphy has been victimized more than many coaches by recruits
signing pro contracts, according to ``Baseball America'' college
baseball editor John Manuel.
</P>
<P>
   ``He and (Florida coach) Andy Lopez recruit that kind of
top-level player more than anyone because they are young and
ambitious,'' Manuel said. ``Sometimes, it pays off like last year,
with Ryan Mills (who spurned an offer by the Yankees out of high
school). Sometimes, it doesn't pay off, and the draft kills a
class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murphy and Lopez roll the dice with those kids.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils, beset by pitching problems this season, lost
four prospects last year, including right-hander Mike Nannini, a
``sandwich pick'' between the first and second rounds by Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Nannini and Joe Orloski, a pitcher selected in the sixth round
by Toronto, led Murphy to believe they would choose college over
pro ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least 30 percent of the kids we recruit, we lose to the
draft,'' Murphy said. ``If I get criticized for shooting too high,
what can I say? That's my personality. I like to go after the
best.'' &QL; 
Consistent program &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murphy defends his five-year record of 188-108 at ASU by saying
the program is among the most consistent of the top three sports _
men's basketball, football and baseball _ in the state.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils have been ranked in the top 25 each year. The
only other such program is the Arizona men's basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   In a 1996 survey, before ASU advanced to a regional final in
1997 and the College World Series final last year, ``Baseball
America'' ranked the Sun Devils as the third-best program in the
country behind LSU and Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine combined a formula of winning percentage,
tradition, player talent through the years and fan support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still not satisfied,'' Murphy said. ``I don't think we
have done an exceptional job. We've done an OK job. There is tons
of room for improvement.''
</P>
<P>
   White supports Murphy, who was chosen ``Baseball Americ''a's
national Coach of the Year in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything, I'm deeply disappointed for the players
that we did not get into the tournament this year,'' White said.
``Personally, I think it's a strong sense of violation for the
student-athletes.'' &QL;

   The sweat-drenched dreadlocks on Brian Grant's head whipped
around with his every motion. A number of other teammates were
grabbing their chests just to signal they have heart.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Portland's 92-80 Game 6 victory against Utah
Thursday night at the Rose Garden was clear, Blazermania ran wild.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the commotion is headed to San Antonio for the Western
Conference finals. The Blazers are this far in the postseason for
the first time since 1992, when they advanced to the NBA Finals
against the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the Blazers celebrated their 4-2 conference semifinals
win by taking off their jerseys and flinging them into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   After throwing aside the two-time defending Western Conference
champion Jazz, the Blazers just did what came natural in a stirring
mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great accomplishment for us,'' Portland reserve guard
Greg Anthony said. ``We're going to celebrate and then we're going
to show we still have a lot of basketball left.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Blazer uniforms go on again in a hurry. Portland and the
well-rested San Antonio Spurs square off in Game 1 Saturday at the
Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   However, Portland will savor a fulfilling series for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   As they have been throughout this best-of-seven matchup, the
Blazers stayed together, relentless and poised until the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we shocked the world,'' said Rider, who led the
Blazers with 24 points, including eight straight free throws in the
final 33 seconds of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of emotions in this series,'' said Grant, who
finished with 7 points and 12 rebounds. ``It's a real satisfaction
to beat a team with so many seasoned veterans. They've been through
this a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Utah was eliminated from the playoffs without reaching the
conference finals for the first time since losing Game 7 at Seattle
in 1996. The Jazz battled the Bulls the past two seasons. Many
considered this season to be Utah's best chance with a Michael
Jordan-less NBA.
</P>
<P>
   But that was taken away by a deep Portland team, which rode
Utah's Karl Malone into one of his worst playoff performances.
Malone played a big role in Utah's 6-1 record in its past seven
elimination games.
</P>
<P>
   He never got going against Portland and finished with a career
playoff-low 8 points on 3-of-16 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was certainly a great feat,'' Portland coach Mike
Dunleavy said. ``Brian was phenomenal. He was just determined to
hold his position. He wanted it so badly.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant played Malone tough. The Blazers also used center Arvydas
Sabonis to throw quick double teams at Malone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grant sacrificed his offense to play great defense,'' Malone
said. ``Give him credit. I just didn't get it done. It's something
I'll be man enough to say. My teammates did a good job and I
didn't. This ranks up there as one of the toughest losses in my
career.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Hornacek's 21 points and John Stockton's 14 points and 10
assists kept the Jazz kicking.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers clung to an 80-78 lead after Hornacek split two free
throws with 1:05 left. Then, Jackson made four straight free
throws, and Rider added two more clutch foul shots that put
Portland ahead 86-78 with 33 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   From there, the outcome was a formality. Utah fouled until the
final buzzer, and Portland made 12 straight free throws to close
out the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Blazers had our number from the first game of the series,
and they kept it up,'' Utah coach Jerry Sloan said. ``Portland is a
good basketball team _ young and lively. They deserve to be where
they are. The thing that counts is defense and Portland broke us
down tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers held the Jazz to 38-percent shooting. Portland was
also big on the boards and finished with a 42-29 rebounding
advantage. Just as they did in each game except Game 5, the Blazers
attacked the ball and did not allow the Jazz to run its offense.
</P>
<P>
   Portland was not perfect, just better.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers' offense took a seven-minute hiatus that allowed
Utah to take an eight-point lead behind a 17-1 run in the second.
Still, Portland seemed to have an answer for everything the Jazz
executed. Perhaps most impressive was the Blazers' cohesion. They
showed a team that employs a 10-man rotation regularly can go far.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at some of the great teams in the past _ Boston,
New York, Chicago and Detroit _ they had a group of guys who all
could go somewhere and play more,'' Jackson said. ``But we go out
there and play together and play for each other. This is an
enthusiastic group.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked what advice he would give the young Blazers, Malone said:
``I don't think I have to give them any advice (for the next
round). They're going to be just fine.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one has to wonder if Portland officially closed Utah's
window of opportunity for winning a championship?
</P>
<P>
   ``Do I think this is the end of the Jazz era? We've been
answering that question for six years,'' Sloan said. ``We may be a
step slower, but we'll have to wait and see what happens. We still
have a pretty good team in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   All the questions about the Blazers seem to have been answered.

AUCTION FAILS TO SETTLE WESTERN WEAR FIRM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Workers and other creditors of a defunct retailer
partly owned by Rep. Howard P. ``Buck'' McKeon got more
disappointing news Thursday when an auction of the company's assets
failed to result in a successful bid.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Santa Clarita-based Howard and Phil's Western Wear,
closed its remaining stores this month after struggling under a
1996 bankruptcy reorganization. Former employees from Fresno to
Santa Ana have filed claims with the state alleging that the
company paid them with bounced checks or failed to issue final
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   The auction of the company's remaining inventory of clothes and
boots, held Thursday in a downtown Los Angeles law office, was
intended to pay part of the retailer's heavy debt.
</P>
<P>
   But the auction stumbled after the highest bidder reportedly
offered about $350,000 for the assets, far below their estimated
retail value of $3.75million to $4million. Coast Business Credit,
the largest creditor, threw out the bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bid received today was not adequate, and it was
rejected,'' said Gary Samson, the attorney representing Coast
Business Credit. ``We're exploring our options.''
</P>
<P>
   As a secured creditor owed about $3million, Coast has first
priority on the assets, said Leslie Horowitz, lawyer for
Development Specialists Inc., the firm acting as trustee for the
Howard and Phil's estate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until Coast is paid in full, no one else is going to get
paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the low bid, Horowitz said, employees and most other
creditors of the failed company likely will not receive money when
the assets are finally sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty much certain the employees can't get paid from the
estate,'' he said. ``We can't say for certain until we finalize
everything, but based on the numbers it doesn't appear likely.''
</P>
<P>
   That left some former workers fuming.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Gehrt, former manager at the company's Burbank store, said
he felt betrayed by Howard and Phil's and the McKeon family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a mess,'' he said, ``and I'm not the only one.''
</P>
<P>
   Gehrt is one of several former Howard and Phil's employees who
say the company owes them for bounced paychecks and unissued final
paychecks.
</P>
<P>
   Five former employees have already filed state wage claims
against the company, including one in Van Nuys that asks for
$4,828.46 for work completed between April 1 and May 12.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Fryer, spokesman for the state Department of Industrial
Relations, said employers have an obligation to pay their employees
even if the company goes bankrupt. If Howard and Phil's officials
cannot work out the wage issues, Fryer said, the state may have to
take the company to court.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph McKeon, former Howard and Phil's president, said Thursday
he was surprised to read in the Daily News that employees had not
been paid. He said no employee had contacted him about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our understanding was that there were supposed to be funds set
aside for the payroll,'' he said. ``If it's our responsibility,
we'll assume it as best we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard and Phil's was founded in 1962 and, at its peak, had 52
stores across the country, but there were only nine stores
remaining when the company closed its doors this month.
</P>
<P>
   Executives have blamed the company's decline on a downturn in
the country wear market.
</P>
<P>
   Howard McKeon has said he stopped taking part in the day-to-day
operations of the business, founded by his parents, after his
election to Congress in 1992, but a spokesman for the Santa Clarita
Republican said he maintained his 20 percent ownership of the
company.

CONTROVERSIAL TUTOR LEAVES USC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Janice Henry, the controversial USC
tutor/supervisor who was a key figure in two academic
investigations, has resigned to accept a similar post at Nevada-Las
Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Henry survived a pair of academic scandals involving USC
athletes in recent years during her tenure.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, she was accused of unethical conduct by at least two
USC employees during a university investigation into allegations of
impropriety in the school's Student Athlete Academic Services
department.
</P>
<P>
   Former USC tutor Noel Looney called Henry ``a cancer'' and wrote
in a memo that she implemented plagiarism and unethical conduct for
football players. Henry was eventually cleared of wrongdoing by a
university committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one came forward with any allegations against her, it was
all by supposition,'' USC general counsel Todd Dickey said.
</P>
<P>
   Henry, currently an SAAS assistant director, was previously
investigated in 1995 over an undergraduate class which gave
students credit for group course work, but did not require class
attendance.
</P>
<P>
   At least 30 athletes took the course, which was the subject of a
Pacific-10 Conference investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Henry will be reunited at UNLV with former Trojans football
coach John Robinson, who was one of her biggest supporters during
her time at USC.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm real excited, I'm real excited,'' Henry said in a brief
comment Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   After USC fired Robinson, Henry stopped tutoring football
players and worked with the men's basketball team.

STATE AID VETOED FOR VERO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ The bid to keep the Dodgers in Vero Beach, Fla.,
took an enormous hit Thursday when Florida Gov. Jeb Bush vetoed a
bill to that could have given the local government $7.5 million in
funding.
</P>
<P>
   It leaves the city of Vero Beach and Indian River County, who
are jointly trying to purchase and renovate Dodgertown to keep the
Dodgers, grossly below the more than $20 million needed for the
project.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are surprised and extremely disappointed the funding for
the bill has been vetoed by Gov. Bush,'' Dodgers president and CEO
Bob Graziano said in a statement. ``Local officials and the Dodgers
have dedicated a great deal of time and effort to the Dodgertown
negotiations over the past six months and the loss of these funds
undoubtedly impacts how we proceed with our discussions.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, we will continue to meet with county and city
officials to explore all the alternatives before we reach any
conclusion about the Dodgers' future in Vero Beach.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have trained in Vero Beach for the last 51 years but
are considering a move to the Fort McDowell Indian Community near
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers representatives plan to go to Vero Beach next week to
discuss the project.
</P>
<P>
   ``Specifically, the governor didn't want to set a precedent of
having everyone conducting spring training in Florida coming for
(money),'' said Nicole Devenish, a spokesperson for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Vero Beach and Indian River County have $13 million secured in
funding from bonds and a one-cent tourism tax. The state funding
was to be spread over two years.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers appraised the Dodgertown land at $14.5 million, but
included the nine-hole golf course. The city and county appraised
the land without the golf course at $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates of recently constructed cloverleaf practices fields in
Florida and Arizona were between $6 million and $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers also want antiquated Holman Stadium renovated, new
clubhouses and a new weight room. Dodger officials said the figure
could reach as much as $10 million for those additions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they are going to reassess there options,'' said
Florida state representative Ken Pruitt (R-Port St. Lucie). ``(Rep.
R-Sebastian) Charlie Sembler and Vero (Beach) made a good-faith
attempt. I hope that will mean something.''

HORSES BEAT INDY CARS BY A NOSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSSTEVENS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Howdy Holmes once tried to convince me he had an advantage over
other drivers in the Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're 5-foot-5,'' Holmes said, smiling, ``the impulse
goes from the brain to the foot quicker.''
</P>
<P>
   Howdy seemed to suggest that if his mind said, ``Mash the
throttle'' or ``HIT THE BRAKE!!'' he could react to the command in
less time than a driver who was several inches taller.
</P>
<P>
   The shorter the person behind the wheel, the better his chances
of avoiding danger and winning the big race.
</P>
<P>
   If this is true, Eddie Gaedel wasted his time playing baseball.
In 1951, Gaedel, who stood 3 feet 7, made one pinch-hit appearance
for the St. Louis Browns. He walked on four pitches.
</P>
<P>
   If Eddie had gone into auto racing and applied himself, the
little guy might have won five or six 500s.
</P>
<P>
   Same for jockeys like Eddie Arcaro.
</P>
<P>
   This leads us to today's discussion: Car racing vs. horse
racing. Which is better?
</P>
<P>
   Given a choice, would you attend Sunday's Indy 500 or next
week's Belmont Stakes?
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing has betting windows.
</P>
<P>
   Car racing doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   The Indy 500 drones on for hours. The Belmont, the longest of
the Triple Crown races, is over in 2{ minutes.
</P>
<P>
   One lap is sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Horses know when to stop.
</P>
<P>
   If a horse starts leaking, no one waves a caution flag to slow
the field to a trot.
</P>
<P>
   Horses don't need to refuel.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing goes faster than the money you put on a race horse. If
Paul Revere had ridden my Derby pick, we still would be under
British rule. But unlike at Indy, you don't have to ask of the colt
you bet on, ``What is he now? Two laps down? Three? Who's leading?
I'm confused.''
</P>
<P>
   At the first raindrop, the Indy 500 is delayed. Horses will run
on tracks that look like chocolate mousse.
</P>
<P>
   Belmont Park doesn't require a signature on a media release
form. The one at Indy reads, in part, ``I understand that my
presence on the premises . . . can expose me to dangers both from
known risk and unanticipated risk.''
</P>
<P>
   You can sit in the stands at a horse race and not worry about
being struck by a flying shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Horses rarely explode.
</P>
<P>
   Indy racing is exciting, entertaining, unpredictable. But horse
racing may be even more so. No one is more surprised by
Charismatic's magical year than the owners of the claiming horse,
Bob and Beverly Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing doesn't have the acrid smell of fuel and burning
rubber.
</P>
<P>
   Horse racing doesn't have green flags. Yellow flags. Black
Flags. White flags. Checkered flags.
</P>
<P>
   Race cars run out of gas. So do horses, but usually you don't
have to push them off the track.
</P>
<P>
   Horses aren't machines, the product of technology. They don't
get faster every year. Secretariat won the Kentucky Derby in under
two minutes. The 1973 record still stands.
</P>
<P>
   A race car has a engine.
</P>
<P>
   A horse has a heart.
</P>
<P>
   A horse also has a personality and a brain, albeit a small one.
I once asked a trainer at the Derby about his horse's intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, he's a real smart horse,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   Is he as smart as, say, a canary? A dog?
</P>
<P>
   The trainer said he never owned a canary so he couldn't speak
about birds, but he did have a dog. He reluctantly admitted his pet
was smarter than his horse.
</P>
<P>
   He based the opinion on the fact that his dog could fetch and
roll over.
</P>
<P>
   Horses are quieter than race cars.
</P>
<P>
   But best of all, horses aren't plastered with decals advertising
liniment, shampoo, hoof polish, oats, alfalfa pellets and other
additives.
</P>
<P>
   When Charismatic won the Derby, jockey Chris Antley didn't need
to say, ``The Absorbine Veterinary Supershield Fly &AMP; Tick Repellant
horse did everything I asked of him. He ran flat out all day.'' &QL;

MAGIC TO TALK TO SUNS' SKILES  
 BUT PAPER SAYS RIVERS IS PICK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Orlando Magic General Manager John Gabriel has official
permission from the Suns to talk with assistant coach Scott Skiles
about the vacant Orlando head coaching job.
</P>
<P>
   It might not be anything more, however, than a courtesy gesture
on the Magic's part if published reports out of Orlando are
accurate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orlando Sentinel'' reported Wednesday that the Magic is
close to hiring Turner Sports analyst Glenn ``Doc'' Rivers after
his broadcasting commitment ends. Rivers did his last scheduled
broadcast Thursday night on the Portland-Utah playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Wednesday with Gabriel, Phoenix General
Manager Bryan Colangelo gave the Magic permission to speak with
Skiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked if they were going to officially ask to talk with him,
and we agreed that he officially has permission to talk with
Scott,'' Colangelo said. ``But I don't know what they're going to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Skiles could not be reached for comment. However, he apparently
is a popular choice in Orlando. ``The Sentinel'' ran a readers'
survey asking fans which coaching candidate they preferred to
replace Chuck Daly, who resigned Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Included on the list were Skiles, former San Antonio Spurs Coach
Bob Hill, Rivers and former Chicago Bulls Coach Phil Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles got 38 percent of the vote. Jackson was second, Hill
third and Rivers last, with 2.6 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday afternoon, agent Keith Glass, who represents
Skiles, had not been contacted by the Magic, and he said Skiles had
not heard from the club either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they've got a deal done,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Rivers also was considered a candidate for the vacant Washington
Wizards job _ another club Skiles formerly played for _ and former
Phoenix forward Garfield Heard now is considered the front-runner. &QL;

LEMKE, COLLINS LEAD UA'S VICTORY  
 WASHINGTON UP NEXT FOR NO. 3 CATS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF METCALFE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA CITY _ Becky Lemke and Lindsey Collins are not to be
confused with Nancy Evans and Leah Braatz, but they proved Thursday
night they can lead Arizona softball at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Lemke (29-7), a sophomore pitcher from Scottsdale, gave up four
singles and Collins banged a pair of solo home runs as third-ranked
UA blanked California, 3-0, before 2,401 at the Women's College
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The Wildcats (53-14) will try to remain in the winner's bracket
and on track for a ninth straight title-game appearance at 6:30
tonight against No. 6 Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious it was a great performance by Becky Lemke,'' UA
Coach Mike Candrea said. ``She started getting stronger at the end
(striking out the side in the seventh inning). Then Lindsey Collins
showed the power I've been waiting to see for a couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemke, one of three All-America third-teamers from UA, worked
just two innings at the 1998 CWS as Evans, the national Player of
the Year, carried almost all of the load. But even that brief
appearance with a team that was the national runner-up took away
the nerves Lemke said she felt here a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have this game, and I was excited to
step up,'' Lemke said. ``I felt more relaxed, and I knew what I had
to do.''
</P>
<P>
   That showed against a team that UA and Lemke split with during
the Pac-10 season.
</P>
<P>
   She coaxed ground balls to short from Holly Yost and Kirsten
Drake in the fourth after Cal put runners on second and third with
one out, and fanned Paige Bowie and Maiko Bristow to strand a pair
in the fifth. Megumi Takasaki flied deep to left with a runner
aboard in the sixth, then Lemke used her changeup to completely
fool the bottom of the order in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Collins increased her team-leading homer total to nine with pops
off Jocelyn Forest (23-7) in the fourth and sixth after striking
out in the second. The sophomore catcher has hit four homers in the
postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Braatz and another former Wildcat, Laura Espinoza, are tied for
the NCAA career homer lead with 85. Collins, with 14 in two
seasons, has a long way to go but said, ``I've learned if I swing
the bat, the ball might go somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Lauren Bauer, also an All-American, doubled with two outs in the
third then scored on an infield single by Toni Mascarenas after
running through a stop sign from Candrea. The throw to first by
shortstop Katie May didn't get Mascarenas, and the relay home was
too late to catch Bauer.
</P>
<P>
   Cal (49-21) drops into an elimination game against Arizona State
at 12:30 p.m. Saturday. Total attendance for both sessions on
opening day was 6,309. &QL;

SELECT THEATERS SNAG EXCLUSIVE DEAL TO SHOW `SHAGGED'

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' already
has scored at the box office, two weeks before the comedy sequel
opens.
</P>
<P>
   In an industry first, tickets for dozens of advance screenings
in 14 cities have gone on sale exclusively through the Internet in
a partnership among New Line Cinema, America Online and MovieFone.
AOL proclaims, in Austin Powers lingo, that the site is ``powered
by GroovyFone, Baby!''
</P>
<P>
   Three Los Angeles area theaters, including an AMC multiplex in
Burbank, have scheduled 9:30 p.m. showings for June 10, the day
before the film officially opens. Should the shows not sell out,
regular tickets will be available through the box offices a few
days before the screenings.
</P>
<P>
   As promotional pushes go, this one is quite a bit smaller than
the ticket scramble for ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The Phantom
Menace.'' But it's a big promotion for AOL, which completed a $525
million buyout of MovieFone two weeks ago. More exclusive deals
like the ``Austin Powers'' tickets will help AOL differentiate
itself from the vast array of Internet service providers and
portals, according to analyst Joseph Butt Jr. of Forrester
Research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very nice way to keep the AOL membership happy,'' he
said. ``You'll see them beginning to offer whole series of
membership benefits. The deal also makes sense for MovieFone
because they'd gone about as far as they could go as a stand-alone
company.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and New Line, which is owned by Time Warner, had announced
in early May a 16-month, multimillion-dollar marketing deal that
they characterized as the largest online-only media buy by a
studio. Under the deal, New Line will have a major presence on the
AOL Movies main screen and promote its films through several AOL
locations.
</P>
<P>
   Butt also said such promotions might help dispel some of the
negative reaction to MovieFone's problems in dealing with the
opening-day crush of advance ticket orders over the phone and Web
for ``The Phantom Menace'' on May 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our view is that it's a turnoff when people can't get
through,'' he said. ``We think there is such a thing as bad PR.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL products have been placed in both the 1997 original ``Austin
Powers'' and the sequel, which is expected to be one of this
summer's biggest hits.

D-BACKS PROMOTE KIM TO BIG LEAGUE  
 TIME IS RIGHT FOR PITCHING PHENOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks have decided there is no time like the present
for their minor league phenom, pitcher Byung-Hyun Kim.
</P>
<P>
   With little else to prove in the farm system, Kim, who received
a $2.25 million bonus when he signed in March, was promoted to the
major league club Thursday and joined the players at their team
hotel in midtown Manhattan in time for a late dinner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, people are getting increasingly anxious to see
Kim,'' said General Manager Joe Garagiola Jr., who acknowledged he
was one of those people. ``If the events show he's not ready, he'll
go back.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I don't think that's going to happen. If there is a risk
to be run, this is a pretty good guy to run it with.''
</P>
<P>
   Kim (pronounced Bee-young Hee-yon Kim) had a combined 2.33 ERA
in 38 innings at Double-A El Paso and Triple-A Tucson. He had 53
strikeouts and had walked just 16 batters. More amazingly, opposing
hitters were batting just .150 against Kim.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine-style right-hander, who was starting for the
Sidewinders in Tucson, will be placed in the Diamondbacks' bullpen.
Garagiola said it was unlikely Kim would be thrown into the frying
pan of a close game right away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be surprised if his first few outings were in that
type of situation,'' Garagiola said. ``I think Buck (Showalter)
will try to pick a spot to maximize his chance for success.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, though, Kim will probably get a shot at closing
games for the Diamondbacks. Current closer Gregg Olson has blown
five of his 10 save opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for Kim, the Diamondbacks optioned reliever Bobby
Chouinard to Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy is overmatching these Triple-A guys,'' Garagiola said
of Kim. ``Do we keep sending him out to do what he has been doing,
so we can remind ourselves of how well he looks or bring him up to
see what he can do?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, everything being done at the minor league level is
for the benefit of the major league club. We felt it was time.'' &QL;

BROAD COALITION PRESSING TO REVIVE U.S. HEMP INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LESLIE GUTTMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ In the quiet heart of the conservative
Bluegrass state, a small corps of techno-savvy activists is playing
a big role in the national campaign to legalize industrial hemp, a
crop the activists call an economic life preserver for U.S. farmers
but which the federal government says is a dangerous drug.
</P>
<P>
   The tall, cane-like hemp plant was cultivated throughout the
United States for decades to make clothing, rope and other items
but lost its respectable reputation in 1937, when the government
banned marijuana _ and hemp along with it.
</P>
<P>
   However, it isn't illegal to import hemp from countries like
China, and right now, hemp is an eco-celebrity of the green
movement, used to make everything from diapers to dashboards,
shampoo to sneakers. Nut butter, fuel, lip gloss, horse feed _ the
list is as long as the hemp stalk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, North Americans spent $75 million on hemp products, up
from $3 million in 1993, according to John Roulac, founder of
Hempbrokers, an international hemp-seed product supplier in
Sebastopol. He estimates that annual sales could approach $1
billion within the next five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Using e-mail, faxes and cell phones, and in friendly, easy-going
Southern style, the Bluegrass group, whose members include actor
and part-time Kentuckian Woody Harrelson, have been doggedly
educating state lawmakers and activists across the country who are
pressuring the government to lift the hemp ban.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to enable U.S. farmers to grow a profitable,
sustainable, pesticide-free crop that will keep rural towns
thriving _ and benefit the environment with what they believe is
the soybean of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we'd have to grow the word before we could grow the
crop,'' says Lexington hemp activist Joe Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   The hemp seed is tiny, almost birdseed-like, with a gray-brown
hull that develops when the seed matures on the flowering plant at
summer's end. Inside the glands of the female flowers, a low level
of the chemical delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is produced;
this is the mind-altering compound found in marijuana. The flowers'
sticky resin can cling to the seed hulls, leaving traces of THC.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana, hemp's botanical cousin in the cannabis family,
contains about 5 to 20 percent THC; hemp usually contains less than
1 percent, way too little to get a person high, say hemp activists
and numerous scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy in Washington
answers queries on hemp with a three-page fax that classifies
marijuana and hemp as the same plant because both contain the
psychoactive compound. At the Drug Enforcement Administration,
officials say it's not their job to make or change the law, just to
enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, spokesman for National Drug Policy Director Barry
McCaffrey, says the government fears that legalizing hemp would
send the wrong message about drugs to young people. He adds that
law enforcement finds it difficult to tell the difference between
hemp and marijuana ``from the sky'' (via helicopter) when it comes
to pinpointing illegal fields for eradication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're open to new research ... we have no objection to hemp as
a product, we just don't want to see a drug culture come in through
the back door,'' says Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DEA says, `We can't tell the difference between industrial
hemp and marijuana,' '' says Hickey, ``Well, that's the difference
between poppy seeds on a bagel and poppy seeds in heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hemp activists say the federal opposition arises in part
from fears of budget cuts for law enforcement. In Kentucky, as in
other states, wild hemp _ also known as ditchweed _ is routinely
eradicated with the same vigilance used against marijuana fields.
According to a 1996 report from the Vermont state auditor's office,
78 percent of the marijuana that was destroyed in the state, and 99
percent destroyed across the country with federal money, was
ditchweed.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner denies any budget fears and calls the activists
``paranoid.'' He also questions the market potential for hemp: ``We
want to make sure farmers with economic problems aren't given a
silver bullet that's not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii Rep. Cynthia Thielen, however, sees hemp as the eventual
savior to Hawaii's eight-year economic slump. Thielen introduced in
the state Legislature a bill to permit growing industrial hemp; it
recently passed the House and Senate. The governor is expected to
sign it into law in June. The bill calls for test plots, which
would be monitored by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar is dead,'' Thielen says of Hawaii's ex-cash cow and the
state's inability to compete with the bargain-bin prices of sugar
in the global marketplace. ``Every day that passes, and we do not
allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, means agricultural workers
are unemployed. And our land lies fallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states are pushing hard for hemp. Last month, North Dakota
became the first state to make growing and selling industrial hemp
legal. (Growers will apply for DEA permits to do so.)
</P>
<P>
   Pro-hemp legislation has either passed or is brewing in at least
11 additional states. (No hemp legislation is pending in
California, although the Democratic Party passed a measure
endorsing industrial hemp April 3 at its annual convention.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the states' pro-hemp legislators and advocates have
consulted the Bluegrass activists at one time or another. They have
become hemp authorities _ reeling off history, factoids, scientific
research results _ from the amount of information they have
gathered in their efforts to legalize hemp in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kentucky group is key; they are the leaders,'' says
Thielen. ``They are helping everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the gently sloping hills of Lexington and surrounding
towns, hemp grows tall and wild, a reminder of when the plant and
the state's economy were intertwined as closely as mint juleps and
Derby Day. Even Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser and a beloved
native son, was a hemp farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The state was a top hemp grower when the crop was legal (this
includes a brief time during World War II when the U.S. ban was
lifted in order to allow rope to be made for the military).
Kentucky lore has it that hemp seed is what made the canaries in
the coal mines sing.
</P>
<P>
   The current Kentucky hemp movement started in 1993 and moved
into national focus in '96, when Harrelson joined forces with
Hickey, Lexington tobacco farmer and businessman Andy Graves and
others. They also brought in Jake Graves, Andy's 76-year-old
father, to educate farmers on the issue. Jake Graves, a pillar of
Lexington society, was a leading Kentucky hemp farmer in the early
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson decided to join up with the feisty Bluegrass
contingent because ``they were full of vision and energy,'' he
says. He adds that the state's hemp history made it the logical
place to do battle. A suit challenging the state ban is currently
before the Kentucky Supreme Court, filed after Harrelson planted
four hemp seeds on his small Lee County property in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the state fight goes, Graves says the government's
moral stance on hemp doesn't make sense because Kentucky already
``raises all the vices _ thoroughbred racing, whiskey and
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists are plotting their next move on a federal suit
that was dismissed in March. It will either be appealed or a new
suit filed, possibly arguing that the hemp ban violates the North
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade by putting U.S. farmers at a disadvantage to those in
hemp-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrelson and the Kentuckians regularly travel around the
United States giving hemp sermons _ as they did at the University
of California at Berkeley campus last fall _ a crucial part of the
effort's success has been the techno-campaign. Without e-mail and a
Web site (www.hempgrowers.com), the word would not have spread so
far and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The activists point to Canada as a model of what could be. The
country legalized hemp last year, and about 6,200 acres were
planted, yielding a crop that sold for approximately $450,000,
according to Robert L'Ecuyer, general manager of Kenex Ltd.,
Canada's largest hemp grower and processor. L'Ecuyer says he
doesn't know yet how much hemp will be planted across Canada in
'99, but it may be five or six times as much as last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Lexington, at Tattersall's Tobacco Warehouse on
the first day of the annual tobacco sales last fall, the auctioneer
reeled off the bids in a gravelly Southern streak as farmers waited
to see how much multinational tobacco companies would pay for their
harvest. The sweet, almost choking smell of tobacco from hundreds
of huge, honey-colored sample bales filled the dim warehouse.
Underneath that aroma was something else: the smell of fear.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much of the nation's tobacco settlement _ more
than $200 billion _ will go to U.S. farmers whose lives, towns and
families thrive only as long the tobacco plant does. The fate of
the quota and price-support system is also uncertain. Tobacco
farmers fear the rise in cigarette prices will lead to less demand,
and foreign competition from countries like South Africa lies
ahead. Tobacco currently sells for about $6,000 an acre, compared
to $300 an acre for corn.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the battle to legalize hemp, the priority for Hickey,
Graves and the other hemp activists in Kentucky is the future of
U.S. farmers of tobacco and other crops with depressed prices, such
as wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky tobacco farmers, like those in other states, are
one of the most conservative groups in America, and yet they are
also behind hemp. Farmers like Jimmy Sharp, who remembers his
father growing fields of hemp in the '30s. ``I don't have a problem
with it,'' he says, leaning over a bale at the auction during a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him, tobacco farmer Graves adds, ``Everybody's
daddy or grandaddy grew hemp. It helped support a way of life
around here. As long as it makes money, they'll grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey believes hemp will grow rural economic development across
the country. He envisions local processing plants for items as bold
as the car made from plastic hemp that Henry Ford once built _
plants like the one a Canadian firm just announced will be built in
northwestern Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Change in federal policy might be afoot. Although the DEA
maintains official silence about the future of industrial hemp from
its public affairs office in Washington, Rep. Thielen in Hawaii
says she is hearing a different tale. She says DEA Chief of
Operations Gregory Williams told her recently that the agency is
working on revising security regulations to permit U.S. farmers to
plant hemp because of the commercial interest. A DEA spokeswoman
for Williams wouldn't comment other than to say the office is
reviewing Hawaii's request on ending the hemp ban.
</P>
<P>
   Change can't happen soon enough for the Bluegrass hemp team.
Says Harrelson, ``The argument has been that hemp sends the wrong
message to our youth. What about cigarettes, alcohol and tobacco?
What kind of message do they send? Those are the real drugs. Hemp
isn't.''

that was dismissed in March. It will either be appealed or a new
suit filed, possibly arguing that the hemp ban violates the North
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade by putting U.S. farmers at a disadvantage to those in
hemp-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrelson and the Kentuckians regularly travel around the
United States giving hemp sermons _ as they did at the University
of California at Berkeley campus last fall _ a crucial part of the
effort's success has been the techno-campaign. Without e-mail and a
Web site (www.hempgrowers.com), the word would not have spread so
far and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The activists point to Canada as a model of what could be. The
country legalized hemp last year, and about 6,200 acres were
planted, yielding a crop that sold for approximately $450,000,
according to Robert L'Ecuyer, general manager of Kenex Ltd.,
Canada's largest hemp grower and processor. L'Ecuyer says he
doesn't know yet how much hemp will be planted across Canada in
'99, but it may be five or six times as much as last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the center of Lexington, at Tattersall's Tobacco Warehouse on
the first day of the annual tobacco sales last fall, the auctioneer
reeled off the bids in a gravelly Southern streak as farmers waited
to see how much multinational tobacco companies would pay for their
harvest. The sweet, almost choking smell of tobacco from hundreds
of huge, honey-colored sample bales filled the dim warehouse.
Underneath that aroma was something else: the smell of fear.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how much of the nation's tobacco settlement _ more
than $200 billion _ will go to U.S. farmers whose lives, towns and
families thrive only as long the tobacco plant does. The fate of
the quota and price-support system is also uncertain. Tobacco
farmers fear the rise in cigarette prices will lead to less demand,
and foreign competition from countries like South Africa lies
ahead. Tobacco currently sells for about $6,000 an acre, compared
to $300 an acre for corn.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the battle to legalize hemp, the priority for Hickey,
Graves and the other hemp activists in Kentucky is the future of
U.S. farmers of tobacco and other crops with depressed prices, such
as wheat.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky tobacco farmers, like those in other states, are
one of the most conservative groups in America, and yet they are
also behind hemp. Farmers like Jimmy Sharp, who remembers his
father growing fields of hemp in the '30s. ``I don't have a problem
with it,'' he says, leaning over a bale at the auction during a
break.
</P>
<P>
   Standing next to him, tobacco farmer Graves adds, ``Everybody's
daddy or grandaddy grew hemp. It helped support a way of life
around here. As long as it makes money, they'll grow it.''
</P>
<P>
   Hickey believes hemp will grow rural economic development across
the country. He envisions local processing plants for items as bold
as the car made from plastic hemp that Henry Ford once built _
plants like the one a Canadian firm just announced will be built in
northwestern Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
   Change in federal policy might be afoot. Although the DEA
maintains official silence about the future of industrial hemp from
its public affairs office in Washington, Rep. Thielen in Hawaii
says she is hearing a different tale. She says DEA Chief of
Operations Gregory Williams told her recently that the agency is
working on revising security regulations to permit U.S. farmers to
plant hemp because of the commercial interest. A DEA spokeswoman
for Williams wouldn't comment other than to say the office is
reviewing Hawaii's request on ending the hemp ban.
</P>
<P>
   Change can't happen soon enough for the Bluegrass hemp team.
Says Harrelson, ``The argument has been that hemp sends the wrong
message to our youth. What about cigarettes, alcohol and tobacco?
What kind of message do they send? Those are the real drugs. Hemp
isn't.''

GATES OPEN SATURDAY AT PRESCOTT DOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Horse players in search of a reprieve from summer's dog days are
in luck.
</P>
<P>
   The Prescott Downs summer race meet begins a 56-day run Saturday
and continues through Sept. 7.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a week beginning June 30, when the Prescott rodeo
assumes control of the Yavapai County Fairgrounds, live racing will
be held Saturday through Tuesday each week. Simulcast racing is
scheduled Wednesdays through Fridays.
</P>
<P>
   Post time is 1:45 p.m. on the weekends and 12:30 p.m. on Mondays
and Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in its history, Prescott's signal will be
beamed to a bevy of racetracks scattered throughout several states,
said Tom Harris, director of racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to New York, Illinois, Florida, Texas, Louisiana,
New Jersey, New Mexico and some others that are on the burner right
now,'' said Harris, hired last October following a 17-year stint as
an announcer at several racetracks, including Garden State (N.J.)
Park and, most recently, Retama Park in San Antonio. ``As far as I
know, Prescott's signal has only gone to Montana and Wyoming in
past years.''
</P>
<P>
   A larger out-of-state betting network will lead to increasing
wagering activity and larger purses for horsemen, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took quite a sales job to get these states to come on, but
what we've got going for us is we can dodge most of the competition
by running on Mondays and Tuesdays,'' Harris said. ``Those are dark
days for a lot of tracks. Everybody who has done it has come out a
winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Prescott's post times also should spur more interest from East
Coast gamblers, who will have somewhere to turn once races there
conclude for the day.
</P>
<P>
   Although Prescott's percentage take from wagers made outside the
state are minimal (about 3 percent of the total handle), any little
bit helps.
</P>
<P>
   Jockey Scott Stevens, who recently won a fourth straight riding
crown at Turf Paradise, also has decided to ride at Prescott for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually, I take a lot of the summer off, but I feel good
enough to keep riding this year,'' Stevens said.
</P>
<P>
   Prescott Downs is expected to move to a new location in Prescott
Valley within about three years, Harris said. Although a new site
has been talked about for more than two decades, this time it
apparently will become a reality as the Yavapai County Fair
Association Board of Supervisors recently voted to relocate about
15 miles from the present location.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is to build 800 to 1,000 stalls, up from 650 at the
present site, and a 1-mile racing surface to replace Prescott's
antiquated half-mile bullring.
</P>
<P>
   ``A mile track will greatly enhance efforts to attract more
horses,'' Harris said. ``There's also plans for a ~-mile turf
course. Eventually, we'd like to have 1,500 stalls.'' &QL;

BROAD COALITION PRESSING TO REVIVE U.S. HEMP INDUSTRY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LESLIE GUTTMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR;  LEXINGTON, Ky. _ In the quiet heart of the conservative
Bluegrass state, a small corps of techno-savvy activists is playing
a big role in the national campaign to legalize industrial hemp, a
crop the activists call an economic life preserver for U.S. farmers
but which the federal government says is a dangerous drug.
<P>
   The tall, cane-like hemp plant was cultivated throughout the
United States for decades to make clothing, rope and other items
but lost its respectable reputation in 1937, when the government
banned marijuana _ and hemp along with it.
</P>
<P>
   However, it isn't illegal to import hemp from countries like
China, and right now, hemp is an eco-celebrity of the green
movement, used to make everything from diapers to dashboards,
shampoo to sneakers. Nut butter, fuel, lip gloss, horse feed _ the
list is as long as the hemp stalk.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, North Americans spent $75 million on hemp products, up
from $3 million in 1993, according to John Roulac, founder of
Hempbrokers, an international hemp-seed product supplier in
Sebastopol. He estimates that annual sales could approach $1
billion within the next five years or so.
</P>
<P>
   Using e-mail, faxes and cell phones, and in friendly, easy-going
Southern style, the Bluegrass group, whose members include actor
and part-time Kentuckian Woody Harrelson, have been doggedly
educating state lawmakers and activists across the country who are
pressuring the government to lift the hemp ban.
</P>
<P>
   Their mission is to enable U.S. farmers to grow a profitable,
sustainable, pesticide-free crop that will keep rural towns
thriving _ and benefit the environment with what they believe is
the soybean of the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew we'd have to grow the word before we could grow the
crop,'' says Lexington hemp activist Joe Hickey.
</P>
<P>
   The hemp seed is tiny, almost birdseed-like, with a gray-brown
hull that develops when the seed matures on the flowering plant at
summer's end. Inside the glands of the female flowers, a low level
of the chemical delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is produced;
this is the mind-altering compound found in marijuana. The flowers'
sticky resin can cling to the seed hulls, leaving traces of THC.
</P>
<P>
   Marijuana, hemp's botanical cousin in the cannabis family,
contains about 5 to 20 percent THC; hemp usually contains less than
1 percent, way too little to get a person high, say hemp activists
and numerous scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Office of National Drug Control Policy in Washington
answers queries on hemp with a three-page fax that classifies
marijuana and hemp as the same plant because both contain the
psychoactive compound. At the Drug Enforcement Administration,
officials say it's not their job to make or change the law, just to
enforce it.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Weiner, spokesman for National Drug Policy Director Barry
McCaffrey, says the government fears that legalizing hemp would
send the wrong message about drugs to young people. He adds that
law enforcement finds it difficult to tell the difference between
hemp and marijuana ``from the sky'' (via helicopter) when it comes
to pinpointing illegal fields for eradication.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're open to new research ... we have no objection to hemp as
a product, we just don't want to see a drug culture come in through
the back door,'' says Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DEA says, `We can't tell the difference between industrial
hemp and marijuana,' '' says Hickey, ``Well, that's the difference
between poppy seeds on a bagel and poppy seeds in heroin.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hemp activists say the federal opposition arises in part
from fears of budget cuts for law enforcement. In Kentucky, as in
other states, wild hemp _ also known as ditchweed _ is routinely
eradicated with the same vigilance used against marijuana fields.
According to a 1996 report from the Vermont state auditor's office,
78 percent of the marijuana that was destroyed in the state, and 99
percent destroyed across the country with federal money, was
ditchweed.
</P>
<P>
   Weiner denies any budget fears and calls the activists
``paranoid.'' He also questions the market potential for hemp: ``We
want to make sure farmers with economic problems aren't given a
silver bullet that's not real.''
</P>
<P>
   Hawaii Rep. Cynthia Thielen, however, sees hemp as the eventual
savior to Hawaii's eight-year economic slump. Thielen introduced in
the state Legislature a bill to permit growing industrial hemp; it
recently passed the House and Senate. The governor is expected to
sign it into law in June. The bill calls for test plots, which
would be monitored by the Drug Enforcement Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sugar is dead,'' Thielen says of Hawaii's ex-cash cow and the
state's inability to compete with the bargain-bin prices of sugar
in the global marketplace. ``Every day that passes, and we do not
allow farmers to grow industrial hemp, means agricultural workers
are unemployed. And our land lies fallow.''
</P>
<P>
   Other states are pushing hard for hemp. Last month, North Dakota
became the first state to make growing and selling industrial hemp
legal. (Growers will apply for DEA permits to do so.)
</P>
<P>
   Pro-hemp legislation has either passed or is brewing in at least
11 additional states. (No hemp legislation is pending in
California, although the Democratic Party passed a measure
endorsing industrial hemp April 3 at its annual convention.)
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the states' pro-hemp legislators and advocates have
consulted the Bluegrass activists at one time or another. They have
become hemp authorities _ reeling off history, factoids, scientific
research results _ from the amount of information they have
gathered in their efforts to legalize hemp in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Kentucky group is key; they are the leaders,'' says
Thielen. ``They are helping everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the gently sloping hills of Lexington and surrounding
towns, hemp grows tall and wild, a reminder of when the plant and
the state's economy were intertwined as closely as mint juleps and
Derby Day. Even Henry Clay, the Great Compromiser and a beloved
native son, was a hemp farmer.
</P>
<P>
   The state was a top hemp grower when the crop was legal (this
includes a brief time during World War II when the U.S. ban was
lifted in order to allow rope to be made for the military).
Kentucky lore has it that hemp seed is what made the canaries in
the coal mines sing.
</P>
<P>
   The current Kentucky hemp movement started in 1993 and moved
into national focus in '96, when Harrelson joined forces with
Hickey, Lexington tobacco farmer and businessman Andy Graves and
others. They also brought in Jake Graves, Andy's 76-year-old
father, to educate farmers on the issue. Jake Graves, a pillar of
Lexington society, was a leading Kentucky hemp farmer in the early
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   Harrelson decided to join up with the feisty Bluegrass
contingent because ``they were full of vision and energy,'' he
says. He adds that the state's hemp history made it the logical
place to do battle. A suit challenging the state ban is currently
before the Kentucky Supreme Court, filed after Harrelson planted
four hemp seeds on his small Lee County property in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the state fight goes, Graves says the government's
moral stance on hemp doesn't make sense because Kentucky already
``raises all the vices _ thoroughbred racing, whiskey and
tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   The activists are plotting their next move on a federal suit
that was dismissed in March. It will either be appealed or a new
suit filed, possibly arguing that the hemp ban violates the North
American Free Trade Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs
and Trade by putting U.S. farmers at a disadvantage to those in
hemp-growing countries.
</P>
<P>
   While Harrelson and the Kentuckians regularly travel around the
United States giving hemp sermons _ as they did at the University
of California at Berkeley campus last fall _ a crucial part of the
effort's success has been the techno-campaign. Without e-mail and a
Web site (www.hempgrowers.com), the word would not have spread so
far and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The activists point to Canada as a model of what could be. The
country legalized hemp last year, and about 6,200 acres were
planted, yielding a crop that sold for approximately $450,000,
according to Robert L'Ecuyer, general manager of Kenex Ltd.,
Canada's largest hemp grower and processor. L'Ecuyer says he

ALL'S QUIET ON THE INDY FRONT  
 CARBURETION DAY PASSES WITHOUT INCIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK ARMIJO  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Nothing unholy occurred Thursday inside the
cathedral known as Indianapolis Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Amen.
</P>
<P>
   Carburetion Day, which traditionally is the final two-hour
practice session held before Sunday's Indianapolis 500, came and
went without so much as a peep of discontent.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-two drivers made it onto the 2.5-mile oval, completing
713 total laps, and all returned to pit road with their sleek
machinery intact.
</P>
<P>
   Good.
</P>
<P>
   Although the practice session was the first time drivers drove
cars affixed with the newly mandated suspension and wheel energy
restraint system, which was designed to reduce flying debris from
crashes, no one, understandably, wanted to test the new safety
device.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no intention of being that person,'' said Billy Boat,
who crashed three times before successfully qualifying for an
outside front-row starting position.
</P>
<P>
   To their credit, IRL officials almost immediately began burning
the midnight oil in search of a safety remedy after the tragedy a
month ago at Lowe's Motor Speedway, where three spectators were
killed and eight others injured after a tire/wheel/suspension
assembly was knocked into the grandstand following a wreck during
the race.
</P>
<P>
   The system is specifically designed to keep suspension parts and
tires from separating from cars during accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Championship Auto Racing Teams also has a similar safety device,
as does Formula One.
</P>
<P>
   Even NASCAR is considering a system to prevent tires and hoods
from getting airborne.
</P>
<P>
   IRL Executive Director Leo Mehl also announced a new engine rule
that goes into effect at the June 12 Longhorn 500 at Texas Motor
Speedway. The rule stipulates engines must operate at 10,000 RPMs
or lower, down from 10,300 and 10,500 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident at Charlotte makes us realize we have to contain
the speeds,'' Mehl said.
</P>
<P>
   Engine manufacturer spokesmen said the rule should translate
into a reduction of 20 to 30 horsepower _ a reduction that will
continue next season when engine sizes drop from 4-liter to
3.5-liter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (the engine rule) is a very good idea,'' said
defending Indy 500 champion Eddie Cheever, a Phoenix native. ``I
think you can compare lowering (the RPMs) to what they do with
restrictor plates in NASCAR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe me, going five miles an hour slower won't make it a
worst product.''
</P>
<P>
   The wheel restraint system, however, might be the IRL's greatest
contribution to improving safety.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boat initially balked at the thought of wheel tethers,
he believes the restraint system is much more favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the optimum compromise,'' Boat said. ``We had to
do something because of the way the wheels, especially the rear
wheels, were coming off cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing has never been 100 percent safe, but I think we were
seeing a little bit of a pattern happening and something had to be
done. It's the league's job to ensure the safety of the drivers,
but also ensure the safety of the fans.''
</P>
<P>
   The CART circuit suffered a similar tragedy last July, when
three spectators were killed and several others were injured by
debris after a crash at Michigan Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   As a deterrent, catch fencing was raised at several racetracks.
</P>
<P>
   But when it happened again nine months later, it became apparent
to CART and IRL officials that additional precautionary measures
were needed.
</P>
<P>
   CART's drivers will race for the first time its version of the
tethers in Saturday's Motorola 300 at Gateway (Ill.) International
Raceway.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a large accident, you'll probably still see some debris,''
said Greg Ray, who is sandwiched between pole sitter Arie Luyendyk
and Boat on the front row. ``But if the wheel comes off, instead of
it coming off at 200 miles an hour, it should only be 50 miles an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The brightest minds in the world are working on this, and to
me, this is a step in the right direction.'' &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
Indianapolis Mayor Stephen Goldsmith proclaimed Thursday as Arie
Luyendyk Day. Luyendyk is making the Indy 500 the final Indy car
race of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Schmidt was fastest during Carb Day practice, reaching
222.458 mph. Ray was next at 221.822.
</P>
<P>
   Galles Racing and driver Davey Hamilton defeated A.J. Foyt
Racing and driver Kenny Brack and won the Coors Indy Pit Stop
Challenge. &QL;

DESPITE RUMORS, IRL-CART PEACE NOT AT HAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Forget whatever you may have read or heard about
a possible reconciliation between the warring Championship Auto
Racing Teams and the Indy Racing League.
</P>
<P>
   There's still a war.
</P>
<P>
   Although Indianapolis Motor Speedway President Tony George
confirmed that he met with CART President and Chief Executive
Officer Andrew Craig, NASCAR President Bill France and CART car
owner Roger Penske last week in Indianapolis, he said the meeting
had proved fruitless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing came out of that meeting that made me believe we were
close (to reconciling),'' George said Thursday during an impromptu
news conference. ``I don't think anything substantial was
addressed. There's still a very big gap where we are
philosophically.''
</P>
<P>
   George was responding to recent reports suggesting the two sides
were engaged in talks that could lead to a reconciliation as early
as 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're (CART) trying to shift some of the attention to
themselves,'' George said. ``They continue to need to give some
glimmer of hope that something is in the offing.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the two circuits disagree on such obstacles as
engine rules and chassis specifications, there appears to be no
hope of merging the two series into one.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no indication I've picked up on that suggests we're
closer in philosophy,'' said George, who created the IRL four years
ago as a result of being disillusioned with CART's rising costs,
few oval races and alleged lack of opportunity for young American
drivers. ``Talking may lead to something, but nothing leads me to
believe we're close to anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I'm not going to compromise our philosophies to get them
back here.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest philosophical differences are engine rules.
CART machines are turbo-charged, and IRL motors are normally
aspirated.
</P>
<P>
   A larger obstacle, however, is that George insists on allowing
teams to buy motors. CART employs an engine-lease program.
</P>
<P>
   And the engine-buy package is non-negotiable, IRL executive
director Leo Mehl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no room for compromise,'' IRL Executive Director Leo
Mehl said. ``We will never change to leasing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although George and Craig share similar sentiments, which is
that open-wheel racing would be better off with one series, it
appears to be the only thing in which they are in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The recent acquisition of Penske Motorsports by International
Speedway Corp. led some to believe ISC President Bill France Jr.,
who also heads NASCAR, would be a strong influence in brokering an
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   France couldn't be reached for comment, but George warned not to
read anything into France's involvement. &QL;

`JOHN DOE' FILES MOTION FOR PRIVACY IN XIRCOM CASE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ John Doe is fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet detractor known only as ``A View From Within'' has
retained an attorney and filed a motion to kill Xircom Inc.'s
subpoena for information from Yahoo!, the online information
company.
</P>
<P>
   But a spokesman for the maker of modems for mobile computers
said Thursday that the company will continue to pursue its case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight it,'' said Randall Holliday, Xircom's general
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute started earlier this month when Xircom officials
discovered two Internet message board postings criticizing the
quality of a key Xircom product, poking fun at executives and
alleging a bad work environment.
</P>
<P>
   Xircom filed a lawsuit in Ventura County Superior Court against
the person, identifying him only as John Doe since the company
didn't know his true identity. Xircom alleges that the writer's
messages were damaging to the company and subpoenaed Yahoo! to get
the identity of ``A View From Within.''
</P>
<P>
   John Doe, who claimed to be a Xircom engineer in the postings,
also supposedly violated a confidentiality agreement signed by
employees.
</P>
<P>
   But in an unusual twist in a unique legal action, John Doe filed
a motion in Ventura County Superior Court this week asking the
court to prevent Yahoo! from divulging his identity and saying that
``A View From Within'' is, in fact, not a company employee.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for John Doe's law firm, Baker and Hostetler in Los
Angeles, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo! has not yet acceded to Xircom's request. The Internet
company does not comment on specific cases, a spokesman said, but
has the right to comply with subpoenas and law enforcement requests
as outlined in its online users agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Mansfield, an Internet law attorney with O'Melveny &AMP;
Myers in Los Angeles, said Internet companies usually comply with a
proper subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   Even if John Doe cites privacy issues in his or her defense, the
law does not protect the writer if the message defames the victim,
Mansfield said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't be reckless or negligent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If John Doe's motion to quash the subpoena doesn't work, the
only way to win a defamation suit is for his or her messages to be
true. But the writer's identity would be revealed in subsequent
court actions.
</P>
<P>
   Mansfield said online writers often fail to understand that the
relationship between the Internet writer and Internet host such as
Yahoo! is not as sacrosanct as the attorney-client privilege, the
relationship between clergy members and their flocks, and between a
journalist and a source.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Taken at face value, the findings are shocking. Over 20 years,
according to the report of an investigating committee chaired by
Congressman Christopher Cox of California, Chinese spies stole
information on every warhead currently deployed in America's
ballistic-missile arsenal, including the W-88, the most
sophisticated yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   They stole missile-guidance technology, and probably got hold of
design information for an enhanced neutron bomb. Their appetite for
the stuff was ``insatiable,'' their energy ``enormous,'' and they
have not stopped yet.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the report concludes, China has been able to leap
in a few years from 1950s-era weapons to the most modern
thermonuclear technology; and America is left with its security in
a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the headlines. Behind them, the Cox report is not
quite that chilling for Americans.
</P>
<P>
   First, it is unclear just how much weapons expertise China has
really acquired, or from where. Since China steals from many
different countries, and even does a little original work of its
own, not all its progress can be credited to America.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensitive material is in the third of the Cox report
that is still classified, but in any case no weapon derived from
the stolen American information has been deployed _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of comparative nuclear strength, China remains way
behind America, with a few dozen warheads to America's thousands.
</P>
<P>
   The most dangerous effect of the stealing is the strength it
gives China within Asia, not only compared with Taiwan but also
compared with Japan and other nuclear powers, such as India.
</P>
<P>
   It is also suspected that some of these secrets were passed on
to others.
</P>
<P>
   The fact of Chinese spying _ though it is hotly denied by China,
of course _ comes as no surprise. Nor, alas, does America's chaotic
openness. Chinese agents have poured for years into this sprawling
treasure chest, and not much has got in their way.
</P>
<P>
   China's borers and grubbers did not merely download material
from slipshod government laboratories; they also worked through
joint ventures, front companies, official exchanges, downloading of
secrets from drunken American visitors, even a careful reading of
American technical journals.
</P>
<P>
   American spies tried to do the same in China, but with far fewer
agents and probably much less to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   Once the security lapses were made public, calls came for the
resignation of the officials in charge, especially Sandy Berger at
the National Security Council and Janet Reno at the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Both had received reports of spying at the laboratories some
years ago, but took no action and apparently did not tell the
president. They appear not to have thought it serious enough, and
there was probably the usual lack of communication between
departments.
</P>
<P>
   The remedy for that is simple: more vigilance and more
information-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   A top-level sacking or resignation, given the laxity displayed
by Berger and Reno, might usefully underscore this point. The
consequences should not, and almost certainly will not, stop there.
</P>
<P>
   The policy of engagement with China, even a constantly pilfering
China, is as right now as it has been since 1972 when that policy
began. Yet the Clinton administration's approach to China has been
both more expansive than that, and more erratic _ even by this
administration's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Although, as the Cox report says, China has been enjoying pretty
unrestricted access to America for 20 years and in Republican and
Democratic administrations alike, it was under Clinton that the
program of official military exchanges was revived, and that
supervision of export sales of satellite technology was removed
from the State Department to the far laxer Commerce Department.
</P>
<P>
   Sales contracts to China were sought with official support, and
celebrated. And it was also under Clinton _ ably assisted by
Vice-President Al Gore _ that Chinese officials pumped money into
the Democratic Party machine in the 1996 election in the confident
hope of a quid pro quo.
</P>
<P>
   Confusingly _ not least to the Chinese _ the administration also
has moments of toughness on China. These occur whenever Clinton
feels that softness is going down badly.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is split several ways on China, between
business-friendly ``engagers'' and those, on both the right and the
left, who want China rapped for its human-rights abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, with his typical desire to play all sides of the court,
accommodates the so-called ``moralists'' when he can.
</P>
<P>
   That is why from time to time he encourages Taiwanese who want
to be a fully independent country, despite his general endorsement
of a ``one China'' policy; and why, after Zhu Rongji's hopeful and
warmly welcomed visit in April, Clinton suddenly turned cool on
China's bid to join the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report, which has given Republicans an ideal election
rod with which to beat the president, will no doubt inspire more
grit for a while. That would be no bad thing, if it lasted.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking lesson of the Cox report is that Clinton needs
to get his China policy straight. He is dealing not with a friend,
but with a rival whose interests are different from those of the
United States and the rest of the democratic West.
</P>
<P>
   To engage with this rival _ to trade, talk, consult _ is
essential. To drop one's guard, even for a moment, could prove
fatally wrong. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   South Korea's economic strategy over the past four decades was
to follow a few paces behind Japan. Its economic model was based on
Japan's. It moved into new industries, such as television or
microwave production, just as Japan moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, South Korea might offer its former colonial
masters a lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have had severe financial crises, which left them
with sick banking systems and massive overcapacity after years of
artificially cheap capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the big difference is that South Korea's economy seems to be
recovering quickly from recession, while Japan's continues to
languish in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year South Korea's GDP jumped by an
annual rate of 18 percent, to 4.6 percent above its level of a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists now predict that the economy will enjoy growth
of more than 5 percent for 1999 as a whole, following a decline of
5.8 percent last year. Industrial production is back at pre-crisis
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this rebound springs from firms adjusting their
inventories, but consumer spending and exports have also perked up.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, in contrast, industrial production is stuck almost 10
percent below its level of early 1997; the country's GDP is
expected to shrink again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics argue that it is easy to bounce back sharply after a
steep fall; and even if the South Korean economy does grow by 5
percent this year, it would still leave output 14 percent below its
previous trend growth line.
</P>
<P>
   But applying the same logic to Japan, where growth has averaged
only 0.7 percent a year over the past seven years, compared with a
previous trend rate of 3-4 percent, one could argue that Japan's
output has already fallen by as much as 15-20 percent relative to
its previous trend. Yet nobody expects Japan to bounce back
strongly this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's recovery partly reflects looser fiscal and
monetary policies; but the government's greater boldness in
pursuing reforms and cleaning up the banking sector have also been
important.
</P>
<P>
   Under IMF tutelage, the government has opened up the economy to
foreign direct investment and tightened accounting rules to make
business more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant of all, South Korea was quick to tackle its
banks' ills. Many banks were closed, merged or nationalized, and
the government has recapitalized the system by taking over bad
loans wholesale. This has helped to shore up confidence, and
allowed banks to make new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan preferred to procrastinate instead. Only now is the
government at last recapitalizing the banking system _ six years
after the seriousness of its problems became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic activity has been depressed by firms' and
consumers' pessimism about the government's ability to resolve the
banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government deserves credit for its efforts. But
the job is far from complete. There are still many obstacles which
could hinder a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest barrier is the country's heavily indebted
conglomerates, or chaebol. The government wants them to sell chunks
of their bloated empires to foreigners, to reduce their debts, but
the giants have been dragging their feet.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more general risk of ``reform fatigue'' if the
recovery causes policymakers and companies to conclude that they do
not need to make further changes.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to implement painful policies in the midst of a
crisis. Indeed, this may explain why South Korea has pushed ahead
more quickly than Japan. It had the ``advantage'' of facing a real
crisis, as capital fled the country, forcing it to go cap in hand
to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, in contrast, has been under no such outside pressure. But
though this may explain Japan's errors, it does not excuse them. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   South Korea's economic strategy over the past four decades was
to follow a few paces behind Japan. Its economic model was based on
Japan's. It moved into new industries, such as television or
microwave production, just as Japan moved out.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, South Korea might offer its former colonial
masters a lesson or two.
</P>
<P>
   Both countries have had severe financial crises, which left them
with sick banking systems and massive overcapacity after years of
artificially cheap capital.
</P>
<P>
   But the big difference is that South Korea's economy seems to be
recovering quickly from recession, while Japan's continues to
languish in the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
   In the first quarter of this year South Korea's GDP jumped by an
annual rate of 18 percent, to 4.6 percent above its level of a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Some economists now predict that the economy will enjoy growth
of more than 5 percent for 1999 as a whole, following a decline of
5.8 percent last year. Industrial production is back at pre-crisis
levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some of this rebound springs from firms adjusting their
inventories, but consumer spending and exports have also perked up.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, in contrast, industrial production is stuck almost 10
percent below its level of early 1997; the country's GDP is
expected to shrink again this year.
</P>
<P>
   Cynics argue that it is easy to bounce back sharply after a
steep fall; and even if the South Korean economy does grow by 5
percent this year, it would still leave output 14 percent below its
previous trend growth line.
</P>
<P>
   But applying the same logic to Japan, where growth has averaged
only 0.7 percent a year over the past seven years, compared with a
previous trend rate of 3-4 percent, one could argue that Japan's
output has already fallen by as much as 15-20 percent relative to
its previous trend. Yet nobody expects Japan to bounce back
strongly this year.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's recovery partly reflects looser fiscal and
monetary policies; but the government's greater boldness in
pursuing reforms and cleaning up the banking sector have also been
important.
</P>
<P>
   Under IMF tutelage, the government has opened up the economy to
foreign direct investment and tightened accounting rules to make
business more transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Most significant of all, South Korea was quick to tackle its
banks' ills. Many banks were closed, merged or nationalized, and
the government has recapitalized the system by taking over bad
loans wholesale. This has helped to shore up confidence, and
allowed banks to make new loans.
</P>
<P>
   Japan preferred to procrastinate instead. Only now is the
government at last recapitalizing the banking system _ six years
after the seriousness of its problems became clear.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, economic activity has been depressed by firms' and
consumers' pessimism about the government's ability to resolve the
banking crisis.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea's government deserves credit for its efforts. But
the job is far from complete. There are still many obstacles which
could hinder a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest barrier is the country's heavily indebted
conglomerates, or chaebol. The government wants them to sell chunks
of their bloated empires to foreigners, to reduce their debts, but
the giants have been dragging their feet.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a more general risk of ``reform fatigue'' if the
recovery causes policymakers and companies to conclude that they do
not need to make further changes.
</P>
<P>
   It is easier to implement painful policies in the midst of a
crisis. Indeed, this may explain why South Korea has pushed ahead
more quickly than Japan. It had the ``advantage'' of facing a real
crisis, as capital fled the country, forcing it to go cap in hand
to the IMF.
</P>
<P>
   Japan, in contrast, has been under no such outside pressure. But
though this may explain Japan's errors, it does not excuse them. &QL;

 (Distributed by the New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ First, the comforting conclusion to be drawn from
the Cox report into Chinese spying: America does not find itself
suddenly facing a world-changing event, as it did in the Rosenberg
case (which revealed the secrets of the Manhattan Project to the
Soviet Union in the 1940s) or even during the missile crisis in the
Taiwan Strait in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The report, produced by a committee headed by Christopher Cox, a
mild Republican congressman from California, revealed that China's
spying has been a long-running campaign, not a sudden incident.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the report is disturbing for three reasons:
because of what it suggests about China's military capability;
because of its timing; and because of what it reveals about
American failures to safeguard nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   These go back many years, but have become considerably worse
during the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   The report says that China has stolen classified information on
seven nuclear weapons programs, including all the warheads deployed
in America's nuclear armory. It also claims that China has
obtained, by hook or by crook, information on satellite and
submarine guidance systems.
</P>
<P>
   The details of precisely which secrets it has got remain
unknown. All the same, at the very least, the range of options
available to Chinese military planners has increased.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cox report says the Chinese are about to test a missile
_ the Dong Feng 31 _ based partly on stolen American technology.
</P>
<P>
   When deployed (which the report says will be in 2002), the DF31
will be the first in a new family of mobile, solid-fuel missile
systems that will make China's nuclear force, which is now on the
level of the Soviet Union's in the 1960s, into something more like
America's in the 1970s: far from parity with the United States now,
but a step up.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's willingness to project force to get its way in
foreign policy, that could have big implications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that nor the revelations in the Cox report necessarily
requires a radical change in American policy towards China.
Nevertheless, the report has brought into question parts of
America's policy of ``engagement'' with China _ or at least the way
in which it has been implemented. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy has meant, for example, that when a Chinese company
has wanted to buy high-technology goods in the United States, the
presumption was that it would get an export license. That is likely
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooperation is also a dead letter; China has suspended
it anyway in the wake of the Belgrade embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the timing of the report _ just after that event _
will make improving American-Chinese relations even harder than it
would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, opponents of China are a strange alliance
of right-wingers in search of a new Cold-War enemy and left-wingers
concerned about human-rights violations and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   They have relatively little support at the political center.
Indignation about the theft of nuclear secrets is widespread and
might provide such support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, that might not mean China's bid for
membership of the World Trade Organization (its top priority in
international trade) is doomed. Before the Cox report, the
administration had been taken aback by protests from companies at
Clinton's refusal to support China's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, any attempt to reopen the issue now will be awkward.
But even Cox supports China's bid _ on the right terms _ and, in
the past, trade issues have usually been separated from broader
political ones. Unfortunately, that means that even if China gets
into the WTO, relations with the United States may still not
improve. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report leaves both sides nursing grudges.
</P>
<P>
   But if America bears a grudge, it has only itself to blame. The
single most shocking fact revealed by the Cox report is not the
extent of China's spying, but America's failure to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The first cases of Chinese espionage in America's nuclear
laboratories date from the late 1970s. The broad details of the
operation were known as long ago as 1995, yet, on two occasions,
the Department of Energy refused to act on investigations by its
own counterintelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until this April that a new energy secretary, Bill
Richardson, shut down the main computers to perform a thorough
check. By that time, the worst (and most recent) example of Chinese
spying had taken place _ after the completion of the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the committee remarked that it was ``concerned that
no procedures are in place that would either prevent or detect the
movement of classified information to unclassified sections of the
computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was right to worry. When officials at the Department of
Energy read that passage, they checked the computer of Wen Ho Lee,
a Chinese-American scientist employed at the Los Alamos Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He had downloaded the so-called ``legacy codes'' on to an open
computer. These codes contain all the data the United States has
gathered in 50 years of nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy is finally slamming the stable door.
And if the Cox committee gets its way, security controls will get
tighter still.
</P>
<P>
   Its report lists 38 policy recommendations, from new binding
international controls on the transfers of sensitive technology, to
transferring authority over satellite licenses back to the State
Department. The day the report was released, the president said he
agreed with most of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report's finer details raise three troubling
questions about America's response to China's recent spying.
</P>
<P>
   First, why did the Department of Energy demote the
counter-intelligence chief who originally raised the alarm?
</P>
<P>
   The man concerned, Notra Trulock, says he first knew of Chinese
spying in the mid-1990s and alerted the department, the secretary
of defense and so on at the time. He was demoted in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Second, why did the Federal Bureau of Investigation fail to act
against Lee and why did it and the Justice Department engage in
mutual recriminations about how to proceed?
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI in 1997 requested permission from Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, to monitor Lee's telephone conversations, she
denied the appeal, arguing that there was not enough evidence to
suspect him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Torricelli, a close ally of the Clinton
administration, called the attorney-general's failure to
investigate ``inexplicable,'' and questioned her fitness to remain
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, why did the chief of the National
Security Council, Sandy Berger, wait more than a year between
learning about the issue (in April 1996) and telling the president
in general terms (in July 1997)? And why did it take even longer
for the president to hear the details?
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, Clinton claimed: ``To the best of my
knowledge, no one has said anything to me about any espionage which
occurred by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   his was three months after he had received the Cox report.
Either he did not read it, in which case he should have done. Or he
did read it and was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the National Security Council says, he read the executive
summary it had prepared. This says there was proven Chinese nuclear
spying before his presidency; there was proven Chinese spying
during his presidency but against satellite tracking devices, not
nuclear weapons; and there was Chinese nuclear spying during his
presidency but it wasn't proven (the case of Lee, who is now in
retirement outside Los Alamos).
</P>
<P>
   To the White House, it seems, everything depends on the
definition of ``Chinese spying during my presidency.'' To the rest
of the world, such Clintonesque wordplay palls in the face of
massive nuclear theft. &QL;

   The details of precisely which secrets it has got remain
unknown. All the same, at the very least, the range of options
available to Chinese military planners has increased.
</P>
<P>
   And the Cox report says the Chinese are about to test a missile
_ the Dong Feng 31 _ based partly on stolen American technology.
</P>
<P>
   When deployed (which the report says will be in 2002), the DF31
will be the first in a new family of mobile, solid-fuel missile
systems that will make China's nuclear force, which is now on the
level of the Soviet Union's in the 1960s, into something more like
America's in the 1970s: far from parity with the United States now,
but a step up.
</P>
<P>
   Given China's willingness to project force to get its way in
foreign policy, that could have big implications in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that nor the revelations in the Cox report necessarily
requires a radical change in American policy towards China.
Nevertheless, the report has brought into question parts of
America's policy of ``engagement'' with China _ or at least the way
in which it has been implemented. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (250-WORD OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE AT 375) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The policy has meant, for example, that when a Chinese company
has wanted to buy high-technology goods in the United States, the
presumption was that it would get an export license. That is likely
to change.
</P>
<P>
   Military cooperation is also a dead letter; China has suspended
it anyway in the wake of the Belgrade embassy bombing.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the timing of the report _ just after that event _
will make improving American-Chinese relations even harder than it
would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, opponents of China are a strange alliance
of right-wingers in search of a new Cold-War enemy and left-wingers
concerned about human-rights violations and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   They have relatively little support at the political center.
Indignation about the theft of nuclear secrets is widespread and
might provide such support.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps surprisingly, that might not mean China's bid for
membership of the World Trade Organization (its top priority in
international trade) is doomed. Before the Cox report, the
administration had been taken aback by protests from companies at
Clinton's refusal to support China's bid.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, any attempt to reopen the issue now will be awkward.
But even Cox supports China's bid _ on the right terms _ and, in
the past, trade issues have usually been separated from broader
political ones. Unfortunately, that means that even if China gets
into the WTO, relations with the United States may still not
improve. &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC; 
 &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report leaves both sides nursing grudges.
</P>
<P>
   But if America bears a grudge, it has only itself to blame. The
single most shocking fact revealed by the Cox report is not the
extent of China's spying, but America's failure to prevent it.
</P>
<P>
   The first cases of Chinese espionage in America's nuclear
laboratories date from the late 1970s. The broad details of the
operation were known as long ago as 1995, yet, on two occasions,
the Department of Energy refused to act on investigations by its
own counterintelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   It was not until this April that a new energy secretary, Bill
Richardson, shut down the main computers to perform a thorough
check. By that time, the worst (and most recent) example of Chinese
spying had taken place _ after the completion of the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the committee remarked that it was ``concerned that
no procedures are in place that would either prevent or detect the
movement of classified information to unclassified sections of the
computer systems.''
</P>
<P>
   It was right to worry. When officials at the Department of
Energy read that passage, they checked the computer of Wen Ho Lee,
a Chinese-American scientist employed at the Los Alamos Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   He had downloaded the so-called ``legacy codes'' on to an open
computer. These codes contain all the data the United States has
gathered in 50 years of nuclear testing.
</P>
<P>
   The Department of Energy is finally slamming the stable door.
And if the Cox committee gets its way, security controls will get
tighter still.
</P>
<P>
   Its report lists 38 policy recommendations, from new binding
international controls on the transfers of sensitive technology, to
transferring authority over satellite licenses back to the State
Department. The day the report was released, the president said he
agreed with most of the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report's finer details raise three troubling
questions about America's response to China's recent spying.
</P>
<P>
   First, why did the Department of Energy demote the
counter-intelligence chief who originally raised the alarm?
</P>
<P>
   The man concerned, Notra Trulock, says he first knew of Chinese
spying in the mid-1990s and alerted the department, the secretary
of defense and so on at the time. He was demoted in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Second, why did the Federal Bureau of Investigation fail to act
against Lee and why did it and the Justice Department engage in
mutual recriminations about how to proceed?
</P>
<P>
   When the FBI in 1997 requested permission from Janet Reno, the
attorney-general, to monitor Lee's telephone conversations, she
denied the appeal, arguing that there was not enough evidence to
suspect him.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Robert Torricelli, a close ally of the Clinton
administration, called the attorney-general's failure to
investigate ``inexplicable,'' and questioned her fitness to remain
in office.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and most important, why did the chief of the National
Security Council, Sandy Berger, wait more than a year between
learning about the issue (in April 1996) and telling the president
in general terms (in July 1997)? And why did it take even longer
for the president to hear the details?
</P>
<P>
   In March of this year, Clinton claimed: ``To the best of my
knowledge, no one has said anything to me about any espionage which
occurred by the Chinese against the labs during my presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   his was three months after he had received the Cox report.
Either he did not read it, in which case he should have done. Or he
did read it and was lying.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as the National Security Council says, he read the executive
summary it had prepared. This says there was proven Chinese nuclear
spying before his presidency; there was proven Chinese spying
during his presidency but against satellite tracking devices, not
nuclear weapons; and there was Chinese nuclear spying during his
presidency but it wasn't proven (the case of Lee, who is now in
retirement outside Los Alamos).
</P>
<P>
   To the White House, it seems, everything depends on the
definition of ``Chinese spying during my presidency.'' To the rest
of the world, such Clintonesque wordplay palls in the face of
massive nuclear theft. &QL;

   MINNEAPOLIS _ Drivers on freeways in California's Silicon Valley
were startled to see, last summer, giant billboards exhorting them
to ``upgrade to Minnesota.''
</P>
<P>
   The message, sponsored by the Minnesota High Tech Council,
sounded desperate, and it was. This year, the council is trying a
subtly different tack: billboards in Minnesota imploring high-tech
workers not to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, the point is clear: the state's labor shortage is
acute.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in Minnesota plunged to a seasonally adjusted 2.1
percent in April, the lowest ever recorded in the state and the
lowest in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities of St. Paul and Minneapolis have become a
workers' paradise: unemployment there hit an all-time low of 1.6
percent in April.
</P>
<P>
   But the state's labor pool is growing at only half the rate it
did in the 1970s. The result is a labor market that is tighter than
at any time since the Second World War.
</P>
<P>
   As national economic growth sputtered and died in the early
1990s, Minnesota clawed onward. Manufacturing defied national
trends and grew, while service companies sprang up all over the
place.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment in the state therefore lingered a point or so
behind the rest of the country, and, when the time came for the
American economy to reawaken, Minnesota found itself without the
excess capacity the rest of the nation had.
</P>
<P>
   Today, indicators of an ever-tightening labor market are legion.
Companies are offering stock options to every employee, from CEOs
to shipping clerks.
</P>
<P>
   Over loudspeakers in department stores, reminders of special
offers are being replaced by announcements of job openings.
Entry-level wages, as seen on notices papered on storefronts, are
ticking ever upward.
</P>
<P>
   In the absence of qualified entry-level workers, some companies
have started using prison labor.
</P>
<P>
   In this workers' market, anyone with a measurable pulse and two
fingers to peck at a keyboard is employable.
</P>
<P>
   Employees have lost their reluctance to ask for better benefits
or more money.
</P>
<P>
   What they have also lost is the desire to join a union. Both
nationally and locally, union power has eroded as non-union
employers offer bonuses to newly hired workers, and thick
wage-and-benefits packages to retain them.
</P>
<P>
   The age of the average union member is approaching 50, which is
near the time when many choose to take their pension.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry, one of the most heavily unionized, is
having particular problems. To keep building sites fully staffed,
unions are strengthening their apprenticeship programs, with some
success: programs for cement masons, pipe fitters and the like are
said to be bursting.
</P>
<P>
   Some unions are recruiting ``non-traditional'' workers (such as
women), and are calling local branches around the country to lure
those who want to travel.
</P>
<P>
   But labor is tight everywhere, and work is plentiful. The call
for new labor has reached immigrants in Honduras and Mexico, from
which a trickle of workers both legal and illegal are travelling
north to find work.
</P>
<P>
   On May 18, the Senate voted to let 30,000 more foreign computer
programmers, health professionals and other skilled workers into
the United States to relieve local labor-market shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota they cannot come too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a February 1998 survey of information-technology companies by
the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, 57 percent of
respondents said they were having trouble finding qualified
workers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, 42 percent said they were having trouble filling
work orders.
</P>
<P>
   If this persists _ and there is every reason to think it will,
especially as telecommunications and information technology become
the twin pillars of this economy _ a shortage of labor may soon
strangle growth.
</P>
<P>
   As for California's high-tech workers, they still seem reluctant
to heed those billboards and move east. It is not just Minnesota's
winters that deter them, but its high income tax.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the state's genuine allurements, such as the beauty
of its lakes, the renowned placidity of its people and its
top-notch public-education system, it has yet to see a big influx
of new, highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 net immigration dropped sharply as unemployment
plummeted all across the country. Local economists are now
beginning to worry that the job market may be tight for as long as
the next ten years. &QL;

the United States to relieve local labor-market shortages.
</P>
<P>
   In Minnesota they cannot come too soon.
</P>
<P>
   In a February 1998 survey of information-technology companies by
the Minnesota Department of Economic Security, 57 percent of
respondents said they were having trouble finding qualified
workers.
</P>
<P>
   More important, 42 percent said they were having trouble filling
work orders.
</P>
<P>
   If this persists _ and there is every reason to think it will,
especially as telecommunications and information technology become
the twin pillars of this economy _ a shortage of labor may soon
strangle growth.
</P>
<P>
   As for California's high-tech workers, they still seem reluctant
to heed those billboards and move east. It is not just Minnesota's
winters that deter them, but its high income tax.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite the state's genuine allurements, such as the beauty
of its lakes, the renowned placidity of its people and its
top-notch public-education system, it has yet to see a big influx
of new, highly skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 net immigration dropped sharply as unemployment
plummeted all across the country. Local economists are now
beginning to worry that the job market may be tight for as long as
the next ten years. &QL;

<P>
   Once a western force invaded Kosovo, it would, at least in
theory, have more than enough firepower to prevail over the Serb
forces. But getting NATO's armor inside a territory that is a
natural fortress ringed on all sides by mountains, and doing so
without great loss of life and equipment, would be much harder.
</P>
<P>
   There is simply no easy way for western forces to drive into
Kosovo. Of the neighboring countries, only Albania shows any
enthusiasm for being used as a launch pad.
</P>
<P>
   But the mountain road linking Albania to its embattled cousins
is a logistical nightmare. Without engineering on a huge scale, it
would simply crumble under the weight of a few tanks.
</P>
<P>
   Entering from Macedonia would be physically easier but
politically trickier, since that country is deeply reluctant to be
used as a staging post for war.
</P>
<P>
   The main road from Macedonia to Pristina, Kosovo's capital, is
in decent condition, though it passes through some high gorges and
tunnels.
</P>
<P>
   A flatter route connects Macedonia with southeastern Serbia. But
any invasion of Serbia proper, as distinct from Kosovo, would have
to face hostile locals.
</P>
<P>
   All the obvious entry points have been heavily mined, and the
Serb army has dug in as heavily as it can.
</P>
<P>
   How much resistance could the Serb forces actually put up? In
its most detailed report to date, NATO said on May 19 that it had
destroyed 556 pieces of military equipment in Kosovo, of which 312
were tanks, armored cars or big guns.
</P>
<P>
   That, if true, would mean that some 30 percent of the Serbs'
``heavy forces'' in the province had been knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   General Michael Short, the American commander of NATO's air war,
said the other 70 percent could be destroyed or chased out within
two months. But the exact pace of this destruction is impossible to
predict.
</P>
<P>
   NATO claimed exceptional success on May 21, saying it had
knocked out a dozen tanks and as many armored cars. But it was
hampered by bad weather for the next three days.
</P>
<P>
   If Serbia's goal is simply to ensure that NATO pays a high
military and human price for any invasion, then it has not yet
lost.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the skepticism of those who doubt that a NATO ground
offensive this summer is feasible was bolstered by this week's
pledge from NATO that it would boost its forces in the region to
50,000 or so.
</P>
<P>
   A gradual buildup to those numbers looks much more like a
preparation for a peacekeeping force, to be deployed with Serbia's
consent, than a war-fighting plan.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, conventional wisdom holds that the moment for mounting
any sort of intervention in hostile conditions may already be
coming to an end, given that it would take many more weeks to get
the troops and their heavy weapons in place, and winter sets in as
early as October.
</P>
<P>
   But there is just a chance that conventional wisdom may be
wrong, particularly over timing. Some experts argue that it would
take only a couple of weeks for America's 101st Air Assault
Division to fly to Italy and then start ferrying mortars, artillery
and light vehicles to the edge of the war zone.
</P>
<P>
   They also argue that NATO could occupy two-thirds of Kosovo
quite rapidly, using American Marines and British and French
paratroopers to spearhead an operation in which western forces
might, with luck, lose only 200-500 men.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably true that once the political decision were taken
to make full use of America's support and attack helicopters, along
with the ``steel rain'' of multiple-launched rockets, the Serb
garrisons in Kosovo could be rapidly devastated.
</P>
<P>
   The long-range strike force of American tanks, gunships and
missiles that is building up in Albania, and could easily be
reinforced with units still in Germany, probably frightens Serb
commanders more than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   So far, U.S. President Bill Clinton has explicitly forbidden the
use of Apache tank-busting helicopters; but he may be keeping that
option up his sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing in the Albania-based force would sharply raise the
stakes all around. Serb armor, now hidden or immobilized to avoid
exposure to air strikes, would presumably reemerge and might
unleash as much firepower as it could before being destroyed or
routed.
</P>
<P>
   Serb forces might well abandon all restraint, firing rockets
deep into Albania and Macedonia, in an attempt to horrify and
destabilize those countries, by selecting targets such as refugee
camps.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians trapped inside Kosovo might die in even
greater numbers than hitherto. Civil war might break out in
Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   If the war in Kosovo is a pain-endurance contest, the Serbs may
not prove to be a pushover. &QL;

   SOFIA _ Unlike several of its neighbors, Bulgaria has been
surprisingly unshy about backing NATO in the war for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Kostov, its center-right prime minister, has let NATO
aircraft fly through a large part of Bulgaria's airspace.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish F-16 fighters, which Greece has refused to allow over
the Aegean, can fly across Bulgaria to attack targets in Yugoslavia
from the east. This, say NATO's planners, weakens Serbia's air
defenses, prepared as they are to repel attacks from across the
Adriatic to the west.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Bulgaria may be playing a more dangerous game than other
Balkan states. It has been almost literally caught in the cross
fire. Its capital, Sofia, is less than 50 kilometers (30 miles)
from Bulgaria's border with Serbia, and within range of Serbian
antiaircraft guns.
</P>
<P>
   At least half-a-dozen NATO missiles that were meant to hit
Serbian air defenses have strayed off course into Bulgaria _ one
hitting a house in a Sofia suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The war is just as unpopular in Bulgaria as it is in Macedonia
and Greece, which both, however, refuse to let the alliance use
their airspace for combat missions. The Greeks and Macedonians are
also firmly against letting NATO troops move through their
territory to attack the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Over 90 percent of Bulgarians, say pollsters, are against the
war. Moreover, the number of those who want Bulgaria to join NATO
is down, from 60 percent before the war to barely half now.
</P>
<P>
   Bulgaria's feelings for Serbia, however, are far from friendly.
A shared attachment to the Orthodox church, which seems to bind the
Serbs and Greeks together emotionally, counts for little with the
Bulgarians, whose quarrelsome bishops have damaged the church's
image.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bulgars and Serbs have fought on opposite sides in four
wars this century.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before fighting erupted over Kosovo, Kostov annoyed the
Serbs by handing over 150 Soviet-era tanks to Macedonia, which
Serbia's rulers still view as an upstart province rather than an
independent state.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kostov and Petar Stoyanov, Bulgaria's pro-western
president, who has a big say in defense and foreign affairs, see
the war as a chance to strengthen Bulgaria's bid to join NATO and
the European Union. They were disappointed not to get a timetable
for membership at the alliance's summit in Washington last month.
</P>
<P>
   They also worry that Albania and Macedonia will soon catch up in
the race to join the EU, though, unlike Bulgaria, neither country
has an association agreement with it that is supposed to precede
eventual membership. Both, however, expect to get one as soon as
the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The war is hurting Bulgaria's economy. Most Bulgarian exports go
through Serbia or along the Danube, now blocked by debris from
bridges bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which was expected to grow by over 5 percent this
year, is now thought unlikely to expand by more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other western donors have promised $750 million to
support Bulgaria's balance of payments and keep market reforms on
course. But that will probably not prevent many more jobs being
lost in Bulgaria's decrepit factories.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly galling for Kostov because western
businessmen, after years of viewing post-communist Bulgaria as a
disaster, were just beginning to take another look.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has been stable, Kostov has shown that he is
genuine about reform, and an array of state assets were to be sold
off this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the only big sale _ to a Greek-Dutch
partnership _ will be that of the state telecoms company; the war
will probably make the price much lower than it would have been.
</P>
<P>
   For Kostov and Bulgaria, a speedy NATO victory in Kosovo is
vital. &QL;

   They also worry that Albania and Macedonia will soon catch up in
the race to join the EU, though, unlike Bulgaria, neither country
has an association agreement with it that is supposed to precede
eventual membership. Both, however, expect to get one as soon as
the fighting stops.
</P>
<P>
   The war is hurting Bulgaria's economy. Most Bulgarian exports go
through Serbia or along the Danube, now blocked by debris from
bridges bombed by NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The economy, which was expected to grow by over 5 percent this
year, is now thought unlikely to expand by more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF and other western donors have promised $750 million to
support Bulgaria's balance of payments and keep market reforms on
course. But that will probably not prevent many more jobs being
lost in Bulgaria's decrepit factories.
</P>
<P>
   That is particularly galling for Kostov because western
businessmen, after years of viewing post-communist Bulgaria as a
disaster, were just beginning to take another look.
</P>
<P>
   The currency has been stable, Kostov has shown that he is
genuine about reform, and an array of state assets were to be sold
off this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now it looks as if the only big sale _ to a Greek-Dutch
partnership _ will be that of the state telecoms company; the war
will probably make the price much lower than it would have been.
</P>
<P>
   For Kostov and Bulgaria, a speedy NATO victory in Kosovo is
vital. &QL;

<P>
   LUANDA _ Aid workers in Angola have a hard time suppressing
their bitterness at the nonstop coverage of events in Kosovo as
they struggle to contain their own, equally grim but largely
ignored, disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Angola should not become a forgotten emergency,'' says an
exhausted Francesco Strippoli, the director of the World Food
Program (WFP) in Angola. ``This is a very real tragedy of massive
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how massive should soon become clear.
</P>
<P>
   After a week-long tour of the country, a U.N. assessment team is
now back in Rome calculating how many Angolans may starve to death
in the next few months if help is not provided.
</P>
<P>
   Six months after the resumption of the civil war between the
Angolan government and Jonas Savimbi's UNITA rebels, the Angolan
people are suffering as they have not suffered before, even in 25
years of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, hunger is being used as a weapon in this
war.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, peasant farmers stayed on their land while the two
armies battled back and forth around them. Nowadays, rebel soldiers
are forcing them to leave their farms empty-handed, killing them
horribly if they try to stay.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 1 million people, about 10 percent of the total
population, have been driven off their land since the fighting
resumed.
</P>
<P>
   They have been herded by UNITA into the government-controlled
cities, which now stand, like besieged islands, surrounded by
hostile UNITA-controlled countryside. The only way out of the towns
is by air: the roads have been turned into impassable death traps
by rebel ambushes and land mines.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels' aim, it would seem, is to starve the population into
rebelling against the government.
</P>
<P>
   So far, there is no sign of such a rebellion. And starvation is
being staved off _ for the moment. Food aid, supplied by the WFP,
is keeping 800,000 people alive. Others are still surviving on
local produce.
</P>
<P>
   The rains this year were exceptionally good; in normal
circumstances, the farmers would now be harvesting bumper crops. In
fact, since so many farmers are being held hostage in the cities,
most of their crops have been stolen by soldiers, burned, or left
to rot. What little has been harvested is being instantly sold or
consumed.
</P>
<P>
   Angola's rainy season has now ended. The leaner dry season
started in mid-May. The crops harvested in the rainy season will
last a month or two at best, and nobody has been able to get to the
fields to plant for the next crop.
</P>
<P>
   People are being forced to eat their seed-corn, so that when the
next rainy season starts there will be nothing left to plant.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few months, an alarmingly large proportion of Angola's
more than 11 million people will be almost entirely dependent on
food aid.
</P>
<P>
   Since the government is pumping all of its considerable oil
earnings into fighting the war, the job of feeding (and housing and
clothing) Angolans falls to the WFP and the aid donors. But the
relief agencies do not have nearly enough money to meet Angola's
constantly rising demands.
</P>
<P>
   In their annual appeal for Angola last autumn, before the
resumption of all-out war, all the U.N. agencies working there,
including the WFP, asked for $67 million for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the donors _ rich countries' governments that are tired
of pouring money into Angola _ have come up with only $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the number of Angolans in need of urgent assistance
has tripled and the cost of distributing food and other aid has
doubled, since, with the roads blocked, everything has to be
transported by air.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.'s 1999 appeal is to be raised to $110 million and the
WFP has launched a separate appeal for $8.8 million, solely for air
transport.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the unlikely event of the donors responding quickly to
these appeals, the situation will remain perilous.
</P>
<P>
   UNITA has already shown that it can close the airports of
provincial cities by shelling as and when it chooses. It is
prepared to attack cargo planes as well: at least six have been
shot down since the war restarted. If the rebels bring down just
one WFP plane, the whole food-aid operation will be grounded.
</P>
<P>
   Given all this, the question is asked why more is not being done
to bring an end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   Angola returned to fighting while still being monitored by a
$1.5 billion U.N. peacekeeping mission. The peacekeepers failed to
notice that UNITA was using the four-year lull in hostilities to
rearm and retrain its forces.
</P>
<P>
   The mission's mandate was finally ended in February by the
Security Council, which made vague promises about replacing it with
a small political mission.
</P>
<P>
   Prospects of the two sides talking to each other are poor. The
Angolan government has vowed never to negotiate with Savimbi again,
citing the fact that he has broken every peace promise he has ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   But does it have an alternative? The rebels have proved
surprisingly strong on the battlefield, defeating the government's
forces, in both conventional and guerrilla warfare.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the government's promised dry-season offensive were to
succeed in wiping out UNITA's conventional forces (itself
improbable), the rebels would still be able to use guerrilla
tactics to make the country ungovernable.
</P>
<P>
   Angolans, meanwhile, will be facing starvation. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Low male self esteem? Blame GI Joe
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At last, an explanation for the low-level emotional miasma that
I've dragged along all these years like swamp fog _ uncomplaining,
even saint-like if I do say so myself, in my silent martyrdom,
bearing my own angst with debonair grit.
</P>
<P>
   It's all GI Joe's fault.
</P>
<P>
   I have for this insight no less a source than one Dr. Harrison
Pope, Harvard psychiatrist, writing in the International Journal of
Eating Disorders. He says GI Joe and other superhero toys have been
bulking up over the last 30 years to the point where their
improbable proportions have become as daunting to men as Barbie's
wasp waist, ship's prow bosom and El Greco legs have been to women.
</P>
<P>
   In a proper I'm OK/you're OK world, I would be at ease with my
body type (old), condition (iffy) and silhouette (cylindrical). But
it is so hard to be comfortable in an intimidating atmosphere that
constantly throws up impossible models as the ideal and, in effect,
mocks those of us, victims of a sour genetic fate and a cultivated
sloth, who cannot measure up.
</P>
<P>
   GI Joe, it turns out, has seen his original 1960s biceps expand
from the equivalent of a reasonable 12 inches to the current
equivalent of 26 inches _ six inches more than the real-world
biceps of professional baseball-abuser Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is GI Joe the only show-off in the gym. Star Wars' Luke
Skywalker, for 20 years a plausible fellow, now poses on toy
counters with robe pulled open to show a chest that would leave
Arnold Schwarzenegger whimpering in the locker room. Batman,
Superman and the rest of the action figures have been slowly
swelling, too, beyond stock superhero fitness to a kind of
mega-humanity.
</P>
<P>
   (In answer to your question, yes, there are people who actually
measure such things. No, I don't know why.)
</P>
<P>
   Martin Zelin, psychology professor at Tufts University, says,
``It seems perfectly reasonable that just as women who are anorexic
have been influenced by the images of thin models, boys could be
influenced by muscular men.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed it does. I now understand that it was in service of
avoiding the dangerous anabolic-steroid shortcut that I logged all
those barbecued ribs, breaded veal chops, imported beers and
sweetbreads in cream sauce. I was desperately eating in hopes of
catching up with GI Joe.
</P>
<P>
   These are tough times for guys trying to live up to today's
glamour images.
</P>
<P>
   Lovely Dan Quayle is being touted as the new intellectual _ no,
really _ and the political phenom is Jesse Ventura, the ex-wrestler
governor of Minnesota who could pop footballs in his armpit. In his
new autobiography, ``The Body'' boasts of losing his virginity at
16 to win a bet, patronizing Nevada prostitutes (and selling his
shell-casings swagger belt to one for seconds), using steroids and
wearing no underwear.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think I'm ever going to catch up. Somehow _ and it will
be a challenge but I am determined to meet it _ I'm just going to
have to reconcile with my body and learn to live in emotional
equilibrium with my underwear.

<P>
   BURREL, Albania _ Agim Kaziu, a 63-year-old businessman in this
remote, poor mountain village, looks as if he has seen a ghost.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's just an American sitting big as life across the table
at a dusty roadside cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Kaziu is moved to pause from his lunch of lamb and potatoes to
mark the moment with an elaborate wave of his fork. ``If someone
had told me 10 years ago that there would be Americans in my
village, I would have said, 'Yes and maybe the man in the moon will
pay us a visit, too.'''
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Kaziu would have been putting it mildly.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, communist dictator Enver Hoxha made Albania
perhaps the world's most isolated country. Hoxha told his people
that Americans -- not to mention most foreigners -- were their
mortal enemies.
</P>
<P>
   It is a changed world -- especially since the Kosovo crisis.
While Americans still are rare in remote areas, young people in the
bustling capital, Tirana, like to wear clothes with American themes
-- the Chicago Bulls are particularly big -- and it is hard to go
without feeling a rumbling rap music bass.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the fall of communism many Albanians have come to
view the United States as the best hope their tiny Balkan nation
has to become a healthy, stable -- the word often used is
``normal'' -- country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look to America, which is the only country with a realistic
view of Albania,'' said Vladimir Prela, a journalist and writer
from Tirana. ``The United States is the only reliable ally we have.
This is our future.''
</P>
<P>
   Albanians have been impressed by the consistent no-compromise
message coming from Washington on the NATO bombing campaign against
Serb leader Slobodan Milosevic, president of Yugoslavia. This is in
sharp contrast to the vacillations of Italy, Germany, and Greece
and to some extent, France.
</P>
<P>
   In a perverse way, the war in Yugoslavia is regarded by many
here as just what the doctor ordered for Albania, some officials
say. A year ago, it would have been hard to imagine seeing Pandeli
Majko, Albania's boyish-looking primer minister, being interviewed
live on CNN or holding a joint news conference with NATO's
Secretary General Javier Solana.
</P>
<P>
   Before the war, Albania's most visible presence in the United
States was as the country in the hit film ``Wag the Dog'' that
seemed obscure enough to make it the perfect place to stage an
imaginary war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now Albania is on the world's agenda,'' said Taulant Dedja,
the deputy minister of local government. ``This presents us with
really a great opportunity. Potentially, there is a greater
possibility of getting economic aid and moving closer to the West
-- particularly America, which has a great interest in Albania and
is our guarantor of stability in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   While Macedonia's leaders have been half-hearted in their
support for NATO's using the country as a staging area for a
potential push into Yugoslavia's embattled Kosovo province,
Albanian President Rexhep Meidani has placed all his country's
assets at NATO's disposal.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the United States and NATO have been allowed to set
up a base to house the 24 Apache attack helicopters and 5,000
support troops that make up Task Force Hawk, which would be the
``tip of the spear'' of any ground force going into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, this is the problem with Albania: The country is willing,
but its assets are weak.
</P>
<P>
   At first look, Albania seems dreadfully poor place with few
prospects for improvement. On further inspection, it is far worse
than it first appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Its ancient roads, bridges and sewer systems are in utter
disrepair. Driving on a smooth surface is a rare experience to be
found mainly in the capital. Many crumbling bridges are unsafe, and
the government has closed a few simply by blocking them with
concrete rubble. Billions of dollars in new infrastructure are
needed.
</P>
<P>
   It would be hard to imagine a worse place to put 450,000 poor
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Many Albanians worry the refugee crisis could push the country
to anarchy. In the decades since the communists lost power, the
country has endured occasional spells of chaos and always seems on
the verge of another.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems calm now, there are pressures from the refugee
influx roiling beneath the surface, said Genc Ruli, the president
of the Institute of Contemporary Studies. ``We're talking about a
sudden population increase of 15 percent for a country that is
barely functioning,'' Ruli said.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of refugees eventually will spark inflation, while
reducing stocks of basic commodities -- clean water is in short
supply -- an age-old cocktail for civic disorder. ``This relative
stability we see now is fragile and temporary,'' Ruli said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Albania's problem comes from being isolated so long and
then having no patron country to provide basic training when
democracy and a free market arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been no stable cradle for the democratic
institutions to develop,'' said Ylli Pango(CQ both), a psychology
professor here who has written a book for Albanians about the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Pango and others believe Western powers abandoned Albania at its
most fragile moment. ``It was crazy, really, for the West to allow
Albania to go without any help,'' said Pango, also a former deputy
minister of education. ``In terms of history, I think it was one of
the biggest mistakes. Now we think that it is clear that Albania
cannot succeed alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here lately have been carrying articles pondering the
idea of Albania's becoming an American protectorate, to become a
ward of the great distant democratic uncle.
</P>
<P>
   While it is nearly unthinkable that the United States would go
so far as to assume such a role with Albania, there are clear signs
the countries are becoming closer.
</P>
<P>
   What one Western official described as a ``hidden protectorate''
is evolving with the United States and European Union members
providing advisors to guide Albanian government officials.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton Administration is moving quickly to replace the very
popular ambassador, Marisa Lino, who resigned last year. Earlier
this month President Clinton nominated Joseph Limprecht, a veteran
diplomat, to replace her.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton so near to the end of his term, this quick action
is seen here as a signal that Washington has come to regard Albania
with great importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Americans know that they now have a very keen interest in
Albania,'' Dedja said. ``Our futures are now joined.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Major General Curtis LeMay, commander of the U.S.
air raids that purposefully killed more than half a million
Japanese civilians during World War II, took a succinct view of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what war is about,'' the hard-bitten, B-29 pilot
once said. ``You've got to kill people, and when you've killed
enough, they stop fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   As the American Century staggers toward an unsettling close --
and graphic images of dead civilians invade American living rooms
with increasing frequency -- LeMay's remarks stand chillingly
emblematic of an era that has seen the slaughter of the innocent on
an unprecedented scale.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 100 years, more than 62 million civilians have
been killed in wars around the world. That's more, historians
believe, than in the previous two millennia combined.
</P>
<P>
   Many -- such as the 330,000 civilians killed by U.S. attacks on
60 Japanese cities during World War II and the 200,000 or so killed
by the nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- were
deliberately slain, in hopes of breaking an opponent's will. All
were killed in violation of one of the most basic tenets of
civilization: respect, if not mercy, for the defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   The limited, almost surgically restrained air strikes the United
States and its NATO partners are conducting against Serb forces in
Yugoslavia could hardly be more different from the total war LeMay
was charged with waging against Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, on this Memorial Day, when Americans pause to remember
those who have died in uniform, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia
is taking a mounting toll on that Balkan republic's civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   At least 320 civilian deaths have been documented, and Belgrade
claims more than 1,200 have been killed, a charge that is
impossible to verify or refute.
</P>
<P>
   It's certain, though, that each civilian who dies takes with
them a bit of the righteous authority President Clinton claimed
when he announced the strikes on March 24, citing ``a moral
imperative'' to counter Serb repression of majority ethnic
Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike any other major war of this century, perhaps in
history, the current NATO campaign is centered exclusively around
limited humanitarian objectives, a justification that is sorely
undercut whenever NATO bombs take innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no ordinary conflict. It's not a fight over territory
or money or markets. It's a struggle for the future shape of
civilized society,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday
in commencement remarks to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Md. ``What is convulsing the United States
and our NATO allies is the face of evil, an ethnic and religious
nationalism that has at its core a hatred of everything our great
democracies treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   If civilian casualties are a tragic by-product of the NATO
strikes, they are the very purpose of the campaign of terror Serb
troops and police have waged for the past year and a half targeting
Kosovar Albanians -- civilians as well as armed fighters pressing
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO strikes began, the repression has escalated into the
single worst rampage of bloodshed and destruction to be visited
upon Europe in 50 years, precisely what the United States and its
NATO allies had hoped to avert through air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, they are now bent on pounding the Serbs until
their leader, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, agrees to
peace on terms he has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, whose military and police forces have executed more
than 5,000 ethnic Albanians, according to State Department
estimates, and forced perhaps 1.5 million others to flee their
homes, has shown little regard for the Geneva Conventions that
protect non-combatants from military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has systematically and intentionally turned Kosovo into a
killing field,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said earlier this
month, ``and this was no accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign being waged to reverse that, NATO's democracies
aren't likely to tolerate high levels of civilian losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts every time it happens,'' said retired Army Maj. Bill
Stuebner, advisor to the rule of law program at the U.S. Institute
of Peace, a government-backed research group. ``You can only so
many times say, 'I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts believe, moreover, that Milosevic is buoyed by
civilian casualties and errant strikes -- like the inadvertent
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- which he hopes will
wear down support for the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic has ever prayed in his life he's praying for
things like that,'' said Stuebner, who has served in civil
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. ``He wants to show dismembered
mothers and babies on television.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO strikes continue, so does the risk of mounting
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real enemy is time,'' said Army Col. James F. Holcomb,
professor of national security strategy at the U.S. Army War
College in Carlisle, Pa. ``Over time, you're going to see these
images coming out more and more. Milosevic knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize civilian deaths, U.S. and allied military officials
are taking a complex set of precautions -- from a painstaking
target approval process to the bombing tactics pilots employ -- on
a scale never before seen in a major conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon lawyers weigh in to ensure that each target has a valid
military value and is not protected under international conventions
on war or human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Military targeting and weapons experts use sophisticated
computer models to assess the expected blast radius of a specific
type of bomb hitting a designated target, then calculate the
likelihood that such a strike might damage surrounding facilities
or put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a calculus here that is employed, and you do that for
every target,'' said U.S. Navy Cpt. Stephen Pietropaoli, spokesman
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics mandate further caution. Allied pilots are instructed to
verify their targets before each attack and are under strict orders
not to release bombs if there's the shadow of a possibility of
hitting civilians. In most cases, so-called forward air controllers
in warplanes accompanying the bombers must also sign off on a
target before it's struck, often in communications with yet a third
aircraft flying reconnaissance over the target area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of strike missions have been scrubbed when pilots
feared they might kill civilians, forcing warplanes to return to
aircraft carriers and land-based air fields with their bombs still
hanging perilously from their wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to inflict any more casualties, even on the
enemy, than is necessary, and certainly not among innocent
bystanders,'' said Pietropaoli.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``It will always be a business of risks, to our
side, to the enemy and, unfortunately, to those innocent civilians
caught in between.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true in an environment in which Serb troops
and police intentionally mix with civilians and position armor and
other military equipment near schools, churches and homes as
protection against allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping nearly 15,000 bombs in more than two months of
attacks, roughly a dozen have caused civilian deaths, according to
NATO officials, as alliance bombs either went awry or blasted areas
or facilities where children, journalists, diplomats and even the
very ethnic Albanian refugees the NATO strikes are designed to
protect were present.
</P>
<P>
   The record has drawn harsh criticism from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite NATO's rhetoric, there can be no doubt that these
killings and injuries were perpetrated willfully,'' alleges a
complaint that a group of international lawyers filed with the
United Nations tribunal investigating alleged war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint calls on the tribunal to indict President Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 65 other officials from
NATO countries for violating international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've charged them with willful killing,'' said Michael
Mandel, a party to the proceedings, who teaches law at York
University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is lying to us,'' Mandel said in a telephone interview
with Cox Newspapers. ``It's not taking care. In fact, it's trying
to terrorize the civilian population into bringing down the
Milosevic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon dismisses such charges, insisting that NATO has
never intentionally targeted civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the country early on, however, that the campaign
would carry risks to civilians as well as to NATO pilots, and U.S.
military officials insist that the civilian casualty rate so far --
tragic though it is -- has been well below what planners had
feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an extraordinary record, but it's not a
perfect record,'' Bacon said. ``We never promised a perfect record.
I doubt if there's been a military force in history that has, one,
set as a goal a reduction or a minimizing of civilian casualties to
the extent that this NATO force has, and that, two, has achieved
that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 percent of the bombs being dropped in Serbia are
so-called gravity bombs that simply tumble from warplanes and fall
to their targets. The other 90 percent are precision-guided weapons
steered to their targets by laser beams, global positioning
satellites, infrared sensors, nose-mounted video cameras or other
means.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reverse of the proportions in the Gulf War, when only
10 percent of the bombs dropped were precision guided weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Advanced navigational aides, combined with computerized cockpit
information systems, mean that gravity bombs can be dropped with
accuracy unheard of just a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   Modern guidance systems, however, a full generation advanced
from the so-called ``smart bombs'' of the Gulf War, enable pilots
to routinely ram 2,000-pound bombs into a target bull's-eye just a
few feet square firing from five miles or more away.

<P>
   ROME, Italy _ In a working-class neighborhood near the Coliseum,
the writing is on the wall regarding NATO's air war against
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``No to the American War,'' reads the graffiti scrawled on a
public building. ``Clinton the assassin. D'Alema (the Italian prime
minister) the accomplice.''
</P>
<P>
   In Greece, the sentiment is the same. A message spray-painted
along the NATO supply route from Greek ports to the Macedonian
border reads: ``Adolf Clinton, call off your dogs and stop the
war.''
</P>
<P>
   Few thought it would last this long -- the two-month-old war
over Kosovo, or the unity of the 19-country NATO coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The governments of Italy, Germany and Greece -- NATO countries
vital to the air war or to the effort to build up ground forces in
Macedonia and Albania -- have faced intense pressure at home to
halt their support for the campaign. Their governments,
particularly in Italy and Greece, have maintained their qualified
support for the bombing despite fierce public protests from the
outset of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Their task may have been made easier by the announcement
Thursday by the United Nations War Crimes Tribunal of indictments
against Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic for the ethnic
cleansing of the Kosovo province's Albanian majority.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say the indictments reinforce the NATO argument that
the war is necessary and serve to authoritatively rebuke the
strident anti-war rhetoric from pacifists, Communists and Serb
sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Rome, some agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO should go through with this until Milosevic is kicked
out,'' said Morelli Pasquale, 63, a barber who initially opposed
the war. ``I don't want war. I don't like this war. But sadly the
behavior of Milosevic requires it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in Germany, Italy and Greece, the leaders are on shaky
political ground. They are seeking on the one hand to remain loyal
NATO partners and on the other to maintain their ruling center-left
coalitions, which include factions vehemently opposed to the NATO
action.
</P>
<P>
   Those domestic strains have had a direct effect on NATO policy
as the alliance has searched for an end-game to force Milosevic's
capitulation.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO military planners have eyed the possibility of a
ground troop invasion of Kosovo, the option has effectively been
shelved, for the time being, because of the political realities for
key NATO states.
</P>
<P>
   German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder has called the possibility
of a NATO ground offensive ``unthinkable.'' Italy has said it could
only take place if sanctioned by a United Nations Security Council
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   Italy and Greece have pressed for a temporary suspension of the
air war in order to allow Serb forces the opportunity to withdrawal
from the province. The United States, Britain and France have
refused to consider a bombing pause.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, there was no disagreement on a NATO decision to
boost forces in the region to 50,000 troops for future peacekeeping
duty. There is no quarrel on the need for a secure means to return
the more than 1.5 million displaced Kosovo refugees to their homes.
The tough question is whether NATO soldiers would go in before or
after a negotiated end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Problems arise more toward the way the war is being conducted
by the NATO military rather than to its end purpose,'' said Cesare
Merlini, head of the Rome-based Institute for International
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   How the coalition has remained intact despite the political
differences reveals much about European politics today. At stake in
NATO's war against the Serbs is the very definition of European and
trans-Atlantic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Failure could have far-reaching implications on the future
effectiveness of European unity at a crucial time as the continent
seeks to implement a single currency and other steps to political
and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is supposed to be the model of the way the new Europe
works -- security cooperation, economic unity -- and to divide
would be to lose all credibility for this new order,'' said Patrick
McCarthy, a professor of European studies at Johns Hopkins
University in Bologna, Italy(CQ).
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, NATO's credibility, perhaps its very existence, has
become intertwined with the war against Serb-dominated Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Europeans are trying to keep their act together. But they
won't be able to do it if they set themselves up as patsies to be
had by a two-bit dictator such as Milosevic,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   Most combat sorties against Yugoslavia are flown from NATO bases
in Italy, whose left-wing and Communist parties have been vocal
opponents of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-American sentiment in Italy is high and U.S. forces here
have been targets of death threats and street assaults. Security
has been tightened at bases and military personnel have been warned
to keep a low profile and wear civilian clothes when traveling in
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``America is not the sheriff of the world,'' complained Moresco
Vittorio, an airline clerk who lives in the predominantly
left-wing, working-class neighborhood of Testaccio in Rome. ``We're
just being used. We must make our own decision to do what is
right.''
</P>
<P>
   His sentiment reveals what political analysts say is
double-edged discontent with the war: First, that NATO is bombing
Yugoslavia, a sovereign country and longtime Communist friend. And
second that Italy, because of its NATO obligations, is powerless to
stop it.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian perception of its role as America's pawn was further
fueled recently when Italian fishermen protested because they have
been snagging unexploded NATO bombs in their nets. NATO jets, upon
returning to their bases in Italy, routinely jettison their
undelivered bombs in the Adriatic Sea before landing. The U.S. and
NATO failed to notify Italy of the practice.
</P>
<P>
   D'Alema, meanwhile, presides over a precarious left-center
coalition that includes Greens and Communists opposed to NATO's air
campaign. Further significant pressure in Italy comes from the
Vatican, where Pope John Paul II has spoken out against the war.
</P>
<P>
   Yet NATO's five original demands for a halt to the airstrikes
remain the basis of Italy's policy. These include a verifiable
cease-fire; the withdrawal of Yugoslav security forces from Kosovo;
the unconditional return of all refugees; deployment of an
international peacekeeping force in the province; and the
acceptance by Belgrade of a political process that will restore
broad autonomy to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``D'Alema is under tremendous pressure and he has played it very
well so far. He has remained very loyal to NATO while allowing
people to speak out against the bombing. It leaves the impression
within the coalition that there's nothing to worry about, it's just
the Italians being the Italians. But the pressure is very real and
I don't know how long the government can last,'' said McCarthy.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   From the outset of the air campaign, Greece has demanded a
48-hour bombing pause as public opinion there remains
overwhelmingly opposed to the airstrikes. Many Greeks feel sympathy
for their fellow Christian Orthodox Serbs and fear conflict in the
Balkans could spread south and shatter Greece's current political
stability and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   During a visit this week to Washington, Greek Foreign Minister
George Papandreou said a temporary suspension could promote
diplomacy and eventual approval of a U.N. Security Council
resolution on a settlement of the Kosovo crisis.
</P>
<P>
   His government also expressed disappointment with the indictment
of Milosevic, the only NATO member to do so. ``This move is
politically wrong because it will not help the peace process,''
government spokesman Dimitris Reppas told reporters in Athens.

   WASHINGTON _ Civilian casualties are as old as war itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries before Christ, during three decades of fighting
between Athens and Sparta, the massacre of children, leveling of
entire cities and the selling of captured women into bondage became
the stock-in-trade for combatants in the Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no length to which violence did not go,'' wrote
Thucydides, one of the world's earliest war correspondents. ``Every
form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by reason of
the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two millennia later, English poet and novelist George Gascoigne
witnessed ``a pitiful massacre,'' of some 17,000 men, women and
children when Spanish troops sacked the German city of Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was neither man nor means to resist them,'' Gascoigne
wrote in 1576. ``When the blood is cold and the fury over, methinks
that a true Christian heart should stand content with victory, and
refrain to provoke God's wrath by shedding of innocent blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in history, however, can begin to rival the mass killing
brought on by the combination of lethal technology and the clash of
empires and values that the 20th Century has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million civilians died during World War I, a
figure so appalling that it shocked a generation into believing it
had fought the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of peace were shattered just two decades later by World
War II, which claimed at least 20 million civilians from Moscow to
Shanghai, from London to Dresden, from Okinawa to Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War followed just five years later, leaving an
estimated 1.5 million civilians dead. A decade after that, the
United States began its involvement in Vietnam, a conflict that
killed an estimated 1 million civilians between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the United States launched air strikes on Iraq in
1991, the global reach of CNN made it clear that President Bush
would pay a heavy price in public support if civilian casualties
got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The use of laser-guided bombs aided U.S. pilots' accuracy in
urban areas, but there were still incidents of civilian deaths, as
when scores were killed in an attack on a supposed military bunker
that turned out to be in use by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to that conflict, the air war against
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia is a full generation ahead in terms of
technology, the most intensive campaign of precision guided weapons
in history.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't ensured that all bombs hit their mark, but it's big
step in that direction.

   TAKIUKUM, Mexico _ In an obscure village in southern Mexico,
Manuel Gomez proudly shows guests horse manure spread beneath a
tangle of vines on his modest coffee farm.
</P>
<P>
   Manure, ironically, is offering a healthier and more prosperous
life to this Mayan Indian farmer, who uses it to fertilize organic
coffee he grows for consumers tens of thousands of miles from his
home.
</P>
<P>
   In Takiukum (pronounced, ``Ta-kee-a-KOOM'') and other isolated
hamlets nestled in the hills of politically-troubled Chiapas state,
more and more subsistence farmers are growing organic coffee for
export, which provides them with about 80 percent of their cash
income.
</P>
<P>
   Helped by foreign buyers who deal directly with them instead of
middlemen, the Indians are tapping into the taste buds of voracious
American coffee drinkers and receiving a much better price for
their gourmet crop than prevailing world market rates.
</P>
<P>
   The farmers' organic coffee is ending up as brew or beans found
in American and European cafes, health food stores, grocery chains
and specialty shops from Germany to Atlanta, Ga., from Italy to
Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez and about 1,300 other Indian farmers belong to Union
Majomut (pronounced, ``Ma-ho-MOOT''), a cooperative whose name
means ``place of birds'' in a Mayan dialect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream is to make our members self-sufficient, with all
their crops organic,'' said Gilberto Aguilar, an agronomist who has
been working with Union Majomut for years in this lushly beautiful
but desperately poor part of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   This quiet revolution is facing difficult challenges, however.
</P>
<P>
   Union Majomut's growers live in the middle of a virtual war
zone, where Zapatista Indian rebels and the Mexican military have
been locked in an uneasy truce since an armed uprising in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   All travelers in this area are stopped at military roadblocks
and divided Indian communities teeter on the edge of political
violence. In December 1997, anti-Zapatista vigilantes massacred 45
people -- including children in a church -- in the village of
Acteal, one of Union Majomut's member towns.
</P>
<P>
   Acteal's producers lost their entire crop that year because they
fled the village or were terrified to venture into their parcels to
harvest beans.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict still hinders production. Last year it cost the
union more than 50 percent of its anticipated yield, Aguilar said.
But the union continues to convert members by staying neutral and
working with farmers on both sides of the political divide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, 80 members were organic growers. Today, 700 out of
1,300 are growing coffee by certified organic means. The remaining
600 members are making the transition, Aguilar said, which requires
not applying chemicals and complying with other norms for at least
three years before certification.
</P>
<P>
   Although this area is remote and many Indians speak limited
Spanish, pesticide companies advertise heavily here, threatening
Union Majomut's investment, Aguilar added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also had a serious problem with the International Red Cross
after the Acteal massacre,'' he said. ``They arrived here and
passed out free packages of agro-chemicals, putting in jeopardy all
our years of hard work. We had to meet with them and ask them not
to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the early 1980s, the Mexican government was pushing
pesticides here, Aguilar said, and Indians who couldn't read
instructions were poisoning themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilar and other agronomists worked village by village to win
the Indians' confidence and persuade them to try organic methods.
</P>
<P>
   They also teamed up with international partners who want to give
the Indians a fair price for their labor, Aguilar said.
</P>
<P>
   One such buyer is Equal Exchange, a Canton, Mass.-based business
that buys coffee only from growers who farm small plots of about
two acres in Central America and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the turmoil in Chiapas, we wanted to find a way to
work with communities in need there,'' said Equal Exchange
marketing director Erbin Crowell.
</P>
<P>
   Coffee growers are always on the brink of disaster because
coffee prices fluctuate wildly. This year they've swung between $1
and $1.20 a pound, but Equal Exchange pays a guaranteed price of
$1.26 a pound, plus 15 cents for an organic premium.
</P>
<P>
   After the Acteal massacre, Equal Exchange raised $13,000 for
victims' families and refugees and gave it to Union Majomut to
distribute.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offers growers up to 60 percent credit in
advance on its contracts, something Mexican banks won't do.
</P>
<P>
   Equal Exchange roasts coffee from its Mexican buyers and sells
it under the brands Organic Cafe Mexico, Organic Mind, Body and
Soul, and other names.
</P>
<P>
   Union Majomut's coffee can be found, among other places, at
Shaw's Supermarket chain in New England, Rainbow Grocery stores in
California, the Wheatsville Food Co-op in Austin, Texas, and the
Ten Thousand Villages shop in Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Churches, too, buy the coffee.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows how much organic coffee is produced currently in
Mexico, said Roberto Giesemann, president of High Quality Coffees
of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The organic yield could still be as low as 1 percent of Mexico's
total coffee production. But there is room for growth in Chiapas,
where the Mayan Indians' culture lends itself to organizing
cooperatives that can police growing methods and produce bulk
quantities, Giesemann said.
</P>
<P>
   It is critical, however, that the Indians maintain contact with
foreign companies willing to pay premiums and offer credit,
Giesemann added.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   In broken Spanish, Manuel Gomez explains how the organic coffee
he's grown since 1991 has helped his family, which lives in a
simple wood house with no running water 26 miles from San Cristobal
de las Casas, the nearest city.
</P>
<P>
   Gomez's coffee plants are hard to spot on a slope behind his
house because they are tucked under trees producing avocados,
oranges and exotic fruits he can only identify in his Mayan
dialect. Vegetables the family relies on grow under a canopy of
trees alive with the song of birds.
</P>
<P>
   The trees provide the coffee plants the right amount of shade
they need to produce robust, flavorful beans of a higher quality
than those produced by rows of unprotected plants often seen on
large plantations.
</P>
<P>
   Careful terracing prevents soil erosion in this hilly area
during pounding summer rains.
</P>
<P>
   Because farmers like can't use chemicals and are required to mix
in other trees and plants among the coffee, these farms provide
another benefit: they are refuges for birds that are fast losing
habitat as Mexican forest is cut down, said Russell Greenberg,
president of the Smithsonian Institution Migratory Bird Center in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``The farms in Chiapas have the second highest diversity of
birds in that area,'' Greenberg said, ``second only to natural
tropical forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez used to migrate to pick coffee on Chiapas' large coffee
plantations, where he earned pennies after weeks of hard work.
</P>
<P>
   He's still poor, but now he can afford to buy a watch, tennis
shoes, saddles and tools while growing enough food for his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``Producers like Manuel,'' said Aguilar, ``have fruits to show
for the investment they've been given.''

   WASHINGTON _ Civilian casualties are as old as war itself.
</P>
<P>
   Four centuries before Christ, during three decades of fighting
between Athens and Sparta, the massacre of children, leveling of
entire cities and the selling of captured women into bondage became
the stock-in-trade for combatants in the Peloponnesian War.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no length to which violence did not go,'' wrote
Thucydides, one of the world's earliest war correspondents. ``Every
form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by reason of
the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   Two millennia later, English poet and novelist George Gascoigne
witnessed ``a pitiful massacre,'' of some 17,000 men, women and
children when Spanish troops sacked the German city of Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was neither man nor means to resist them,'' Gascoigne
wrote in 1576. ``When the blood is cold and the fury over, methinks
that a true Christian heart should stand content with victory, and
refrain to provoke God's wrath by shedding of innocent blood.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing in history, however, can begin to rival the mass killing
brought on by the combination of lethal technology and the clash of
empires and values that the 20th Century has wrought.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 6 million civilians died during World War I, a
figure so appalling that it shocked a generation into believing it
had fought the war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   Dreams of peace were shattered just two decades later by World
War II, which claimed at least 20 million civilians from Moscow to
Shanghai, from London to Dresden, from Okinawa to Manila Bay.
</P>
<P>
   The Korean War followed just five years later, leaving an
estimated 1.5 million civilians dead. A decade after that, the
United States began its involvement in Vietnam, a conflict that
killed an estimated 1 million civilians between 1965 and 1975.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the United States launched air strikes on Iraq in
1991, the global reach of CNN made it clear that President Bush
would pay a heavy price in public support if civilian casualties
got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The use of laser-guided bombs aided U.S. pilots' accuracy in
urban areas, but there were still incidents of civilian deaths, as
when scores were killed in an attack on a supposed military bunker
that turned out to be in use by civilians.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to that conflict, the air war against
Serb-dominated Yugoslavia is a full generation ahead in terms of
technology, the most intensive campaign of precision guided weapons
in history.
</P>
<P>
   That hasn't ensured that all bombs hit their mark, but it's big
step in that direction.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Major General Curtis LeMay, commander of the U.S.
air raids that purposefully killed more than half a million
Japanese civilians during World War II, took a succinct view of his
profession.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what war is about,'' the hard-bitten, B-29 pilot
once said. ``You've got to kill people, and when you've killed
enough, they stop fighting.''
</P>
<P>
   As the American Century staggers toward an unsettling close --
and graphic images of dead civilians invade American living rooms
with increasing frequency -- LeMay's remarks stand chillingly
emblematic of an era that has seen the slaughter of the innocent on
an unprecedented scale.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 100 years, more than 62 million civilians have
been killed in wars around the world. That's more, historians
believe, than in the previous two millennia combined.
</P>
<P>
   Many -- such as the 330,000 civilians killed by U.S. attacks on
60 Japanese cities during World War II and the 200,000 or so killed
by the nuclear strikes on Hiroshima and Nagasaki -- were
deliberately slain, in hopes of breaking an opponent's will. All
were killed in violation of one of the most basic tenets of
civilization: respect, if not mercy, for the defenseless.
</P>
<P>
   The limited, almost surgically restrained air strikes the United
States and its NATO partners are conducting against Serb forces in
Yugoslavia could hardly be more different from the total war LeMay
was charged with waging against Japan.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, on this Memorial Day, when Americans pause to remember
those who have died in uniform, the NATO air war against Yugoslavia
is taking a mounting toll on that Balkan republic's civilian
population.
</P>
<P>
   At least 320 civilian deaths have been documented, and Belgrade
claims more than 1,200 have been killed, a charge that is
impossible to verify or refute.
</P>
<P>
   It's certain, though, that each civilian who dies takes with
them a bit of the righteous authority President Clinton claimed
when he announced the strikes on March 24, citing ``a moral
imperative'' to counter Serb repression of majority ethnic
Albanians in Serbia's southern province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   For unlike any other major war of this century, perhaps in
history, the current NATO campaign is centered exclusively around
limited humanitarian objectives, a justification that is sorely
undercut whenever NATO bombs take innocent lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no ordinary conflict. It's not a fight over territory
or money or markets. It's a struggle for the future shape of
civilized society,'' Defense Secretary William Cohen said Wednesday
in commencement remarks to the graduating class at the U.S. Naval
Academy at Annapolis, Md. ``What is convulsing the United States
and our NATO allies is the face of evil, an ethnic and religious
nationalism that has at its core a hatred of everything our great
democracies treasure.''
</P>
<P>
   If civilian casualties are a tragic by-product of the NATO
strikes, they are the very purpose of the campaign of terror Serb
troops and police have waged for the past year and a half targeting
Kosovar Albanians -- civilians as well as armed fighters pressing
for independence.
</P>
<P>
   Since NATO strikes began, the repression has escalated into the
single worst rampage of bloodshed and destruction to be visited
upon Europe in 50 years, precisely what the United States and its
NATO allies had hoped to avert through air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Failing that, they are now bent on pounding the Serbs until
their leader, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, agrees to
peace on terms he has so far rejected.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic, whose military and police forces have executed more
than 5,000 ethnic Albanians, according to State Department
estimates, and forced perhaps 1.5 million others to flee their
homes, has shown little regard for the Geneva Conventions that
protect non-combatants from military force.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has systematically and intentionally turned Kosovo into a
killing field,'' Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon said earlier this
month, ``and this was no accident.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign being waged to reverse that, NATO's democracies
aren't likely to tolerate high levels of civilian losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts every time it happens,'' said retired Army Maj. Bill
Stuebner, advisor to the rule of law program at the U.S. Institute
of Peace, a government-backed research group. ``You can only so
many times say, 'I'm sorry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Western analysts believe, moreover, that Milosevic is buoyed by
civilian casualties and errant strikes -- like the inadvertent
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade -- which he hopes will
wear down support for the NATO air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Milosevic has ever prayed in his life he's praying for
things like that,'' said Stuebner, who has served in civil
peacekeeping operations in Bosnia. ``He wants to show dismembered
mothers and babies on television.''
</P>
<P>
   As the NATO strikes continue, so does the risk of mounting
casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real enemy is time,'' said Army Col. James F. Holcomb,
professor of national security strategy at the U.S. Army War
College in Carlisle, Pa. ``Over time, you're going to see these
images coming out more and more. Milosevic knows that.''
</P>
<P>
   To minimize civilian deaths, U.S. and allied military officials
are taking a complex set of precautions -- from a painstaking
target approval process to the bombing tactics pilots employ -- on
a scale never before seen in a major conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon lawyers weigh in to ensure that each target has a valid
military value and is not protected under international conventions
on war or human rights.
</P>
<P>
   Military targeting and weapons experts use sophisticated
computer models to assess the expected blast radius of a specific
type of bomb hitting a designated target, then calculate the
likelihood that such a strike might damage surrounding facilities
or put civilians at risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a calculus here that is employed, and you do that for
every target,'' said U.S. Navy Cpt. Stephen Pietropaoli, spokesman
for the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Tactics mandate further caution. Allied pilots are instructed to
verify their targets before each attack and are under strict orders
not to release bombs if there's the shadow of a possibility of
hitting civilians. In most cases, so-called forward air controllers
in warplanes accompanying the bombers must also sign off on a
target before it's struck, often in communications with yet a third
aircraft flying reconnaissance over the target area.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of strike missions have been scrubbed when pilots
feared they might kill civilians, forcing warplanes to return to
aircraft carriers and land-based air fields with their bombs still
hanging perilously from their wings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no desire to inflict any more casualties, even on the
enemy, than is necessary, and certainly not among innocent
bystanders,'' said Pietropaoli.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``It will always be a business of risks, to our
side, to the enemy and, unfortunately, to those innocent civilians
caught in between.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   That's particularly true in an environment in which Serb troops
and police intentionally mix with civilians and position armor and
other military equipment near schools, churches and homes as
protection against allied attacks.
</P>
<P>
   After dropping nearly 15,000 bombs in more than two months of
attacks, roughly a dozen have caused civilian deaths, according to
NATO officials, as alliance bombs either went awry or blasted areas
or facilities where children, journalists, diplomats and even the
very ethnic Albanian refugees the NATO strikes are designed to
protect were present.
</P>
<P>
   The record has drawn harsh criticism from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite NATO's rhetoric, there can be no doubt that these
killings and injuries were perpetrated willfully,'' alleges a
complaint that a group of international lawyers filed with the
United Nations tribunal investigating alleged war crimes in the
former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint calls on the tribunal to indict President Clinton,
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and 65 other officials from
NATO countries for violating international humanitarian law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've charged them with willful killing,'' said Michael
Mandel, a party to the proceedings, who teaches law at York
University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   ``NATO is lying to us,'' Mandel said in a telephone interview
with Cox Newspapers. ``It's not taking care. In fact, it's trying
to terrorize the civilian population into bringing down the
Milosevic regime.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon dismisses such charges, insisting that NATO has
never intentionally targeted civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton warned the country early on, however, that the campaign
would carry risks to civilians as well as to NATO pilots, and U.S.
military officials insist that the civilian casualty rate so far --
tragic though it is -- has been well below what planners had
feared.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an extraordinary record, but it's not a
perfect record,'' Bacon said. ``We never promised a perfect record.
I doubt if there's been a military force in history that has, one,
set as a goal a reduction or a minimizing of civilian casualties to
the extent that this NATO force has, and that, two, has achieved
that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 10 percent of the bombs being dropped in Serbia are
so-called gravity bombs that simply tumble from warplanes and fall
to their targets. The other 90 percent are precision-guided weapons
steered to their targets by laser beams, global positioning
satellites, infrared sensors, nose-mounted video cameras or other
means.
</P>
<P>
   That's the reverse of the proportions in the Gulf War, when only
10 percent of the bombs dropped were precision guided weapons.

information systems, mean that gravity bombs can be dropped with
accuracy unheard of just a decade ago.

   SKIN-PROTECTION _ WACO, Texas _ Soaking up the hot rays of the
summer sun without protection is like giving skin cancer an open
invitation to form on your skin. ``People are still thinking a tan
is beautiful and the sun and tanning beds are safe,'' said Dr.
James Mason, a dermatologist. ``I think older people are getting
the picture when they see the bumps and skin spots come up, but
younger people feel like they're immune to these types of problems
and don't think about it until it's too late.'' (Mays, Waco

   FITNESS-KYUDO _ Meditative Japanese archery is the latest thing

It's more meditation than sport, more like tai chi and yoga than

discovering more about yourself (how Austin.) (Santos, Austin

ASO competing with for talent? What do insiders around the country

daughter and they've survived a long family feud. By MICHAEL
DOUGAN.

abandoned plant in a remote factory town into the country's largest

 &HT;    THE FEDS VS. MICROSOFT: ROUND TWO BEGINS

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When the Microsoft antitrust trial resumes Tuesday
after a three-month break, it will feature much the same set of
characters arguing about many of the same issues in the same
federal courtroom. Only the computing world has changed.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department and 19 states have charged that Microsoft
sought to use its monopoly in the Windows operating system, loaded
on 90 percent of the world's personal computers, to achieve
dominance in the Internet browser market. That could give Microsoft
a choke hold on Internet access at a time when electronic commerce
promises to reshape the economy, the government contends.
</P>
<P>
   But since February, Microsoft has quietly shifted its strategic
stance to reduce its reliance on Windows. Using a $20 billion cash
hoard and a stock market capitalization of some $338 billion, the
company is investing heavily in a new generation of intelligent
devices, including cable TV set-top boxes and smart phones.
</P>
<P>
   Also since February, America Online, the nation's leading
Internet provider, has completed its $10 billion takeover of
Netscape Communications Corp., maker of a popular Internet browser.
Microsoft is expected to argue in court that the deal proves that
Microsoft lacks true monopoly power.
</P>
<P>
   The government will say the deal has no bearing on whether
Microsoft broke the nation's antitrust laws. Upholding that view in
his mid-trial deposition, America Online chairman Steve Case said
his service company must rely on Microsoft to include AOL sign-up
materials with each installed copy of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   In the first phase of the trial, prosecutors offered evidence,
including internal E-mail, that Microsoft had hard-wired Internet
Explorer into Windows in order to throttle usage of Netscape's
competing browser.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft holds that the integration of the browser into the
operating system offered millions of satisfied users the
convenience they craved and, in any event, caused no harm.
</P>
<P>
   That's hardly likely, said Robert Bork, a former federal appeals
court judge who has served as a consultant to Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is,'' Bork said last week, ``that once the government
demonstrates anti-competitive tactics and preserving a monopoly,
consumer harm is automatically inferred. You don't go around
preserving a monopoly by illegal tactics unless you expect to get
monopoly profits and slow innovation _ which is consumer harm.''
</P>
<P>
   As the case unfolds during the next month or so before U.S.
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, each side will put three
rebuttal witnesses at the stand. In theory, the idea is to respond
to the other's side's prior case, but this phase of the trial may
bring out some fresh attacks and defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Prompted by the judge, the litigants met several times during
the recess and exchanged written drafts on how to settle the case.
But so far as is known, they remain far apart. No talks further
talks are scheduled to resolve the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In the opening phase of the Microsoft trial, which began last
October, each side presented 12 witnesses before Jackson, who then
recessed the trial Feb. 26 to preside over a complex murder case.
</P>
<P>
   When the trial resumes, the government will call IBM executive
Garry Norris, economist Franklin Fisher and Princeton computer
expert Edward Felten. Microsoft will call AOL executive David
Colburn as a hostile witness, along with software industry veteran
Gordon Eubanks and economist Richard Schmalensee. All but Norris
and Eubanks are repeat players.
</P>
<P>
   Of the six, IBM's Norris could well emerge as the final star
witness.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 200 pages of notes and other internal IBM documents
that the government will introduce to support his account, Norris
recounts strong pressure against IBM in 1996 and 1997, orchestrated
directly by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, Norris will testify, cut IBM out of secret
market-development contracts, a complex web of discounts that are
given to personal computer makers, when IBM refused to drop work on
its rival OS/2 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft maintains there was nothing unusual or improper
about its licensing talks with IBM. Said spokesman Mark Murray:
``There were tough negotiations on both sides, and I'm sure lots of
strong statements made on both sides ... but the bottom line is
that Microsoft did license Windows 95 to IBM at a competitive
price, and IBM continued to ship lots of competitor products right
alongside Windows on their machines.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   However the trial turns out, it already has made a profound
impact on Microsoft's corporate culture, as well as that of its
Silicon Valley enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Friedman, the Nobel laureate economist, believes that
``Silicon Valley is suicidal in calling government in to mediate in
the disputes among some of the big companies in the area and
Microsoft.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The end result,'' Friedman adds, ``will be that is that the
industry is going spend in legal fees over the next 10 or 20 years
money which society could benefit from much more if it were spent
in the kind of research and development that have brought us the
many miracles in the area of Internet, in the area of home
computers, industry computers, and all the rest.''

 &HT;    Poor-quality tools are good for making holes in your wallet
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A query on the Internet raises perhaps the biggest question any
woodworking newbie has _ what tools to buy and how much to pay.
</P>
<P>
   A fellow asks the subscribers to the rec.woodworking news group
which three bench power tools they consider necessary and if it's
worthwhile getting them used.
</P>
<P>
   He mentions a line of tools he saw in a a discount department
store _ $100 for a 10-inch table saw and $140 for a compound miter
saw.
</P>
<P>
   Then he mentions a couple of jigsaws he noticed in a pawn shop,
name brands running between $89 and $300. ``What are the brands to
stay away from?'' he asks.
</P>
<P>
   I have been on this Earth for more than 60 years now, spending
money hand over fist for most of that time, and I have never failed
to get burned when I tried to go cheap. I have known people who had
an uncannny knack for finding bargains, but these were good buys on
good equipment _ not cheaply made stuff.
</P>
<P>
   With woodworking, as in most areas, there is a scale of prices
for a given item that starts very low, reaches a sort of
equilibrium with good quality at a certain level, and goes on up
with diminishing returns.
</P>
<P>
   A table saw is the first major tool a woodworker needs. A $100
table saw, however, is not even going to make a decent toy. A
compound miter saw is a carpenter's tool, not a woodworker's.
</P>
<P>
   There are two basic kinds of table saw, the smaller ones known
as contractor's saws and the full-size jobs. People who do not
intend to work with sheets of plywood, or get into heavy timbers,
can often get by with a contractor's saw. These run around $800.
The Jet brand has a good reputation.
</P>
<P>
   The next level is the Delta Unisaw and its clones at around
$1,500. These are massive saws suitable for almost any kind of work
short of heavy commercial production. You can go on up to $5,000
and more. What you get for all that extra money varies, but it can
include automated features for production shops, added functions,
and generally even beefier construction. They're dandy if you can
afford it, but it's a rare woodworker who couldn't do just fine
with a basic Unisaw type.
</P>
<P>
   The reason this stuff costs so much is that it must be
accurately built and heavily constructed in order to maintain that
accuracy. A table saw whose blade cannot be kept in alignment with
the miter slots is useless. So is a table saw that cannot easily
and smoothly cut through a two-inch-thick plank of oak. A $100
table saw? Lord, a good miter gauge costs more than $100.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as for the pawn shop jig saws, these are scarcely essential
tools in the woodworker's shop. I'd guess that $89 is at the bottom
end of a decent quality tool and $300 is in the area of overkill.
</P>
<P>
   The basic bench tools, in my opinion, are the table saw, the
jointer and the planer. The bench-top planers, generally in the
area of $300, do an adequate job if you aren't going into
production or planning on running extremely long planks through
them. The jointer is going to cost you as much or more than the
table saw if you get one of a good useful width _ say, 10 inches. I
always recommend looking into a two-in-one jointer/planer. What
brands to stay away from? The brands I stay away from are legion,
far too numerous to name, and then there are a great many tools,
usually Taiwanese clones, that suffer chiefly from poor quality
control. Some can be very good, some pretty bad. Luck of the draw,
don't you know.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to buy tools is to go to woodworking stores, and
get catalogs from every one you can. Generally speaking,
woodworking specialty stores are run by woodworkers and they cater
to professionals as well as amateurs. They are not going to stock
poor tools.
</P>
<P>
   You will find, I wager, that there won't be $5 difference in the
price of the same tool with the same configuration between any of
these places. They're selling them as cheaply as they can while
still making money. You will get an idea, however, which tools are
good. If you can't afford one, see if you can't find it used. But
don't waste your money on junk that will hinder rather than help
you.

WHAT DOES JANE FONDA HAVE TO SAY OF ANY IMPORTANCE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By J.R. LABBE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Confession, as the saying goes, is good for the soul. This
Memorial Day weekend is as good a time as any to confess to the
nation's veterans that I did not watch the ABC/Barbara Walters
special on the century's 100 great women, which was the topic of a
column earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   I won't watch anything that includes Jane Fonda. I knew she was
going to be part of the program after reading a preview written by
the paper's TV critic.
</P>
<P>
   Having not watched the program, I didn't know precisely the
scope of the traitor-turned-exercise-maven's participation.
Regardless, the very idea of Walters and ABC including Hanoi Jane
on a program showcasing significant women of the 20th century was
stomach-turning.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the more than 300 e-mails, 100 phone calls and scores of
letters I received about the column, only one caller said she
actually watched the show.
</P>
<P>
   She said Walters asked Fonda to comment about the contributions
of one of the chosen 100. Fonda, like talk-show hostess Rosie
O'Donnell (who was asked about her friendship with Madonna, who WAS
recognized as ``great,'' if you can believe it), was not herself a
woman of greatness.
</P>
<P>
   Although that provides an iota of relief about ABC's judgment,
it's not enough to change my original premise that Fonda doesn't
belong in anybody's spotlight, unless it's that of the House
Committee on Un-American Activities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the caller, Walters asked Fonda about the impact
that birth control, an invention pioneered by a woman, had on
society.
</P>
<P>
   Why, pray tell, ask Fonda? Why not a doctor or a sociologist or
the surgeon general or someone with some credentials beyond being a
personal friend of the interviewer? (Walters and Fonda are old
pals, dating back to the 1988 ``20/20'' interview in which Fonda
``apologized'' to America's veterans for going to Hanoi during the
Vietnam War and cavorting with the enemy.)
</P>
<P>
   Which brings up the next puzzler: Why would the American Bar
Association book Fonda to speak on Aug. 10 at its annual Silver
Gavel Awards in Atlanta? Can't they afford someone from out of
town?
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Weixl of the ABA's media relations department in Chicago
explained that the annual awards are designed to recognize members
of the media _ not just news, but movies, TV and radio _ for
excellence in providing information about the legal system to the
public. According to a statement released by the ABA, Fonda was
invited to speak because of her ``contributions to the arts and her
important work with young people.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if that includes the torture of young American soldiers
by their Viet Cong captors because they didn't show the proper
deference when Fonda traipsed her way through Hanoi in 1972?
</P>
<P>
   What lessons are America's young people learning from Fonda _ to
betray your country for fun and profit? That there's absolutely no
consequence for denouncing your nation during war and consorting
with the enemy?
</P>
<P>
   The ABA made it clear _ very clear _ that Fonda will not be a
recipient of any award at the $40-a-plate luncheon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ABA doesn't take positions,'' Weixl said. ``We invite
people with all kinds of opinions _ speakers who haven't agreed
with the ABA, controversial people ...''
</P>
<P>
   If controversy is what the ABA was aiming for, then it hit the
bull's eye with Fonda. Who'll be invited next year _ Slobodan
Milosevic?

   Attorneys get knocked pretty hard in this country _ some of it
deserved, most of it not. They're easy to criticize until you need
one _ sorta like police. But here's a sure way that a bunch of them
could crank up their standing a couple of notches in the eyes of
scores of veterans: Don't shell out the 40 bucks for the optional
meal ticket.

<P>
   Go to your convention, have a wonderful time, learn the latest
tricks of the litigation trade. But take a pass on lunch with the
traitor.

   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I think you should speak out against violent
computer games. My 13-year-old son is so absorbed in Doom I am
afraid he may suffer psychological harm.

privileges or do a better job of overseeing what software he buys.
As I seem to recall, it's your job to help build his character, and
relinquishing that kind of power to the big shiny box on his desk
is no way to do that. Or are you afraid of not being a ``cool
mom''?
</P>
<P>
   And just because somebody plays Doom doesn't mean he's going to
go ballistic. First-person shooters can be fun if you're mature
enough to know they're about as much like real life as ``The Jerry
Springer Show.'' If you teach your kid that _ and get him to come
up for air once in a while _ he'll be OK.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I've got a Pentium 133 with about 400 megabytes
of available disk space, yet the thing is running a bit on the slow
side when you go from one program to another. I scan and defrag the
disk regularly and flush out all the temp files from the Internet
every day. I've also noticed that America Online 4.0 seems a lot
slower compared to 3.0.

   DEAR 'POKE: Available disk space doesn't have all that much to
do with how fast things run. You'll get the biggest bang for your
buck if you cram as much RAM as you can into the box.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the olden days, programs were a lot leaner and meaner.
Now, decreased speed is the penalty you pay for all that ease of
use and friendly graphics and singing icons. Microsoft Word seems
to get slower in each incarnation because they keep adding stuff to
it. The same is true of AOL. They're memory hogs.
</P>
<P>
   When Windows needs more memory than you have, it uses free hard
disk space to simulate RAM, but writing and reading all that data
to and from the disk is painfully slower than doing it to a chip.
And another thing: You say ``Pentium 133'' as if it's something to
be proud of. That's pretty marginal these days. See if you can
upgrade the processor.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I have an HP Vectra on which I have DOS and
Windows 3.11. I can't afford to do away with the DOS because I have
a 13-year-old database program with an enormous amount of records
that I don't want to redo in some newer program. Since you say that
Windows and Linux could be on one hard disk, could I do the same
with DOS and Windows?
</P>
<P>
   _Split Personality
</P>
<P>
   DEAR SPLIT: Forget what Microsoft tells you about Windows being
its own operating system. Windows is just a tarted-up DOS, and
there's really no reason to subdivide your drive to accommodate
both. Linux and Windows/DOS are radically different systems,
however, and they can't coexist in the same disk partition.
</P>
<P>
   You can get to DOS easily enough by clicking the MS-DOS Prompt
icon in the main program group. Assuming you have DOS 6 or so,
adding special commands into Config.sys and Autoexec.bat will allow
you to boot into either Windows or DOS, but that means you have to
get out the DOS manual. What, did you think I was going to do all
your work for you? They don't pay me enough for that. Go read the

SAAB ROLLS OUT FIRST WAGON IN 25 YEARS: THE LUXURY 9-5
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By G. CHAMBERS WILLIAMS III 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are station wagons coming back?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's just wishful thinking on the part of automakers who
don't have a sport-utility vehicle or minivan in their product
lineups, but the word from these companies is that consumers are
ready to embrace wagons again.
</P>
<P>
   Many of us grew up in the '60s and '70s when our parents had big
station wagons to haul the family around in. My parents had a '66
Chevy wagon for us five kids, and before that, a '56 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning in the early '80s, big wagons began to be replaced
by minivans, and by the mid-90s, minivans were being replaced by
sport-utility vehicles such as the Ford Explorer and Jeep Grand
Cherokee.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, such automakers as Audi, Saab and Saturn are adding
midsize wagons to their fleets to satisfy what they believe is a
trend back toward wagons. They are not the huge models like the
Chevy Caprice and Buick Roadmaster that General Motors discontinued
a couple of years ago _ the last really big wagons.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new wagons are smaller, sleeker and more sedanlike
than ever. The new entries are coming on line to compete against
the handful of midsize wagons that remained on the market during
the onslaught of sport-utilities and minivans, including entries
from Volvo, Mercedes, BMW, Volkswagen, Subaru and Ford/Mercury.
Volvo, by the way, is the world leader in wagon sales.
</P>
<P>
   I recently tested both the 1999 Saab 9-5 Wagon, which went on
sale in April, and the midsize 2000 Saturn wagon, which will debut
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, both of these cars are derived from the same vehicle
platform, developed originally for the German Opel Vectra. The
Saturn will cost about half as much as the Saab wagon, but it's not
quite as luxurious. All three vehicles are GM products, since GM
owns Saturn and Opel, and has controlling interest in Sweden's
Saab.
</P>
<P>
   For Saab, introduction of the 9-5 Wagon is something of a
historical occasion. The company last produced a wagon a quarter of
a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab, with base prices ranging from $31,850 to $36,900
depending on engine choice, will compete against the high end of
the wagon segment, which includes the Volvo V70 all-wheel-drive,
BMW 5-series, Audi A6 Avant and Mercedes E-class. Saab says the
U.S. luxury wagon market ``has quietly grown by 40 percent'' since
1988. It's still not a very big segment, however; just 60,000
vehicles are expected to be sold in the United States this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 9-5 wagon isn't planned to be a mass-market vehicle like the
Saturn; Saab's goal is to sell 3,800 wagons in the United States
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Saab and Saturn officials made much to do about their respective
vehicles' styling, telling automotive journalists that they went to
great lengths to refrain from designing another ``box,'' which of
course is a reference to the boxy Volvo that wagon fans worldwide
have come to know and love.
</P>
<P>
   True, neither one is boxy like a Volvo, with squared-off edges,
but both of these cars look like wagons. They are, after all,
wagons.
</P>
<P>
   The Saab is a good-looking wagon, though. But if you don't like
wagons, you probably won't like the 9-5 no matter how rounded and
aerodynamic it is.
</P>
<P>
   Does it truly ride and handle like a sedan? Absolutely. If your
main complaint about wagons isn't their boxy appearance, but
instead, their boxy handling characteristics, then you'll probably
be pleasantly surprised.
</P>
<P>
   I put a 9-5 wagon through its paces on freeways, curvy mountains
roads and even some sandy trails best left to the sport-utility
vehicles, and other than a scare or two when the front-wheel drive
got bogged-down in deep sand momentarily, the Saab was a real treat
to drive.
</P>
<P>
   The wagon has essentially the same suspension as the 9-5 sedan,
which debuted last year as the most expensive, safest and most
impressive Saab ever. Both vehicles are powered by either a
2.3-liter, turbocharged four-cylinder engine rated at 170
horsepower and 207 foot-pounds of torque, or a 3.0-liter,
turbocharged V-6 rated at 200 horsepower and 229 foot-pounds of
torque.
</P>
<P>
   The higher-priced V-6 model comes with a four-speed automatic
transmission, while the four-cylinder is paired with a five-speed
manual (the automatic is a $1,150 option on the four-cylinder
model).
</P>
<P>
   Unlike some competitors, the Saab is not available with a third
seat or all-wheel drive. Saab officials said the decision to leave
out a third seat was made on the basis of safety; it's hard to
protect occupants riding in what is essentially the cargo area of a
station wagon in a rear- end collision. As for all-wheel drive:
that's expensive to design and manufacture, and Saab officials
don't believe it would be worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample room for five adults and 37 cubic feet of cargo,
and with the back seat removed, the cargo area expands to as much
as 72.9 cubic feet. A unique feature is a loading floor that slides
out as far as 20 inches from the rear of the hatch, and there are
study cargo rails on the floor to help secure your stuff so it
doesn't go flying around during an accident. A rigid parcel shelf
is included to cover the cargo and keep it out of view.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other safety features are antilock brakes, a steel
safety cage surrounding the passenger compartment, next-generation
front and dual-stage side air bags for front seat occupants, and
Saab's active head-restraint system, which instantly moves the head
rests forward to stop whiplashing of the occupants' heads in a
rear-end collision.
</P>
<P>
   A leather interior is standard on the V-6 model, but costs
$1,350 extra on the four-cylinder model. Ventilated front seats,
which have perforations and little fans to push air out of the seat
bottoms and backs, cost $1,025 on the V-6 wagons and $1,800 on the
four-cylinders. It's a nice feature, especially for climates like
that of Texas, but I'm not sure it's worth the price.
</P>
<P>
   Standard features on both models include power everything,
anti-theft system, walnut-veneer interior trim, electric sun roof,
automatic climate control (with separate controls for driver and
front passenger), refrigerated glove box (perfect for soft drinks,
sandwiches and chocolate bars), cruise control and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   EPA fuel-economy ratings are better than most sport-utilities
and minivans: 19 miles per gallon in the city and 25 mph on the
highway for the V-6 model; 22 city/29 highway for the four-cylinder
with manual transmission; and 19 city/28 highway for four-cylinder
automatics.
</P>
<P>
   The tank holds 18.5 gallons of fuel.

<P>
   At A Glance:
</P>
<P>
   1999 Saab 9-5 Wagon
</P>
<P>
   THE PACKAGE: Midsize, five-door, five-passenger,
inline-four-cylinder or V-6 powered, front-drive luxury station
wagon, the first wagon from Sweden's Saab in 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   HIGHLIGHTS: Ride and handling take no lumps in this stylish
conversion of the premium 9-5 sedan into wagon form. Unlike its
cross-country rival, Volvo, the Saab wagon is well-rounded on the
edges and aerodynamically clean; the interior is well done, with
obvious attention to detail; and there are two engine choices _
both turbocharged and good performers.
</P>
<P>
   NEGATIVES: No all-wheel-drive version offered to meet the Audi,
Volvo and Mercedes-Benz competition.

THANK YOUR LUCKY STARS FOR `NOTTING HILL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By AMY BIANCOLLI  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hollywood is, as always, fascinated with itself. From the soapy
noir of ``Sunset Boulevard'' through the witty plotting of ``The
Player'' on into the pulpy low-lives of ``L.A. Confidential,''
Tinseltown has always been its own best subject.
</P>
<P>
   So it doesn't seem the least bit awkward to describe ``Notting
Hill,'' a gracefully funny romance from the team that made ``Four
Weddings and a Funeral,'' as a movie about movie stardom starring
movie stars. As evidence of just what a Mobius strip this is, the
film's one-sheet poster consists of a man walking past the
one-sheet poster for ``Notting Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   The joke here _ and it is indeed a joke _ is that a movie about
a mega-wattage quasar actually stars a mega-wattage quasar, in this
case Julia Roberts. This lends a self-mocking, origami quality to
much of the film, as though the entire thing were folded in on
itself; when average folks bump into Anna Scott, the actress played
by Roberts, they react with the geeky enthusiasm you'd expect from
average folks bumping into you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   And when Anna talks privately about the agonies of fame, it's
impossible not to assume that our own, dear Julia is suffering the
same fate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was nice to meet you. Surreal, but nice,'' says a
starstruck suitor, and he might have just as easily been talking
about the film.
</P>
<P>
   The suitor is William Thacker (Hugh Grant), a travel bookstore
owner in the culturally mishmashed London neighborhood of Notting
Hill. Thacker's the kind of sad-eyed chap that Grant has made his
career out of, a hesitating underachiever whose very allure is his
complete lack of self-confidence. When Anna glides into his
bookstore, he regards her with the quiet amazement that befits
encounters with remote natural wonders the Grand Canyon, an aurora
borealis, Niagara Falls.
</P>
<P>
   And when he accidentally sloshes orange juice all over her
skimpy blouse, his shock at being that up-front-and-personal with
the luminous Anna is both emotionally transparent and charming.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you like something to eat? Something to nibble? Apricots
soaked in honey?'' he babbles, after lending her his flat to change
clothes. She beats a polite but hasty exit, only to return moments
later and kiss him, long and seriously.
</P>
<P>
   So caught off guard is William that he can't pull his hands out
of his back pockets to embrace her. He just stands there, stunned.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Michell directed ``Notting Hill'' from a script by Richard
Curtis, and the film has the same, sweet hex on it that the
filmmakers brought to ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' The main
difference is the absence of Andie MacDowell, whose icy bearing
didn't mix well with Grant's stuttering nerd. Few sparks flew
between those two.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, Grant's chemistry with Roberts is wholehearted and
utterly believable, trading on Roberts' grace before the camera and
Grant's dithering (but dorkily seductive) unease. Roberts has never
been better; as Anna's romance with William starts and stalls, her
poise begins to crack, and simple human yearning streaks through.
</P>
<P>
   So much works in ``Notting Hill'': Curtis' affable, asymmetrical
dialogue (which includes a debate on the usage of
``whoopsadaisy''); Michell's pacing, which never lusts after
consummation but leads up to it naturally; and the ensemble
contributions of a bull's-eye supporting cast, including Emma
Chambers as William's pop-eyed sister, Tim McInnerny as his
empathetic best friend and Rhys Ifans as his slacking, unhygienic
flatmate.
</P>
<P>
   Grant makes a perfect Everyman and a delightful nobody, which of
course he isn't. In the matter of mega-wattage, his sun is only
slightly less brilliant than Roberts'. But ``Notting Hill'' is a
movie, and more than that, it's a fairy tale: Not since ``Roman
Holiday'' has a film so winningly paired royal and peasant, pixie
queen and common mortal. (Now it's beginning to sound like ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream.'')
</P>
<P>
   As lovers go, William and Anna are a pair to root for. You have
to thank your lucky stars _ both of them _ for a film as warm, as
romantic and as ticklishly festive as the spirited ``Notting
Hill.''

WHERE THERE'S SMOKE, THERE'S NETWORK SPIN 
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK _ Drew Carey nailed what was going on all over New York
City last week, as networks threw shows and parties for
advertisers, and touted their new lineups as the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it always amazing how every year the world gets saved by
a network schedule?'' Carey told the Madison Avenue types asked to
risk millions on new sitcoms and dramas. ``Every year you get so
much smoke (your way) you get cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Every network except UPN and Pax touted how their numbers
clearly showed they are where the advertising dollar should go.
Even those bottom-rung networks trotted out stats supporting their
causes.
</P>
<P>
   Lies, damn lies, statistics and network statistics. CBS ended
the season on top with total viewers, but lagged behind the other
top networks in the key demographic, namely those 18-49.
Demographics, the age/gender/income groupings that advertisers look
for when rates are set and decisions are made on when to buy, trump
total viewership.
</P>
<P>
   This leads to different networks giving different spins, the
most outlandish coming from WB head James Kellner, whose
youth-oriented network skews the youngest of all:
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to be No. 1,'' he said. ``We don't care about
household ratings.''
</P>
<P>
   What a relief. As if he had to worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   It's tough to tell what new shows will be artistic or commercial
successes based on a brief synopsis, a short clip, a cast roster
and a Roget's-load of adjectives the networks offered (I have some
hints, but let's give them a chance). But you can see some trends
developing:
</P>
<P>
   _ Thursday's up for grabs: Smelling blood, the other networks
are going to counter-program on Thursdays, once considered the
unassailable bastion of NBC. This is the night UPN hopes to make
some inroads by bringing the WWF back to network television (it
will also continue to run on USA Network).
</P>
<P>
   _ The ``Providence'' factor: NBC believes
whiter-than-Wonderbread dramas can work on Fridays, which is why
the new ``Cold Feet'' is being paired with ``Providence,'' the
surprise ratings winner of 1999. Meanwhile, Fox is
counter-programming with a pair of new blood-and-guts guy dramas.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spin control: Spinoffs abound next year, including at NBC
(``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit,'' from ``Law &AMP; Order''), Fox
(``Ally,'' from ``Ally McBeal,'' and ``The Time of Your Life,''
from ``Party of Five''), WB (``Angel,'' from ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer'') and UPN (``Mo'Nique,'' from ``Moesha''). ABC has also
added another edition of ``20/20.''
</P>
<P>
   _ In Kelley they trust: David E. Kelley is returning to
``Chicago Hope'' to help revamp the show for CBS. He also has a new
show on ABC, ``Snoops,'' which will be paired on Sundays with his
other drama for the network, the brilliant ``The Practice.''
</P>
<P>
   When Kelley told Fox entertainment head Doug Herzog he wanted to
do a half-hour version of ``Ally McBeal,'' the young exec almost
had a coronary until he realized it was an additional half-hour
show.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how many David E. Kelleys are there?
</P>
<P>
   _ Buy a program: The networks, with the exception of NBC, have
all done some major reshuffling of their lineups. Start studying
now.

VETERANS DESERVE BETTER MEDICAL CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Chauncey Robinson was 32, working as security
guard, when he decided to be all that he could be. He joined the
Army.
</P>
<P>
   His military career turned out to be a bit disappointing. During
basic training in Missouri, he injured his eye. It took stitches.
The Army stuck him at a desk. Then a drill sergeant decided that he
wanted Robinson on KP instead.
</P>
<P>
   If you've been in the service, you might recall your drill
sergeant. In fact, I'm certain you recalls yours as vividly as I
recall mine. As a breed, drill sergeants are not noted for their
conspicuous gentility. This one found Robinson asleep and awakened
him by turning over his bunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit my head against the locker,'' Robinson told me the other
day. ``I went to the medical clinic. They checked my heart and
found out my heart was racing ...
</P>
<P>
   ``They sent me out to a major hospital. Then the chest X-rays
they gave me before my eye operation showed an enlargement of the
heart. So they sent me home. I went to the doctor, and the X-rays
and the EKG and everything showed the same.''
</P>
<P>
   The drill sergeant was admonished. Robinson was honorably
discharged on medical grounds. A doctor at the Albany Medical
Center told him that not only did he have heart problems, but he
also suffered from a panic disorder. Robinson applied for Veterans
Administration disability payments.
</P>
<P>
   That was seven years ago. Robinson is still waiting for an
answer to his application. I talked to somebody in the office of
Rep. Michael McNulty, D-N.Y., who's familiar with this case.
Robinson is legitimate, I was told. All his paperwork is there. The
VA just can't get its act together, is all.
</P>
<P>
   What's disturbing is that Robinson is in no way a unique case. A
federal audit released a few months back revealed that the VA makes
errors in as many as 36 percent of its benefit decisions _ and
that's when the applicants can get those decisions made at all. The
audit indicated that as many as 3 million veterans, their
dependents and survivors are still waiting for $19 billion in
benefits due them.
</P>
<P>
   Much of this seems due to decisions by Congress and the Clinton
administration to starve the VA. At a time when 7.5 million World
War II veterans are deep into old age and need medical care _ and
at a time when veterans of Korea are getting old and the Vietnam
guys are showing signs of mileage _ services are being moved around
and trimmed. Even in fat times.
</P>
<P>
   At the Stratton VA Medical Center in Albany, for example,
funding has been cut by millions. Hundreds of workers have been
laid off, including doctors and nurses. Eighteen months ago, the
hospital needed a $30,000 laser dental drill. It took an employee
auction to help pay for the thing.
</P>
<P>
   So it's probably not surprising that on Memorial Day, veterans
are staging rallies across the country to protest what Washington
politicians are doing to the VA and to the millions of men and
women who risked their lives for their country.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gibney of the Disabled American Veterans is an organizer of
a rally at the Stratton VA Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people don't want this,'' he said. ``Our studies
show that 95 percent of Americans want veterans to get the care
they were promised ... Because veterans have been given such a low
priority in the federal budget, many sick and disabled veterans die
before they're able to access health care or obtain a correct
claims decision ...''
</P>
<P>
   It's just not right, Gibney says.
</P>
<P>
   And it's not.

   TEEN: Missouri lawmakers, with no fanfare, have passed a law
that makes major changes in Missouri's driver's license system. The
change was part of a 262-page bill that won approval on the last
day of the session. If the governor signs it, Missouri will join
two dozen or so other states with graduated driver's license laws.
For kids there is one big gain: they can get a learner's permit at
the age of 15 instead of 15.5 starting Jan. 1, 2001. But they will
have to be 18 to get an unrestricted license, not 16, and will have
to clear several hurdles to do so. Backers say the change is just
common sense, especially since young drivers make up a
disproportionate number of fatalities. Story also includes comments
from parents and kids and what they think about the changes and
what has happened on the issue in Kansas. Will Sentell, Winston

   CHICK: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's
advisory committee on vaccines recommended Thursday that states
make chicken pox vaccinations mandatory for children entering
school or a licensed day care. The new vaccine has been found to be
quite effective. And getting chicken pox is not only no fun, it can
be dangerous. We're trying to get a photo and interview with
parents of a 4-year-old who got chicken pox and developed a strep
infection from it. As a result, the boy now needs a heart valve
replacement. The child is at Children's Mercy Hospital. Graphic.

WORLD OF ART ARISES FROM ABANDONED FACTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30)   (EDs: Photo available on the Wieck database.)

<P>
   NORTH ADAMS, Mass. _ It seemed preposterous a pie-in-the-sky
fantasy as extravagant as it was bizarre. Talk about your old mill
dreams: Turn an abandoned electronics plant in a remote Berkshire
factory town into the country's largest museum for minimalist,
postmodern and conceptual art. Yeah, right.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1986. Now, 13 years later, the naysayers are eating
their words and hoping the rest of the world has a short memory.
MASS MoCA, the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, is now
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The massive arts center, in a 13-acre, 27-building factory
complex in North Adams, Mass., opens to the public Sunday. With
facilities for both the visual and performing arts, MASS MoCA bills
itself as the largest venue of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA is more than an art museum. In fact, it isn't a museum
in the conventional sense at all. It doesn't own any art, and has
no plans of maintaining a permanent collection. MASS MoCA is more
like an interdisciplinary laboratory, designed to foster
collaboration among artists and art forms. The planned programming
is staggering, and includes site-specific artworks, sound-art
installations, multimedia theatrical performances, cutting-edge
animation showings, dance and music concerts, premiere film
screenings even a show of artist-designed billboards.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire arts institutions, including the Clark Art Institute
and Jacob's Pillow, have affiliated themselves with the project, as
have prestigious museums like the Guggenheim Museum in New York and
the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Among the major avante-garde
artists whose work will inaugurate the complex are Robert
Rauschenberg, Joseph Beuys, James Rosenquist and Dan Flavin, as
well as composer Philip Glass, director Robert Wilson and
choreographers Trisha Brown and Bill T. Jones.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA director Joe Thompson sees his museum as a catalyst, a
place where art and artists can throw off sparks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our mission is to be a platform for new work that might not
happen anywhere else,'' Thompson says. ``We don't bring a
collection or assets to the table. We bring time and space.''
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA's great asset and its great promise amount to one
thing: raw space. A ton of it. Generous, affordable space, which
permits art to happen in a way that only large spaces really allow.
Total space available: 700,000 square feet, only about a third of
which is currently in use. Some 120,000 square feet is devoted to
performance spaces, rehearsal studios, fabrication shops and public
areas such as a restaurant. An additional 100,000 square feet is
devoted to exhibition space, in 19 separate galleries.
</P>
<P>
   One of the galleries at MASS MoCA is 40 feet high, with
clerestory windows and both balcony and mezzanine viewing levels.
Another, at more than 100 yards long, is bigger than a football
field. From one vantage point, the visitor can sight through a
series of galleries across a distance spanning the equivalent of
two and a half city blocks. Its large galleries will house
monumental artworks, pieces that weigh a ton or measure a quarter
of a mile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are not a great number of places where the kind of work
that will be shown there can be seen regularly,'' observes Michael
Kimmelman, chief art critic for the New York Times. ``Most urban
centers don't have that much room.''
</P>
<P>
   Space has always been the attraction of the MASS MoCA complex.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a textile factory, the century-old red-brick plant
housed the Sprague Electric Co. from 1942 to 1985. Sprague's
closing devastated North Adams, leaving 4,000 people out of work in
this western Massachusetts city of 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was around the same time that Thomas Krens, the then-director
of the Williams College Art Museum in nearby Williamstown, began to
eye his blue-collar neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   Krens, now director of the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, is a
man of baroque ambitions he set the art world abuzz a couple years
ago by opening an architecturally flamboyant ``branch'' of the
Guggenheim in the Spanish factory town of Bilbao. But his first big
idea was MASS MoCA, which he envisioned would house one of the
world's finest collections of minimalist art in the Sprague plant.
</P>
<P>
   Krens recently explained that around the time Sprague closed, he
had come to the conclusion, ``that contemporary art museums were
insufficient to the task of showing contemporary art. I saw
something in Europe where they had done an exhibition in an old
factory building, and it struck me that North Adams had an old
factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Krens soon left for the notoriety of his current
position, and his protege Thompson was named to head it, the
cockeyed genius of the original vision has remained pretty much
intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability to respond to contemporary culture is a function
of how much space you have,'' Krens said. ``Space leads to
opportunities.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA will allow work to be seen that simply doesn't get too
much exhibit time. Such a work is Joseph Beuys' ``Lightning with
Stag in its Glare,'' a multipiece sculptural installation dominated
by a 22-foot, 2,000-pound bronze abstract form suspended from the
ceiling.
</P>
<P>
   The piece, on loan from the Philadelphia Museum of Art, had been
stored in an abandoned subway station and not exhibited because the
museum didn't have the facilities to show it. In North Adams, it
comfortably and effectively hangs in what is, by MASS MoCA's
standards, a fairly smallish space.
</P>
<P>
   Oversized works have plenty of elbow room in North Adams.
Rosenquist's 160-foot painting ``The Swimmer in the Econo-mist''
gets its own gallery, as does Rauschenberg's ``1/4 Mile or 2
Furlong Piece,'' a visual stream-of-conscious journal of paintings,
prints, sculpture and assemblages that covers the floor and three
walls of the football field-sized Building 5 Gallery. Under the
direction of Rauschenberg himself, a crew of 15 worked the better
part of a week installing this single piece.
</P>
<P>
   Inside MASS MoCA's vast space, the usual rules of engagement at
a museum don't apply. Viewers are surrounded by the oversized
artworks, making it difficult to stand back and take them in
passively.
</P>
<P>
   The philosophy of art as a force rather than an artifact is a
central theme of contemporary artists, but one that's often
misunderstood. MASS MoCA is designed to give the visitor an
opportunity to ``get it.'' Because the museum does not exhibit
traditional paintings or sculpture, there's no competing aesthetic
to distract the viewer, making it somewhat easier to confront the
art that is there on its own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what's displayed makes demands on the viewer's
intellectual imagination: Carl Andre's sculpture of 36 brushed
aluminum floor tiles arranged to create a 54-foot runway in an
otherwise bare gallery, for instance, or Mario Merz's constructions
based on the mathematical symmetry of the Fibonacci series, or
Natalie Jeremijenko's installation of six live maple trees
suspended upside-down over an outdoor courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   MASS MoCA gives the viewer time to get into the mindset of such
work, making it possible to appreciate its conceptual beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson says that to meet expenses he needs to attract 100,000
visitors a year. That's not just to the art shows, but to
everything, including planned pop concerts and polka parties.
</P>
<P>
   As for his art exhibitions, he is guardedly confident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they're up, lit, installed, they become playful and
visual,'' he says of the works. ``They have a real theatrical
quality that, if people have an open mind, they'll warm to.''

 &HT;    DESPITE TIME ELSEWHERE, GORE AND BUSH ARE POLITICAL SONS OF
DIXIE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The longstanding joke about Al Gore was that at
Harvard he took ``Southern'' as a foreign language. But Bob Squier,
a longtime maker of his campaign TV ads, says it has been
impossible to wring the Tennessee twang out of Gore's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Southern boy, no doubt about it,'' Squier said last
week as he accompanied the vice president on part of a three-day
campaign swing through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when George W. Bush came to Washington to work on his
father's campaign for president in 1988, he surprised a lot of the
Beltway ``suits'' by showing up chewing tobacco, a habit he had
cultivated in the oil fields of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush attended Yale University and Harvard Business
School, ``I am a product of the West and I think that way,'' the
second-term Texas governor said in a recent interview with The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was born in Washington, D.C., and Bush on the Yale campus
in New Haven, Conn. Even though their down-home roots have been
questioned, the themes and policies Gore and Bush are developing as
they pursue their parties' 2000 presidential nominations fit the
politics of the modern-day South like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   Both are political centrists, with philosophies of limited or
``reinvented'' government. They are openly religious and support
government cooperation with ``faith-based'' organizations in
attacking social ills. They promote the importance of family,
education and community. They recognize the importance of
technology in the new economy. They are tough on crime. They are
free traders. And they are military hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are battling for the votes of a region that has changed
a lot since 1972, when President Nixon's campaign devised a
racially tinged ``Southern strategy'' for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Southern voters are clearly moving on'' from wedge-issue
politics of pitting a minority, such as blacks, against a fearful
majority, such as Southern whites, said Richard Tafel, executive
director of Log Cabin Republicans, a nationwide group of gay
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the change has come from rapid growth. In 1998, five of
10 fastest growing counties in the nation were in the South. The
other five were in the West. That growth has produced an explosion
of suburbs that are less willing to accept polarizing racial
politics or the moralizing of the GOP's religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs have become the key battleground in national
elections,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC), the centrist organization which Gore helped found
after Walter Mondale's disastrous loss to Ronald Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush ``both have their eyes on the suburbs'' in the
South and the West, said Merle Black, a political science professor
at Emory University and co-author of the 1992 book, ``The Vital
South: How Presidents are Elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to extend the Democratic political inroads that
Clinton made into Republican-leaning suburbs by pressing a
``liveability'' agenda aimed at voters in such cities as Atlanta
and Austin, Texas, that are choking on urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   And following student shootings in suburban schools in Colorado
and Georgia, Gore has touted gun control measures while also
lecturing the entertainment industry about violence in movies and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who faces the prospect that a decades-long Republican
``rising tide'' may be ebbing across the South, is also adjusting
to new political realities as he steps up from statewide candidacy
to a run for national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is at a crossroads,'' said Mark Miller,
executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist
group founded in 1997 and modeled after the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now face a situation similar to that of the Democrats of
the 1980s, who were dominated by a vocal minority from the far-left
liberal wing of their party,'' Miller said.
</P>

 &HT;    DESPITE TIME ELSEWHERE, GORE AND BUSH ARE POLITICAL SONS OF
DIXIE
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The longstanding joke about Al Gore was that at
Harvard he took ``Southern'' as a foreign language. But Bob Squier,
a longtime maker of his campaign TV ads, says it has been
impossible to wring the Tennessee twang out of Gore's voice.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a Southern boy, no doubt about it,'' Squier said last
week as he accompanied the vice president on part of a three-day
campaign swing through the South.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when George W. Bush came to Washington to work on his
father's campaign for president in 1988, he surprised a lot of the
Beltway ``suits'' by showing up chewing tobacco, a habit he had
cultivated in the oil fields of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Though Bush attended Yale University and Harvard Business
School, ``I am a product of the West and I think that way,'' the
second-term Texas governor said in a recent interview with The
Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was born in Washington, D.C., and Bush on the Yale campus
in New Haven, Conn. Even though their down-home roots have been
questioned, the themes and policies Gore and Bush are developing as
they pursue their parties' 2000 presidential nominations fit the
politics of the modern-day South like a glove.
</P>
<P>
   Both are political centrists, with philosophies of limited or
``reinvented'' government. They are openly religious and support
government cooperation with ``faith-based'' organizations in
attacking social ills. They promote the importance of family,
education and community. They recognize the importance of
technology in the new economy. They are tough on crime. They are
free traders. And they are military hawks.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are battling for the votes of a region that has changed
a lot since 1972, when President Nixon's campaign devised a
racially tinged ``Southern strategy'' for his re-election.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even Southern voters are clearly moving on'' from wedge-issue
politics of pitting a minority, such as blacks, against a fearful
majority, such as Southern whites, said Richard Tafel, executive
director of Log Cabin Republicans, a nationwide group of gay
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the change has come from rapid growth. In 1998, five of
10 fastest growing counties in the nation were in the South. The
other five were in the West. That growth has produced an explosion
of suburbs that are less willing to accept polarizing racial
politics or the moralizing of the GOP's religious conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suburbs have become the key battleground in national
elections,'' said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership
Council (DLC), the centrist organization which Gore helped found
after Walter Mondale's disastrous loss to Ronald Reagan in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Bush ``both have their eyes on the suburbs'' in the
South and the West, said Merle Black, a political science professor
at Emory University and co-author of the 1992 book, ``The Vital
South: How Presidents are Elected.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore is trying to extend the Democratic political inroads that
Clinton made into Republican-leaning suburbs by pressing a
``liveability'' agenda aimed at voters in such cities as Atlanta
and Austin, Texas, that are choking on urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   And following student shootings in suburban schools in Colorado
and Georgia, Gore has touted gun control measures while also
lecturing the entertainment industry about violence in movies and
television.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who faces the prospect that a decades-long Republican
``rising tide'' may be ebbing across the South, is also adjusting
to new political realities as he steps up from statewide candidacy
to a run for national office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican Party is at a crossroads,'' said Mark Miller,
executive director of the Republican Leadership Council, a centrist
group founded in 1997 and modeled after the DLC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now face a situation similar to that of the Democrats of
the 1980s, who were dominated by a vocal minority from the far-left
liberal wing of their party,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   That is especially true in the Sunbelt, where religious
conservatives, the driving force in Republican presidential
nominations since 1980, are concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, Bush, while opposing abortion rights, avoids any
suggestion that the U.S. Constitution be amended to abolish
abortions. And unlike his father, who railed against racial
``quotas'' and ``affirmative action,'' the Texas governor advocates
``affirmative access'' _ admission to college based on performance

<P>
   ATLANTA _ After the Cold War, many expected that the world would
enter an era of unprecedented peace and prosperity. Those who live
in developed nations might think this is the case today, with the
possible exception of the war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But at the Carter Center we monitor all serious conflicts in the
world, and the reality is that the number of such wars has
increased dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that the United Nations was designed to deal with
international conflicts, and almost all the current ones are civil
wars in developing countries. This creates a peacemaking vacuum
that is most often filled by powerful nations that concentrate
their attention on conflicts that affect them, like those in Iraq,
Bosnia and Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   While the war in Kosovo rages and dominates the world's
headlines, even more destructive conflicts in developing nations
are systematically ignored by the United States and other powerful
nations.
</P>
<P>
   One can traverse Africa, from the Red Sea in the northeast to
the southwestern Atlantic coast, and never step on peaceful
territory. Fifty thousand people have recently perished in the war
between Eritrea and Ethiopia, and almost 2 million have died during
the 16-year conflict in neighboring Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   That war has now spilled into northern Uganda, whose troops have
joined those from Rwanda to fight in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (formerly Zaire). The other Congo (Brazzaville) is also
ravaged by civil war, and all attempts to bring peace to Angola
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Although formidable commitments are being made in the Balkans,
where white Europeans are involved, no such concerted efforts are
being made by leaders outside of Africa to resolve the disputes.
This gives the strong impression of racism.
</P>
<P>
   Because of its dominant role in the U.N. Security Council and
NATO, the United States tends to orchestrate global peacemaking.
Unfortunately, many of these efforts are seriously flawed. We have
become increasingly inclined to sidestep the time-tested premises
of negotiation, which in most cases prevent deterioration of a bad
situation and at least offer the prospect of a bloodless solution.
</P>
<P>
   Abusive leaders can best be induced by the simultaneous threat
of consequences and the promise of reward _ at least legitimacy
within the international community.
</P>
<P>
   The approach the United States has taken recently has been to
devise a solution that best suits its own purposes, recruit at
least tacit support in whichever forum it can best influence,
provide the dominant military force, present an ultimatum to
recalcitrant parties and then take punitive action against the
entire nation to force compliance.
</P>
<P>
   The often tragic result of this final decision is that already
oppressed citizens suffer, while the oppressor may feel free of
further consequences if he perpetrates even worse crimes. Through
control of the news media, he is often made to seem heroic by
defending his homeland against foreign aggression and shifting
blame for economic or political woes away from himself.
</P>
<P>
   Our general purposes are admirable: to enhance peace, freedom,
democracy, human rights and economic progress. But this flawed
approach is now causing unwarranted suffering and strengthening
unsavory regimes in several countries, including Sudan, Cuba, Iraq
and _ the most troubling example _ Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   There, the international community has admirable goals of
protecting the rights of Kosovars and ending the brutal policies of
Slobodan Milosevic. But the decision to attack the entire nation
has been counterproductive, and our destruction of civilian life
has now become senseless and excessively brutal. There is little
indication of success after more than 25,000 sorties and 14,000
missiles and bombs, 4,000 of which were not precision guided.
</P>
<P>
   The expected few days of aerial attacks have now lengthened into
months, while more than a million Kosovars have been forced from
their homes, many never to return even under the best of
circumstances. As the American-led force has expanded targets to
inhabited areas and resorted to the use of anti-personnel cluster
bombs, the result has been damage to hospitals, offices and
residences of a half-dozen ambassadors, and the killing of hundreds
of innocent civilians and an untold number of conscripted troops.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of focusing on Serbian military forces, missiles and
bombs are now concentrating on the destruction of bridges,
railways, roads, electric power, and fuel and fresh water supplies.
Serbian citizens report that they are living like cavemen, and
their torment increases daily.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that we must save face but cannot change what has
already been done, NATO leaders now have three basic choices: to
continue bombing ever more targets until Yugoslavia (including
Kosovo and Montenegro) is almost totally destroyed, to rely on
Russia to resolve our dilemma through indirect diplomacy, or to
accept American casualties by sending military forces into Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we are following the first, and worst, option _ and seem
to be moving toward including the third. Despite earlier denials by
American and other leaders, the recent decision to deploy a
military force of 50,000 troops on the Kosovo border confirms that
the use of ground troops will be necessary to assure the return of
expelled Albanians to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   How did we end up in this quagmire? We have ignored some basic
principles that should be applied to the prevention or resolution
of all conflicts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Short-circuiting the long-established principles of patient
negotiation leads to war, not peace.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bypassing the Security Council weakens the United Nations and
often alienates permanent members who may be helpful in influencing
warring parties.
</P>
<P>
   _ The exclusion of nongovernmental organizations from
peacemaking precludes vital ``second track'' opportunities for
resolving disputes.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ignoring serious conflicts in Africa and other underdeveloped
regions deprives these people of justice and equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   _ Even the most severe military or economic punishment of
oppressed citizens is unlikely to force their oppressors to yield
to American demands.
</P>
<P>
   _ The United States' insistence on the use of cluster bombs,
designed to kill or maim humans, is condemned almost universally
and brings discredit on our nation (as does our refusal to support
a ban on land mines).
</P>
<P>
   Even for the world's only superpower, the ends don't always
justify the means.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted
every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we
convinced Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo
and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution
advocates of compromise propose today. But it failed last fall.
Milosevic broke his promises, poured more troops into Kosovo,
poised for an offensive he had been planning for months. When it
began, we had to act.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's strategy has been to outlast us by dividing the
alliance. He has failed. Instead of disunity in Brussels, there are
growing signs of disaffection in Belgrade: Serbian soldiers
abandoning their posts, Serbian civilians protesting the policies
of their leader, young men avoiding conscription, prominent Serbs
calling on Milosevic to accept NATO's conditions. Meanwhile, our
air campaign has destroyed or damaged one-third of Serbia's armored
vehicles in Kosovo, half its artillery, most of its ability to
produce ammunition, all its capacity to refine fuel and done
enormous damage to other sectors of its economy. Though he has
driven hundreds of thousands of Kosovar Albanians from their homes,
Milosevic has not eliminated the Kosovar Liberation Army. Indeed,
its ranks are swelling, and it has begun to go on the offensive
against Serb forces hunkered down to hide from air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Now Milosevic faces the certainty of continuing air strikes, the
persistence of the KLA and the prospect of having to answer to his
people for starting an unwinnable conflict that is bringing
military failure and economic ruin. The question now is not whether
his ethnic cleansing will be reversed, but when, and how much of
his military he is willing to see destroyed along the way.
</P>
<P>
   While I do not rule out other military options, we are pursuing
our present strategy for three reasons. First, and most important,
it is working and will succeed in meeting NATO's basic conditions
of restoring the Kosovars to their homes, with Serb forces out of
Kosovo and the deployment of an international security force. This
force must have NATO at its core, which means it must have NATO
command and control and NATO rules of engagement, with special
arrangements for non-NATO countries, just like our force in Bosnia.
Our military campaign will continue until these conditions are met,
not because we are stubborn or arbitrary, but because these are the
only conditions under which the refugees will go home in safety and
under which the KLA have any incentive to disarm _ the basic
requirements of a resolution that will work.
</P>
<P>
   Second, this strategy has broad and deep support in the
alliance, and allows us to meet our objectives. While there may be
differences in domestic circumstances, cultural ties to the Balkans
and ideas on tactics, there is no question about our unity on goals
and our will to prevail. I have worked hard to shape our present
consensus; 60 days into the air campaign, NATO is more unified on
Kosovo than it was at the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Third, this strategy gives us the best opportunity to meet our
goals in a way that strengthens, not weakens, our fundamental
interest in a long-term, positive relationship with Russia. Russia
is now helping to work out a way for Belgrade to meet our
conditions. Russian troops should participate in the force that
will keep the peace in Kosovo, turning a source of tension into an
opportunity for cooperation, like our joint effort in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, we must remember that the reversal of ethnic cleansing
in Kosovo is not sufficient to end ethnic conflict in the Balkans
and establish lasting stability. The European Union and the United
States must do for southeastern Europe what we did for Western
Europe after World War II and for Central Europe after the Cold
War. Freedom, respect for minority rights, and prosperity are
powerful forces for progress. They give people goals to work for;
they elevate hope over fear and tomorrow over yesterday. We can do
that by rebuilding struggling economies, encouraging trade and
investment and helping the nations of the region join NATO and the
European Union. Already, the region's democracies are responding to
the pull of integration by sticking with their reforms, taking in
refugees and supporting NATO's campaign. A democratic Serbia that
respects the rights of its people and its neighbors can and should
join them. If it does, we will help to restore it to its rightful
place as a European state in the Balkans, not a balkanized state at
the periphery of Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The Balkans are not fated to be the heart of European darkness,
a region of bombed mosques, men and boys shot in the back, young
women raped, all traces of group and individual history rewritten
or erased. Just as leaders took their people down that road,
leaders must take them back to a better tomorrow. Ultimately, we
and our allies can help make this happen, if we stick with NATO's
campaign and follow through with a strategy to ensure that the
forces pulling southeastern Europe together are stronger than the
forces tearing it apart.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We are in Kosovo with our allies to stand for a
Europe, within our reach for the first time, that is peaceful,
undivided and free. And we are there to stand against the greatest
remaining threat to that vision: instability in the Balkans, fueled
by a vicious campaign of ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is not simply ethnic hatred, or even ethnic
conflict. The people of the former Yugoslavia have lived together
for centuries with greater and lesser degrees of conflict, but not
the constant ``cleansing'' of peoples from their land. Had they
experienced nothing but that, their nations would be homogenous
today, not endlessly diverse.
</P>
<P>
   The intolerable conditions the region finds itself in today are
the result of a decadelong campaign by Slobodan Milosevic to build
a greater Serbia by singling out whole peoples for destruction
because of their ethnicity and faith. The brutal methods are
familiar now. Spreading hate in the media. Killing moderate
leaders. Arming paramilitaries and ordering soldiers to conduct
planned campaigns of murder and expulsion. Eradicating the culture,
the heritage, the very record of the presence of his victims.
Refugees are not a byproduct of the fighting he has initiated; the
fighting is designed to create refugees. We are haunted by the
images of people driven from their homes, pushing the elderly in
wheelbarrows, telling stories of relatives murdered.
</P>
<P>
   We saw this for the first time in Croatia and in Bosnia. The
international community responded at first with a studied
neutrality that equated victims with aggressors; it followed with
diplomacy and the deployment of unarmed peacekeepers with the
mandate, but not the means, to protect civilians. By the time NATO
acted, 250,000 people were dead, more than two million displaced,
and many have still not returned. People will look back on Kosovo
and say that this time, because we acted soon and forcefully
enough, more lives were saved and the refugees all came home. The
Balkan conflict that began 10 years ago in Kosovo will have ended
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   We cannot respond to such tragedies everywhere, but when ethnic
conflict turns into ethnic cleansing where we can make a
difference, we must try, and that is clearly the case in Kosovo.
Had we faltered, the result would have been a moral and strategic
disaster. The Kosovars would have become a people without a
homeland, living in difficult conditions in some of the poorest
countries in Europe, overwhelming new democracies. The Balkan
conflict would have continued indefinitely, posing a risk of a
wider war and of continuing tensions with Russia. NATO itself would
have been discredited for failing to defend the very values that
give it meaning. Those who say Kosovo is too small to be of great
importance forget these simple facts.
</P>
<P>
   When the violence in Kosovo began in early 1998, we exhausted
every diplomatic avenue for a settlement. Last October, we
convinced Milosevic that he should withdraw some forces from Kosovo
and allow an unarmed international presence. That is the solution

RECORDING INDUSTRY GIVES WAGNER'S `RING' DESERVED ATTENTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ALLAN ULRICH  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ You've finally done it, and now you're having
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   You've invested a month's rent in tickets for the San Francisco
Opera's production of Wagner's ``Der Ring des Nibelungen'' (the
four cycles run June 9 to July 3 at the War Memorial Opera House),
and since you've made four lengthy evenings worth of commitment, a
great adventure in anybody's musical life, you want to derive the
maximum pleasure without taking out another loan.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the record industry is ready to oblige; a complete
``Ring'' spreads over 14 compact discs, and you should own one that
takes advantage of contemporary technology. Historical recordings
of the ``Ring'' are another matter. Some are most illuminating, but
sonics and pitch accuracy vary and, because they are published by
independent companies, these sets are often hard to find, even in
the biggest stores.
</P>
<P>
   If you've already blown the budget, spend at least $25 more and
get ``Der Ring des Nibelungen _ An Introduction'' on two mid-price
Decca/London CDs (443 581), originally recorded in 1967. The late
musicologist Deryck Cooke delivers a no-nonsense, unfailingly
pertinent analysis of Wagner's tangled skein of leitmotifs and
their transformation throughout the four operas. The booklet
reprints the 193 musical quotations Cooke highlights and musical
excerpts are drawn from the complete Vienna Philharmonic/Georg
Solti recording.
</P>
<P>
   As for complete ``Ring'' recordings, the most recent arrival _
EMI Classics CDZN-72731 _ is also one of the greatest bargains in
the catalog; you should pay no more than $99 for it. This is the
soundtrack of an NHK video production by Nikolaus Lehnhoff (the
original director of the San Francisco ``Ring''), taped in Munich
in 1993. Heading the cast are Hildegard Behrens (Brunnhilde), Julia
Varady (a most touching Sieglinde), Rene Kollo (Siegfried) and
American Robert Hale (Wotan/The Wanderer).
</P>
<P>
   Wolfgang Sawallisch conducts the Bavarian State Orchestra
solidly and idiomatically, in a manner that suggests he's more
storyteller than philosopher, and the few sound effects shouldn't
disconcert anyone.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, at this price, EMI has economized by omitting a copy of
the Wagner libretto. You will need one, if only to understand how
he uses Stabreim, an archaic German alliterative device, as a major
element in his prosody.
</P>
<P>
   The most economical solution is Andrew Porter's superb singing
translation (in Norton paperback, with the original on facing
pages), which has been used by opera companies from London to
Seattle. If you're looking for something more elaborate, there's
Rudolf Sabor's translation and analysis in five (one for each
opera, one for the ``Ring'' as a whole) beautifully designed and
illustrated Phaidon paperbacks, available separately.
</P>
<P>
   Wagnerites who want to splurge on a more costly ``Ring'' will
find three contenders selling in stores for virtually the same
price, in the $170 (mid-price) range.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran Wagnerites would probably choose the Philips (20325),
recorded during 1966-67 performances at the prestigious Bayreuth
Festival and conducted by Karl Bohm. The album spotlights the
foremost Brunnhilde and Siegfried of their time, Birgit Nilsson and
Wolfgang Windgassen, who, when heard in live conditions, always
excelled their studio efforts. Leonie Rysanek's ardent Sieglinde,
screams and all, is a major plus. The casting is uneven, Bohm
doesn't rise to the heights until ``Siegfried,'' but the unique
blend of voice and orchestra possible at Wagner's own festival hall
is something everyone should experience.
</P>
<P>
   Recently remastered digitally in the ``Originals;; Series
(Deutsche Grammophon 457 780), the illustrious Berlin
Philharmonic/Herbert von Karajan) ``Ring'' (taped piecemeal in the
late 1960s) offers the most luscious and balanced orchestral
account of any set, and the beautifully textured ``Das Rheingold''
is terrific by any standards. This is not, pace contemporary
commentators, a chamber music ``Ring.'' Yet, after ``Die Walkure''
(starring Regine Crespin, Join Vickers and Gundula Janowitz), the
singing from Siegfrieds Jess Thomas and Helge Brilioth and
Brunnhilde Helga Dernesch simply can't compare with the best of its
generation.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Georg Solti's best-selling Vienna Philharmonic
``Ring'' (London 14100, and stretched to 15 CDs). The project,
launched in 1959, introduced three of the operas in stereo. Kirsten
Flagstad (the ``Rheingold'' Fricka), Nilsson, Windgassen and Hans
Hotter (Wotan) were all titanic Wagnerians. But Solti's
overemphasis often precludes lyricism and poetry. Yet, in the
absence of another, it's the ``Ring'' on which an entire generation
was weaned.
</P>
<P>
   In the most expensive category, the DG Metropolitan Opera studio
version of the ``Ring'' is, foremost, a tribute to the world-class
orchestra artistic director James Levine has built over the past 25
years, and it does feature James Morris, who will sing Wotan again
in San Francisco. As a statement of the score, it's a glorious
effort, stately and sonorous. As music drama, however, it's a bit
chilly for this taste, and the singing can be spotty.
</P>
<P>
   Behrens is more interesting with Sawallisch, and nobody should
be forced to listen to Gary Lakes' Siegmund.
</P>
<P>
   Also at top price, but with the components available separately,
is Daniel Barenboim's Bayreuth set, taped (and shot for video) in
1991. Harry Kupfer's production was controversial, but Barenboim
seems more alert to the implications of the music drama than any
recorded conductor in decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Brunnhilde _ Anne Evans, who was a disaster here as Elsa 20
years ago _ is warm and lyrical. Siegfried Jerusalem is an
intensely involved hero, and John Tomlinson delivers an incisive
Wotan.
</P>
<P>
   The live ambience and sense of risk-taking is powerful.
</P>
<P>
   But you, the listener, will take no risks by acquiring ``The
Anna Russell Album'' (Sony MDK 47252), wherein that paragon of
musical enlightenment dispatches her hilarious analysis of the
``Ring.'' Russell does it all in under 22 insightful minutes.

STEWART SHOOTS FOR DAILY DOUBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Winning the Indianapolis 500 has been a lifelong
dream for Tony Stewart, a homegrown Hoosier from Rushville. But
Stewart's budding NASCAR Winston Cup career and his commitment to
drive the No. 20 Home Depot Pontiac for car owner Joe Gibbs at the
Coca-Cola 600 in Charlotte, N.C., Sunday posed a conflict with his
desire to drive his own car in the 83d Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   Until Gibbs came up with a solution: Why not drive in both
races?
</P>
<P>
   ``When I signed my contract with him two years ago, Joe actually
was the one that brought up the Indianapolis 500,'' said Stewart,
28. ``I didn't even bring it up. He said, `I know how much of a
dream it is for you to run Indy, and I want you to be able to do
that as long as you like to.' So I guess that's what his
involvement is; it's his willingness to let me come here and run
this race.''
</P>
<P>
   With Gibbs's blessing and support, Stewart will attempt to run a
grueling marathon by driving in both the Indy 500 during the
afternoon and the Coca-Cola 600 that evening. Talk about May
Madness. CART driver Robby Gordon and Roberto Moreno will also pull
double duty this weekend by driving in the Motorola 300 CART race
in Madison, Ill., then starting in the Indy 500.
</P>
<P>
   But their whirlwind weekend will not compare to Stewart's, who
will attempt to turn his double play on the same day.
</P>
<P>
   Come Sunday, Stewart will pilot the No. 22 Home Depot
Aurora-powered Dallara he co-owns with Tri-Sports Motorsports
partners Larry Curry and Andy Card and start 24th in the 33-car
Indy field. Barring unforeseen circumstances, Stewart will climb
out of his Indy car after completing 500 miles, fly by charter jet
to Charlotte, climb into his Winston Cup car, start from the rear
of the field, and drive another 600 miles.
</P>
<P>
   Total mileage for the day: 1,100.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be honest, I don't know how difficult it's going to be,''
said Stewart, who sucessfully completed a dry run last weekend when
he overcame a one-hour rain delay, qualified for Indy with a
four-lap average of 220.653 miles per hour, then flew to Charlotte,
where he won The Winston Open qualifying race and finished second
to Terry Labonte in The Winston all-star race. ``Because I've never
done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   The last driver to run both races was John Andretti in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But Stewart would be the first to complete all 1,100 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty worried when I went to bed Saturday night,''
recalled Andretti, who finished 10th in the 1994 Indy 500, then
flew by private jet to Charlotte and, though he qualified ninth,
was forced to start at the rear of the field because he was unable
to attend a mandatory drivers' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Andretti wound up 36th when he dropped out after 220 laps with a
cracked shaft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weird thing was, I usually go to bed worrying about the
race car,'' Andretti said. ``That night, all I worried about was
the weather. I was worried that it might rain in Indianapolis and
it might not rain in Charlotte. A rain delay in Indy was going to
make it really tough to make the start of the race in Charlotte. A
rain delay in Charlotte, at least at the start, was going to make
it a little easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I woke up Sunday morning and saw the sun shining in
Indianapolis, I was pretty relieved. I knew then we could pull it
off and get everything done. We could run all day at Indianapolis
and still have time to make the race at Charlotte. Once I saw that
sunshine, race day became the easiest part of the whole deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the weather. It can be unpredictable in these parts at this
time of year.
</P>
<P>
   When Stewart awoke last Saturday morning for pole day at Indy,
he was greeted by rainy skies which caused a one-hour delay in the
start of time trials. It was an hour Stewart, already on a tight
schedule, could not afford to lose.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, Stewart drew the No. 2 spot in the qualifying
lineup and was the second to take the track for a qualifying
attempt and first to make the field. He wasted little time in
departing Indy, driving a police-escorted van to the airport, where
Gibbs's private jet was waiting to whisk him to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   He was airborne at 12:50 p.m., just 40 minutes before Curry's
self-imposed deadline of 1:30.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude about his whole two weeks is that it's going to be
an unforgettable two weeks of my life that I've enjoyed
thoroughly,'' Stewart said. ``So I'm just enjoying it right now.''
</P>
<P>
   But pole day was just one obstacle with which Stewart and Curry,
his former chief engineer at Team Menard, were forced to contend
when they arrived at Indy. First, Stewart had to win a court
decision over his former IRL car owner, John Menard, who filed suit
claiming Stewart was still contractually obligated to drive for him
at Indy.
</P>
<P>
   Then, last Thursday during a late-afternoon practice run,
Stewart crashed his primary car, slapping the wall between Turns 3
and 4 and causing light damage to the right side. A year ago, he
had been a moody sort who wouldn't have had the patience to explain
his blunder to the media, but he was a changed man _ humble,
contrite, and yes, even patient _ when he arrived at the trackside
conference room.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm definitely still hard on myself,'' he said. ``I guess I'm
still a driver in training to a certain degree. I definitely didn't
win any Mr. Congeniality awards last year by any means, and I
apologize for acting like that. My team and my engineer give me 100
percent, and I want to give them 100 percent back.''
</P>
<P>
   It is but a small price to pay for a boyhood dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of races that are important to me that I still
want to try and win in my lifetime,'' Stewart said. ``But I would
say that if I could only guarantee that I was going to win one of
them, this would be the one that I would pick. You know, it's the
most important race of my life.''

   ``His older brother Tommy hit the ball so hard, we used to call
him `Tommy Gun,' '' said Harvard coach Dave Fish. ``When little
James came along, he was a half-pint, so they nicknamed him `Squirt
Gun.' And he went from `Squirt Gun' to being the No. 1 player in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``As he gained some height, he began practicing with Mats
Wilander (who resides in Greenwich, Conn.), and (Wilander) started
telling people, `Hey, this kid is the real deal.' ''

   Cooking under pressure
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, facing an opponent against whom he had split two
previous meetings, Blake jumped out to a 4-0 lead, then struggled
and found the first set tied, 4-4, before closing it out. He
trailed three times in the second set, including at 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't fret or falter, battling to force the tiebreaker,
then beating Bohaboy with an array of dazzling serves and passing
shots.
</P>
<P>
   In his first-round match, Blake beat Asaf Tishler of Nevada-Las
Vegas, the 33d-ranked player in the world, 6-2, 6-3, in one hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He controls the points,'' said Tishler. ``He doesn't let you
have an opportuntity to become more aggressive and control the
point. You are on the defensive side on every point. He hits the
ball really hard on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   The challenge this week is monumental. Should Blake win in
singles, he must also play a fourth-round contest. He also has a
final exam scheduled here.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the player who once considered himself a brat has been
composed throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ``One tournament isn't going to make or break my year,'' said
Blake. ``I feel like I've proven myself and reached my goals
throughout the year, so if I have an off week at the NCAA
tournament and don't play well, it's not going to be the end of the
world. I know I still proved I played my hardest. That's the only
thing I can guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, the better James does, the more humble he is,''
said Barker. ``At each step, when he's done something great, he has
become more mellow and more and more humble. What's interesting is
that most kids are the exact opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A showcase and a decision
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of his showing in the NCAA tournament, the
6-foot-1-inch, 155-pound Blake will continue to be a focal point of
tennis after the season.
</P>
<P>
   He has been named to the US Davis Cup team as a practice partner
and will help the team prepare to face Australia July 16-18 at
Longwood Cricket Club in Brookline, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``James has an extremely great future in men's tennis; he is one
of the most promising American prospects,'' said US Davis Cup coach
Tom Gullickson. ``He's very athletic on the court. He's a very
difficult shotmaker. He has a good mind for tennis. He's very
composed on the court, which I like a lot. I think he's only going
to get better as he plays higher levels of competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a little bit of a late bloomer. For his age, he doesn't
have a terrific amount of experience at the higher levels of
competition. To expose James to the Davis Cup team, the Davis Cup
atmosphere, the best players in the world there, will be terrific
for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Blake said that following the tournament, he will
announce whether he will forgo his final two seasons of college
eligibility and turn professional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping to try to make a decision early to be fair to all
the people involved, the coaches here and agents and everyone
else,'' said Blake. ``My brother has told me it's another big step,
where everyone is a really tough player and they're all fighting
for a living, so they have that added level of intensity. You have
to be ready to fight in every match you're in.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely a tough decision. I'm having such a great time
here. But luckily, the good thing about this school is that they
have a policy where you can come back at any time; once you're
accepted, you're accepted forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do decide to leave, I would love to put some money away
and come back here whenever I decided to quit playing tennis. If I
feel like there's not much I can do at the college level and there
aren't too many people coming back who can push me to that next
level in college, then I might have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Blast from past
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Blake began teaching clinics at the Trumbull
club and encountered a 10-year-old Barker described as ``a
nightmare.'' Blake wanted to take the youngster under his wing, but
after a few lessons, the boy turned on Blake and yelled, ``You
jerk. I don't want you to teach me. You're an idiot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``James didn't know what to do,'' said Barker. ``He wanted the
kid to like him. He wanted to do a good job. He wanted us to ask
him to teach again. He looked at me and said, `Brian, what do you
do to a kid like this?' And I said, `James, you're now me, and that
kid was you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I was probably that bad when I was that little and
Brian said I was five times worse,'' said Blake. ``That was one of
the things that kept me in the learning process, learning how to be
humble and act like a sportsman on the court and not a pain. I
didn't feel like dealing with those kids, and I'm sure no one felt
like dealing with me.''

PHOTO EXHIBIT EXPOSES THE SPLENDOR OF THE WILDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAVID BONETTI  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Carleton Watkins (1829-1916) is widely regarded
as the finest American landscape photographer of the 19th century;
many judge him to have been the most important photographer to have
worked in Northern California.
</P>
<P>
   And considering the competition in that category _ Edward Weston
and his sons, Imogen Cunningham, Dorothea Lange, Ansel Adams, John
Gutmann, to name the most prominent _ that's saying something.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until the 1980s, Watkins' achievement _ his photographs of
Yosemite were so astonishing that they directly contributed to its
early designation as a national park _ went widely unacknowledged.
Even now in the broader world interested in photography, his name
doesn't resonate fully.
</P>
<P>
   So, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art retrospective,
``Carleton Watkins: The Art of Perception,'' which continues
through Sept. 7, aims to finally give Watkins his due. That the
show will travel to the Metropolitan Museum in New York and the
National Gallery in Washington, guarantees that it will receive the
national audience it deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition looks splendid installed in the museum's
loft-like, fifth-floor galleries, miraculously transformed by wall
colors and moldings into a 19th century salon. It includes more
than 150 of Watkins' images, both the mammoth plates (up to
18-by-22 inches) that brought him fame and the stereo views that
entered almost every middle-class American home. At the end of the
galleries, banks of computers simulate the stereo viewing
experience.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, the show is extraordinarily persuasive of
Watkins' originality and talent.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Douglas R. Nickel, the museum's associate curator
of photography, the exhibition comes with a thesis. Nickel, who
wrote an impressively erudite essay for the catalog (Abrams, $60,
hardbound; $34.95 paper), says Watkins was a modernist involved in
creating ``an art of perception'' in his work, which, in his mind,
he made for frankly commercial purposes.
</P>
<P>
   If I understand him correctly, what Nickel means by ``an art of
perception'' is the new way of seeing that came into being in the
19th century _ evident in work of French artists such as Edgar
Degas as well as in Watkins' _ in which pure opticality replaced
the more narrative or symbolic mode of representation that
previously prevailed. The camera's objective, non-hierarchical,
non-picturesque vision, was crucial to this new way of looking, and
Watkins responded to his medium's demands intuitively.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Watkins, who was uneducated in art and theory, said
about his practice merely that he sought ``the spot which would
give the best view.'' And the exhibition demonstrates that again
and again Watkins had a knack for finding exactly that right spot.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins remains best known for his Yosemite pictures, which
still strike us as filled with awe for an untrammeled wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   In these pictures, Yosemite appears to be the handiwork of a
rather stern and theatrical deity _ even if Watkins' intention was
merely to go about getting what was to his eye the best view, which
would guarantee him success in the fierce competition of selling
images.
</P>
<P>
   (While Watkins might have been an unconscious genius as an
image-maker, he was a dramatic failure as a businessman. He lost
his gallery and all his negatives to a rival in the bank panic of
1875. In the 1890s, he and his family ended up living in a boxcar,
until his childhood friend, railroad tycoon Collis Huntington,
bailed him out.)
</P>
<P>
   The story of Watkins' Yosemite treks verges on the heroic. A
young man from Oneonta, N.Y., who came to California looking for
fortune during the Gold Rush, Watkins fell into taking photographs
by chance. But in 1861, he dragged a wagon full of cumbersome
equipment through the still roadless Yosemite Valley in order to
make pictures of the natural wonderland that was the subject of
much mythologizing in California cities.
</P>
<P>
   Watkins used the wet-negative process, and the large glass
plates that served as negatives had to be kept evenly wet with
collodion medium while taking the picture and during its subsequent
development. Then, after image-capturing was completed, the glass
negatives had to be brought back to San Francisco for printing.
Needless to say, the possibility of breakage was very real.
</P>
<P>
   But the results of that first trip _ he ultimately visited
Yosemite eight times _ at least 30 mammoth plates and 100
stereographs, galvanized the world. East Coast philosophers,
preachers and professors, including Oliver Wendell Holmes, were
awed by Watkins' achievement, and in 1864, largely on the evidence
of Watkins' photographs, President Abraham Lincoln signed
legislation protecting Yosemite from development. By 1867, Watkins
won a bronze medal at the Paris International Exposition for
landscape photography.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although photography's subsequent technological development
means that we have to work a bit to appreciate the
unprecedentedness of what Watkins did, the Yosemite pictures remain
awesome. Not only did Watkins capture the big picture, the best
view he spoke about as his goal, he also created images in which
details speak. The shimmering light off turned-over leaves, the
sparkle of water, the hardness of rock are all plainly evident in
these great pictures.
</P>
<P>
   But Watkins' greatest works might be those that show the steady
encroachment of civilization on the wilderness. His photographs,
some of them multiple- panel panoramas, of San Francisco, Salt Lake
City and Portland, Ore., are riveting documents.

KING FINDING TRINIDAD, DAD A HARD SELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN _ It is difficult these days, but Don King is trying.
He is trying to sell the paying public a fighter he believes is the
best welterweight in the world. The fighter is not named Oscar De
La Hoya, so it is a tough sell anywhere but here, in a ballroom at
the El San Juan Hotel not far from where the fighter grew up.
</P>
<P>
   King is trying with all the bombast and bluster he can muster,
which is considerable under any circumstance but more so under
trying ones. But it is trying to try so hard for someone who
doesn't seem to understand what you are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   Selling is something that comes naturally to King, as natural as
the rocketry of his hairdo. Closing the deal is his specialty, and
this he thought he had done for Felix Trinidad, the International
Boxing Federation champion who will defend his title Saturday night
in front of a packed house at Roberto Clemente Coliseum and before
a cable TV audience in the United States expected to be
considerably smaller than the one that watched De La Hoya a week
ago.
</P>
<P>
   King has brought The Fighter Nobody Knows and his father a
guaranteed $8 million purse to fight De La Hoya next; they have
never made more than $3 million before (and usually less than $1
million). And he has brought them the head of the man they insist
will be rendered unconscious if the two meet in the ring Sept. 18.
</P>
<P>
   King has done his job, working to make more out of a fighter
than the fighter has made of himself, although admittedly, the
promoter stands to pick up $2.5 million plus $6 per household for
every pay-per-view home over 850,000 that watches Trinidad-De La
Hoya _ if he can just get father and son to sign the piece of paper
in his pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That is the sticking point. The piece of paper and the numbers
on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the fight,'' Trinidad (34-0, 29 KOs) insists as he sips
cold water and then hot coffee with warm milk. ``If you told me the
father of Oscar De La Hoya doesn't want him to fight me, I would
believe you. But my father wants the fight. This problem is just
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will we fight on Sept. 18? That is up to Don King. That is up
to Bob Arum. We have been very flexible. Very flexible.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ask King, Trinidad's father has been about as flexible as
a block of cement. First he insisted on $500,000 in training
expenses to work at the same gym his son has always worked at, a
gym in Puerto Rico that looks like no one has put $50 into
preserving it, let alone $500,000. Lately, the father has reduced
the demand to $350,000, to which King shakes his head in
bewilderment and then laughs a laugh that carries more menace than
merriment.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not the real problem. When King got Arum to up the
ante from $10 million to $10.5 million while also lowering the
required pay-per-view sales from 1 million to 850,000 before
Trinidad and King begin to share equally in the revenue, Trinidad's
father still refused to sign because the promoter kept the extra
$500,000.
</P>
<P>
   King claims he is entitled to a $3 million promotional fee but
has cut it by $500,000 and is willing to share any upside of
pay-per-view sales even though ``that is my money. He wants the
guaranteed money, so I get the overage if there is any. That's the
promoter's gamble. I'm willing to share it, but Don Felix don't get
it. I can deal with treachery, man. It's abject ignorance that
gives me trouble. But I will work this out.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, people close to the promotion say, King and Don
Felix were ``working it out'' at about 200 decibels. It was not the
kind of business discussion you expect among partners on the cusp
of splitting $10.5 million plus an upside, but this is boxing,
where fighting is the point.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, the fighter sits tranquil, refusing to make
any demands on his father. Instead, he struggles to make 147
pounds, a weight that in recent fights has been a stiffer opponent
than the men in front of him, and concentrates on the challenge, a
young man with no chance named Hugo Pineda.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects much from Pineda even though he has only one
loss, and that was against former junior welterweight champion
Kostya Tszyu, a man Pineda knocked down but couldn't knock out.
Considering that Trinidad has been knocked down five times in his
career, that might be a concern to some, but not to Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I am the best welterweight in the world,'' he declares
regally, sounding the way people who have grown up with money all
their lives do when they talk about paying the bills. ``I know I
have to win Saturday night to show the people that I am the best
pound-for-pound fighter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I already know this, but the fight with De La Hoya is a fight
the world wants, so I am ready to do it. But I don't believe he
wants to fight me. He knows what will come. He knows he will visit
the canvas.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does know this, De La Hoya has a good way of hiding his
fears. He is the one who ordered Arum to give Trinidad the $10
million his father first demanded to make the fight. Now Don Felix
has it but says it's not enough to put his son in with an opponent
he claims will visit the canvas not long after the first bell
tolls. King hears this and shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   He is incongruous! He is amazed! He is stupefied and mortified!
He's also mad as can be, but he's trying not to show it.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid that, he's doing something else. He's selling his
fighter. Or at least his fighter's fruit juice.
</P>
<P>
   It is a hot day in San Juan, but it is always hot where King
stands, so he is unfazed by the wilting humidity or the melting
television lights bathing him and Trinidad in sweat. King is not
fixated on the heat of the moment or the heat with Don Felix now.
</P>
<P>
   He's fixated on the camera and on the tiny box he is holding in
front of it as Trinidad speaks. It is time to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a refreshing drink that will make you think!'' King is
shouting as he waves a box of Tito's Punch. ``So drink it now!''
</P>
<P>
   As King roars and young Trinidad smiles, Don Felix sits in the
corner wearing a business suit and a frown. As he glowers, Don King
wishes for only one thing.
</P>
<P>
   He wishes Don Felix would try a drink that makes him think.
Before it's too late.

LOOK AT PORTFOLIOS AS ONE, THEN CREATE PERFECT BALANCE

   Q. My husband and I notice that most people who write to you
share our problem _ asset allocation. We are in our late 30s and
early 40s and plan to retire when we are 62 and 65. We both
contribute 15 percent of our pretax salaries to 401(k) plans; I
work part time and am able to contribute approximately $2,600 a
year and my husband now can max out at $10,000 a year. My husband's
plan invests through American Funds family, and 50 percent of his
contributions go to Washington Mutual Investors (large-cap domestic
stocks), 20 percent to New Perspective (global stocks) a like
amount to Investment Co. of America (large-cap US and foreign
stocks), and 10 percent to Income Fund of America (balanced). His
other options are Europacific Growth, an income fund, and a money
market fund. My 401(k) is 50 percent invested in Vanguard Index
500, 30 percent is in Janus Balanced, and I have 10 percent each in
Janus Worldwide and T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth. The other options
are a guaranteed interest fund, Harbor Bond, Vanguard Windsor II,
T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock, and Janus Overseas funds. What do
you suggest?
</P>
<P>
   R.V., San Diego
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, both of you have done much better than the average
401(k) investor. I think there are a few things, though, that you
can do to improve the balance. First, both of you have chosen
global funds _ New Perspective and Janus Worldwide _ to diversify
into overseas stocks. That diversification is fine, but by choosing
world stock funds rather than international stocks, you have to
some extent duplicated your large-cap domestic stock position _
according to the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports, New Perspective
fund has 43 percent of its portfolio in US stocks, while Janus
Worldwide has 30 percent. By switching to Europacific Growth and
Janus Overseas, you will get 100 percent international stocks in
those segments of the portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the way I would handle the overall situation: Your 401(k)
has a broader selection of funds, and I suggest you lump the two
portfolios together in your minds so you can take advantage of
that. You might consider creating what appears to be an unbalanced
portfolio in your 401(k), but one which will, when combined with
your husband's, turn out to be in perfect balance.
</P>
<P>
   Between the two of you, I would suggest 50 percent in domestic
large caps and 12 1/2 percent each in T. Rowe Price Mid-Cap Growth,
T. Rowe Price Small-Cap Stock, either Janus Balanced or Income Fund
of America, and either Europacific Growth or Janus Overseas. Don't
be daunted by the lowly two-star Morningstar rating for the Price
Small-Cap Stock fund _ that rating reflects the woes of the
small-cap sector as much as the fund's performance. Over the long
haul, the fund has been a solidly above-average performer in its
peer group, and given your long-term investment time frame you
should be willing to wait for the small cap sector to finally wake
up and likely far outperform its larger peers.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I left my job in 1993 at age 50, I left my 401(k)
account with the firm. The money was earning very little, so in
June 1994 I rolled over the $111,508 account into an IRA with
Fortis investments. As of April 1, it had a $183,692 balance. I
also have an IRA invested in a large cap growth fund, now worth
$6,995. During the past five years I have moved money from one fund
to another, based on returns. I do not receive guidance from my
account representative. I would like to retire at age 65, and am
making prepayments on my home mortgage so it will be paid off by
then. My current occupation provides sporadic income, and I have a
money market account to provide for month-to-month expenses. My
current allocation for the rollover IRA is: $24,514 in asset
allocation, $28,280 in global growth, $5,251 in aggressive growth,
$44,799 in growth and income, $19,099 in global asset allocation,
$53,257 in a Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 Index fund, $4,078 in mid-cap
stock, and the rest in a fixed account earning 4.67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   S.D., Laguna Niguel, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   A. My guess is that through your various moves over the past
five years you've probably cost yourself some money. Calculating
your returns over 58 months, I get a 10.86 percent average annual
portfolio return. Not bad in many markets, but you were operating
in an almost unremitting bull market during that period; according
to Morningstar Mutual Funds, the average domestic stock fund
returned a little more than 16 percent a year over the 5 years; the
Standard and Poor's 500 index had average annual return in excess
of 26.5 percent for the period. In fact, had you simply put your
money in the very conservative Fortis Asset Allocation fund back in
June of '94, you'd have done better, with Lipper Analytical
Services Inc. reporting a 118.03 percent total return for the fund
during the five years from May 12, 1994 through May 13, 1999. My
suggestion is to stop churning yourself _ select a solid long-term
portfolio that suits your needs and appetite for risk and stick
with it. There's no need to leave Fortis to do this; just stop
chasing Thursday's highest-performing funds.
</P>
<P>
   If you achieve average 10 percent returns during the next nine
years, the combined value of your IRA and the 401(k) would be
$449,695. If such a sum were then invested to produce an income
stream, you could expect about $29,250 a year, presuming an average
6.5 percent yield from a fixed-income portfolio. If you will
qualify for Social Security benefits, you don't seem to be in very
tough condition. But there are two unpleasant factors to think
about, both involving inflation. The first is the fact that a
$29,250 income stream in the year 2008 would have the buying power
of only about $21,465 in today's money, presuming average 3.5
percent inflation. The second is that you should leave some of your
retirement savings invested in stocks after you retire, so as to
provide capital growth.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds to me as though you've been relying entirely on that
old 401(k). You don't give much information about your current
income or finances, except that income is irregular. I suggest you
begin a program to augment your retirement savings; even if you
have to start at a modest level, the critical thing is to adopt a
savings discipline and stick to it.

STEVENS EXPECTS LOUD FINISH ABOARD REAL QUIET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Jockey Gary Stevens is heading to England to ride on a
regular basis, but he'll keep an appointment in Boston first.
Stevens will ride 4-5 morning line favorite Real Quiet in
Saturday's $600,000 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs, with a
post of 5:40 p.m., then catch a 7:20 flight from Logan to Heathrow
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   Since Stevens is committed to ride for British trainer Michael
Stoute at least through November, this could be his last race in
the United States for some time. And Stevens intends to exit by way
of the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Real Quiet rates right up there with the best horses I've
ridden,'' said Stevens, 36. ``He's a great athlete with tons of
ability. Unfortunately, he had some setbacks at the end of his
3-year-old season. He had a chronic problem with body soreness. His
last race in the Pimlico Special (a victory over Free House, who
was leading the handicap division), I thought, was a very special
race.''
</P>
<P>
   For Stevens to rank Real Quiet, who won the Kentucky Derby and
Preakness last year, near the top of his list is high praise,
because he has been the best rider in this country for at least the
last three years. He was elected to the Hall of Fame in 1997, and
in 1998, he won a record $19.6 milion in purses and was voted the
Eclipse Award. He has ridden three Kentucky Derby winners (Winning
Colors, 1988; Thunder Gulch, '95; and Silver Charm, '97) and has
ridden six winners in the Breeders' Cup. Stevens has also developed
a reputation as a thinking man's rider and is president of the
Jockeys' Guild.
</P>
<P>
   Kent Desormeaux was the original rider aboard Real Quiet, but
after winning the Derby and Preakness, he made a precipitous move
in the Belmont and Real Quiet was caught at the wire by Victory
Gallop, ridden by Stevens. When Real Quiet was beaten in his '99
debut, trainer Bob Baffert and owner Mike Pegram replaced
Desormeaux with Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Most observers think the MassCap is a two-horse race, with 6-5
second choice Behrens, winner of two straight Grade I handicaps,
standing in Real Quiet's way. ``We're more or less going to his
home court,'' said Stevens of Behrens, who is stabled at Saratoga.
``He doesn't have to travel much. But I'm not scared of anybody on
Real Quiet. In the Texas Mile, I was just getting to know Real
Quiet (who finished second); I'd like to think that knowing him
better contributed to the win at Pimlico. No disrepect to Behrens,
I know what kind of horse he is, but I'm very confident in our
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think having Real Quiet at Suffolk is a continuation of the
great quality of horses involved in the MassCap the last five years
(Cigar won in 1995 and '96, Skip Away in 1997 and '98). It's not as
if the Boston fans haven't been exposed to great horses in past
years. Cigar and Skip Away were great horses, and Real Quiet is
another great horse coming to this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has never ridden at Suffolk, but he's watched the recent
MassCaps and knows that the East Boston oval is not as kind to
speed horses as some of the major tracks he's used to, especially
those in sun-drenched California. That should suit his horse well,
because while Behrens has early speed, Real Quiet is strictly a
stalker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried to put it together the last couple of years in the
hopes that Silver Charm (also trained by Baffert) could race there,
but it never happened,'' said Stevens. ``I'm really looking forward
to it. It's a great day of racing for the fans of Boston. I try to
do my homework. I've watched the races there and I have noticed
that it's not a particularly fast racetrack. It's a notoriously
tiring track. It's going to be in the back of my mind to reserve
plenty of horse for the finish.''
</P>
<P>
   There are several reasons Stevens has decided to go to England
while still at the peak of his game. He's had three knee operations
and is taking a pounding in the American-style crouch. He can ride
much higher in Europe. He battles weight, and he can ride much
heavier in Europe. And, perhaps most important, his wife, Nicola,
is English and hasn't been home in four years. Stevens will ride
his first race in England Tuesday, guiding Greek Dance for Stoute
in the Brigadier Gerard Stakes at Sandown. Then it's on to the big
show as he rides favored Beat All in the Epsom Derby, one of
Europe's most prestigious races, the following Saturday. If Stevens
is happy being based in Britain, he may extend his agreement with
Stoute for two more years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something I didn't decide casually,'' he said. ``I want
to realize my full potential. I've been blessed with special
skills. To me, life is an adventure, and this is just another
chapter in my life. I've made it a rule not to make long-term plans
and to live each day to the fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   The Epsom Derby is the same day as the Belmont Stakes, and the
first important mount that Stevens will lose is that on champion
filly Silverbulletday, who is trained by Baffert and will be ridden
by Jerry Bailey as she takes on colts in the Belmont, a race not
won by a filly since 1905 (Tanya). But Stevens will be rooting in
the Belmont. He'll be rooting for close friend Chris Antley to win
the Triple Crown aboard Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Off the racetrack, Chris is like a little brother to me,''
said Stevens. ``I went through trying to win the Triple Crown (with
Silver Charm in 1997) and fell three-quarters of a length short
(beaten by Touch Gold in the Belmont). It is very difficult to
accomplish. The media really started hounding Chris after he won
the Derby, and he's tried to do as many interviews as he can. He's
done a great job, but my advice to him is that three or four days
before the race, he should go into his own little world and focus
on the Belmont. He's handling it all in stride right now. But there
is a hunger out there, from both the press and the fans, for a
Triple Crown because it's been so many years since there was a
Triple Crown winner (Affirmed in 1978). When it comes down to the
final eighth of a mile in the Belmont, I'm rooting for a Triple
Crown winner.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens has been among the top 10 money winners every year since
1985; he has won 14 races with $1 million purses; he took the $4
million Dubai World Cup with Silver Charm in '98; and he had a
streak during which he rode at least one winner on 31 straight
programs in California. But his induction into the Hall of Fame at
Saratoga was his biggest thrill in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most spectacular time of my career,'' said Stevens,
who rode one race at Hollywood Park Thursday, the fourth, and won
in his farewell appearance, his 1,200th victory at the track where
he has competed since 1984. ``I feel privileged to have been
inducted at a fairly young age. It's what I'm the most proud of.
It's great to be appreciated, not just by the other jockeys, my
peers, but by the whole spectrum of racing, the whole industry. It
is something I never would have dreamed of growing up in Boise,
Idaho.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet stretched his legs with a jog over the Suffolk strip
Thursday morning. ``He's had no problems since he shipped in,''
said exercise rider Larry Damore, who was aboard for the gallop.
``He put a smile on my face. We are just going about the normal
routine, but he is probably better than normal now. He always plays
a little bit when you get him on the track. He has a measure of
class and a bounce to his step.'' . . . Also out for a gallop was
European invader Running Stag, the third pick at 6-1, who went a
brisk 7 furlongs under assistant trainer Roger Teal. Running Stag
galloped in company with Lonesome Dove, a local allowance horse,
but it was not an official workout. ``He went very well out there,
just perfect,'' said Teal. ``He was not bothered by the dirt in his
face at all. He is used to all this by now. It always takes him a
day to get adjusted to surroundings, but he is as good as ever
right now.''

DILEMMA FOR MILOSEVIC'S PROSECUTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ In Canada, they're calling it ``Arbour's Choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Louise Arbour, the UN chief war crimes prosecutor who made
history Thursday with the indictment of Yugoslav leader Slobodan
Milosevic, faces an agonizing personal and professional decision _
one the world is watching.
</P>
<P>
   Next month, the 52-year-old Ontario judge, on special leave from
that province's Court of Appeals to serve with the United Nations
tribunal, is likely to be offered a seat on the Supreme Court of
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Appointment to the nation's nine-member high court is the honor
of a lifetime, the greatest professional achievement to which any
Canadian judge can aspire. If she passes on the opportunity now, it
will likely be years before another vacancy occurs.
</P>
<P>
   But anxious human rights advocates warn the loss of the
highly-regarded Arbour could throw a monkeywrench into efforts to
hold Milosevic's Serbian regime accountable for genocide, and are
urging Arbour to stay with the tribunal for humanity's sake. In the
long run, they fear, the departure of the iron-willed, high-octane
prosecutor might even cripple the fledgling process of
international prosecution of crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her departure would be very, very bad news for the tribunal,''
said Stefanie Grant, director of programs for the New York-based
Lawyers' Committee for Human Rights. ``It's not only the loss of
her tremendous talents, energy and focus, although that would be
bad enough. The real concern is that her departure would slow the
process, perhaps even drag it down.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, many observers say, Arbour's departure would
effectively halt the prosecutorial effort for months and even years
as the UN casts about for a politically-suitable replacement.
Russia, which opposes the US-led bombing campaign against
Yugoslavia, is expected to use its seat on the UN Security Council
to block appointment of any proposed prosecutor from a NATO nation,
such as Canada.
</P>
<P>
   But sources in Canada's government and legal community, as well
as media speculation, suggest Arbour is leaning strongly toward
accepting the Supreme Court position, if it is offered.
</P>
<P>
   The Quebec-born judge, little given to public musings, has
declined to deliver the verdict on her future. ``I don't think it's
fair to speculate on what I might or might not do with my life,''
she told the Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   The situation poses a dilemma for Canada.
</P>
<P>
   On one hand, to have a Canadian serving in such a prominent and
powerful post fits perfectly with the country's policy of
international activisim. But delaying appointment of a new justice
to fill a Supreme Court position would hamper the high court's
work, and likely become a major political controversy for the
government of Prime Minister Jean Chretien.
</P>
<P>
   A decision by Arbour and Canda will have to be made soon since
Supreme Court Justice Peter Cory is scheduled to retire next month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is such a critical situation, such a historical juncture,
we're hoping the Canadian government can find some other option,
one that would let her to stay on the tribunal'' while still
keeping the Supreme Court seat open, said Kenneth Roth, executive
director of Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   Roth recently wrote a personal note to Arbour, imploring her to
continue working for the war crimes tribunal. ``But there's
recognition that this must be extraordinarily difficult personal
decision,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour is one of Canada's best-respected jurists, and it doesn't
hurt, politically, that she is also of French-Quebec heritage,
fluently bilingual and female. ``There is a kind of consensus in
the legal community that Louise Arbour is an ideal candidate, or,
if not ideal, then clearly the leading candidate,'' said Patrick
Monahan, a professor at the prestigious Osgoode Hall Law School in
Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Arbour, the mother of three, is separated from her husband, and
is said to yearn for a return to Canada. The 1971 graduate from the
University of Montreal, whose special expertise is in criminal law,
is known as much for her graciousness as her unswerving integrity
and resolve. She was appointed to the Ontario Supreme Court in
1987, and to Ontario's Court of Appeals in 1990. In 1996, at the
special request of the UN, she was given a leave to work for the
war crimes tribunal and has been based in The Hague, Netherlands,
ever since.

BU'S `ULYSSES' SCHOLAR TO EMBARK ON JOB ODYSSEY? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are we seeing the last days of Boston University's famous James
Joyce Research Center, run by the brilliant, nutty Joyce scholar
John Kidd? Kidd, possibly the world's foremost expert on Joyce's
novel ``Ulysses,'' tells me that he has resigned from the
university, effective next year, and that his resignation has been
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the world of academe, Kidd is viewed as a
high-maintenance oddity. (I detailed his ministrations to the
wounded squirrels and pigeons of Commonwealth Avenue in ``The Long,
Strange Voyage of BU's `Ulysses' Man,'' Oct. 1, 1997.) But Kidd's
departure is a blow to BU not only because of his scholarship, but
also because he owns all 6,000 volumes in BU's Joyce Center. Where
he goes, the Joyce Center goes, and he says numerous universities
(why do I suspect Boston College is one of them?) have made him
``seven-figure offers'' for the book collection, plus promises of a
job for him.
</P>
<P>
   Why is he leaving? BU officials say Kidd's grading practices _
he flunked a few students, a no-no in the modern university _ have
been under investigation. And of course he is embroiled in a
controversy with the campus police over his efforts to rescue dying
pigeons on BU property. Whatever the cause, Kidd says ``I'll be
gone'' after he takes a sabbatical next year. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Follow-up on the news &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several people called me after reading last week's item ``The
Lost History of the Wall Street Journal'' and said I left out the
best part of the story. It's true that Random House is stuck with
an unwieldy, unfinished history of the paper, partly written by the
late Richard Clurman and partly finished by Newsweek managing
editor Jon Meacham. But I did leave out the part about the
Journal's offering to finance completion of the manuscript, because
I didn't know about it.
</P>
<P>
   The Journal's vice president for corporate communications
Richard Tofel says he called Meacham's agent, Amanda (Binky) Urban,
after he learned that Meacham wouldn't have time to finish the
project. ``We had a certain interest in preserving part of the
manuscript,'' Tofel explains. ``I told Binky that if we were going
to play some role in this, either by buying copies or publishing
the manuscript privately, we would have to read it.'' Tofel's
primary interest was in the material from the 1920s and 1930s that
the writers had dug out of the WSJ archives, not in the Journal's
more turbulent, recent years of corporate strife.
</P>
<P>
   Urban did let Tofel read the manuscript earlier this year. More
than one writer was surprised to learn that what had started out as
a top-drawer, $300,000 project involving a prestigious publishing
house and well-known writers had devolved into a
bought-and-paid-for piece of corporate shilling. But that's not
exactly what happened. Tofel passed on his proposed deal, probably
because the jury-rigged manuscript was unsalvageable. ``I didn't
think there was any deal to be had from our perspective'' is all he
will say about his decision. Urban, a longtime friend of the
Clurman family, just wants to get the manuscript finished and says
she was grateful for Tofel's input: ``Dick was trying to do us a
favor.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Inside baseball &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the New Fenway games begin, meaning the endless flurry of
posturing around plans for a new Fenway Park, it helps to have a
program to know who the players are. The story behind the stories
that you read in the paper _ about property owner Stephen Mindich's
need to be compensated for his venerable Fenway-area properties,
etc., etc. _ is that many local businessmen wish ill upon John
Harrington, who manages the Jean Yawkey Trust, which owns the Sox.
And they hope the constant spitballing of the New Fenway, and the
cost of building a new stadium, will exhaust Harrington and the
trust financially, forcing the team to seek new owners.
</P>
<P>
   It would be wrong to suggest that the influence peddlers seeking
``input'' into the New Fenway _ people like the estimable and
upright George Regan, and former congressman Chester Atkins _ are
acting in concert or have a secret agenda. And at various times,

ACADEMIC RARITY: BROWN TO INCLUDE STUDY OF VALUES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Treading into a field that most schools have long considered far
too mine-laden, Brown University will integrate the formal study of
values into its famously unstructured undergraduate curriculum
beginning next year.
</P>
<P>
   Educators have been made wary of such programs by critics who
ask whether schools can teach values, and if so, whose they will
teach.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown officials say that with the repetitive shocks of mass
shootings in schools and a lack of respect for the nation's
leaders, political concerns about teaching values have given way to
a yearning among Americans for agreement on a core set of
principles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a mystery to anybody that the question of values
ranks top in the public mind when people are asked about what is
the nation's problem,'' said Nancy L. Rosenblum, a professor of
political science and the director of the values initiative at
Brown.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the decline of personal virtue that we see among our
leaders and all the collective horrors in our world, these
reflections on values come up. There's a kind of exhaustion with
cynicism, an interest in trying to reconstruct values. We want to
exploit what we see as a renewed interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The program will engage undergraduates in a discussion of the
whole range of what Rosenblum called ``the elements that make up
the good life: social justice, human morality, character,
friendship, spirituality, aesthetics, the nature of beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   The university will inaugurate the program with a public seminar
at the start of commencement weekend Saturday, and the formal study
for undergraduates will begin with freshman seminars discussing the
values that make up a ``quality life'' next winter. A sophomore
seminar will follow, on justice and responsibility. Eventually,
Brown administrators said, a course in values is likely to be a
requirement for a diploma in any major, as much as writing or the
completion of a thesis.
</P>
<P>
   Brown officials say the addition of the study of values is the
biggest change in the ``New Curriculum,'' a pioneering program
introduced at Brown 30 years ago that did away with most course
requirements and made grades optional.
</P>
<P>
   But if adding a formal study of values redefines the Brown
curriculum, Rosenblum said, it also reflects a change in academia
in general. While religious colleges have consistently taught
courses on values, nonsectarian schools have traditionally shied
away from such discussions, thinking them inconsistent with the
spirit of academic inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're witnessing a sea change even in academics and radical
intellectualism, away from pure deconstruction and relativism, away
from cynicism,'' Rosenblum said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown officials said the introduction of values to the
curriculum was a return to the earliest mission of their
university, which was founded by a predominantly Baptist group to
be a ``liberal, catholic interdenominational school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Charter of 1764 defined Brown as a place that prepared
students for lives of `usefulness and reputation' in the world
beyond campus,'' said Brown president E. Gordon Gee.
``Increasingly, the world needs men and women who can discern and
champion the necessary elements of a good life and a just society.
. . . We intend to promote and enhance that ability to discern what
is necessary for a good life.''
</P>
<P>
   Until now, most programs in values or ethics have been
concentrated at the graduate level, and specific to certain fields
_ ethics in law, for example, or bioethics. Dartmouth has a program
for ethics in engineering. The closest program to what Brown will
offer is at Princeton, where the University Center for Human Values
has offered freshman seminars on everything from computer privacy
to political theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a period where values have been a strange
topic,'' said Peter Kramer, a psychiatrist and author of the
bestselling ``Listening to Prozac,'' who will appear on a panel at
the commencement weekend seminar. ``In the '60s and '70s, liberals
really had the upper hand on values, coming out of the civil rights
movement, the antiwar movement. Then we entered this period where
values seemed associated with political conservatism, or religious
extremism.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now, there is a sense . . . of laissez-faire capitalism
having gone awry, a lack of ability to control what emerges from
the market place. The level of violence that would have previously
indicated an art cinema movie now is entirely mainstream almost too
easily accessed. So there may be more of a consensus about the need
for values.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Rosenblum said, Brown officials recognize the potential
pitfalls in their new program. Brown's New Curriculum has been
parodied as a self-indulgent exercise in personal growth, and
courses in values might be open to the same knock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trick is on the one hand to be academically serious, on
the other to make it introspective and meaningful, personally,
without it devolving into a confessional or anything like that,''
she said. ``Treading that line is difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   In her freshman seminar, for instance, she plans to discuss
``Walden,'' and whether Henry David Thoreau was peculiar in
believing self-sufficiency was the key to life.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics will also say, she acknowledged, that the
university shouldn't try to define values.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still that question. It will always arise; it should
always arise,'' she said. ``We know that declarations and attempts
to enforce universal values have been a disguise for imperialism
and oppression, and we should always be sensitive to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having said that,'' she added, ``the business of
deconstruction and skepticism makes sense where you have very
powerful traditional values and conventions. It doesn't make sense
when people feel they don't have values. Then, it's crippling.''

 &HT;    CONGRESSIONAL LOCK BOX FOR SOCIAL SECURITY _ HOW SECURE IS IT?
 &HT;    For release Sunday, May 30.
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ As lawmakers left the Capitol for the Memorial Day
holiday, Republicans boasted they had protected Social Security
from government ``raids.'' Democrats grumbled nothing has been done
_ or is likely to be done _ to solve the federal retirement
system's long-term financial problem.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans plan to use the holiday to whip up support among
their constituents, blaming Senate Democrats and the White House
for twice blocking their ``lock box'' bill. The issue is likely to
be among the first on the Senate floor when lawmakers return June
7.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is primarily symbolic, with a heavy dose of politics.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, approved Wednesday in the House, would subject any
legislation that would spend more money than is available in budget
_ not counting the Social Security or Medicare trust funds _ to a
parliamentary ``point of order.''
</P>
<P>
   Raising a point of order would mean that a majority of the
House, and at least 60 members of the Senate, would have to
specifically approve dipping into the trust funds.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said their action was a first step toward protecting
Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   This bill ``will impose a discipline on us'' that will make it
difficult to break budget limits until Social Security is reformed,
said Rep. E. Clay Shaw Jr., R-Fla., a co-author of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This puts us on the spot,'' he said. ``If we don't solve
Social Security, sooner or later this will bite us and bite us
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats said the bill was designed to help Republicans
politically by making it look like they were saving Social
Security. In reality, they say, the bill is weak because it does
nothing to extend Social Security beyond 2034, when the trust fund
is expected to be depleted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Instead of making the tough decision to do something
substantial, my Republican colleagues are taking a pass,'' said
Rep. Joseph Moakley, D-Mass. ``Instead of acting, they are offering
this country this point of order which the Democrats already
enacted some 14 years ago, and which merely restates congressional
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties voted overwhelmingly for the bill, with Republicans
claiming it would help and Democrats suggesting that it couldn't
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   During decades of federal deficits, the government has spent
Social Security _ and to a lesser extent, Medicare _ surpluses and
replaced them with IOUs in the form of special Treasury bonds. Now
that the budget is beginning to run a surplus _ still composed
primarily of Social Security reserves _ Republicans worry that the
extra money will also be spent unless it is locked away.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans argue that without their bill, President Clinton and
congressional Democrats would spend $138 billion from the surplus
over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that Clinton's plan _ to use 62 percent of the
surplus for Social Security reform, 15 percent for Medicare reform
and 12 percent for individual investment accounts _ will do more to
resolve Social Security's long-term problem than putting the money
is a parliamentary ``lock box'' that, they say, can be too easily
opened.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats note that the threshold is ridiculously low. Any bill
must have at least a majority of the House, and 60 votes in the
Senate is the margin any bill must attract to break a filibuster by
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   They also note that the lock box could be opened by declaring
any bill to be one that reformed Social Security or Medicare _
regardless of whether the bill actually strengthened those
program's financial situation.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Reischauer of the Brookings Institute, a former head of
the Congressional Budget Office, called the bill a ``statement of
intent that suggests we should be saving the Social Security
surplus. To the extent that's practical, that represents good
policy.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reischauer said that regardless of whether there is a lock
box, Social Security benefits will be paid. The question is how
hard it will be for the government to pay them.
</P>
<P>
   Both the lock box and the Clinton proposal would reduce the
federal debt. The surplus money would be used to offset marketable
Treasury bonds which would simply not be refinanced, according to
Reischauer.
</P>
<P>
   Lowering the debt now, government economists say, would make it
easier in the future to issue more Treasury bonds to finance Social
Security and Medicare benefits when the programs need the money.

TOUGH QUERIES TEST TEXAS GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- The once-easy atmosphere in the Austin restaurant
began to grow tense as Alexander ``Sandy'' Tennant questioned
Governor George W. Bush of Texas about rumors concerning his
``youthful indiscretions'' and his hot temper.
</P>
<P>
   Tennant, former executive director of the Massachusetts
Republican Party, was part of a delegation of Massachusetts money
people who made the pilgrimage to meet the Republican presidential
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   The others hadn't expected a question as direct as Tennant's,
and they listened nervously as the governor related that he had
already said what he planned to say about once having been, in his
oft-repeated words, ``young and irresponsible.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But I have never been unfaithful to my wife, I haven't had a
drink in 10 years, and as far as I am concerned, it is a
non-issue,'' Bush declared emphatically, according to several
people who attended the late-March meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, Bush said, he had faced those concerns in the 1994
Texas campaign in which he defeated Governor Ann Richards. All of
those issues had been brought up, and he had dealt with them all.
</P>
<P>
   From both mien and manner, Bush made it clear he didn't care to
discuss the issue further. Neither did the group of 30 or so
sitting around the table in the private room at Austin's tony
Shoreline Bar &AMP; Grill. Having winced through Tennant's question,
they were ready to move on.
</P>
<P>
   Now, to be sure, some Republican insiders worry there might be
more to the rumors, just the way Bill Clinton's backers did in
1992, when he assured them that reports about problems in his
personal life were nonsense. After all, one politico who has known
the Texas governor for years says Bush told him that before he
finally quit drinking, his tippling had gotten so bad that it came
to a point where he had ``to choose between Laura and Jack.'' Laura
is his wife; Jack as in Jack Daniels.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was a meeting of basic Bush fans, more than a dozen
Massachusetts fund-raisers from the Weld/Cellucci operation who are
pulling together to help the Texas governor, plus some operatives
from Ohio and California. (Most of the Massachusetts group had
jetted down in the private plane of Richard Egan, chairman of EMC
Corp. of Hopkinton, Mass.)
</P>
<P>
   In short, they had come to praise George W., not to query him.
Which is why, if some were made uneasy by Tennant's first question,
they were even more nonplussed when Tennant pressed on. Some
remember him asking two pointed followups; others say there was
only one.
</P>
<P>
   But most everyone agrees that Tennant, a political pitbull,
wasn't about to drop the issue. Saying his own experience had
taught him the political opponents would never let the facts get in
the way of a good electoral argument, he insisted questions about
Bush's personal life and his temper would be the issues in the
presidential campaign. Are you going to be able to control
yourself, he wanted to know?
</P>
<P>
   By the time the exchange was over, Bush, sources say, was
staring daggers at Tennant, and some others in the room were
squirming in their seats. ``You mean, can I smile when a bunch of
jerks asks me questions?'' Bush asked, affecting an icy smile.
``The answer is yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Few at the table were left in doubt as to whom the Texas
governor considered the jerk asking importunate questions at this
particular moment.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, sources say, former Massachusetts governor
William F. Weld, obviously uncomfortable at Tennant's
cross-examination, tried to break the tension, quipping that if
Bush could handle Tennant, he could certainly finesse the press.
</P>
<P>
   Blunt though he may be, Tennant is also cagey. As executive
director of the Republican State Committee in late 1980s, he helped
conceive and execute the plan that revived the GOP as a force in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows firsthand the damage the allegations can do. In
1989 and 1990, he was a one-person battering ram assaulting the
Democratic bastion that Massachusetts politics had become.
</P>
<P>
   As the state's economy slid into recession, creating a fiscal
crisis, Tennant pounced on each new bit of bad news, citing it as
evidence of the ``waste, cronyism, and corruption'' the Democrats
had supposedly visited upon ``the working people of
Massachusetts.'' Abrasive and bombastic though he could be, Tennant
was so effective that when the Democratic Party searched for a new
executive director in 1991, they remembered the lesson, and looked
for someone _ they chose Steve Grossman _ who could offer an
equally tough critique of the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Tennant downplays the exchange. ``I am 110 percent
behind George Bush,'' he said. ``I was just raising what the
initial issues were in this campaign. I thought his answers were
very good.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, sources say Tennant has offered a more interesting
rationale when friends pressed him on why he had grilled Bush so
hard. He wanted to test Bush's composure; if the candidate couldn't
stay cool in front of a friendly group of Republicans at a private
lunch in Austin, what would he do under the white-hot glare of the
campaign klieg lights?
</P>
<P>
   Cast in that light, some conceded that, awkward though the
moment was, there may have been a method to Tennant's badness. For
if some of his fellow Bay State Republicans were uncomfortable
about Tennant's impromptu stress test, they were also left a little
uneasy about George W.'s smoldering response.

DON'T COUNT THIS DARK HORSE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Once again, the hype is hot: Saturday's Massachusetts
Handicap at Suffolk Downs will be a match race between Bob
Baffert's Real Quiet and James Bond's Behrens. As usual, the hype
has a hole in it.
</P>
<P>
   For the fifth year in a row, to the amazement of many, Suffolk's
Lou Raffeto has schmoozed and cajoled and talked and persuaded the
connections of America's best horses to come to East Boston, this
year's prizes being Real Quiet and Behrens. But a third horse also
is here, inviting himself more or less, and that horse is Running
Stag. Remember his name.
</P>
<P>
   Phillip Mitchell, Running Stag's trainer, was asked what his
strategy might be to dethrone America's kings of older racehorses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shoot them,'' replied Mitchell pithily.
</P>
<P>
   That comment was delivered from England, in an English accent
and in the familiar blunt English manner. And therein the tale.
</P>
<P>
   For the second year in a row, Running Stag has left Europe, as
so many Europeans have done, and for the familiar European reason _
to go after that easy money that's just piled on the streets of the
United States, there for the picking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's a very, very versatile horse,'' said Mitchell.
``There aren't many horses racing who maybe are as good on the
grass as they are on the dirt. But he's shown that he is. We wanted
to try him on the dirt because he won our premier UK race on the
dirt (at Lingfield in 1998) very easily, and that's what set our
mind in motion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Cochrane, Running Stag's jockey in Europe, scoffed at this
idea, saying in England's Racing Post that Running Stag is better
suited to the ``righthanded'' (clockwise) racing that predominates
in Europe, not the ``lefthanded'' (counterclockwise) racing that is
an American staple.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a remark that Ray made hoping the horse would stay in
Europe and not come to America,'' Mitchell scoffed back. ``He was
trying to con me that he was better going righthanded because he
knows all the tracks in America are lefthanded.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it seems Running Stag is a Grade II horse at best _ a
notch below US Grade I winners Real Quiet and Behrens _ he made a
most respectable showing last year against America's best at the
time, Skip Away and Silver Charm. Specifically, Running Stag may
have run his best race in his first US race, as so many foreign
invaders do.
</P>
<P>
   That race was the Grade I Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park Sept.
19, when he was in the hunt and ran a credible third behind Skip
Away and Gentlemen. ``He came off the turn and he was breathing
right down Skip Away's neck,'' said Roger Teal, his assistant
trainer. ``And Ray took him to the inside and they said the inside
was slow. There was no way he was going to beat Skip Away, but he
might have finished a little closer.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag did not take to the mud in the Jockey Club Gold Cup
at Belmont Oct. 10 when Gentlemen and Skip Away dueled each other
suicidally, allowing Wagon Limit to upset the favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the Breeders' Cup Classic at Churchill Downs, Running
Stag finished seventh among 10 horses in the race won by Silver
Charm. Finally, in his fourth race in the United States, Running
Stag finished fourth in the Clark Handicap at Churchill in late
November, but only 1 1/2 lengths behind Silver Charm, the winner.
At least Running Stag proved he belongs on the same tracks as
America's best horses, even if he didn't threaten to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``He jumped a shadow in the Clark Handicap,'' said Teal.
``(Jockey) John Velasquez said he was very unlucky not to win the
Clark; he jumped the shadow about a furlong out.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag last ran May 8, finishing second in the Shergar
Stakes at England's Goodwood racetrack, ``and that was a good
second to Handsome Ridge, a Group II horse,'' said Mitchell. ``He's
ready and he's happy and he's big and he's bursting.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only other race this year, Running Stag finished seventh
in the $5 million Dubai World Cup in March, won by Almutawake over
the Americans Malek and Victory Gallop. But that race taught
Mitchell a lesson, and the man seems open-minded enough to realize
that maybe the Americans do know something about training horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were in Dubai with him, we would take him out on the
track in the morning, when the weather was nice,'' said Mitchell,
``and we would notice that (California trainer) Richard Mandella
would take his horse out at night. We thought this was so he would
be used to racing under the lights, but now we can see why he did
that. It was the humidity over there. When we took him out for the
race, the heat was really bothering him. He was in position
throughout the race but came up empty, and we think the heat played
a part in that.''
</P>
<P>
   (For sure, Mitchell said, Running Stag loves to travel. ``He's
an ace traveler,'' said the trainer, ``and he loves it. He puts his
feet up and watches the movie on the way over.'')
</P>
<P>
   There are great cultural battles between the rest of the world
and the US in most areas of life, but few seem as great as the
philosophical divide between the training of horses in Europe and
America. Americans snicker at the European style; Europeans scoff
at the American way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the stopwatch,'' said Teal, pointing to the greatest
divide between Old World and New. ``Every time that (American)
horse goes on the track, there's a stopwatch on him. And if he
doesn't do a certain time, that horse isn't worth much. Back home,
we ride the horses and we don't overtrain him. We'll get permission
to take him to tracks (where the horse will race) and work him
there, but we do not train him on the clock.''
</P>
<P>
   The other difference, Teal believes, ``is that Americans don't
see that a horse can be beat. Before a race, ``they just don't see
that a horse can lose. But horses don't run the same every race and
you cannot go there and say, like Skip Away last year (in the
Jockey Club Gold Cup), everyone was saying he can't be beat. And
people couldn't accept that Skip Away was beaten by Wagon Limit.''
</P>
<P>
   But the worst difference, said Teal, was how racegoers in
America react to a loss by the horse they fancy. ``They booed Skip
Away after the Breeders' Cup,'' he said, ``and we couldn't handle
that at all. We came back with our horse after the race, and there
were guys booing Skip Away. It was horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   On their second tour of American dirt, the Running Stag crowd
has also learned that perhaps an American jockey might be
beneficial for a race in America, so Cochrane was left at home to
ride his righthanded races. Shane Sellers, one of America's better
jockeys, will be aboard Running Stag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We originally wanted Velasquez because John rode him in the
Breeders' Cup and in the Clark Handicap, but John was committed to
ride in New York,'' said Teal. ``So we then asked for (Jerry)
Bailey, but he had commitments. But then Shane Sellers' agent
phoned up and we got Shane.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag is here because Mary Pitt, a Bostonian who is an
American correspondent for the Racing Post, was in England over the
winter and suggested to Mitchell that Boston might be a bit easier
for Running Stag than New York and there was this race in Boston
called the Massachusetts Handicap. And of course, money made in
Boston is just as spendable as money made in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But, said Teal with a laugh, ``we thought it'd be easier this
year'' than it was in 1998 running against Skip Away, Silver Charm,
and Gentlemen. But all the talk about a match race between Real
Quiet and Behrens is not irksome to the British.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes the pressure off us a little bit,'' said Teal.

DIAMONDS ARE HIS PASSION

   &UR;  &LR; He is out there somewhere, off in some corner of this vast
cocktail bar called America, doing what he does best, or at least
most _ tossing back a Bud tallboy, delighting over a plate of
nachos, informing a stranger that his bachelor party is an
uninspired disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   His name? Stephen Pecevich. His home: South Boston. His goal?
Visit every Major League Baseball stadium on the continent in May
and June, dollars and sense be damned.
</P>
<P>
   Some people take spiritual journeys to pray in the Holy Land,
kneel in the Vatican, or absorb the wonders of history along the
Great Wall of China. Pecevich, 35, is a spirit of a slightly
different sort, evidenced in this e-mail dispatch from Atlanta's
Turner Field this month: ``Beer? Stands everywhere. Lines NOWHERE.
I almost felt obliged to order a beer at each stand I passed.''
</P>
<P>
   His is a journey not of faith but of hope _ hope for an
old-fashioned pitcher's duel, hope for the perfect ballyard hot
dog, hope for an uncommonly cold draught beer. All the while, he
e-mails his thoughts and experiences daily to friends and saves his
notes for posterity _ and possibly a book.

   April 30. South Boston. At sunrise, I went to my roofdeck for
motivation and I sang, in this order, America the Beautiful, God
Bless America, The National Anthem and Take Me Out to the Ballgame.
I was officially on my way now.

   Thursday found him in Milwaukee, at County Stadium, watching an
afternoon game between the Brewers and the Atlanta Braves. Tomorrow
brings him to Chicago, where he will sit with friends in the famed
Wrigley Field bleachers and watch the Cubs and Sammy Sosa face the
St. Louis Cardinals and Mark McGwire. As of today, he is 17
stadiums into a 30-park crusade that will end with a hero's welcome
at Fenway on June 26.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he has caught a foul ball and received a standing
ovation at Pro Player Stadium in Miami, narrowly avoided a cable
car crash in San Francisco, and drunk an afternoon away with a
trucker at the Anheuser-Busch plant in St. Louis. He has had a
cabdriver confess an extramarital affair to him, swum with a cell
phone in his pocket, seen his laptop driven to Tucson without him.

   May 5, St. Louis. As I was finishing my meal, a group of nuns
were seated beside me. As their conversation evolved, I had to
procrastinate. Topics ranged from the ``Independence of
Sisterhood'' to the ``Mother House not allowing them to wear slacks
or hosiery,'' to one nun stating that ``balsamic vinaigrette gives
me a buzz'' _ after which she ordered that specific dressing for
her salad. That's one crazy nun.

   All in all, he confides, he's a little worse for the wear. ``It
is killing me,'' he says on the phone from Milwaukee. ``I can't
wait to go home and not eat. The point for the book is that I'm
trying to find the best places to eat. I order everything at the
park.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he normal? ``Well, no,'' says Stephen Flynn, one of his best
friends. ``He's crazy,'' says his wife of two years, Cathy.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, crazy like a fox. He's a venture capitalist, Quincy born
and Catholic school bred, who made his fortune early and knows how
to enjoy it often. He is a patron of Catholic Charities, a former
baseball player at Holy Cross, a bon vivant who has persuaded a
sainted wife to bless this singular trek.

   May 25. San Diego. Our first stop inside Qualcomm Stadium was
not the game, but Randy's Ribs. When they handed me my order, I
thought the picnic table would fall over like Fred Flintstone's
car. For the next 15 minutes, there was silence. Two men on a
mission. As long as neither of us put our hands near the other's
mouth, we were out of harm's way.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His favorite stadiums so far: The Ballpark at Arlington, Bank
One Ballpark in Phoenix, and Coor's Field in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The stodgier among us will roll their eyes in condescension.
They will decry the money _ 15 to 20 large, by his estimate _ spent
on what amounts to a two-month version of ``Ferris Bueller's Day
Off.'' They will read his daily dispatches _ ``Next stop,
Killebrew's Blues, a bar that served its purpose (as well as
Jagermeister)'' _ and relegate him to the status of eternal frat
boy.
</P>
<P>
   But they miss the point. He is not just seeing the parks, but
meeting the people in them. He is not only living the moment, but
celebrating a life. He is not merely a man on a mission, but a
living excuse for anyone in need of a break. As we kick off the
summer, practice these words: ``For God sakes, honey, all I want to
do is go to one lousy game. It's not like I'm this guy Pec who left
for two months straight.''

SLEEPWALKING TRIAL BEGINS: WIFE STABBED 44 TIMES, DROWNED  
 (ADV: FIRST OF FOUR STORIES RECOUNTING WEEK'S TRIAL ACTION) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Scott Falater, known to all as a loving husband, went
berserk one night when his wife made the fatal mistake of
interrupting him while he was sleepwalking, his attorney said
Monday in Maricopa County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``He immediately went into a rage, a total frenzy, and stabbed
her 44 times,'' lawyer Michael Kimerer told the jury during the
opening of Falater's murder trial Monday (May 24) before Judge
Ronald Reinstein.
</P>
<P>
   With a knife and flashlight in hand, he likely was drawn to
their broken pool pump while in a deep sleep state, Kimerer said.
Falater had been trying to fix the pump before he went to bed,
Kimerer said, and his mind likely was still fretting over it.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Yarmila, must have come outside from the den where she
had been watching television, Kimerer said. Maybe she tapped him on
the shoulder. Maybe she asked him what he was doing.
</P>
<P>
   But county prosecutor Juan Martinez believes the killing was
premeditated. He's seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, an engineer, family man and leader in his church, was
too deliberate and calculating in his movements to kill his wife,
then cover up his crime, Martinez said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He began stabbing her over and over and over and over again,''
Martinez said. ``She went down to the ground and he continued to
stab her in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't like she didn't struggle or scream, Martinez said.
Self-defense wounds were found on her hands. Neighbors heard
Yarmila's screams for up to 30 minutes before the sounds turned
into low groans.
</P>
<P>
   And if stabbing her was not enough, Martinez said, Falater
dragged her to their backyard pool, pushed her in and held her head
down with both hands.
</P>
<P>
   But first, he went in the house to change clothes and clean up,
he said. Falater packed the knife, an athletic mouthpiece that had
his saliva on it, boots and his bloody clothes in a plastic
container. He stuck it in a garbage bag before hiding it in the
wheel well of his Volvo hatchback.
</P>
<P>
   A neighbor peeking over their adjoining fence watched Falater as
he walked through the house, turning lights on and off, then going
down to the kitchen to wash his hands.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, Greg Koons, testified Monday that Falater even
opened the sliding-glass door to signal his dog to lie down. At one
point, Falater spun around toward the fence as if he heard a sound
from where Koons stood, concealed by a large pine tree, Koons said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater stood still for about five to 10 seconds before
returning to the house.
</P>
<P>
   Koons testified that he stayed put to see Falater come back
outside to finish off his wife in the swimming pool.
</P>
<P>
   Those are not the movements of a sleepwalker, Martinez told the
jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This individual here . . . in a sense baptized his wife,
Yarmila Falater, into the afterlife,'' said Martinez, referring to
Falater's Mormon beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   As Martinez recounted the gruesome details, Falater's face
remained blank. At times during the hearing, he dropped his head,
his eyes downcast. But his face never showed any emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a gray suit, he looked less frail than in previous court
hearings when he wore jailhouse stripes and handcuffs. He smiled
and waved to friends who were in court Monday to show their
support.
</P>
<P>
   His attorney, Kimerer, spoke at length about Falater's love for
his wife and family. The two met while sophomores in high school,
later married and had two children.
</P>
<P>
   They devoted their lives to family, church and home, he said.
Under their guidance, their children excelled. Their daughter was
the valedictorian of her graduating class this year; their son, a
straight-A student.
</P>
<P>
   Yarmila was a talented artist and president of the state chapter
of a basketweaving association.
</P>
<P>
   Falater, 44, was a member of his church stake's high council.
</P>
<P>
   The couple had no financial problems. He and Yarmila shared the
same religion, the same politics. They never fought. They always
sat down and discussed any problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But all was not idyllic.
</P>
<P>
   Court records show that Yarmila was depressed at times about not
having a career in nursing. She was not as happy with the Mormon
church as her husband. He had joined it first. She later. He wanted
more children. She did not.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer, meanwhile, insists there was no motive for the slaying.
</P>
<P>
   Sleepwalking is the only explanation for the killing, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a senseless crime. There was no reason for it,'' he
said in court. ``There was no reason why Scott Falater would kill
the woman he loved more than anything else in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not as farfetched as it sounds, to kill while under the
dark spell of sleepwalking, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He listed several homicides committed by sleepwalkers, including
a man who was disturbed while sleeping in his car by two young
women wanting a ride. He drove off, turned around, hit one of the
girls with his car, then turned around and hit her again, killing
her, Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was the French detective who was assigned to a
homicide case only to discover he was the person who had killed the
victim while sleepwalking.
</P>
<P>
   Falater also fits the profile of a sleepwalker who can become
violent, Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   Not only do he and his family have a history of sleepwalking,
sleep-talking and bed-wetting, Falater was in the state of mind
that is typical of sleepwalkers who become violent, Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   They are usually male, under stress and have trouble sleeping,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Falater had been living for days on little sleep and was under
tremendous stress from his job at the time of the killing, Kimerer
said. A new computer chip was a failure. He was worried he would
have to lay off the employees he loved and who loved him in return,
Kimerer said.
</P>
<P>
   He is calling three national sleep disorder experts who will
testify that Falater was not aware of what he was doing that night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did it without any consciousness,'' Kimerer said. ``In
fact, his brain was asleep.'' &QL;

FILM TAKES A RIVETING LOOK AT DIVORCE IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WESLEY MORRIS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Divorce by any other name is still a divorce. Ugly, volatile,
nasty, inevitable. The circumstances don't matter _ divorce stinks,
especially if you happen to be a woman looking for one in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   With harrowing conviction, Kim Longinotto and Ziba Mir-Hosseini
unfurl an incensing reel of D-I-V-O-R-C-E candids, in which a
country's judicial system and religious customs conspire against
its unhappily _ no, miserably _ wedded women, keeping them in
loveless, sexless relationships because it's what the man wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Divorce Iranian Style,'' which was runner-up for the audience
award at this year's San Francisco International Film Festival,
chafes with outrage over the sexism rampant in Iranian society.
</P>
<P>
   What begins at first as a grainy, possibly academic (read:
patronizing) anthropological study in an ``otherized'' culture
quickly evolves into a document of vexing (and vexed) immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   That single camera perched adjacent to the judge's bench remains
there for most of the film, and the things it sees defy anything
you've seen in ``Divorce Court.''
</P>
<P>
   Women fill the closet-size courtroom with their weeping,
pleading and conniving to be liberated from dismal misalliances in
front of old, incredulous judges resolved to play conspirator to
oppression by not finding ways to evade the bureaucracy and
circumvent the laws that side almost exclusively with the husband.
When a court clerk's daughter climbs into the judge's chair and
starts emphatically presiding over an imaginary case, the film just
grows downright despondent with the impossibility of that girl, or
any woman, legally granting divorces.
</P>
<P>
   Had Longinotto and Mir-Hosseini, who's also an Iranian
anthropologist, just shown us a few pitiful, distraught wives
desperate for the single life, the film would have veered into the
sort of the hands-off, souped-up, victim-as-subject dramamentaries
that Christiane Amanpour uses to bring that urgent, crunchy center
to the occasionally candy-coated ``60 Minutes.'' Many of the women
shown in ``Divorce'' are as self-empowered as they are victimized,
greedy as they are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   All Tina Turner wanted in her iconic split from Ike was her name
_ at least that's what she told Kurt Loder in ``I, Tina.'' A couple
of the wives in this film want to break up all the way to bank.
They're backed by an arbitration process that grants them a $10,000
marriage gift if given a divorce. But the provision floats before
them like a bachelorette mirage they'll never get their hands on _
or they'll get so disgusted with the procedure that they'll
renounce any interest in monetary or proprietary consolation prizes
just to be single again.
</P>
<P>
   The film is careful in its display of the assortment of husbands
as well. An abusive father beseeches his family to believe that his
cruelty will end once the divorce request is dropped, while his
unmoved wife expresses her doubt off-camera, presumably to the
filmmakers. Another attempted divorce makes it to arbitration, a
limbo for dead marriages, and during a settlement palaver held over
an argumentative family tea, the camera repeatedly lands on the
dejected face of the husband who's been whittled down to his wick
by the enveloping pettiness.
</P>
<P>
   But in the scheme of things, it's fury that compels Longinotto
and Mir-Hosseini to leave their fingerprints on the trajectory of
the fate of Maryam, a woman whose husband accuses her of destroying
a court order _ an offense that could land her in jail. When Maryam
turns to the filmmakers to corroborate her innocence, they do,
knowing minutes before that she'd giddily confessed to them that
she had torn it up. It's a riveting, rule-breaking violation in
which a little white lie is an unpronounced but searing moment of
truth.

   When Andrew Perlman and Mark Land formed Cignal Global
Communications in 1995, they expected to run the operation
themselves, adding technical and management talent as they grew.
</P>
<P>
   One major problem: Perlman, then 19, and Land, 20, both college
dropouts, had lots of energy and determination but no business
experience. While they managed to launch a low-cost overseas phone
service using Internet technology, they were quickly running out of
$1 million in capital from a private investor and a close friend's
father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just about gone,'' said Perlman, citing a series of
mistakes and the defections of several managers who left once the
money started running out.
</P>
<P>
   Enter Christopher Rooney, 58, former president of Global One, a
consortium of Sprint International, Deutsche Telecom and France
Telecom, who became Cignal Global's chief executive last May and
helped stabilize the fledgling company.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their technological know-how, great ideas, and big
ambitions, entrepreneurs in their 20s are discovering that they
still need older, experienced executives to provide business focus,
credibility, and management leadership to help a start-up succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors looking to bring in adult supervision is not an
uncommon scenario,'' said Charles A. Polachi, office managing
partner of the executive search firm Heidrick &AMP; Struggles/Fenwick
Partners in Lexington. The firm seeks out chief executives who will
earn between $150,000 and $300,000 and could own up to 10 percent
of a young company's equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``But with younger and younger entrepreneurs who have often
spent 10 years with computers and are technically savvy, plus the
huge flows of venture capital money,'' he said, ``the need for an
experienced CEO who can provide leadership along with marketing,
sales and brand awarenesss has never been greater.''
</P>
<P>
   And these business leaders _ some of whom serve as mentors to
their younger colleagues and others who are viewed as father
figures _ are in big demand. In New England alone, Polachi said,
there are about 50 chief executive openings, of which about half
are for start-ups with young founders.
</P>
<P>
   Wellie Chao knew from the start he needed a chief executive with
a consumer marketing background. Along with two others, he formed
Crimson Solutions, an on-line job placement service for new college
graduates, while the three were still students at Harvard College.
</P>
<P>
   One of Crimson's early investors met Sharon Whiteley at a
conference and persuaded her to meet with Chao and his team.
Whiteley was instrumental in putting pushcarts in Faneuil Hall
Marketplace nearly 23 years ago, and since then had formed and run
four companies in specialty retailing and consumer product
manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never worked with entrepreneurs this young,'' said Whiteley,
now 50 and chief executive of the 18-employee Boston-based
start-up, which recently received $3 million in venture capital
financing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is like the Wild, Wild West, and I was drawn to
it, along with a true appreciation for the entrepreneurial
spirit,'' said Whiteley. ``Entrusting an outsider with your dream
and vision is something I know and am very respectful of.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Perlman and Land of Cignal Global realized they
needed help after several rejections from venture capital companies
questioned their lack of experience. Finally, New York-based
investment banker Spencer Trask agreed to put up $10 million under
one major condition: that they build a management team led by a
seasoned telecommunications executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really did not know where to look for one,'' recalled Land,
who before starting Cignal Global wanted to create a carpet
business for students living in the Washington University
dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   Once the word got out, Perlman was flooded with phone calls and
e-mails. But when prospective candidates learned how young the
controlling shareholders were, they bowed out. Others could not
keep pace with Cignal Global's ambitious growth plans.
</P>
<P>
   But Perlman remembered attending a telecom conference at which
Christopher Rooney spoke, and he had been impressed. So when
Rooney's name emerged, he having left Global One, Perlman made an
all-out effort to recruit him, including persistently calling his
home in Fredericksburg, Va. But his calls were not returned.
Finally, Perlman reached Rooney's wife by phone and pleaded his
case that Cignal Global was the company her husband needed to run
after spending a career at big corporations and stuffy
bureaucracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``She made the pitch for us, and thanks to her he returned our
phone calls,'' said Perlman. He and Land each talked to Rooney to
get a grasp of his management style, knowledge of networking
software, and family (seven grown children in a still strong
35-year marriage).
</P>
<P>
   ``They basically said to me, `We have gone this far, recognize
we cannot go much further, and feel you can help us,' which is
quite different than what you hear from flesh-peddling
headhunters,'' said Rooney, who before entering the
telecommunications field spent 20 years in the Marine Corps.
</P>
<P>
   But no sooner did they meet Rooney than the Cignal founders
began to have reservations about their future leader, fearing his
Marine career and experience at a large telecommunications company
would make him too rigid to lead an entrepreneurial company.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military background scared us,'' said Neal Isaacson, 37,
the company's chief financial officer, who remembers a Sunday
afternoon walk with Perlman and Land during which they discussed
whether they were making a mistake hiring Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   After several more meetings and a dinner with Rooney and his
wife in Boston, Land and Perlman offered Rooney a competitive
salary, stock options totaling about 5 percent of the company, and
an unusually long, five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, a key question was: Could the young founders adapt to
having a leadership style within an organization that would be
other than their own?'' said Rooney.
</P>
<P>
   Rooney _ after learning that two of the young founders still
rode their mountain bikes to work and listened to their mothers _
cautiously accepted, with a stipulation that that there be a trial
period to determine if everyone could work together.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting on three Friday afternoons, they discussed business
issues and company progress to gauge how the relationship was
going. Soon both sides felt comfortable, and Rooney and his wife
relocated to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We now see his military background as an asset in providing
structure to a young company,'' said Land. ``He is focused on
getting tasks done, and he gives us latitude to build out for the
future. I am thrilled to have him on board.''
</P>
<P>
   Perlman agreed, noting Cignal Global has added such big
customers as Harvard University, Thermo Electron Corp., the
Christian Science Monitor, and Sprint Canada. He predicts revenues
will reach $25 million this year. Rooney, however, is more
cautious, forecasting $15 million to $20 million in revenues.
</P>
<P>
   And while Perlman could be the most promising tycoon from his
Newton (Mass.) South High School class of 1993, potentially
following the famous footsteps of Bill Gates and Michael Dell, his
mother still hounds him about when he'll finish college.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing it a little less nowadays,'' Perlman said with a
smile.

HUSBAND `CALM' AT SCENE OF MURDER  
 (ADV: SECOND OF FOUR STORIES RECOUNTING WEEK'S TRIAL ACTION) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 BY JERRY KAMMER and VICTORIA HARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Scott Falater, who says he was sleepwalking when he
killed his wife, appeared strangely ``confused and calm'' a few
minutes after the bloody attack at the couple's Phoenix home, an
emergency medical technician testified Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked to me kind of in a daze and was acting kind of
confused,'' said John J. Nettles Jr., a defense witness in the
Maricopa County Superior Court murder trial that has drawn
nationwide attention.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles was on the crew of Phoenix firefighters that sought to
aide Yarmila Falater after her husband stabbed her 44 times and
dragged her into the backyard pool.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles, who estimated that he has responded to 200 homicides in
his 10-year career, said he was struck by Scott Falater's atypical
calm after the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't match up to me _ from what I'd seen outside _ that
this person had just done this,'' Nettles said. He said assailants
in such bloody attacks are normally ``sweating, pumped up'' and
agitated.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles' description contradicted testimony Monday from a
Phoenix policeman who described Scott Falater as out of breath, as
if he had just finished a physical workout.
</P>
<P>
   County prosecutor Juan Martinez aggressively challenged Nettles'
account. He suggested that the murder scene was too tense and
turbulent for Nettles to have given careful attention to Falater's
demeanor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your attention was more geared to what you were doing, wasn't
it?'' Martinez asked.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles held his ground. ``We are taught to be aware of our
surroundings because we are in the middle of a violence incident,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also challenged Nettles' testimony that Falater
had asked, ``What's going on here? Where's my wife? What's
happening?''
</P>
<P>
   But Nettles insisted he had either heard Falater's expressions
of confusion or had heard another firefighter repeat the questions
in a post-incident discussion designed to help the firefighters
deal with their stress.
</P>
<P>
   Nettles recollection in court squared with testimony of the
Phoenix police officer who arrested Falater. ``He said `What's
wrong? What's going on?' '' Officer Kemp Layden testified.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then pursued questions that aimed to show that Nettles
was sympathetic to Falater. Nettles acknowledged that he and
Falater are members of the same Mormon stake and that his son had
received math tutoring from Falater's daughter, Megan. But Nettles
also said that he had never seen Scott Falater before that bloody
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor also attempted to undermine Nettles' credibility
by reacting skeptically to the firefighter's claim that he didn't
know the murder victim was Yarmila Falater until the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   Defending his inability to recognize the victim, Nettles said,
``Let's put it this way. When somebody's alive, sometimes they put
off a different look than when they're in that state.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Falater, 44, an engineer, showed emotion for the first
time in trial Tuesday. He dabbed at at his eyes as the county
medical examiner described Yarmila's wounds.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorneys are expected to call some of Falater's friends
and relatives to testify this week that Falater has strong
character and that the couple had a loving marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Michael Kimerer has told jurors that Yarmila
was the ``only woman'' Scott had ever known.
</P>
<P>
   But court records and statements made in pretrial hearings
indicate that strains had developed in their 20-year marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Although the two were virgins when they married, Yarmila went to
the medical office in 1990 and discovered she had a sexually
transmitted disease, Martinez said at a pretrial hearing Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez asked Judge Ronald S. Reinstein to allow a medical
worker to testify that when Yarmila asked how she got the disease,
the worker replied that Falater was probably cheating on her.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Reinstein, however, refused to allow the witness to
testify during the trial, saying the incident was so long ago, it
could not be considered a motive for murder.

BACKSTREET BOYS' ``MILLENNIUM'' JIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   That high-pitched wail you hear isn't the new Backstreet Boy.
It's the sound of Garth Brooks spilling tears in his beer over
having his record for opening-week album sales toppled by five
pretty boys from Florida. The Backstreet Boys' new CD
``Millennium'' released last Tuesday, sold 1,133,505 copies in its
first week of release. That beats the country superstar's record of
1,085,373 in first-week sales, set late last year for Brooks'
``Double Live'' CD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Millennium'' moved an astounding half a million copies the
first day of release. Which means that plenty of people are moved
by the Backstreet Boys. Most of them are young, female, and
floating in that ether-like state of pubescent delirium where cute
boys who can sing inspire a passion of frightening proportions. And
don't the Boys know it. There's a theme to this project: ``It's
Gotta Be You,'' ``I Need You Tonight,'' ``Don't Wanna Lose You
Now,'' ``Back To Your Heart,'' ``No One Else Comes Close.'' And
that's not even the half of it.
</P>
<P>
   Wisely opting not to mess with a winning formula (imagine if
they'd made a go at credibility), the Boys roll out tender
heartbreakers and R&AMP;B-Lite tracks that play like shiny new toys hot
off the assembly line. With the help of Swedish hit-meister Max
Martin (Britney Spears), the Boys follow the buffed-to-a-glow dots
to the lowest common dance-pop denominator. In other words, there
is nothing even remotely inventive about these tunes.
</P>
<P>
   That said, the Backstreet Boys bring it off with irresistible,
pristine, teen-idol style. You can almost see the billowing smoke
and flashing lights as the album's opening cut, ``Larger Than
Life,'' rotates like prime cut on its swaggering, synthesized axis.
That's followed by ``I Want It That Way,'' a sleek,
acoustic-guitar-based love song that courses along,
meandering-river-like, in eternal midtempo.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the album generally toggles back and forth between
the two models _ a Spanish flourish here, a bona-fide rock riff
there _ anchored by the sweet, tight harmonies that power this
speeding train. As far as lyrics go, suffice it to say the themes
are simple and self-evident (see song titles), with the exception
of ``The Perfect Fan,'' which is about _ and this should seal the
Boys' destiny as every good little girl's dream date _ none other
than their moms.

DEAL MAKER, DEAL BREAKER
 &HT;    WITH SUPERAGENT BORAS BY HIS SIDE, ALEX RODRIGUEZ FACES FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Almost as soon as it happened, the richest contract in
baseball history _ $105 million! Seven years! _ was old news.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Boras, the agent who had secured it from the Los Angeles
Dodgers for pitcher Kevin Brown, stepped away from the podium at
the winter meetings in Nashville. The press conference was breaking
up, and it was time for follow-up questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must have been 100 reporters,'' Boras recalled recently
at his office in Irvine, Calif. ``First question, `What's Alex
Rodriguez worth?' The ink wasn't dry on Kevin Brown, and the focus
was Alex.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras called Rodriguez that night. It was incredible where the
market had gone, he told Rodriguez, who suspected that his agent
had surprised even himself. Boras advised the Mariners shortstop to
be prepared: His future was becoming an issue before it had even
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, when the Mariners struggled early this season,
trading Rodriguez became the latest solution. He can't possibly
re-sign when his contract comes up after the 2000 season, the
thinking went _ not with Ken Griffey Jr. due the same year, not in
this market, not with that agent.
</P>
<P>
   But trade A-Rod? It's not as easy as it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Alex may be the most difficult player to trade in major league
history,'' Boras said. ``The Mariners, to trade him, are going to
want what? Not one, not two, maybe three premium young players,
established major league players, a whole package of things. What's
the other team going to require? A contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, if it came to that, Alex would have to want to
sign and do something and go, so it's really going to boil down to
Alex's decision anyway. So when you say you can trade the player, I
would say, not unless you're going to really trade Alex for
something that is wholly below his marketplace, because that team
isn't going to give that much unless they knew they could sign him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're this good, you control the steering, the brake and
the gas pedal of this car. I really believe that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez hears the trade talk _ which amounts not so much to
rumors as to opinions and predictions _ and said he's surprised by
how little it bothers him. In the third year of a four-year, $10.6
million contract, he's not only secure for life, but secure in his
conviction that whatever happens, he's done right by Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I've been good to this city, I know this city's been
good to me and I have a clean conscience,'' Rodriguez said. ``I've
had a great time here and I really, sincerely want the best for
Seattle. And if it's going to take a championship team to get me
out of here, then that's what I want for Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can go somewhere else and help another team, but if they can
go out and get three good pitchers for me or two good pitchers and
a young shortstop or whatever, that's fine. I just know, what I
feel most great about is they've only invested $11 million in me,
and I would have played six years here and given them a lot for
their money.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners have said all along they will not trade Rodriguez
this year, and will resume talks on a contract extension this
winter. No offers have been made, but when they met with Boras
during spring training, the Mariners tried to convey how much
Rodriguez means to their future, and how much they respect him.
</P>
<P>
   That message came through, said Boras, who expects such respect
to be ``the foundation to a good negotiation.'' When the Mariners
said they intend to re-sign Rodriguez, that told Boras they believe
they have the money.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, everything will depend on how the Mariners'
assessment of the market matches Boras'. Only now, Boras said, is
he beginning to seriously prepare, searching for comparable players
throughout history, getting a gauge on exactly why Rodriguez is so
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   And when Scott Boras goes to work, that's when things get
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   XXXXXXXXXX
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry Colangelo came into baseball, the Arizona
Diamondbacks chairman learned about Boras by way of comparison.
Colangelo, who also owns the NBA's Phoenix Suns, was told that
Boras was the ``David Falk of baseball,'' a reference to the agent
for Michael Jordan, Patrick Ewing and others.
</P>
<P>
   ``My attitude toward Scott Boras was, if we're going to be
successful in our business, we're going to need to develop a
relationship with Scott Boras,'' Colangelo said. ``He represents a
number of players in the league that could somewhere, somehow have
a real impact on us. And that was true.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Colangelo's team ever threw a pitch, it threw significant
dollars at three Boras clients. Before its inaugural season last
year, Arizona signed shortstop Jay Bell, pitcher Andy Benes and
catcher Jorge Fabregas, who got a two-year deal immediately after
losing to the Diamondbacks in arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   There is no denying Boras' influence on the industry. His cause
celebre is the draft, where he has represented five No. 1 overall
picks and memorable holdout J.D. Drew. His often drawn-out
negotiations and industry-rocking demands cause scouts to warn
players against choosing him. Boras believes the draft is behind
much of the venom directed at him, like the headline on a New York
Times profile calling him ``The Most Hated Man In Baseball.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras knows that comes with the territory, but the 46-year-old
still chafes at the characterization. He was, he said, an Illinois
farmboy with nothing who has built a life from the game.
</P>
<P>
   A former infielder/outfielder, Boras still wears a ring Stan
Musial gave him for winning the minor league player of the year
award in the Cardinals' organization in 1976. When his four-year
career ended in 1977, Boras earned a doctorate in industrial
pharmacology and a law degree at the University of the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   A class on contract law led him back to baseball, and his first
clients were Mariners pitcher Bill Caudill and Cleveland infielder
Mike Fischlin, both former teammates. His company now employs 24
people, including several former major leaguers, a former NASA
computer engineer and a sports psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   Boras gets his infamy from the draft, but he makes his money in
the majors. His 41 major-league clients will make nearly $100
million this year, and include some of the game's top players. Five
percent of those earnings _ a common commission for agents _ comes
to roughly $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows what every athlete makes, but no one knows what
an owner makes,'' Boras said. ``And as long as that stands that
way, the villain will rest in this chair. I tell my clients, that's
my job. Don't worry about that. My job is to make sure that you are
able to focus, that you are comfortable and that you will be
received in the (proper) manner. If I'm held accountable for being
this perceived greedy, money-oriented person, so be it. You and I
both know who I really am.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners first baseman David Segui thought he knew who Boras was
before Rodriguez introduced them over lunch last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's so different from the public perception,'' Segui said.
``Before I knew him, I didn't like him. People say he's greedy and
arrogant, but he's the complete opposite of that. He's the most
down-to-earth, respectful guy, and he loves and respects the game
of baseball. That's very important. He believes in playing the game
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing that impressed Segui, he said, was that Boras
didn't talk about money at their first meeting. That would come
soon enough, after Segui fired his agent and hired Boras.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very good at being able to forsee market changes,'' said
Segui, a free agent-to-be who turned down a three-year offer worth
about $12 million from the Mariners this spring. ``You know you're
going to get what you're worth.''
</P>
<P>
   Fischlin, who works for Boras out of Georgia, said Boras
routinely works until 2 or 3 in the morning and has every contract
in the majors committed to memory. He lives in the numbers, both
financial and statistical, and his preparation is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very hard worker, and he out-works most other agents,''
said Roger Jongewaard, the M's vice president for scouting and
player development, who has wrangled with Boras several times.
``He's very aggressive, and he's been very successful. He's taught
me a lot, that leverage is everything, that without a deadline,
nothing gets done. He uses the things that work best for him to the
fullest.''
</P>
<P>
   His ability to wait and wear down makes Boras successful, if not
popular with teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in a lot of instances, Scott creates more of an
adversarial relationship with clubs than some other agents do,''
said Philadelphia Phillies general manager Ed Wade, whose team
drafted Drew, then lost him after a year-long contract dispute.
``It's not at all times and it's not in every circumstance, but the
fact of the matter is, sometimes when negotiations are concluded,
there are some ill feelings between Scott and the club.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what Boras' clients want.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would you rather go to war with a poodle or a bulldog?'' said
Boston Red Sox catcher Jason Varitek, who held out for a year
before signing his first contract. ``He's a bulldog; I chose the
bulldog.''

`THIRTEENTH FLOOR' TAKES UNLUCKY LEAP INTO THE PAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
THE THIRTEENTH FLOOR 
Directed by: Josef Rusnak 
Screenplay by: Rusnak, Ravel Centeno-Rodriguez (based on Daniel
Galouye's novel, ``Simulacron 3'') 
Starring: Craig Bierko, Gretchen Mol, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dennis
Haysbert, Steven Schub, Armin Mueller-Stahl 
Running time: 120 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Vintage LA, circa 1937, steals ``The Thirteenth Floor,'' an
overwrought but underwritten sci-fi item that could have been a
witty metaphor for movies driven by special effects morphing, but
plummets pretty quickly out of contention. The subject of
make-believe universes has been pretty much exhausted for the
moment by ``The Matrix'' and``eXistenZ'' conceptually, and by
``Dark City'' visually, and this earnest but hopelessly foursquare
and depressingly humorless effort doesn't take it anywhere new.
About the best that can be said is that it begins promisingly, with
an elegantly dressed Armin Mueller-Stahl making his way through art
deco LA until he runs into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   We soon learn that he's a virtual reality guru inhabiting a
simulated universe of his own invention. Before long, his
assistant, played by Craig Bierko, stretches out on a table in the
mastermind's present-day downtown skyscraper, rolls into a sort of
CAT scan device, and beams himself back to 1937 to find out what
went wrong. We don't know it yet, but the best part of the film is
about over. It peaks after Bierko's searcher rides down La Cienega
Boulevard, with the HOLLYWOOD sign at his back, past uninhabited
hills dotted with oil derricks. When he gets back to the present,
he tells his aide, played by Vincent D'Onofrio, that the
simulations are good but the colorization is still a little off.
</P>
<P>
   It's true, it's amusing, and it's the only part of the film
that's amazing. It's not just that the color is off, it's the way
in which it's off. The views of prewar LA we see are essentially
sepia-toned, as if they've been lifted off old postcards and
crudely colorized in the way that postcards of the time were. A lot
of the action takes place in a stylish old invented hotel. And the
simulated world is inhabited by dead ringers from the present.
Bierko's character is a bank clerk. Mueller-Stahl's is a Pasadena
bookseller. And D'Onofrio's is a bartender who sneaks a look at a
letter and becomes enraged when he learns he's not real, but only a
character in a game. There's also a tres '30s femme fatale, played
by Gretchen Mol, and a murder.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller-Stahl emerges with dignity, even as the script seems to
evaporate around him, and D'Onofrio, that most versatile and
underappreciated of actors, finds ways to jolt the angry
bartender's role to life. But Bierko is a blank and Moll brings
only her iconographic looks to the table _ and nothing much else.
What are supposed to be love scenes between them are embarrassingly
devoid of anything even remotely suggesting vital impulse, which
guarantees that the already weak ending is a total letdown. ``The
Thirteenth Floor'' looks great, at least when it stays in the past,
and especially when the bartender sees the truth. But it
self-destructs in the present, which mostly unfolds in a cavernous
penthouse with all sorts of money for decor but none for lighting,
to judge by the absence of candlepower. As for the future, ``The
Thirteenth Floor'' has no future.

   SEATTLE: ``I chose the bulldog.''
</P>
<P>
   So did Rodriguez, whom Boras first spotted at a tournament in
Monterrey, Mexico, when Rodriguez was 14. The two met a year later,
before Rodriguez's junior year of high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had so much information and knowledge and wisdom,''
Rodriguez said. ``It was all facts, everything he said was backed
up by numbers and facts. Other agents were making just a lot of
empty promises, not telling me anything bad. He told me both sides
of everything. His truthfulness was what separated him from
everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Mariners took Rodriguez first in the 1993 draft, Boras
took the M's to the last possible day before securing a $1 million
signing bonus. Other agents approached Rodriguez during his brief
stay in the minors, but Boras and Fischlin were never far from him,
seeing him about two days every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The close relationship continues. On vacation with his family
for the first time in two years this April, Boras left early to be
with Rodriguez after his knee surgery. Boras' own career had been
cut short by a knee injury, and he knew Rodriguez's family was far
away, in Miami. The visit meant a lot, Rodriguez said, and he
doesn't make any life decisions without consulting Boras.
</P>
<P>
   That includes his 1996 contract. Boras advised Rodriguez he was
forfeiting some $10 million by letting the Mariners buy out his
arbitration years, but Rodriguez wanted to secure his family. He
presented his plan, explained that he knew what he was doing, and
promised to defend Boras if people criticized the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to make me feel good,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, who never has complained about the contract, thinks
people forget that the same agent who negotiated the game's biggest
contract also negotiated its biggest bargain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably the easiest contract in Mariner history was the one
that I did,'' Rodriguez said. ``It was about a month and a half of
conversation and we got it done, that quick. And I didn't read this
huge article about how nice Scott was and how helpful he is to the
teams. I must have missed it. No one wrote about how generous he
was with the Mariners. But as soon as he gets the Kevin Brown
contract or whatever, they call him the biggest demon in baseball.
That's not fair.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez's point is that Boras works for the player, not the
other way around. It's a belief shared by others like Ben McDonald,
the No. 1 pick in the draft four years before Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ultimately, it's going to be Alex's decision,'' said McDonald,
recovering from a shoulder injury with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays.
``Scott's not going to take Alex away from Seattle if Alex wants to
be there. He's going to give the information to him and tell him,
`It's your call, do what you want to do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball executives have heard that before.
</P>
<P>
   ``His clients are very well-prepared on what their position
should be in the media,'' Wade said. ``They say that they control
the situation, and that Scott works for them, and I think a lot of
things are well-scripted. I'm not saying that's a bad thing or
underhanded, not at all. What I am saying is he prepares his
clients very well for what the process should be and how it should
be handled.''
</P>
<P>
   If Rodriguez hits free agency, it should be an unprecedented
financial bonanza _ in tandem with a Griffey free agency, of
course. That was the case with Brown, who left the San Diego Padres
and broke the $100 million barrier. Looking back, said Padres
general manager Kevin Towers, San Diego never had a chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Scott and Kevin would have just said, `Hey, listen. We're
gonna take the highest dollar. We don't care where it is, we're
going to take what they're going to pay us,' that would have been
fine, because I know we couldn't have been the highest,'' Towers
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``...If Scott's got leverage, he's going to use it. If we would
have approached Kevin Brown when we first got him about a
four-year, five-year deal, $10 million (per year), I don't think he
would have taken it. I think he would have said, `Hey, I've got
confidence in my player that he'll have a big year, I'm going to
take him out on the market and we'll set records.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll take his chances with his players, and if he's got a
chance to take him out on the free-agent market, he will. And if
he's got leverage, he's tough. He knows he's holding the golden
egg.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know Alex's situation, (but my guess is) he'll
definitely wait. Because the closer you get to free agency, the
more the dollars go up. I mean, A-Rod's value is not going to come
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez maintains that he'd love to stay in Seattle, under the
right circumstances, and the biggest factor is the Mariners'
competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
   But dollars will be an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``His contract will be very unique, because there are things
that I believe this type of player requires to assure his stature
economically, apart from most major league players, because he
brings so much value to a franchise,'' Boras said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be terms and conditions that apply to Alex that
probably a club would never do in any other situation, because my
job is to place him in a position that is worthy of what he's done
and his commitment. I don't mean just the dollar figure, I mean
other elements that relate to the term of the contract and what his
stature would remain in the marketplace, all those kinds of
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Boras would not specify what he meant by unique, but it's worth
noting that Brown's contract came with 12 annual flights on a
private jet for his family. Mariners president Chuck Armstrong also
is unaware of the specifics.
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong's meetings with Boras have been ``very cordial,'' he
said. But when negotiations move into the specific, Armstrong is
hoping to get feedback from Boras along the way. One of Boras'
stated strategies _ ``You have to provide a lot of `No's' to get to
`Yes''' _ could make things difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott's very creative, very smart,'' Armstrong said. ``He
negotiates more contracts than we do, and he knows his player. So
what does his player want, what does it take to make him happy,
what would he want to have to stay here or why would he want to go
someplace else?
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to tell us those things to see if we can match goals
with him. I mean, one of the frustrating things in some contract
negotiations is they just kind of receive offers and they just say
no, and then you ask, well, what is it you want me to say?''
</P>
<P>
   Armstrong points out that Boras has returned players to the same
club before. The Yankees re-signed Bernie Williams last winter for
seven years and $87.5 million, and Atlanta re-signed Greg Maddux
(five years, $57.5 million) during the last year of his contract,
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Boras could bring Rodriguez back to the Mariners. Or he could
take him elsewhere. The only certain thing is that a 23-year-old
megastar belongs to Seattle through 2000. And to hear Boras tell
it, the Mariners might be wise to keep him here.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when nobody ever believed the Yankees would
sign Bernie, and they did, and they used him that year to win a
world championship,'' Boras said. ``The one thing I would say to
the Mariners and everyone else _ and I don't know what Alex's
decision is going to be _ but I would keep every door open in every
way to allow for the player's decision to evolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``You run the risk in that scenario of not getting something for
the player, but remember what you're getting from him. You lose the
player for a year, you may lose a world championship. They've never
won one up there.''

WITNESSES PAINT SLEEPWALKER AS KIND HUSBAND  
 (ADV: THIRD OF FOUR STORIES RECOUNTING WEEK'S TRIAL ACTION) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Six witnesses Wednesday helped defense attorneys paint
a portrait of Scott Falater as a kind, conscientious and
unflappable man who had no plausible motive for brutally murdering
his wife at their Phoenix home.
</P>
<P>
   Their testimony, at times conveying bewilderment and anguish,
deepened the mystery surrounding the 1996 night when Falater claims
to have been sleepwalking when he stabbed his wife 44 times,
dragged her into the backyard pool, then hid his blood-splattered
pajamas.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of testimony in the Maricopa County Superior Court
trial also probed one of the first-degree-murder case's underlying
themes _ the couple's relationship with the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of Yarmila Falater described frequent recreational
walks at a mall when Scott's wife talked contentedly about family
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the things she said, it seemed to me that they were doing
everything according to how you'd wish your life could be, by
having a good job and kids and savings and your church,'' Sarah
Elizabeth Biggs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like that was the All-American dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Daryl Williams, who described Scott, 44, as ``easygoing, calm
and unflappable,'' said the former Motorola engineer was bewildered
in the aftermath of his wife's death.'
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a state of trying to figure out what happened,''
said Williams, who became friends with Scott when they taught
early-morning seminary classes for Mormon youth. ``Scott had no
recollection of what happened, in my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Balls, a former Mormon bishop who worked closely with
Scott in church affairs, said the couple ``cared for each other,
went places together and were happy.``
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a good relationship to me,'' said Balls, who
told of attending the surprise party that Scott had for Yarmila's
40th birthday, about a year before her death.
</P>
<P>
   Like Wednesday's other witnesses, Balls said he had been stunned
to learn that Yarmila had died so violently and that Scott had been
charged with murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't fit,'' he said. ``It was as far off the wall as
anything I could ever think of. . . . It's not the Scott I knew in
my 10-year relationship with him.''
</P>
<P>
   During his cross-examination, prosecutor Juan Martinez reacted
skeptically to the glowing descriptions of the Falaters' marriage
as a contented relationship rooted in devotion to the Mormon
Church.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez had earlier told jurors that Yarmila, 41 at her death,
was a restless woman who resented the church's demands on her time
and resisted Scott's desire to have more children.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs acknowledged that Yarmila had complained about the church,
saying, ``The more you do, the more they want you to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``She felt overwhelmed sometimes,'' said Biggs, recalling
Yarmila as a strong-willed, independent woman who had decided
firmly against having more children. The Falaters had a boy and a
girl, both teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   But Biggs downplayed Yarmila's discontent with the church,
calling it a typical reaction of a woman who feels stretched too
thin.
</P>
<P>
   Biggs also disputed Martinez's claim that Yarmila expressed her
unhappiness with a physical appearance that became ``unkempt.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had nice clothes and was always fussing, wondering
if her hair was good,'' Biggs said. ``I can't imagine why anyone
would say she was unkempt.''
</P>
<P>
   In an exchange with defense attorney Lori Voepel, Biggs attacked
the core of the prosecution's case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you believe that what occurred was the result of major
marital problems?'' Voepel asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's totally false,'' Biggs responded firmly.
``There were no problems that were that major.''
</P>
<P>
   Voepel asked if Biggs would tell the jury if Yarmila had spoken
of troubles in the marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Biggs replied, near tears. ``Anything to make some
sense out of it (Yarmila's death).
</P>
<P>
   Under Martinez questioning, former bishop Terry Lee Call
acknowledged he had seen a tearful Yarmila at the back of the
church shortly after a change in local church boundaries cut her
off from old friends.
</P>
<P>
   Call said Yarmila had declined his offer to talk about the
problem. But he acknowledged receiving a letter from Yarmila that
he had refused to show the prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Call said the church's ``priest-penitent privilege'' prevented
him from showing Martinez the letter. He insisted that he would not
have testified that the Falaters had a solid marriage if
confidential information suggested otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   A Motorola shipping clerk who worked under Scptt spoke glowingly
of the engineer, who claims a history of sleepwalking and says
work-related stresses had disrupted his sleep patterns at the time
of Yarmila's death.
</P>
<P>
   Wyvaughna Mullins said that in her 35 years at Motorola she had
never had a manager who matched Scott's consideration and kindness.
</P>
<P>
   Mullins said that if she were asked to pick her top five bosses,
Scott ``would be number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nobody who comes close to his attitude and the way he
treated people,'' she said. &QL;

THERE'S A LOT TO LOVE ABOUT `NOTTING HILL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
NOTTING HILL 
Directed by: Roger Michell 
Screenplay by: Richard Curtis 
Starring: Julia Roberts, Hugh Grant, Hugh Bonneville, Emma
Chambers, James Dreyfus, Rhys Ifans, Tim McInnerny, Gina McKee 
Running time: 123 minutes 
Rated: PG-13 (sexual content and brief strong language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Notting Hill'' is the winning romantic comedy every summer not
only awaits, but counts on to offer escape from the big-bang action
movies and other Hollywood offerings that come on like heavy
machinery and play like something written by a committee. This one
has enormous charm, a luminous Julia Roberts, and a confidently
self-deprecating Hugh Grant as the commoner and bookstore owner who
dares hope he can get something romantic going with the closest
he'll ever get to real-world royalty. We refer, of course, not to
an inhabitant of the House of Windsor, but the House of Warner. Or,
in this case, Universal.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is an American film goddess cleverly set to work playing
both sides of her real-life film-goddess status. To buy into
``Notting Hill,'' we have to suspend disbelief that a star would
really want to opt out of the whole paparazzi craziness, and not
just hire extra security while soldiering bravely on, paying the
price of being on the A-list. But there is a genuine impulse in
Roberts to just bolt from it all, and the public has seen enough of
it to believe in her skittishness. In short, the role wouldn't work
with a lot of stars in it, but it does work with Roberts.
</P>
<P>
   It also works for another reason. She's among the most
thin-skinned of actors. She's emotional litmus, able to convince us
of the force of her longing. Lucikly for the film, we believe
what's in her eyes when she plays her big romantic scene. She's
also poised enough to convincingly project the cool take-charge
manner a star of her magnitude must project in public. She's
touching in the wisely few moments of romantic yearning she's given
because. Otherwise, she's pretty composed, not only in her scenes
of professional dispatch, but in those where she finds ways to
relax and be gracious to people who aren't stars.
</P>
<P>
   The most warming scene is when Grant's bookseller takes her to
dinner with his sister and a houseful of his old pals, and it's
brought off with rare and disarming warmth. How they get together
is immaterial. They're the stars, so you know they're going to be
brought together. In this case, Roberts' Anna Scott, shopping
Portobello Road in sunglasses, wanders into Grant's bookshop,
enjoys a bright, friendly exchange, and wanders out, only to
collide with him a few moments later, have him drench her in orange
juice, and accept his offer to come to his nearby house to dry off
and change.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the film's biggest challenge is to keep bringing them
together in ways that don't demolish our wish to hold onto the
fantasy. This it does, in ways more confident and conventional and
less idiosyncratic than ``Four Weddings and a Funeral.'' This new
caper not only essentially asks Grant to play the same role he
played in the film that launched his career, but reunites him with
that film's producer (Duncan Kenworthy) and writer (Richard
Curtis). It also gives him a much more substantial American over
whom to pine than Andie McDowell was handed in ``Four Weddings and
a Funeral.''
</P>
<P>
   But although ``Notting Hill'' is more conventional and its
eccentricity has been toned down, Curtis still gives us the
impression that he's drawing us into a longtime circle of London
pals and in a neighborhood so unproblematically diverse that it
becomes part of the film's fairy-tale world. Neither Roberts nor
Grant are given high farce to play. The eccentricity is mostly
attended to by Rhys Ifans as Grant's scruffy Welsh housemate and
Emma Chambers as Grant's ditzy sister. Still, a more naturalistic
tone prevails here, most persuasively anchored by Gina McKee's
wheelchair-bound married friend. In short, there's a lot of warm,
simpatico social solidity against which the jangly life of the
American film star (amplified by a funny cameo from an unbilled
Alec Baldwin) is contrasted.
</P>
<P>
   Grant recaptures the career ground lost in his offscreen
peccadillos by coming on hesitantly and pretending to be surprised
at his character's high self-regard. But it's the sum total of the
persona Roberts puts before us that makes the film sublime. She's
not all gossamer longing for magical interludes in a moonlit park.
At times, she's impulsive, even destructive. But she convincingly
inhabits both the public situations she has learned to navigate and
a wistful longing for an emotional purity to which she can never
return. Roberts's character may be fictional, but she's not all
that fictional, and her nerve endings are the real thing. Finally,
here's the '90s equivalent of Audrey Hepburn in ``Roman Holiday.''
Even in its big mass-market moments, Roberts makes ``Notting Hill''
tender as well as trendy, and it makes all the difference.

   Ricky Martin was the center of the pop universe, at least for a
week. He's a former child star whose performance at the Grammy
awards signaled a flood of interest in his hip-shaking Latin pop.
That interest may not be sustained, given the fickle nature of the
marketplace _ remember Gerardo's short-lived ``Rico Suave'' or Los
Del Rios's ``Macarena''? _ but don't bet against it this time.

   Martin's English-language debut album _ simply titled ``Ricky
Martin'' _ just sold 660,000 copies in its opening week, although
that record was topped this week by the Backstreet Boys. His
Spanglish single, ``Livin' La Vida Loca,'' hit No. 1, pumped up by
a Latin horn arrangement and a theme of ``the millennium party song
from hell,'' cowriter Desmond Child says. ``She'll make you live
her crazy life until you go insane,'' the lyric says.
</P>
<P>
   Child, however, believes that the recent chart frenzy ``doesn't
mean a Latin music explosion, but it's a Ricky Martin explosion.''
He adds: ``Some people are trying to tie it in with a lot of other
Latin artists who haven't even released records yet . . . but most
of that is the same old generic stuff that's been coming out of
Miami for years _ the stuff that you listen to and then want to
kill yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Another faction believes, however, that Martin's runaway success
_ he also just did ``Saturday Night Live'' and has lined up Oprah
Winfrey, Jay Leno, and David Letterman like a bunch of dominoes _
marks a milestone for Latin inroads into Anglo pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world is becoming smaller, and people now understand
different cultures,'' says Emilio Estefan, the dean of Latin
producers (he helped produce five tracks on Martin's album) and
husband of crossover star Gloria Estefan. ``Latin music is going to
stay. There will be a lot more fusions, but definitely Latin
percussion will remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Latino radio stations are basking in Martin's glory.
``It's great for us. It's giving Latin music a very high profile,''
says Alberto Vasallo, vice president of Boston's Radiolandia (1330
AM). ``For many people who are not Latinos, this is their first
immersion in this very hot music. It's kind of like when rap and
hip-hop hit in the late '70s. You're going to hear a lot more
crossover artists.''
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Martin is so big on Radiolandia that his hit
``Livin' La Vida Loca'' has led to a parody version in which on-air
personnel offer their own lyrics above the music. A sample from
morning DJ Johnny Peguero: ``Johnny, who wakes you up in the
morning, is also living `La Vida Loca.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Even apart from Martin, it's hard to deny the emergence of Latin
music into the mainstream. Latin record sales increased from $491
million in 1997 to $571 million last year, according to the
Recording Industry Association of America. That's still a small
part of the overall $14 billion domestic market, but it's an
increase that has record labels, notably Sony Records (which has
Martin under contract), flocking to sign Latin artists with
crossover potential.
</P>
<P>
   How times change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, when I did `Conga','' Estefan says of his
wife's first hit, ``I was almost thrown out of Sony Records. They
said, `Take the congas out and the trumpets out of the song.' . . .
But now, Gloria and me and Ricky are living the American Dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan recalls a fateful conversation with Martin seven years
ago. ``I told Ricky then, `You're going to cross over.' He said,
`It will never happen.' I said, `It's going to be hard, but let's
start making demos.' And we stayed with it, and you could see that
it was going to happen. He became famous with his last two Spanish
albums, and when you saw him play in places like France, Germany,
and Brazil, where they don't speak Spanish as a first language, you
could see them react with the same excitement. You knew the wave
would come to America, too. And then came the Grammy awards.''
</P>
<P>
   Estefan has also become the pivotal figure for English-speaking
artists looking for credibility in the Latin market. He did a Latin
remix of Will Smith's ``Welcome to Miami'' and a recent Latin remix
of Lenny Kravitz's ``Hey Mama,'' which went to No. 1 in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never erase your heritage. I'm proud of where I came
from,'' says the Cuban-born Estefan. ``I feel very Cuban, but I
also feel very Anglo. We are immigrants who grew up listening to
Motown and the Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin has a similar bilingual bent and has soaked up the
influence of many cultures. He was born in Puerto Rico (his dad was
a psychologist, his mom an accountant) and became a member of the
teen group Menudo when he was 12. Menudo was a formula-prone group
whose management required that you leave by age 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Puerto Rico, you either joined the Little Leagues or you
joined Menudo. It was every kid's dream,'' says Robi Rosa, a former
Menudo mate who stayed in contact with Martin and wrote and
co-produced half the songs on Martin's new disc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky's always been an even-keeled guy _ very focused and very
positive,'' says Rosa. ``He offers a new energy, and everyone is
embracing it right now. He represents a new beginning, new hope.
And what I appreciate about Ricky is that he is interested in
finding a way to maintain his roots in pop, but also to push the
envelope.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin, who is expected to tour the US in the late summer or
fall, is most respected for his work ethic. ``He's a multitalented
guy. He can sing anything from Broadway to rock to salsa,'' says
Child, noting that he first met Martin two years ago after the
latter sang in ``Les Miserables'' on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always prepared,'' adds Child. ``Even if he's just flown
18 hours from Australia, he'll still stand there and sing for 12
hours. He wants to make sure he doesn't drop the ball on his end.''
Adds Rosa: ``He's a workaholic.''
</P>
<P>
   Child brought to Martin's new album some of the ``anthem-style''
hooks that he previously brought to Bon Jovi (on Bon Jovi hits
``You Give Love a Bad Name'' and ``Livin' on a Prayer''), to
Aerosmith (Child wrote ``Dude Looks Like a Lady,'' ``Angel,'' and
``Crazy''), and to Kiss.
</P>
<P>
   The new album was actually a long time coming and wasn't just
done after Martin's mega-exposure at the Grammys. ``We took our
time. It was a melding of different genres. It was very carefully
crafted,'' says Child, who grew up in Miami and whose mother, Elena
Casals, recorded a number of Latin songs. (His aunt, Olga Guillot,
made 56 albums.)
</P>
<P>
   Martin's new disc indeed ripples with a fresh energy at times
but is a guilty pleasure at others (especially in the teen-idol
knockoff ``Shake Your Bon Bon''). There are rock tracks, pop-salsa
dance tunes, two Diane Warren ballads (talk about going for the
commercial brass ring), a tasteful love song with Madonna (``Be
Careful,'' produced by William Orbit), and a reprise of the ``The
Cup of Life,'' the World Cup theme song. Martin sang it before 1.5
billion viewers of the World Cup in Paris and then for another
billion-plus watching the Grammys. The tune went to No. 1 in 22
countries.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the next Latino crossover wave? Observers say to
look for Jennifer Lopez, who starred in the film ``Selena'' and has
a new album next week; the Argentinian Giselle D'Cole and
Colombian-born Shakira, who both write their own songs; Elvis
Crespo, whose Spanish-language album just debuted on the Billboard
charts at No. 49; Menudo-like teen group MDO; and Marc Anthony, who
is about to record a duet with soul star Maxwell. (For another
duet, look for Gloria Estefan and `N Sync to do a song on the
soundtrack to the Meryl Streep film ``Fifty Violins'' this fall.)
</P>
<P>
   While the Ricky Martin phenomenon has given new juice to the
Latin surge, there may be an inevitable cloning that could tarnish
it. Of course, this is the same thing that happens to Anglo stars
as well, so perversely, it may be another sign that Latin music has
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Ricky, we'll probably see a female Ricky Martin and
a Ricky Martin all-boy group and a Ricky Martin all-girl group,''
says Child. ``It will be like the time when Bon Jovi hit it big.
Bon Jovi's success unleashed leagues of hair bands that we couldn't
get rid of until Kurt Cobain came along. Just watch: People are
going to ride Ricky's coattails, too.''

ANOTHER LIFE 
A Memoir of Other People 
By Michael Korda 
Random House, 530 pp., $26.95 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Start on Page 475 of this how-to book if you're a writer, or
even if not a writer but only a reader who's interested in the
writing process. At a press conference, Ronald Reagan is discussing
``his'' memoirs. ``I hear it's a terrific book!'' he says,
cheerfully. ``One of these days I'm going to have to read it
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   That is this book's theme in a nutshell. The image of Reagan, a
``writer'' not known for any interest in reading or writing _ or
even, intimate friends conceded, introspection _ dovetails nicely
with the image of absent-minded Simon &AMP; Schuster founder Max
Schuster. He advises stripper/author Gypsy Rose Lee, at the party
celebrating the publication of her novel: ``One of these days you
ought to write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Korda, editor in chief of Simon &AMP; Schuster, has buried inside
this garrulous, sometimes plodding memoir a brisk, fast-paced and
somewhat comic how-to about book publishing, which sounds like a
sort of out-of-town tryout for Hollywood and Hollywood celebrities.
Nobodies need not apply. In Korda's world, publishing is all about
deals, about the arcane process of (dis)assembling books, the
perversion of verbs like ``writing'' and the business itself. It's
a business, as opposed to, say, editing, which, Korda writes, is a
profession. This book is a study in the behavior of characters who
seem to be kindred anal obsessive-compulsives drawn to the
publishing process and determined to survive in it. If indeed
``process' is what it can be called.
</P>
<P>
   Korda is at his best when he's wry, often when he's listening to
people confiding in him. Playwright Sidney Kingsley describes in
excruciating detail his method of writing, prompting Korda to muse
that ``on no subject more so than their own writing are writers
more likely to be self-deceived, or, in conversation, more
boring.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the editor's job is not listening but maintaining the
``extracurricular'' reading of the ``sheer volume of material that
(has) to be read.'' It's analogous to the monk's ``getting up to go
to mass in the middle of the night.'' Editors, writes Korda,
``overwork and underachieve,'' spending weeks and months ``lovingly
rewriting a manuscript that was never worth anything in the first
place.''
</P>
<P>
   Every once in a while something resembling a literary
transaction occurs, as in the inspired reconstructive editing that
hallowed editor Robert Gottleib and assistant Nina Bourne performed
on Joseph Heller's manuscript of the legendary ``Catch-22.''
Gottlieb, in fact, is the closest to a universally beloved figure
in the book. All it requires for him to sell commercial fiction is
the ``energy and sincerity'' of the writer. Gottlieb is also a
pivotal figure, not least because he's not above applying to a
novel the antic show business dynamic of the movie business.
</P>
<P>
   With fiction, as Korda writes, the ``only limits are set by the
editor's energy and the author's willingness to live with big
changes. Character, motivation, and plot can be changed, subplots
and minor characters can be thrown out, whole scenes eliminated or
created from scratch.'' It's easier to do this with first
novelists, Korda writes, ``whose major anxiety is whether . . .
their book will ever get published at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Bestselling authors operate at a higher level. Congenital
bestseller Harold Robbins unwittingly submits to S&AMP;S two halves of
separate novels as one whole one that's due. He insists, to Korda's
anguish, that despite the incongruity, it's a novel that can be
published as is, that no one will notice. It's published as is. Not
a reader complains.
</P>
<P>
   Korda, who came from a moviemaking family, has a high opinion of
the screenwriter's approach to writing books. Screenwriters, he
writes, know how to do ``all the things that puzzle many novelists:
how to cut to the chase, how to maintain a consistent point of
view, how to work out motivation for every action and to prepare
the reader for sudden changes of plot, how to avoid flashbacks,
and, worse still, flash-forwards. A strong story line, divided into
clear scenes,'' is ``exactly what works for most readers of
fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   He also advises writers not to become trapped by their research.
Korda recalls what Robbins said about his bestselling rival Irving
Wallace, who, Robbins thought, wrote his fiction essentially to
justify his voluminous, fastidious research. Wallace wrote about
sex, Robbins believed, ``as if he had never experienced it.''
</P>
<P>
   Editors loom large in the picture, with, Korda writes, their
approach to the written word, starting with questions like ``How
can we fix this?'' and, more fundamentally, ``How . . . did we get
into this . . . and why?'' Editors are usually pivotal in the
decision/determination of whether a book works or requires massive
cutting. This book, although poorly titled and itself a candidate
for hefty cutting, is useful. A suggested better title: ``Bonfires
of the Vanity Press: How We Publish and Sell People Who Can't Write
_ or Won't.''

`SOUTHIE' CAPTURES NEIGHBORHOOD SPIRIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
SOUTHIE 
Directed by: John Shea 
Screenplay by: James Cummings, John Shea 
Starring: Donnie Wahlberg, Rose McGowan, James Cummings, John Shea,
Anne Meara, Lawrence Tierney, Steve Koslowski, Amanda Peet, Will
Arnett, Josh Marchette, Robert Wahlberg, Jeffrey Cook, Lenny Clark,
Jere Shea 
Running time: 95 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and pervasive language) 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Authenticity and a collective feeling of heartfelt urgency carry
``Southie'' past a certain lack of originality and technical
finesse. Although it was filmed before ``Good Will Hunting,''
``Monument Ave.,'' and ``Next Stop Wonderland,'' it's only now
finding its way to filmgoers looking for the next movie that speaks
in a convincing Boston accent. In the case of ``Southie,'' it's not
what it says but how it says it that generates its appeal. There's
no question that Jimmy Cummings, who wrote the film with director
John Shea and who also stars in it, has successfully captured the
flavor of his South Boston world, or that Shea's direction
transfers it to the screen with gritty intensity.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, the actors bring to their roles the kind of rightness
that can't be learned in an acting school. They need it to carry
them past contrived structuring and more than a few melodramatic
gangster-movie-plot cliches. Donnie Wahlberg's central character,
Danny Quinn, relies on a sort of anguished caring in the role of
the guy who returns to the old neighborhood knowing what a
minefield it is, especially if he's going to stay sober and avoid
the violence that caused him to leave in the first place. Guiltily,
he feels obliged to replace his late father, killed while working
for the local godfather, Lawrence Tierney's impressively stony old
patriarch, Colie Powers. By himself, Danny is tough enough. His
problem is that his family is vulnerable and his friends are weak.
</P>
<P>
   His two younger brothers are in thrall to a vicious rival crime
lord, whose son is Danny's old enemy. Danny's sister has an alcohol
problem. His mother, played by the ever-valuable Anne Meara, has a
gallant heart but a damaged one, and no medical insurance. And his
lifelong neighborhood pal is desperate to draw him into a
get-rich-quick scheme running an illegal after-hours club. He
resists, but when the bad guys freeze him out of the union, he's
pushed into the deal. That puts him on a collision course with his
old nemesis, the gangster prince, played by Cummings with a
brashness born of knowing he's got a tough father covering his
back. Cummings brings to the role a slightly crazed quality that's
an enjoyably over-the-top throwback to old gangster movies, while
Wahlberg satisfyingly balances toughness against conflicting
demands of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Wahlberg succeeds in making us feel that Danny's internal
struggle counts for more than the inevitable tough-guy face-offs.
Tierney and Meara anchor ``Southie'' with authority at either end
of the emotional spectrum, giving lessons on how to skirt cliche,
strongly embodying the past in a film that's in large part about
the tug of the past. Rose McGowan will get to you, too, as Danny's
suffering sister herded into detox. Shea is a plus as a police
officer cousin vainly trying to supply a voice of reason. The
smaller roles are done with idiomatic rightness, both those within
the neighborhood and a few from outside it, such as Amy Stiller's
note-perfect overworked doctor in a hospital scene. There are
technical rough patches, and a few too many actors wear a few too
many caps _ the only costuming lapse. But juicy acting and an
intense individual and communal commitment that seems to boil up
from the streets carry ``Southie'' past its structural and
technical limitations.

THREE FISH CREATE BLISS WITH `THE QUIET TABLE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As a Pearl Jam side projects go, there's nothing quite like
Three Fish _ a mystical, trance-based act that has more to do with
Sufi poetry than with Seattle grunge. Three Fish features Pearl Jam
bassist Jeff Ament teaming up with South African-born singer-friend
Robbie Robb and drummer Richard Stuverud to make music that recalls
Donovan's hippie journeys in the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Together, Three Fish have sailed up the Nile River in Egypt for
inspiration _ and they just recorded their second album, ``The
Quiet Table,'' in a high-ceilinged barn near Ament's Montana home.
There, the percussive hand drums and exotic instruments such as
sitar, oud, and saz forged an ambient charm with resonant Western
guitars and often chant-like vocals.
</P>
<P>
   ``This album is a little bit more song-based than the first,''
says Ament, ``but there's still a lot of experimenting and music
that came from laughter and late-night conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like getting together with a buddy you haven't seen in
a couple of years and going camping,'' Ament says of Three Fish.
</P>
<P>
   Three Fish isn't the most commercial band that you'll hear this
year, but the band members like it that way. They are dedicated to
subtle surprises, from the chimingly acoustic ``Tremor Void'' to
the more electric, U2-like rock of ``All These Things.'' There's
also the bell-like ``Shiva and the Astronaut,'' along with a song
about Princess Diana (``It takes more than a moving car to steal
your breath away,'' a verse says) and, in another song, the
Egyptian chant of ``ah nu tayru,'' which means ``unity uppermost
showed, which is a brilliant name for God,'' says Robb.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very open relationship that we have,'' says Ament. ``I
don't think we have any expectations. We don't have that many
expectations in Pearl Jam, either, but there are subconscious
things that set in with Pearl Jam. Whereas with this band, we try
not to think that we are even going to make a record. We just get
together and play music.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is a blissfully meditative album unlike anything out
there in the chaotic days of the late '90s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Bits and Pieces: The latest Entertainment Weekly has a cover on
the ``100 Greatest Moments in Rock.'' Obviously it's speculative,
but it's easy to agree with the No. 1 moment of the Beatles on the
``Ed Sullivan Show'' in 1964. There are some weird ones (the Eagles
debuting at Disneyland in 1971, Pat Boone's ``Ain't That a Shame''
entering the charts in 1955, and Ginger quitting the Spice Girls
last year), but for the most part it's a good read.

FIRMS MAY FIND CURBS ON SALES TO CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They are found in banks and factories, brokerages
and airports _ computers that handle the routine tasks of the
business world. But in the wrong hands, they can also be used to
design a nuclear weapon or a fighter jet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with anger rising over allegations of Chinese nuclear
spying, there is new urgency to the debate over whether and how the
United States can keep high-end computers away from potential
enemies. The outcome could have a significant impact on
Massachusetts, which has seen exports to China more than double in
the past year despite the Asian economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the Senate voted to give intelligence agencies a
broader role in reviewing export licenses, a move prompted by a
congressional report released Tuesday that accused China of
conducting a vast campaign to steal US nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress moves to toughen export laws, however, advances in
computer technology threaten to swamp enforcement efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, the government can block sales to China of
certain high-end computers made by companies such as Compaq
Computer Corp. in New Hampshire, Stratus Computer Corp. of
Marlborough, and Data General Corp. of Westborough. Because these
computers are so fast, they are potentially useful in designing
certain weapons.
</P>
<P>
   But high-end computers are about to break into the mainstream,
and when they do, observers say, the government will have little
ability to control who buys then and how they are used. By next
summer, personal computers will be powered by Intel Corp.'s latest
Pentium chip, which is so fast that Intel cannot sell it to China
without special approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are really mass-market products, and there is no way to
control them,'' said Richard Cupitt, who tracks exports to Asian
nations for the Center for International Trade and Security at the
University of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Hoydysh, trade policy director for Unisys Corp., noted that
Intel sells its chips to computer-makers overseas, who in turn sell
finished computers to China and other countries that are not allies
of the United States. By one projection, he said, foreign
manufacturers will sell 60,000 computers to China in the year 2000
that would have triggered government scrutiny had they been sold by
US companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can you dam half a river?'' Hoydysh asked. ``If in fact
you could get an agreement from everyone who made computers not to
sell them to China, OK. But that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, a House investigative panel led by Representative
Christopher Cox, a Republican from California, released a
long-awaited report that accused China of using a network of front
companies and spies to steal US technology and nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,000-page report, which had bipartisan support, said that
US companies should be able to continue selling computers to China
for nonmilitary purposes. But it called for new safeguards to block
sales that might help China's military.
</P>
<P>
   Although China accounts for only a tiny portion of sales by
Massachusetts computer makers, many of them see the country as a
promising new market.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts exports to China more than doubled last year to
$317 million, a remarkable rise given that total exports fell by
nearly 5 percent amid the Asian financial crisis. China is the
state's 14th largest trading partner, but exports are growing far
faster than to any other large nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Cox report could spell problems for local companies in two
ways. First, tougher trade restrictions could limit future sales to
China. ``Potentially, our shipments this year could be affected,
depending on how export controls are strengthened,'' said Ken
Donoghue of Stratus Computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sending tennis shoes to them; we're sending
instruments and computer equipment and so on,'' said Andre Mayer of
Associated Industries of Massachusetts. ``So, if Congress or the
Department of Commerce go overboard, I'm sure our exports would be
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Cox report has made it far less likely that
Congress will approve China's entry into the World Trade
Organization. Many business leaders say that they will be able to
sell more goods to China if it joins the international body.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law that took effect last year, companies must notify
the Department of Commerce 10 days before they ship a computer or
chip that meets certain speed benchmarks to China, Pakistan, India,
Israel or 46 other countries. These so-called ``Tier III''
countries have failed to sign the nuclear nonproliferation pact or
are on a watch list for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The government can block sales of certain equipment to these
countries. It also tries to inspect US products once they have been
purchased by foreign customers, an attempt to make sure they are
not put to military uses. But after 15 years of negotiation, US
officials said Thursday, only three site visits have been conducted
in China _ one in 1998, and two this year.
</P>
<P>
   The law applies to any computer system that runs faster than
2,000 MTOPS, or millions of theoretical operations per second.
Once, that was considered ``supercomputer'' speed.
</P>
<P>
   But no longer. Some Compaq computers based on the Alpha chip _
the speedy chip made in Hudson, Mass. _ run faster than that. So do
some Data General and Stratus computers. Moreover, the mass-market
Intel computers promised for next year will run at 2,500 MTOPS,
Hoydysh said.
</P>
<P>
   Cupitt, citing a 1995 Stanford University report, said a
computer running 1,500 MTOPS would be helpful in designing a
nuclear weapon of the sort the United States built during World War
II, or some of today's warplanes.
</P>
<P>
   But it would take 20,000 MTOPS or so to design a sophisticated
submarine or an acoustic system to track subs in shallow water,
Cupitt said. And modern battlefield management, which tracks
multiple planes, ships and weaponry, requires an even faster
computer, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cupitt said export controls have a limited value, especially
when trying to block a product that is freely available.
</P>
<P>
   ``Export controls can delay activities related to making weapons
of mass destruction, or make them more expensive,'' he said. ``They
can buy time for diplomacy, for our own capabilities to improve, in
some cases for a change in government to occur. But to give the
task to export controls of stopping proliferation _ it's not going
to happen.''

INTEREST RATE WORRIES COOL HEELS OF HOT INTERNET STOCKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZipLink Inc., a company that connects customers to the Internet,
was hoping to cash in on the Web stock craze when it went public
this week.
</P>
<P>
   But ZipLink's $49 million initial public stock offering, which
hit the market on Wednesday, was greeted by investors in a way that
would have been unimaginable just weeks ago. The stock of the
Lowell, Mass. company actually dropped in value by the end of its
first trading day. The shares, initially priced at 14, finished
Thursday at 12 1/8.
</P>
<P>
   Internet stocks suddenly are not the sure thing they have been
for most of the last year. Fears of higher interest rates are
pulling all Web stocks down, even the most familiar names that have
become known as the blue chips of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't the first time Internet stocks have slumped. Just last
month, they fell hard when investors started to worry about the
earnings potential of many Web companies. But those shares bounced
back, nearly to their old levels, in short order.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the slump looks more like a slow leak of confidence
rather than a blowout. Put the two declines together and the losses
mount for even the biggest Internet stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com Inc. is down about 45 percent from its high, recorded
a month ago. Yahoo Inc. is off about 40 percent since its April
peak and America Online Inc. has slipped more than 28 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But a flood of new stock ginned up to meet voracious investor
demand has become a kind of wet blanket of its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incidence of failed deals is much more frequent,'' said
Brian Stack, a mutual fund manager at MFS Investment Management in
Boston. ``Everyone thought it was their birthright to see a stock
go up 100 percent on Day One.''
</P>
<P>
   The rash of IPOs and additional stock offerings by public
Internet companies is sating much of the demand. More importantly,
the rush has generated more IPOs than there are solid, seasoned
companies suitable for public markets.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 Internet-related companies have gone public and
raised in excess of $4 billion so far this year. Another 82 are in
the pipeline, having filed papers to go public with the Securities
and Exchange Commission, according to BT Alex Brown.
</P>
<P>
   The tide of capital flowing into the Internet stock sector has
been dramatic, but hardly a new phenomena. It is a basic function
of the market and investment bankers who work there to latch onto
demand for any type of shares and supply them, usually to excess.
</P>
<P>
   They continue to pump out new stocks for buyers until the
process breaks down and the market becomes swamped with shares of
declining quality that investors no longer want to buy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Supply and demand has changed,'' said Linda Killian of
Renaissance Capital's IPO and Aftermarket fund. ``Even when
Internet companies were going public in the first quarter of this
year, there was a tremendous supply-demand imbalance. Investors
have certainly started to attach more discipline to the valuation
of these stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, Web companies going public are more likely to be
pigeonholed into small market niches or have other business plan
faults. But often they are solid companies that are simply being
brought into the market too soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The investment marketplace to some degree is playing a
late-stage venture capital role in today's market,'' said Anurag
Pandit, a small-stock portfolio manager at John Hancock Mutual
Funds.
</P>
<P>
   What's still in favor? Companies with lots of name recognition
working in a broad Web market and possessing the potential to grow
dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   DLJ Direct, a well-known on-line stock brokerage, went public at
20 on Tuesday and finished Thursday's session at 38. EToys Inc.,
the web toy retailer, launched its public stock at 20 last week and
now trades at 50 1/4.
</P>
<P>
   And just in case you worried that sanity had completely
overtaken the Web stock market, consider Barnes
</P>
<P>
   &AMP;noble.com, the relatively new on-line bookseller operated by
Barnes &AMP; Noble.
</P>
<P>
   It went public Tuesday at 18 and has since gained modestly,
finishing at 24 Thursday. But at that price the market has valued
Barnes&AMP;noble
</P>
<P>
   .com at about $3.5 billion, or roughly two-thirds more than its
parent firm, which operates brick-and-mortar stores and still owns
a huge chunk of the on-line operation.
</P>
<P>
   Among established Internet companies, the big names are still
wildly successful stocks when viewed in the bigger picture.
</P>
<P>
   For all its recent problems, Amazon.com is still up 693 percent
in the last year. Shares of CMGI Inc. of Andover, the leading Web
venture investing business, have slipped by about a third since
April but have gained 759 percent in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is ZipLink, a relatively narrowly focused company
cursed by bad timing. It wasn't alone.
</P>
<P>
   Edgar Online Inc., which uses the Internet to retrieve corporate
disclosure documents for on-line customers, hit the market the same
day and has barely moved since.
</P>
<P>
   Other smaller, niche Internet companies that were once hot new
IPOs have since cooled. Retailer Cyberian Outpost Inc., which
traded near 40 in January, was worth 11 1/4 Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all Internet stocks will bounce back again, as they have
before. But the threat of higher interest rates, which hurt small
stocks, is a serious problem for Web investors. And then there are
all those other Internet companies in the pipeline, waiting to go
public before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can rest assured, they (investment bankers) are going to
try to clear that calendar before mid-August, when they go on
vacation,'' said Stack.

NETWORK IN HUNT FOR RATINGS WITH MASSCAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HOWARD MANLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pete Macheska has overseen professional football and basketball
game coverage for years, but the Fox producer finds horse racing
more of a challenge for one reason.
</P>
<P>
   The race lasts all of two minutes, and most of the time,
Macheska is producing an hour-long show.
</P>
<P>
   How does one keep the show exciting?
</P>
<P>
   Macheska said it's a balancing act between informing the
hard-core fans and educating new ones. ``We're trying to build a
bigger audience,'' he said. ``But we don't want to insult the
diehard fans.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been an uphill climb. Fox's cable network launched its
horse racing coverage last year with the Santa Anita Handicap. The
race pulled a 2.4 rating and 5 share on Fox Sports New England in
Boston. It didn't do as well nationally, earning only a 1.3 rating
and 4 share. Ratings for the Santa Anita race in March dropped a
bit nationally to a 1.1 and plunged in Boston to a .5.
</P>
<P>
   Macheska is looking to stem the ratings slide in Saturday's
Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs in Boston. New England
Sports Network, an affiliate of Fox Sports Net, will televise the
event, starting at 5 p.m. with host Kenny Albert and analysts Caton
Bredar, Ron Ellis, and Jay Privman.
</P>
<P>
   The MassCap is part of the National Thoroughbred Racing
Association series, and its $600,000 purse makes it the top event
in New England. Post time is 5:40, and the race features 1998
Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner Real Quiet against NTRA series
points leader Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's hour-long coverage also includes the 5:15 Metropolitan
Mile from Belmont. The added race, to be called by Barry Tompkins,
gives Macheska a little breathing room.
</P>
<P>
   Macheska said the announcing team brings different perspectives
for all levels of viewers. Ellis, for instance, is a horse trainer,
and during the Santa Anita race, he explained the term ``quarter
crack.'' Diehard fans probably already knew that the injury is akin
to a broken fingernail or turf toe, but the novice definitely
appreciated the information. Ellis has also been quick to point out
his problems with handicap races, the ones when horses are assigned
a weight. Initially used as a way to balance the field, handicaps
have caused owners to shy away from races in which their horses are
given more weight than they want.
</P>
<P>
   Macheska said graphics are designed to give information in
understandable terms. Instead of showing just the odds, Fox's
graphics will indicate that 2-1 odds, for example, will pay $6.
</P>
<P>
   Albert hosted his first horse race broadcast last year. The son
of Marv Albert usually does football play-by-play for Fox. Kenny
enjoys the chance to host an event as exciting as a horse race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm basically a traffic cop,'' he said. ``I'll introduce the
features and set up our three analysts. But I tell you, it's
something to be down on the track when the horses are running. At
the Santa Anita, there were about 40,000 people in the stands and
the buzz from the crowd was incredible, absolutely incredible.''

   Strawberry speaks
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry talked with CNN/SI's John Giannone and
apologized to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner for the April 14
incident in which he was arrested on charges of cocaine possession
and soliciting a prostitute. He pleaded no contest to the charges
Wednesday and received 18 months probation. ``I probably wasn't in
the right state of mind,'' Strawberry said.
</P>
<P>
   Giannone listened to Strawberry's mea culpa, then asked a
tactless question about whether Strawberry had contemplated
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, no, I didn't really contemplate anything of that
nature,'' Strawberry said. ``I didn't really care too much about
life at that time. It was just some type of thought going through
me.''
</P>

   Blackledge on board

<P>
   Todd Blackledge is leaving ABC to join play-by-play man Sean
McDonough on CBS as the network's lead college football analyst.
Blackledge replaces Terry Donahue and will work 12 regular-season
games plus the Sun Bowl . . . ABC will air its 17 ``Monday Night
Football'' games this season, as well as the Super Bowl, on HDTV .
. . HBO's broadcast of Oscar De La Hoya's title defense against Oba
Carr last Saturday night pulled a 14.6 rating and was seen in
approximately 4 million homes. HBO's boxing ratings are up nearly
20 percent from last year. Felix Trinidad defends his International
Boxing Federation welterweight title against Hugo Pineda on HBO
Saturday at 11 p.m.

 &HT;    
 By NADINE GORDIMER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 For release: MAY 30 or thereafter  
 &HT;    When I was young, in South Africa during World War II, I was far
removed from the bombs, the nights in underground shelters, the
rationed food, in Europe.
 &HT;    I read reflections by those living through this experience, and
these were not what I had in my mind as the way life must be there;
I had constructed their lives out of a projection of my own
priorities in what makes life, my own fears of what would be most
threatened in imagined circumstances.
 &HT;    Our war _ South Africa's liberation struggle _ is over. On June
2, we shall cast our votes in our second post-apartheid elections.
We have been led to that day by one of the great men of this
century. He now displays the ultimate wisdom in closing his era at
his peak of accomplishments, the final one being the assurance that
his successor is the one equal to the era about to begin.
 &HT;    We have lived five years of freedom. Whatever the frustrations
as well as triumphs we've tackled, it is an achievement placed
toweringly beside the years of apartheid racism and before them the
years of colonial racism _ five years against three centuries.
 &HT;    Yet I see that this period is often the object of the same kind
of subjective projection I imposed on the reality of wartime Europe
50 years ago.
 &HT;    Again and again, when I am interviewed or find myself in
encounters with other people abroad, the burning question is,
``What is happening to whites?'' And again and again, my genuinely
surprised response is: ``What about blacks? Don't you believe there
are challenges to be met in their new lives?''
 &HT;    There are two obvious assumptions to be made of this approach to
South Africa by Europeans and North Americans. The majority of them
being white, they identify only with whites, whether consciously or
subconsciously. Because I am white, they assume I do the same. It's
the Old Boys/Old Girls Club producing its dogeared membership card.
 &HT;    The projection is of the priorities of their lives, along with
the old colonial conditioning that these belong with whiteness and
are incontrovertibly, always, forever, threatened by the Otherness
_ blackness.
 &HT;    Five years into freedom. What kind of fossil should I be,
unearthed from the cave of bones that was apartheid, if my
essential sense of self were to be as a white?
 &HT;    There are some who still have this sense _ suffer it, I would
say, and unnecessarily, so it becomes a form of self-flagellation.
I don't posit this in any assertion of smug superiority; I should
just wish to prod them into freedom from confinement.
 &HT;    And there is also the other _ unadmitted _ side of feeling
superior as white: being ashamed of being white. An
overcompensation for the past, useless for living fully in the
present.
 &HT;    If you put the question to me, I hear it as, ``What about us?''
_ South Africans going as best we can about the business of living
together. Being white as a state determining my existence is simply
not operative. I was privileged through racism, I rejected and
actively opposed racism, I played my small part in the liberation
struggle and I know that as a result I am a South African and
nobody else, living in a country we are in the difficult, thrilling
process of creating. That we must create; for despite its natural
resources, its sophisticated infrastructure, its advanced
technology, what we want never existed for us before: a truly human
society.
 &HT;    Grand words. How does it feel to live day to day under their
imperative? Five years into freedom: For me, the great change comes
from others, from the change in atmosphere in the cities, the
streets. It is nothing new for me to ``mix'' with people of all
colors; my closest friendships and working relationships have been
in this context for many years. But the old life existed counter to
everything that defined and characterized the country.
 &HT;    It was _ even if triumphantly always in opposition _ surrounded
by the laws, the state, secular and religious traditions that
represented everything it was not. Although we said ``our
country,'' this was in reference to that which people were
suffering, striving, surviving to bring about _ there was no
identity with the official entity called South Africa. We had no
country.
 &HT;    I am aware now, every day, in so many ways, big and small, happy
and troubling, that I can speak of ``our country.'' If the air of
taking possession can be palpable, I feel it when I walk out of my
gate. I hear it in the volume of traffic. I know it when I pick my
way between vendors of everything from cell phones and fake French
perfume to tomatoes and toilet rolls on the pavements. I see it out
of the corner of my eye when I stand in a queue at my local post
office and eavesdrop on the black postmaster giving instruction to
the young Afrikaans employee at the counter. I hear it in the
accents of our many languages, listeners speaking English on radio
phone-in programs.
 &HT;    It is that indefinable quality called confidence; even the
member of the vast number of unemployed who guides me theatrically
into a parking bay has it _ yes, a contradiction of his actual
circumstances.
 &HT;    Well, I live in Johannesburg. A city in transition is full of
such contradictions.
 &HT;    Recently my bag was snatched from the car when the friend
driving stopped at a traffic light; I had forgotten to lock the
passenger-seat door _ our routine precaution, like the free
distribution of condoms against AIDS. I was indignant. House keys,
credit card, ATM card _ the fact that they were filched by someone
living on the streets who had no middle-class status to own such
things did not assuage me.
 &HT;    But on the same streets in the press of people flowing and
dodging round one another, the great mass whom had been shut out of
the city in ghettos and ``ethnic homelands,'' if someone jostles
me, I hear, ``Sorry, maGogo'' (``I apologize, Grandmother'').
 &HT;    Ordinary good manners, you will say. No. He apologizes. He
accepts me as a common relative in the human family; after he and
his forebears have been decreed outcast from it for generations,
both subtly and brutally, colonialist patronage to apartheid
rejection.
 &HT;    The benison of human feeling at once shines out against, and is
threatened by, violent crime. The second question fired by
individuals from abroad is one with a target that can't be missed.
Back to the first proposition of the contradiction: the snatched
bag.
 &HT;    ``What about crime?'' I shall not duck. The impersonal
statistics are there, never mind my credit card. The city I live in
is among those with the highest crime rates in the world.
 &HT;    That my French granddaughter, a student in Nice, has had her
little old car stolen is an incident of urban crime all over the
world, but it doesn't add up to the indicting total in one city,
one country, the way the loss of my bag will in the calculation of
those passing judgment on the progress of a country with a
five-year commitment to democracy as against the several hundred
years' experience of its evolution in the West.
 &HT;    The curious view from abroad is that only whites are threatened
by, and concerned about, street crime, hijackings and housebreaking
and the violence these involve. Again and again, there are
descriptions of suburban razor wire and Rottweilers as the
prevailing flora and fauna of the white suburbs. The facts are that
homes, humble as well as substantial and even complete with
swimming pool, in what are still the black townships of greater
Johannesburg, are also armed with wire and dogs.
 &HT;    Black professional and businessmen and -women who now take a
place among the affluent owners of fine cars (regarded primly as
suspect conspicuous consumers by observers who do not have the same
moral judgment of whites driving the same models) are also victims
of hijacking. We face the problems together.
 &HT;    But if you move about in my city, you don't need a criminologist
to identify the reason for crime's prevalence. And it is not a
bleeding-heart apologist response when the blunt answer is:
unemployment.
 &HT;    I have taught myself to drive, all over again, 50 or so years
after I was first licensed, because there has to be a new, nippy
know-how and understanding of an unwritten code among drivers to
weave among the buffalo herd of the road, the minibuses. We call
them ``combis'' because they are combination buses and taxis and
conduct themselves as a hybrid, which is confusing to the
uninitiated driver of a car.
 &HT;    They hoot continuously, to attract the attention of potential
passengers; they stop anywhere at the signal of a raised finger
from the curbside, the way a hailed taxi responds; they have
regular routes they follow like a bus but no obligation to restrict
themselves to any designated bus stops. They are always packed to
suffocation limit. They have solved the transport question, which a
succession of white regimes dealt with as the decision that blacks
use their legs.
 &HT;    To me, the combis are symbols of the immeasurable influx of
people to the city since freedom was confirmed at the ballot box in
1994, the trek of many thousands who come to find work, and for
whom there will be little or no possibility of finding it. When the
humiliation of begging fails, desperation offers one way to survive
_ crime.
 &HT;    This phenomenon of crime is not, as some observers take smug
satisfaction in regarding it, the phenomenon of freedom.
 &HT;    Things were not better in the old days of the apartheid regime.
They were kept out of sight. The unemployed and underemployed who
come to the city hungry in every way for a better life now were
corralled in that extraordinary experiment in social engineering,
poverty-ridden ``ethnic homelands.''
 &HT;    The social disease, unemployment, was quarantined. Migratory
labor from the rural areas, and from one province to another, was
permitted to enter the city only in numbers determined healthy by
the needs of industry.
 &HT;    And these workers were legally forbidden to take their families
with them. I have to remind myself of this when I see among us that
sad developing-world category of childhood, street children. Now
they are there before our eyes instead of underfed and
undereducated in the ``homelands'' of apartheid.
 &HT;    It is not a politically correct convenience to blame the past,
apartheid, for unemployment.
 &HT;    The plain fact is that dammed-up unemployment has burst upon us
from the inhuman confines of the past; it is not something inherent
in freedom, a kind of punishment for our people's audacity in
defeating whites-only rule. As a result of the policies of the
past, black people come to the city doubly disadvantaged.
 &HT;    First, industrial development, hampered through sanctions that
were necessary to end apartheid, has only limited employment to
provide in a period when, despite every effort toward expansion,
such development is affected by quaking conditions in world
finance.
 &HT;    Second, the majority of the unemployed do not have the education
or skills to take on such jobs that are available. Many are
illiterate or semiliterate, the products of the contemptible level
of education apartheid decreed for blacks. Few have any of the
basic skills demanded by an increasingly technological labor
market.
 &HT;    I cannot shrug and dismiss them as a lost generation. I am one
who will press for innovative large-scale government projects that
will institute skills training and employment at the same time.
When the adults are providers, the children will not be on the
streets.
 &HT;    And I am encouraged by the government's chivying of business to
give training in financial processes, and the condition laid down
to foreign investors that there must be a training component in
their most welcome decisions to profit from investment
opportunities here.
 &HT;    There is enthusiasm among Haves in the city to see a solution to
the unemployment of Have-nots in what they call, broadly, small
business, and there are formations that commendably provide modest
finance for this.
 &HT;    Yet when I pass, near a supermarket, a young man mending shoes
in a booth he has been supplied with, I can't help thinking this is
something of a dead-end for him. Couldn't he be learning to be an
electrician or plumber, even if he cannot become one of the
millennium's computer-literate?
 &HT;    His ``small business'' venture doesn't seem to have the vigor of
self-initiated brisk trading by those pavement vendors whom I note,
month by month, acquiring the acumen of what will arrest the gaze
of customers beyond a mere pile of bananas _ the latest sports-club
logo on a cap, the look-alike Nikes.
 &HT;    South African blacks are new to shopkeeping, having been barred
from owning shops in the city. They don't have the capital to do
so, yet, but you can see they're learning fast _ the hard way.
 &HT;    In awareness of sharing as a post-apartheid ethos, at what
levels is this evident? At the top economic level, which used to be
exclusively that occupied by whites, like begins to live beside
like. It was a pejorative _ aimed at white privilege in general _
to refer to ``Houghton,'' but now our President Mandela lives in
that residential area, more modestly than he would if he made the
conventional choice of the official residence occupied by the white
regimes' presidents in Pretoria.
 &HT;    Sandton _ the most luxurious of garden suburbs _ can't really be
regarded as the generic symbol of white capitalist living any
longer, because black dignitaries in professions, business,
communications and the arts now also favor the landscaped townhouse
complexes complete with security service. They are a minority among
blacks, of course.
 &HT;    At the broadest, basic level of the new social pyramid there are
changes that are not less contrasting, in their way, with the
living conditions of the past. Late last year, I was in the city's
old black township of Alexandra, in the brand-new three-room house,
built with government subsidy and a low-interest bank loan, into
which the Mashabela family of five had just moved after 17 years in
a one-room shack housing 14 people. This kind of leveling of
material conditions is my primary criterion of justice in my
country, the city I live in.
 &HT;    I know it could not possibly be brought about in five years, or
ever can be completely achieved, on the evidence of the chasms
between the life of rich and poor in developed capitalist countries
that have declared themselves dedicated to it for several hundred
years, and the failure of Socialist countries (of Socialism _ so
far in human history, but not forever, in my belief) to avoid
making freedom a prisoner of its own dictates.
 &HT;    South Africa _ like its combis _ has had to choose pragmatically
to be a hybrid: a mixed economy, with every bias it can afford
toward making the legal equality, now achieved, meaningful in
economic, material form for the impoverished majority.
 &HT;    It follows that community of purpose is particularly decisive
for us, coming as we do, rawly, from our divided, racist past. My
own natural preoccupations, within my life as I see it as a
responsible citizen, have always been in the arts, what are called
(rather embarrassingly for my taste) cultural formations, in which
race or color or even language differences were an irrelevance in
common enthusiasms, the realm of the imagination that couldn't be
annexed, even by apartheid.
 &HT;    But now, as it should be, in pursuit of South Africa as an
African country rather than an Africanized outpost of the West, the
initiatives and much of the innovation in culture are taken up by
blacks _ a form of unofficial, organic affirmative action that
creates a balance that was missing while partnerships between black
and white were always weighted by the fact that whites, by law, in
the ordinary pursuits of daily life, had access to opportunities
blacks did not have.
 &HT;    I feel at home _ in the real sense of the concept _ as never
before, even in working with my longtime close friend Mongane Wally
Serote, poet, former freedom fighter, now a member of Parliament
with a high position in the Department of Arts and Culture, and
with Walter Chakela, director of the Windybrow Center for the Arts,
in a total context that didn't exist for them and for me before.
 &HT;    Perhaps that may be regarded as a rather special area of race
relations, far from ``Sorry, maGogo'' in the street. In between, I
reflect on my feelings when, moving about the city and suburbs, I
pass a school at the hour when classes end. It was a whites-only
school I knew well.
 &HT;    I see the kids coming out, the small boys scuffling with one
another, the little girls tangling hands and giggling together.
They are all shades of color _ South African black, South African
Indian, South African milange, South African white. They are
growing up with a common initiating experience, into life.
 &HT;    They will never be subject to the unspeakable horrors that the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has exposed to us, and that
have been so vital for us to face, what we did or what we allowed
to happen. These children are not being kept apart to learn to
hate, to fear the unknown, the untouched in one another.
 &HT;    One of the generation that was the victim of the horrors of
apartheid, Tokyo Sexwale, lately premier of Gauteng, of which
Johannesburg is the capital, and now a black-empowerment crusader
married to a white woman, said something this month that could be
our rubric to live by: ``If blacks get hurt, I get hurt. If whites
get hurt, that's my wife, and if you harm colored people, you're
looking for my children. Your unity embodies who I am.''

 By NADINE GORDIMER  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 For release: MAY 30 or thereafter  
 &HT;    When I was young, in South Africa during World War II, I was far
removed from the bombs, the nights in underground shelters, the
rationed food, in Europe.
 &HT;    I read reflections by those living through this experience, and
these were not what I had in my mind as the way life must be there;
I had constructed their lives out of a projection of my own
priorities in what makes life, my own fears of what would be most
threatened in imagined circumstances.
 &HT;    Our war _ South Africa's liberation struggle _ is over. On June
2, we shall cast our votes in our second post-apartheid elections.
We have been led to that day by one of the great men of this
century. He now displays the ultimate wisdom in closing his era at
his peak of accomplishments, the final one being the assurance that
his successor is the one equal to the era about to begin.
 &HT;    We have lived five years of freedom. Whatever the frustrations
as well as triumphs we've tackled, it is an achievement placed
toweringly beside the years of apartheid racism and before them the
years of colonial racism _ five years against three centuries.
 &HT;    Yet I see that this period is often the object of the same kind
of subjective projection I imposed on the reality of wartime Europe
50 years ago.
 &HT;    Again and again, when I am interviewed or find myself in
encounters with other people abroad, the burning question is,
``What is happening to whites?'' And again and again, my genuinely
surprised response is: ``What about blacks? Don't you believe there
are challenges to be met in their new lives?''
 &HT;    There are two obvious assumptions to be made of this approach to
South Africa by Europeans and North Americans. The majority of them
being white, they identify only with whites, whether consciously or
subconsciously. Because I am white, they assume I do the same. It's
the Old Boys/Old Girls Club producing its dogeared membership card.
 &HT;    The projection is of the priorities of their lives, along with
the old colonial conditioning that these belong with whiteness and
are incontrovertibly, always, forever, threatened by the Otherness
_ blackness.
 &HT;    Five years into freedom. What kind of fossil should I be,
unearthed from the cave of bones that was apartheid, if my
essential sense of self were to be as a white?
 &HT;    There are some who still have this sense _ suffer it, I would
say, and unnecessarily, so it becomes a form of self-flagellation.
I don't posit this in any assertion of smug superiority; I should
just wish to prod them into freedom from confinement.
 &HT;    And there is also the other _ unadmitted _ side of feeling
superior as white: being ashamed of being white. An
overcompensation for the past, useless for living fully in the
present.
 &HT;    If you put the question to me, I hear it as, ``What about us?''
_ South Africans going as best we can about the business of living

not operative. I was privileged through racism, I rejected and
actively opposed racism, I played my small part in the liberation
struggle and I know that as a result I am a South African and
nobody else, living in a country we are in the difficult, thrilling

material conditions is my primary criterion of justice in my
country, the city I live in.
 &HT;    I know it could not possibly be brought about in five years, or
ever can be completely achieved, on the evidence of the chasms
between the life of rich and poor in developed capitalist countries
that have declared themselves dedicated to it for several hundred
years, and the failure of Socialist countries (of Socialism _ so
far in human history, but not forever, in my belief) to avoid
making freedom a prisoner of its own dictates.
 &HT;    South Africa _ like its combis _ has had to choose pragmatically
to be a hybrid: a mixed economy, with every bias it can afford
toward making the legal equality, now achieved, meaningful in
economic, material form for the impoverished majority.
 &HT;    It follows that community of purpose is particularly decisive
for us, coming as we do, rawly, from our divided, racist past. My
own natural preoccupations, within my life as I see it as a
responsible citizen, have always been in the arts, what are called
(rather embarrassingly for my taste) cultural formations, in which
race or color or even language differences were an irrelevance in
common enthusiasms, the realm of the imagination that couldn't be
annexed, even by apartheid.
 &HT;    But now, as it should be, in pursuit of South Africa as an
African country rather than an Africanized outpost of the West, the
initiatives and much of the innovation in culture are taken up by
blacks _ a form of unofficial, organic affirmative action that
creates a balance that was missing while partnerships between black
and white were always weighted by the fact that whites, by law, in
the ordinary pursuits of daily life, had access to opportunities
blacks did not have.
 &HT;    I feel at home _ in the real sense of the concept _ as never
before, even in working with my longtime close friend Mongane Wally
Serote, poet, former freedom fighter, now a member of Parliament
with a high position in the Department of Arts and Culture, and
with Walter Chakela, director of the Windybrow Center for the Arts,
in a total context that didn't exist for them and for me before.
 &HT;    Perhaps that may be regarded as a rather special area of race
relations, far from ``Sorry, maGogo'' in the street. In between, I
reflect on my feelings when, moving about the city and suburbs, I
pass a school at the hour when classes end. It was a whites-only
school I knew well.
 &HT;    I see the kids coming out, the small boys scuffling with one
another, the little girls tangling hands and giggling together.
They are all shades of color _ South African black, South African
Indian, South African milange, South African white. They are
growing up with a common initiating experience, into life.
 &HT;    They will never be subject to the unspeakable horrors that the
Truth and Reconciliation Commission has exposed to us, and that
have been so vital for us to face, what we did or what we allowed
to happen. These children are not being kept apart to learn to
hate, to fear the unknown, the untouched in one another.
 &HT;    One of the generation that was the victim of the horrors of
apartheid, Tokyo Sexwale, lately premier of Gauteng, of which
Johannesburg is the capital, and now a black-empowerment crusader
married to a white woman, said something this month that could be
our rubric to live by: ``If blacks get hurt, I get hurt. If whites
get hurt, that's my wife, and if you harm colored people, you're
looking for my children. Your unity embodies who I am.''

IN COLLEGE TENNIS, JAMES BLAKE IS IN COMPLETE CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ Sometimes he applied what he figured was the
proper force and technique to deliver a textbook volley. But
apparently, the ball opted to do its own thing: It chose not to
land where 12-year-old James Blake had sent it. For that, the next
available ball got whacked clear out of the court, a stern warning
for any other sphere that considered acting up.
</P>
<P>
   That went double for the racket. Often it chose to return serves
into the net, and the youngster threw it or slammed its head
against the surface. Other times, the air was kicked. The walls
were attacked. The floor was stomped.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, no one anticipated that the undersized youth from
Fairfield, Conn., would someday become the first player in Harvard
history to earn a No. 1 ranking in men's tennis as a sophomore.
That he would be within four matches of becoming only the second
player in history to take three legs of the Intercollegiate Tennis
Association Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   He began playing the sport regularly at age 7, in a youth
program at a Harlem armory that also served as a homeless shelter.
Often he would watch people sleeping on the floor and remind
himself how fortunate he was, and he sought to use his talent to
the best of his ability.
</P>
<P>
   Yet once he developed a passion for the sport, Blake uncovered
an insatiable desire to succeed, confused potential with perfection
_ and wouldn't stand for anything to get in the way of a command
performance. His motto was ``spare the rod, spoil the elements.''
</P>
<P>
   And vent frustrations against the person on the opposite side of
the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``James, you should just say, `Nice shot,' and keep going,''
Betty Blake would often say to her son, waiting for their tennis
match to resume, lamenting that another moment of mother-son
bonding had soured because James was too temperamental for a
friendly game.
</P>
<P>
   ``James, don't get angry,'' said coach Brian Barker of the
Tennis Club of Trumbull, Conn., who began working with Blake when
the boy was 10 and asked to be assigned to another player the
following day.
</P>
<P>
   ``James, if you don't curb your attitude, you won't be playing
tennis anymore,'' warned his father, Thomas Sr., who introduced
James and his older brother, Thomas Jr., to the sport while
volunteering in a Harlem youth program when the family lived in
Yonkers, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, the boy rebelled against his father's threat. Then,
following the urging of Barker and Thomas Jr., he gradually relaxed
on the court, played through adversity, complimented opponents,
accepted defeat as part of the game. As his physical attributes
developed, so did his maturity, his humility.
</P>
<P>
   Then an amazing thing happened. The more humble he became, the
more unbeatable Blake got. So much so that after he had a growth
spurt at 18, he began a meteoric rise to the top of amateur tennis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The top man
</P>
<P>
   Blake has been the nation's top-ranked men's Division 1 player
since Dec. 8. He is the top seed in the 115th NCAA Men's Tennis
Championships at the University of Georgia. In addition, he and
teammate Kunj Majmudar rank third nationally in doubles and are the
second seed here.
</P>
<P>
   A singles title would enable Blake to join Sargis Sargsian of
Arizona State (1995) as the only men to capture three ITA Grand
Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   Blake did not compete in the first leg, the National Clay Court
Championships, then won the ITA Rolex Indoor Championships Feb. 7
and the ITA All-America Championships Oct. 20, becoming the first
Ivy League player to do so. On Jan. 9, he captured his first title
in a professional event, the US Tennis Association Futures of
Seminole County in Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   The son of an African-American father and British mother, Blake
is also attempting to become only the second player of
African-American descent to capture the NCAA singles championship;
Arthur Ashe did it while at UCLA in 1965. And he would be the first
Ivy player to win the title since Lucien Williams of Yale in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was younger and I wasn't really good and I thought I
was good, I was probably arrogant then. I thought I should never
lose and that I knew everything,'' said Blake, who Thursday
defeated Doug Bohaboy of Northwestern, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5).
</P>
<P>
   ``After I worked with (Barker), I realized that's not the
approach you take to tennis, and I would be so much better if I
just relax a little and realize there are so many more matches in
my career and that every match isn't the end of the world, every
practice isn't the end of the world. And that I really don't know
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Blake has become one of the most likable, approachable athletes
around _ so much so that most folks who didn't know him then are
taken aback to hear he was once so temperamental. Among the awards
his parents take pride in are several he's earned for
sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as he accepted losing, he started to win more,'' said
Betty Blake. ``If things didn't happen his way, he would lose his
temper, and it made it difficult for everyone around him. Brian
Barker and Thomas (Jr.) helped to calm him down. I don't think he
wanted to be seen as a jerk anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A splash at Harvard
</P>
<P>
   At Fairfield High School, Blake finished with a four-year record
of 80-3, winning his last 40 matches. At 18, he won 49 consecutive
matches and became the USTA's top-ranked player in the 18-and-under
division.
</P>
<P>
   James was Thomas's doubles partner at Harvard last season and
became the school's first freshman singles All-American in men's
tennis. He finished the season ranked 14th in the nation with a
singles record of 37-5. He had a 23-4 doubles mark with Thomas, who
graduated and is now on the ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to be the smallest person around wherever we went, so
I think he wanted to be everyone's equal,'' said Thomas Blake Sr.
``His game improved, but he still had a problem with size. Then he
hit a growth spurt at 18 and his physical strength caught up with
his game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he was smaller than his brother, and few people,
including his parents, figured Blake would ever reach his current
level.

POLITICIANS' RIVALRIES ARE UNCOVERED BY BIG DIG SPAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, it seems the digs had very little to do
with the Big Dig itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, members of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation were seizing on a federal auditor's report that accused
state officials of improperly funneling $150 million of federal
money into a trust fund for the Central Artery project _ money the
congressmen said should have been spent on the state's decaying
roads and bridges. State officials countered that the trust fund
was an innovative self-insurance plan to protect the Big Dig from
catastrophic losses.
</P>
<P>
   But as the charges and countercharges were being sorted out, it
appeared to be mainly a war of personalities and personal issues,
not to mention political grudges from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   And by Thursday _ as Massachusetts Turnpike Authority head James
Kerasiotis fired off a nasty letter to Representative James P.
McGovern _ the fight seemed to be as much the product of a
dysfunctional relationship between the Democratic congressional
delegation and the Republican governor as about a highway project
that is hardly half complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Jim, stop whining,'' read Kerasiotis's letter, which
was immediately distributed to the entire delegation. ``More
importantly, find a constructive way to act out.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's incident follows another skirmish between
Massachusetts' elected officials. Two weeks ago, Senator John F.
Kerry and McGovern were caught circulating a letter that complained
about the way Governor Paul Cellucci was talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both public spats _ as well as a series of more private
ones between Democrats in Washington and Republicans in Boston _
seem to have much deeper roots, entangled in the nebulous world of
infrastructure appropriations and the politicians who take credit
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing conflict stems from a single source, according to
congressional and gubernatorial aides: last year's federal
transportation bill, in which Massachusetts saw its highway funding
slashed, providing the state's tiny Republican Party a giant hammer
with which to beat Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bill, Cellucci has held the delegation
responsible for fiscal woes in Boston. Boston Republicans have
gleefully used it as a symbol of the ``cloutless Democratic
delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the delegation's Democrats, still smarting from their slide
into the minority in the House in 1994, have gotten agitated. They
have tried to puncture the argument time and again, arguing that
Massachusetts was bound to lose money after the Big Dig stopped
receiving new funds, that the state lost less money than expected,
that it still took in more federal funds than most other states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained. They wrote letters. They said that they
were frustrated by the arrogance of the Cellucci administration,
and said that state officials refused to work with them and would
not stop torturing them with an inaccurate assessment of how they
did their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This week, then, seemed to be payback.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation audit _ titled ``Overpayments of Premiums for
the Central Artery Project's Owner-Controlled Insurance Project'' _
was performed for the Federal Highway Administration by the
inspector general of the US Department of Transportation. It was
given to congressmen Tuesday, and was circulated among reporters
Wednesday. By Thursday, an arcane audit had sparked a full-scale
political war.
</P>
<P>
   The state set up an insurance company that invested in corporate
bonds as a means of building up a trust fund that could be used to
cover major losses during Big Dig construction. According to the
audit, $150 million in federal money was improperly used to buy the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans said they were simply using a creative method
that generated income, which would not only insure the Big Dig, but
end up saving taxpayers as much as $1 billion over the life of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes's letter said the Treasury Department endorsed the
concept in 1995. And even the executive director of the FHA,
Anthony Kane, disagreed with the report and said the inspector
general had misunderstood the purpose of the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegation members stayed quiet _ afraid the damaging
report could be used during the congressional appropriations
process as proof Massachusetts does not deserve more funding.
</P>
<P>
   But others, according to McGovern, got ``a little excited.''
Although he noted the audit was not commissioned by the delegation,
he did not altogether deny his rage was connected to a longtime
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the delegation trying to pick a fight,'' McGovern
said. ``We have been incredibly patient and silent for a long time
_ some say too long. The reality now is, it's time to set the
record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley agreed. ``It's always the same thing,'' he said.
``Cellucci and his minions go around saying there's not enough
money because Congress didn't get us enough money. Here, he's got
$150 million in a slush fund.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cellucci spokesman indicated Thursday that the spat was not
going to immediately disappear. Asked why the audit turned into
such a contentious issue, Jose Juves said: ``Some members are still
upset they were unable to secure Massachusetts' fair share of
highway funds.''

PENTAGON'S MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM IS ON A LONG LOSING STREAK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Withdrawing $110 billion from the ATM to play craps would seem
penny dumb and pound nuts, even if the ATM is Capitol Hill's
bottomless automatic teller for the military. This week reminded us
why.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the Pentagon held a test of its Theater
High-Altitude Area Defense missile. THAAD is the latest in
congressional science fictions to knock enemy missiles out of the
sky.
</P>
<P>
   The only sound from THAAD is ``thud.'' In seven years, all six
previous tests have failed. You would not know this from the
Pentagon. Like a disbelieving loser who needs to be dragged out of
a casino, the military insists it is about to hit the jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The last failure was March 29. A test missile whizzed past a
test attacker, missing by less than 90 feet. Nonetheless, the
Pentagon bragged that the missile achieved 16 of 17 objectives. ``I
am encouraged by the test,'' said Army Lieutenant General Paul L.
Kern. ``We are much closer to achieving success.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the vaporized residents of whatever metropolis was
the incoming target of that warhead. Never mind that the ``only''
failure was merely the worst thing that could happen, the
malfunction of the infrared seeker. The Pentagon keeps walking the
implausible thin line between telling us how complex the problems
are (the more to get defense dollars), yet how soon they will solve
them (also the more to get defense dollars).
</P>
<P>
   Brigadier General Daniel Montgomery said the March 29 failure
was possibly due to debris on a plug that caused disruptions so
small ``you can't see them without a microscope.'' The disruptions
cause the failure of a thruster and the telemetry. Yet, Montgomery
declared these to be ``low-tech problems, and we can correct
those.'' He promised that on the next test, ``we will hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The hit was supposed to be Tuesday. It was so bad, it did not
even register a thud. The Pentagon aborted the test entirely when
the ``attacking'' missile zoomed out of control. Of course, the
incurable gambler did not see this as more evidence of utter
incompetence. It was just a nonevent, a test that did not exist.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, the target failed,'' said Defense Department
spokesman Kenneth Bacon. ``Therefore, the THAAD was never launched.
It's life. They will come back and try again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tell that to the vaporized residents of whatever metropolis was
the unintended target of the misguided warhead. You would think in
a real attack, THAAD would have to go after not only missiles
launched as straight arrows, but also errant mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   There is no reason to let the Pentagon come back to the ATM to
try again. In three decades, there has been $110 billion of
spending and 16 test launches of missile defense systems.
</P>
<P>
   Out of the 16, the Pentagon claimed two hits in 1984 and 1991.
But after each ``hit,'' embarrassed officials later confessed that
the tests were rigged. In 1984, the heat was artificially increased
in the attack missile to help the infernal infrared seeker. In
1991, the computer of a test missile received precise programming
beyond the bounds of reality for a real attack.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being 0-for-16 record in untainted hits, the ATM
withdrawals continue, fueled by our arrogant belief in technology,
the arms lobby, and the politics of fear that has supplanted
militaries in Asia and the Middle East for the old Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House voting overwhelmingly to pursue missile
defense. This week, the Senate Appropriations Committee proposed to
add $200 million to President Clinton's six-year, $10.5 billion
project to determine if missile defense is feasible. Despite the
fact that it is nowhere close to feasible, NATO last week signed a
$300 million contract with THAAD's maker, Lockheed-Martin, to
develop a similar system for Europe.
</P>
<P>
   If the United States decides missile defense is feasible, it may
cost up to $28 billion to deploy. If NATO decides it can work, its
contract with Lockheed Martin can balloon to $20 billion by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   But feasibility seems a long way off since the United States is
currently in the worst slump of disasters in a decade in
old-fashioned space rocketry. In the last nine months, the United
States has had six major failures, costing $4 billion in lost,
destroyed, or misplaced military and communications satellites.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably one of the worst times in the launch history
of the country,'' said Howell M. Estes III, the former head of the
US Space Command. ``Even the old rockets aren't working, and some
of the newer rockets aren't working. That's the concern, and it
comes at the very time we most need to get the launch costs down
and assure access to space.''
</P>
<P>
   If it has become so hard getting satellites into space, then
missile defense is an impossible science fiction. It has less
chance hitting targets than ordinary gamblers have hitting the
number. The military keeps saying ``We will hit.'' We need to take
the ATM out of service and the Pentagon to Gamblers Anonymous.

CHILI PEPPERS HEAT UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We are the grand old statesmen of alternative rock,''
pronounces Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Chad Smith, with mock
pride and a laugh. ``We were just playing in St. Louis with Blink
182 and all those guys come up to me and the drummer says, `Oh man,
I started playing drums because of you, man!' And, I'm like, `Oh my
God what am I, Led Zeppelin or something?'
</P>
<P>
   ``But hey, you know what: We're still making great music and
we're having a great time. We may be old farts, but we're not
boring. We want to be like Neil Young.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hot Chili Peppers making great music and having a great
time in 1999. . . . This was not preordained, by any means. The
rock 'n' roll life is often a roller coaster, and the Peppers have
boarded it big time. There are highs, there are lows, there are
breathtaking turns. But the roller coaster keeps going around the
same track.
</P>
<P>
   Cut back to 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Hot Chili Peppers make a hot album and go out on tour.
Things fall apart, drugs become involved, the band is in disarray.
``Emotionally bottomed out,'' in the words of bassist Flea,
discussing the period between ``BloodSugarSexMagik,'' their 1993
mega-breakthrough CD, and ``One Hot Minute'' in 1996. Flea
described a period of being ``bitter, upset, lonely.'' Some in the
band move on to other projects or drop out. Band status: Iffy at
best.
</P>
<P>
   Back to 1999. The Red Hot Chili Peppers are on the verge of
releasing a terrific, expansive album called ``Californication.''
This week, the hook-packed emphasis track, ``Scar Tissue,'' was
added by all 91 radio stations with a modern rock format. (The last
song to achieve that was U2's ``Discotheque'' in 1996.) ``Scar
Tissue'' was also added by 168 mainstream and heritage rock
stations. The Peppers are out on the road, having just completed a
five-city tour called ``Teen Tolerance,'' where the band played
clubs for high school kids. The price of admission? Suggestions on
how to end hatred among students in high schools. (It was inspired
by the school shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton,
Colo.)
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Peppers are in the middle of several radio
station-sponsored shows. Yet getting to this point was, once again,
a familiar, frustrating, and difficult process. There was a lot of
down time between 1996 and 1999. ``Toward the end of '96 we stopped
touring for `One Hot Minute,' '' says drummer Chad Smith, ``and
then we had to take a break and tried writing songs, and went to
Hawaii to try and write, and that didn't pan out too well.''
Guitarist Dave Navarro joined the Jane's Addiction Relapse Tour and
worked with Smith on a group called Spread; Flea had his projects,
including Banyan. As for singer Anthony Kiedis, Smith says, ``You
know, he's had his ups and downs with the (drug) addiction thing. I
can't really talk for him, but it's an ongoing thing, a disease.
It's always there.''
</P>
<P>
   Plus: ``We didn't have the real excitement of working
together,'' says Smith of that period. ``It felt more like a job.
Having fun is what it's all about for the Chili Peppers.''
</P>
<P>
   Guitarist John Frusciante had exited the Peppers in 1992,
replaced by Navarro, who held the position from 1993-1997. ``When
he left,'' says Smith, of Frusciante, ``he was really unhappy with
the whole music industry and how the band had gotten really popular
and we were playing really big places and it wasn't about the art
for him anymore. It felt like it was all about the big machine, the
touring and the money.'' He stepped out of the band, painted, read,
and ``it worked for a while,'' says Smith. ``Drugs were a part of
that. You know how it works for a little bit and after a while it
doesn't? He ended up going `Ok, I did that.' '' He rejoined the
band and Smith says, ``He is all focused. I was really surprised to
hear he was clean and ready to go. As soon as we started playing in
Flea's garage, we just started rocking. There was such good
chemistry with the four of us there.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith says Frusciante's involvement was pivotal, both for
songwriting _ he's a more melodic writer than Navarro _ and from a
personal point of view. ``Playing with John,'' says Smith, ``it was
all about music. It felt so good, so right. Anthony has been so
great. There hasn't been any relapses. I don't know what's going to
happen tomorrow, but we just go with what's happening today and
what feels really good now.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith can't really explain how the magic works. ``We just all
get in a room and jam off the top of our heads, just make noise,
and the seeds of a lot of songs happen that way. If we hit on a
groove, and everybody is smiling, we'll tape it and do another.
We'll give tapes to Anthony so he can ride around in his car and
listen to them. He'll get inspired by something and come back with
melodies and words. (Producer) Rick Rubin comes in and we hone it
down, try to make the best songs we can.
</P>
<P>
   ``A very big part of the band is the love and respect we have
for one another, not just musically, but as people. It's the whole
brotherhood thing. It might sound hippie-ish, but it's sincere. We
are all so completely, spastically, different _ we're freaks _ but
there's balance and it just works for us. It's kind of an
intangible. You can't analyze it too much. I don't see how other
bands do it, riding separate buses and never seeing each other.
There's no vibe. And people pick up on that.''
</P>
<P>
   It wouldn't be the Chili Peppers without some deep funk grooves,
and there certainly are those on the new CD, beginning with the
first track, ``Around the World.'' But the album continues along
the more melodic direction the Peppers have been headed in for some
time. The title track is the centerpiece, a look at their home
state, particularly Los Angeles. Sings Kiedis: ``It's understood
that Hollywood sells Californication . . . Hard-core soft porn /
Dream of Californication . . . Space may be the final frontier /
But it's made in a Hollywood basement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anthony is the principal lyrics writer,'' says Smith, ``and
it's really his take on how he sees the influence that Hollywood
and California have on the outside world. Some of it's very
negative, and some of it's beautiful, but it's got to such a point
where (Hollywood) makes the world so much smaller. Little kids,
wherever they are, watch the E! channel and say `I should be
dressing like this.' . . . There's some ugly, disgusting, terrible,
ridiculous, phony stuff going on in Los Angeles, and I've had some
of those experiences. But I'm not into that scene _ what kind of
car you drive, how much money you have. It has nothing to do with
real life.''

`MONDAY' TAKES ORGY TO THE TOP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM SULLIVAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A pulsing, angst-y, but ultimately uplifting and melodic
techno-rock song called ``Blue Monday'' has been coursing over the
airwaves for some time now, with its singer repeatedly asking,
``How do I feel? How should I feel?'' A confused young America can
relate. Girls and boys, both.
</P>
<P>
   The singer is Jay Gordon and the band is Orgy, a sharply
dressed, spikey-haired, futuristic- and good-looking quintet from
southern California that seemed to have appeared, fully formed, on
the Korn-helmed Family Values tour last year. They had not cut
their teeth in clubland, yet they had a major label debut album,
``Candyass,'' and, suddenly, there they were in the arenas with
Korn, Rammstein, and Ice Cube.
</P>
<P>
   Now the album is on the verge of going platinum (having sold
almost 1 million copies), very much on the strength of ``Blue
Monday'' _ a song written and recorded by the moody English
electro-pop band New Order. Hmmm, the skeptics say. A big hit out
of the box, (itals)but not with their own song.(unitals)
Credibility? Perhaps, it is suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Orgy shrugs. What can you do?
</P>
<P>
   Signed to the Warner Bros.-backed Korn imprint label,
Elementree, Orgy is one of the hot bands playing at WBCN's sold-out
River Rave Sunday at the Tweeter Center in Mansfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it starts to go good,'' says guitar-synthist Amir Derakh,
``everybody wants to say, `Well you guys had it too easy.' It's
always like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Derakh doesn't want to pull a suffering artist act, but says,
``All of us have done the club circuit. We've been in many
different incarnations and other bands.'' (Guitarist Ryan Shuck,
bassist Paige Haley, and drummer Bobby Hewitt round out the unit.)
Three of the Orgy guys were in a band called Lit. Derakh even
logged time in an '80s hair metal band called Rough Cutt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of everything I've done,'' he says. ``I'm not
embarrassed by it. Every band I've been in has been different.
That's just the way I am. For me to keep doing this, I almost have
to re-invent myself to keep myself interested.'' Gordon and Derakh
have also engineered and produced for years.
</P>
<P>
   Orgy is a well-packaged outfit, no question. Derakh says their
fashion sense is as important as their sound. ``We wanted to make a
statement with the image. We didn't want to be grotesque or
anything _ we weren't gonna be GWAR _ but we wanted to have like a
clean, fresh, futuristic look, but still be a rock band. We knew
what we didn't want, being like KISS or whatever. That's too much.
It's great for them, but not what we're about.''
</P>
<P>
   A role model was Pete Burns, leader of the slinky glam/goth '80s
English group Dead or Alive. ``A great look,'' muses Derakh,
``pretty, yet masculine. I liked Dead or Alive and Duran Duran.''
</P>
<P>
   Other influences: David Bowie, Kraftwerk, Joy Division, Bauhaus,
Motley Crue, Ratt, Judas Priest, drum 'n' bass, house.
</P>
<P>
   The Orgy guys like to describe their music as a collage. Even
the band name, they claim, was inspired by the idea of a musical,
not sexual, orgy. ``The name is just a name,'' says Derakh. ``If it
makes people giggle or whatever, that's cool. But everything we do
besides the name has nothing to do with the sexual thing. We didn't
want to come out with a bunch of naked chicks on our record cover.
It's too one-dimensional. (Still) it gives it that double-entendre
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Their music is a mix of grinding hard-rock and aggro-techno.
Gordon has called it ``death pop.'' ``He said that once and it
stuck for a year,'' says Derakh, with a laugh. ``We were like `If
you took `death' and `pop' and put them together, it's kind of us,
because it gives you the black and the white. We like to have good
melodies and maybe our arrangements can sometimes be of a more
simple pop type, but there's this very dark foreboding undertone to
our music as well.''
</P>
<P>
   What of the ``Blue Monday'' effect? ``Only time will tell,''
says Derakh. ``I'm not going to complain about it. At least it got
us noticed. If the general public is going to think (of us), `Oh,
it's the band that does `Blue Monday,' well, hopefully we can
change that over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did the song because we loved it, and we had no idea it was
going to be the single, or even on the record. I think we did it
justice. I think it sounds like us. It was probably one of my
favorite songs from the '80s. I was already a New Order fan and
that song cemented it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay and I were out CD shopping and talking about it,'' Derakh
says, ``and I said, `Do you got any New Order CDs? They have a good
one here if you want to buy it.' He's like, `Does it have ``Blue
Monday'' on it?' and I said, `Yeah, it does _ hey that would be a
good song for us to cover.' We took the CD back to the house,
listened to it, and everybody was like, `That would be fresh.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Within a few days we started working on it, and it just came
together pretty easily. It took a while to get the arrangement the
way we wanted to because we wanted it to be different, but keep the
integrity of the original. The way it was orginally arranged, it
was much more dance-oriented and one-dimensional; we needed to add
more dynamics to it to make it an Orgy song. We put a chorus on it,
which it didn't have. It never had that big `How does it feel?'
(New Order's Bernard Sumner) only sings that once and it's in the
verse.''
</P>
<P>
   They tinkered with the melody slightly, grunged up the guitar
and performed it not via computers or keyboard synthesizers (a la
New Order) but live. (Orgy's synthesizer sounds come from Derakh,
who plays a guitar-synth.) Says Derakh: ``Our drummer plays all
electronic drums. We have no tapes, no sequencing, pre-recordings
or click tracks.'' The same applies in concert, he says.
</P>
<P>
   How does ``Blue Monday'' fit Orgy's ethos?
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a mixture of things,'' says Derakh. ``I think there's
the darkness _ it's sort of a dark relationship song _ and we write
those, too. Aside from that a lot of our stuff is pure fantasy,
things our singer imagined. Some of it can be placed into real
situations involving people we know and some of it is just made up.
None of it paints a specific picture. Basically, it's up for
interpretation.''

 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ If Hillary Rodham Clinton runs for the U.S. Senate
from New York, she will be hoping for support from the Empire
State's sizable Jewish population to win.
</P>
<P>
   A key adviser, who asked not to be identified, said that while
the first lady has no specific aide working on the Jewish vote, she
has received advice from several political figures and experts on
Jewish politics in the state.
</P>
<P>
   With a population of 1.6 million _ 9.1 percent of the state's
total _ Jews are a key ingredient to victory in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But their vote, although traditionally Democratic, is not
guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   For openers, Clinton, if she runs, will have to explain remarks
she made last year favoring creation of a Palestinian state, still
a sore point among many Jews.
</P>
<P>
   Her May 1998 statement that it is ``in the long-term interests
of the Middle East for Palestine to be a state'' came in the midst
of delicate peace negotiations and created a brief but intense
controversy. The White House politely disavowed her comments.
Israel has long opposed Palestinian statehood as a threat to
Israeli security.
</P>
<P>
   But in Israeli elections earlier this month, incumbent Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu lost to challenger Ehud Barak, who has
vowed to jumpstart negotiations that might ultimately lead to
Palestinian statehood.
</P>
<P>
   The election signaled a turning point that may end up countering
the fallout of Clinton's Palestinian-statehood remark among Jewish
voters, Clinton supporters said. Several pointed to the decision
last week by the influential American Israel Public Affairs
Committee (AIPAC) _ a pro-Israel lobbying group _ to drop its
opposition to a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the atmospherics are changing,'' said David Singer,
research director for the American Jewish Committee (AJC), a New
York-based organization devoted to civil rights and religious
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Others point to polls showing American Jews are not uniformly
hostile to a Palestinian state. An AJC survey this month of 1,000
Jews found 47 percent opposing such a state and 44 percent
supporting it.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said,
``There'll be elements in the Jewish community that will make an
issue out of this'' but predicted that the issue would not be
decisive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's going to have to make her case to Jewish voters on why
she should be senator from New York, but that's going to involve
bread-and-butter New York issues rather than foreign policy,'' the
adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   New York State Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, said
he talked to Clinton about her Palestinian-statehood remark in
March. She explained that she had been inspired by a conversation
with the late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin who told her
that ``the only way to make peace is with an entity, and that if it
had no shape and no form, it is very difficult to enforce an
agreement,'' Silver said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But her commitment is the same as our government's,'' he
continued. ``She believes unequivocally that the parties should
make an agreement, and that our government should not impose
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans say Clinton is vulnerable among Jewish voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish community has a long memory,'' said Matthew Brooks,
executive director of the Republican Jewish Coalition. ``I think
Hillary Clinton will find that support in the Jewish community will
not be as easy as she thinks it is..MDRV/.MDNM/''
</P>
<P>
   For Jewish voters, he added, a race involving Clinton is just as
likely to turn on issues such as crime, education and saving Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks also pointed to the 1997 re-election victory of New York
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is seen as the leading Republican
contender for the Senate seat being vacated in 2000 by retiring
Democratic Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, Giuliani, a non-Jew, won 70 percent of the Jewish
vote against Democratic challenger Ruth Messinger, who is Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were a Democratic strategist, I'd be very concerned about
Giuliani's ability to leverage his strength by bringing those
constituencies into supporting Republican candidates,'' Brooks
said.
</P>
<P>
   Whichever way it leans in any given election, the Jewish vote is
not monolithic. In New York City, with a million Jewish residents,
10 percent to 15 percent of the Jewish population is orthodox or
ultraorthodox, according to Singer. Though many of these Jews are
loyal Democrats, they also are politically conservative when
compared with more secular Jews, Singer said.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, there is a solid Jewish Republican tradition in
New York. The late Republican lawmaker, Jacob Javits, who was
Jewish, served in the U.S. Senate from New York from 1957 to 1981.
Rep. Benjamin Gilman, another New York Republican Jew, has served
in the House since 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Some polls show Clinton doing well among Jews. In a survey last
week of 807 voters by the Hamden, Conn.-based Quinnipiac College
Polling Institute Clinton beat Giuliani 48 percent to 42 percent.
Among Jewish voters, who made up 8 percent of those questioned,
Clinton trounced Giuliani 60 percent to 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
   A poll last month by the Poughkeepsie, N.Y-based Marist College
Institute for Public Opinion showed the two in a statistical dead
heat: 44 percent for Clinton and 43 percent for Giuliani. But among
Jews, 12 percent of the 512 questioned, Clinton beat Giuliani 51
percent to 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Yet a poll of 748 voters two weeks ago by Zogby International of
Utica, N.Y. showed Giuliani beating Clinton among Jewish voters 50
percent to 36 percent. Among voters overall, Giuliani beat Clinton
49 percent to 44 percent, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Jews are important in New York balloting because of their
reputation for heavy turnouts.
</P>
<P>
   According to data cited by Singer, 72 percent of eligible Jewish
voters went to the polls in New York's 1997 mayoral race. Overall,
only 38 percent of the city's eligible voters cast ballots.

   AMERICAN-MURDERS (Undated) _ At the heart of the analysis of the
killings last month at Columbine High School in Colorado has been a
deceptively simple question: Were the killers chillingly aberrant
monsters or were they a part, however perverse, of something in our
culture as a whole? But long before Columbine, this question and
others were being asked by professors as homicide became an
increasingly conspicuous slice of American scholarship. By Peter
Applebome. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   MAPS-HISTORY (Undated) _ The history of maps once seemed a
quaint preoccupation. Aged maps _ with their compass roses, their
illuminated borders and their vast blank spaces _ were sought by
collectors and historians but were otherwise considered artful
relics of ignorance, faltering steps on the way to modern
geography. No longer. In the past 25 years there has been a sea
change in the world of cartography. The study of maps has come to
seem urgently contemporary, taking on all the contours now familiar
from recent academic studies of history, literature and culture. In
this realm, they are being looked at as instruments of power. By
Edward Rothstein. (1700 words)

SEAL A REAL `HUMAN BEING' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICK MITCHELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seal's latest album is ``Human Being.'' The title is a wry
commentary on the way music is labeled and marketed in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's anything that saddens me, it's the segregation
between people and music in the United States,'' Seal said by phone
from his home in Los Angeles. ``Why are there such tall boundaries
between R&AMP;B, or black music, and white music?
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming from England, that's the thing I find most stifling
about the United States. In Europe, it's not really like that.
Basically, radio stations play everything. And that's really how it
should be, man. I don't just make music for black people or for
white people. I make it for my brothers and sisters, my fellow
human beings. There should be no rules.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Seal will perform at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell
Pavilion in The Woodlands, Texas. He's bringing a band of fellow
human beings that includes studio ace Michael Landau on guitar,
former Bruce Springsteen keyboardist David Sancious, former Peter
Gabriel bassist Tony Levin and Louisiana-born jazz drummer Brian
Blade.
</P>
<P>
   The show marks Seal's first Houston-area appearance since a 1995
date in The Woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``No. It hasn't been that long, has it?'' he said. ``You know
something? I don't even know. You'd probably know better than I
would.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Human Being,'' which features a nude silhouette of the artist
bathed in blue light on the cover, was more than four years in the
making. Released in November, the album so far has failed to match
the multiplatinum sales of 1994's ``Seal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a difficult record, but then most of my records tend to
be quite difficult,'' Seal said in a proper British accent. ``I
think that I wrote the songs that I needed to write in terms of the
message that I'm sending out, which is one of love and harmony, a
message of humanitarianism. And so it is a success for me from a
spiritual and artistic point of view.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he's given up on the album's commercial prospects.
</P>
<P>
   ``My records tend to stay around for a long time, and they have
an unorthodox path in terms of their commercial success,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My second album had four singles released from it, including
''Kiss From a Rose,`` which was a stiff the first time around. The
album was counted out, dead and gone, then what happened was this
big movie came along called ''Batman Forever`` and basically
brought ''Kiss From a Rose`` to a lot of people's attention. Four
Grammys later, everyone's saying, `Of course, what a fantastic
song.'''
</P>
<P>
   Seal was born Sealhenry Olumide Samuel 35 years ago in London to
a Nigerian mother and a Brazilian father. Although he now projects
a stylishly erudite air, he grew up poor and on the streets. At one
point, he was put up for adoption and then reclaimed by his father.
The mysterious-looking scars on his cheeks are the result of a
childhood bout with lupus.
</P>
<P>
   Seal's 1991 self-titled debut album produced the dance-pop hits
``Crazy and Killer,'' but it was ``Kiss From a Rose'' that
catapulted him to stardom in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The songs on ``Human Being'' tend to follow in even more moody
and intricate patterns, with Trevor Horn's sleek Euro-pop
production contrasting with Seal's smolderingly soulful vocals and
philosophical lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Colour'' is a plea for racial harmony, while ``Human Beings''
refers to the deaths of rappers Tupac Shakur and the Notorious BIG.
Other songs, such as ``No Easy Way'' and ``When a Man Is Wrong,''
were inspired by his romantic travails with supermodel Tyra Banks
and another ex-flame.
</P>
<P>
   Seal says he emerged from those relationships wiser and
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point I was trying to make was that any experience like
that is a strengthening experience, one that stimulates growth, if
you choose to see it that way. I wanted people to be able to
identify with it and say, `OK, it's not just me that goes through
that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Both men and women, we go through all kinds of disillusion. We
go through periods of being disconnected from the self, of acting
outside of ourselves through fear and insecurity. My relation to
the album was one of constantly searching for love and harmony in
other people, rather than knowing that charity begins at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Seal has since come to better terms with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in the most wonderful place of my entire life that I think
I could ever be,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And what has brought on this change?
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, that's what brought on the change. My connection with
myself and my connection with everything around me, with God. Not
necessarily in the biblical sense, but that, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Seal promises his next album won't take as long to make as the
last one. He says the album will be a dance-oriented project
incorporating elements of his West African heritage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thinking of doing some Ghanian highlife, some Nigerian
juju, deeper stuff. There's a whole wealth of goodies in that
area.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, however many copies ``Human Being'' eventually sells,
Seal said he'll always be proud of the songs on the album.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very funny and fragile concept, the music business. You
can't really get too bogged down by it. Obviously, I look back on
the album and think there's one or two things I could have done
better, but I consider the work on this album to be my best work.''

FORMER CELL MATE, CHILDREN TAKE STAND  
 (ADV: FOURTH OF FOUR STORIES RECOUNTING WEEK'S TRIAL ACTION) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY KAMMER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Scott Falater's sleeping patterns were the focus of
Thursday's testimony at his murder trial, as a former jail cellmate
told jurors Falater walked in his sleep several times while
confined at the Madison Street Jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott got down from the bunk, went over to the door and shook
the heck out of the door,'' said Robert Bluntschly, who shared a
cell with Falater during most of 1997. He said Falater repeated the
pattern two or three times.
</P>
<P>
   Bluntschly's testimony bolstered Falater's defense in Maricopa
County Superior Court against first-degree murder charges in the
1997 death of his wife of 20 years, Yarmila.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's attorneys admit that he stabbed his wife 44 times and
dragged her into their backyard pool at their Phoenix home. But
they say he was sleepwalking at the time and therefore cannot be
held criminally liable.
</P>
<P>
   Bluntschly testified that the sleepwalking Falater moved rigidly
in the cell and did not respond when Bluntschly asked if something
was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I told him later, he had no memory of doing it,'' said
Bluntschly, who is appealing a murder conviction on charges of
killing his fiancee.
</P>
<P>
   Falater's two teenage children also testified Thursday, telling
jurors their parents had a gentle, loving relationship in which
they never fought and managed to smooth over disagreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just like any other home,'' Michael Falater, 15, told
the jury of 10 women and five men. ``We were happy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We all loved each other and tried to support each other as
best we could,'' said 17-year-old Megan Falater, the valedictorian
of this year's graduating class at North Canyon High School.
</P>
<P>
   Both children remained poised, despite the obvious strain of
testifying in the case that stems from their mother's death and
could end with their father's execution.
</P>
<P>
   Megan, who plans to begin studies this fall at the University of
Chicago, made her feelings clear when asked what she wanted for her
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like for him to be with Dad, so I can go to college,
and he will be with his family,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But under cross-examination by prosecutor Juan Martinez, the
Falater children acknowledged that until their mother's death, they
had not been told that their father was a sleepwalker.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez also sought to undermine Bluntschly's credibility,
pointing to his criminal record and ridiculing the testimony that
Falater moved rigidly during the sleepwalking episodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's approximately two feet from the end of the bed to the
bars'' in the door, Martinez said. ``He was rigid for two steps?''
</P>
<P>
   When testimony resumes Tuesday, defense attorneys plan to call
other relatives of Scott Falater to talk about his history of
sleepwalking. Falater's sister has told investigators that he
lifted her and tossed her across a room during a sleepwalking
episode 20 years ago at the family's Illinois home.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors are also expected to hear testimony from Falater's
colleagues at Motorola about the work-related stresses that,
according to the defense team, played havoc with Falater's sleep in
the weeks before the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's testimony from the Falater children also indicated
that sleepwalking runs in the family.
</P>
<P>
   Megan talked about getting up in the middle of the night and
preparing for school until her father told her to go back to bed.
And Michael recalled his inability to understand an instance when
he awoke in the living room after falling asleep in his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from defense attorneys, the Falater children
undermined the defense theory that Scott and Yarmila Falater had
become estranged because of tensions stemming from their membership
in the Mormon Church.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez is attempting to convince jurors that although Scott
was a devoted Mormon, Yarmila resented the church's intrusions on
her time and Scott's desire to have more children.
</P>
<P>
   Megan testified that while her mother disliked individuals
within the church, she respected the institution. She said her
parents' disagreements on the size of the family were handled in a
light-hearted manner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure that was not a problem,'' she said. &QL;

ALICE ADAMS, A MASTER OF SHORT STORIES, DIES AT 72 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alice Adams, whose novels and short stories
about strong women and life in San Francisco made her one of the
most celebrated writers in the region, died in her sleep Wednesday
at her home. She was 72.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams, who was released from a hospital earlier in the week
after treatment for heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a writer, she was considered one of the masters of the
short story,'' said fellow writer and longtime friend Millicent
Dillon. ``Most of her work was about people in San Francisco. She
had a really remarkable ability to write about the surface of
society and then get down to the level of how they felt.''
</P>
<P>
   The last of Ms. Adams' 10 novels and five short story
collections was published last year. ``This Last Lovely City'' was
another work about San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Fredericksburg, Va., she grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C.
Ms. Adams' father was a University of North Carolina language
teacher and her mother was a frustrated writer. Ms. Adams graduated
from high school at 15 and from Radcliffe College at 19.
</P>
<P>
   She married college sweetheart Mark Linethal and they spent a
year in Paris before moving to San Francisco in 1948. They were
divorced in 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams published her first short story for The New Yorker in
1969 and became one of the magazine's most distinctive voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and
women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said her New
Yorker editor, Fran Kiernan. ``She was a great romantic, with the
highest expectations of life. As a writer, she was unfailingly
wise.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Adams claimed she inherited the reticence of her
Southern female characters, legendary editor William Abrahams said
of her, after meeting her in the 1950s, that ``she was not going to
pretend she wasn't the bright woman she is. The stereotype of women
being mildly stupid in order to get ahead in the world simply never
touched her. And that didn't always make her especially loved ...
I'm tempted to say that Alice was a kind of feminist before her
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams' 1975 novel, ``Families and Survivors,'' about a woman
who moves to San Francisco from the South, established her as a
front-rank writer. ``Superior Women,'' a 1984 story tracing the
lives of five Radcliffe women, was a best-seller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Southern Exposure,'' her ninth and possibly best novel, was a
return-to-roots masterpiece set in the South.
</P>
<P>
   She won the prestigious O. Henry Special Award for Continuing
Achievement in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams had a wry view of the lives of independent women, and
of life itself, and could be at once funny and trenchant in
describing both during salons at her beautiful Victorian home.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Adams is survived by her son, Peter Adams, of San Francisco.

AUTHOR DEFENDS HIS BOOK ON GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ZACHARY COILE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After three decades covering political battles
from Tel Aviv to Moscow to Capitol Hill, it seemed natural for
journalist Bob Zelnick to write a book about one of America's
foremost politicians: Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision to write ``Gore: A Political Life,'' cost him
his job as an ABC News correspondent and has made him a target of
attacks by Gore supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick, now a visiting professor of journalism at Boston
University, defended the book in an interview with the San
Francisco Examiner as a fair and balanced look at the Democratic
presidential hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't pull any punches, but it doesn't take any cheap
shots either,'' Zelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   The book's release March 29, about a year before Democratic
voters in California and other states begin picking a nominee for
the 2000 presidential race, has irritated the Gore campaign.
</P>
<P>
   While the biography is at times flattering, it also hones in on
what Zelnick sees as Gore's weak spots, from his questionable
campaign fund-raising tactics to his refusal to admit he reversed
his stance on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast with Gore's boss, President Clinton, the vice
president is depicted as a man of strong morals, a dedicated
husband and father of four. But as a leader, Zelnick says Gore's
high principles have made him intolerant of dissenting views,
especially on environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central weak spot in Al Gore's character is an overbearing
self-righteousness that doesn't allow for the possibility of error
and therefore doesn't allow for the possibility of well-meaning
opposition,'' Zelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't escape the feeling that a self-righteous person who
does not concede the possibility of another reputable point of view
poses a certain danger when he has the power of the presidency in
his hands,'' Zelnick said.
</P>
<P>
   The book ended his 21-year career at ABC News, where he had
worked as a Pentagon correspondent and foreign correspondent in
Israel and the former Soviet Union. ABC executives felt the
biography would undermine Zelnick's credibility as a Capitol Hill
correspondent and hurt the network's reputation, so he resigned
last February.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's political team has been bashing the book since before it
was released, claiming it contains no new information and is a
right-wing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a regurgitation of old news,'' said Roger Salazar, deputy
press secretary for the Gore campaign. ``(It) represents an effort
to plow old ground in hopes of kicking up some mud.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is published by Regnery Press of Washington, which has
published books by Republican firebrand Patrick Buchanan and Rep.
Dick Armey, R-Texas. Zelnick concedes the publishing house is
conservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be a right-wing publisher, but I'm not a right-wing
author,'' said Zelnick, who describes his own views as
``center-right'' _ liberal on most social issues and conservative
on economic and national security issues.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Backfire: A Reporter's Look at Affirmative
Action,'' also published by Regnery in 1996, angered many liberals
because of its sharp criticism of affirmative action programs.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore biography details how the vice president, the son of a
Tennessee senator, was groomed for a role in government from the
time he was a boy. He attended the elite Washington prep school,
St. Albans, and later studied government at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   After a brief stint as an army reporter in Vietnam and as a
staff writer for the Nashville Tennessean, Gore parlayed his family
name into a seat in the House of Representatives and later the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   While his father was known as a left-of-center Southern
lawmaker, Gore billed himself as a ``screaming moderate.'' He
became one of Congress' top nuclear arms experts and was one of 10
Senate Democrats who backed President George Bush's Persian Gulf
War amendment _ a vote the hawkish Zelnick lauds as an ``act of
conscience'' that could have hurt his political career if the war
had gone badly.
</P>
<P>
   But at other moments, Zelnick charges, Gore sacrificed his
principles for political expediency. As a congressman he voted
several times for amendments banning the use of federal funds for
abortions _ part of his view that government should not be seen as
endorsing the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   But during a debate in the 1992 presidential campaign, when Gore
was the running mate of a strongly pro-choice Bill Clinton,
then-vice president Dan Quayle reminded Gore of his earlier
``pro-life'' position. ``That's simply not true,'' Gore responded.
</P>
<P>
   Zelnick credits the vice president, along with Clinton, for
``yanking the Democratic Party out of the (1972 Democratic
presidential candidate George) McGovern era and moving it to the
center.'' But especially in Gore's strong environmental views, the
author sees a streak of extremism he finds troublesome.
</P>
<P>
   In Senate hearings on global warming, Gore was hostile to
scientists who said the phenomenon of rising temperatures needed
more study before taking drastic action, Zelnick writes. And when a
former professor of Gore's from Harvard joined in an academic paper
downplaying the threat of global warming, Gore and his aides
claimed the aging educator had been coerced by the co-authors, the
book says.
</P>
<P>
   The book also rehashes disclosures about Gore's efforts to raise
money for the 1996 election _ including the claim that a Buddhist
temple fund-raiser was an ``outreach'' event.
</P>
<P>
   But Zelnick finds no fault with Attorney General Janet Reno's
decision not to appoint an independent counsel to probe Gore's
fund- raising efforts, particularly his questionable calls to
donors from the White House. Democratic and Republican lawyers told
Zelnick the law is too vague and the case against the vice
president had too many holes.

   AMERICAN-MURDERS (Undated) _ At the heart of the analysis of the
killings last month at Columbine High School in Colorado has been a
deceptively simple question: Were the killers chillingly aberrant
monsters or were they a part, however perverse, of something in our
culture as a whole? But long before Columbine, this question and
others were being asked by professors as homicide became an
increasingly conspicuous slice of American scholarship. By Peter
Applebome. (1500 words)

   MAPS-HISTORY (Undated) _ The history of maps once seemed a
quaint preoccupation. Aged maps _ with their compass roses, their
illuminated borders and their vast blank spaces _ were sought by
collectors and historians but were otherwise considered artful
relics of ignorance, faltering steps on the way to modern
geography. No longer. In the past 25 years there has been a sea
change in the world of cartography. The study of maps has come to
seem urgently contemporary, taking on all the contours now familiar
from recent academic studies of history, literature and culture. In
this realm, they are being looked at as instruments of power. By

JEREMY NORTHAM PLAYS TO TYPE IN `THE WINSLOW BOY' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By LOUIS B. PARKS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made of filmmaker David Mamet going against his
usual style with his new, much-praised ``The Winslow Boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Mamet, known for his caustic R-rated dialogue (``Glengarry Glen
Ross''), mature themes of deceit (``House of Games,'' ``The Spanish
Prisoner'') and enigmatic, clipped characterizations, has produced
a G-rated version of a popular play (by the late Terence Rattigan)
in which everyone behaves with great restraint and uses oh, so
proper language.
</P>
<P>
   For actor Jeremy Northam, however, the film is a return to
exactly what people expect of him. Northam plays a very British,
very gentlemanly lawyer in the early 20th century, a role similar
to many he has played before.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care if I (ever) do another movie with a wing
collar,'' the actor says, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   At 37, the tall, darkly handsome Northam _ one of the most
popular actors on the British stage _ has spent a great deal of his
career playing proper Englishmen in period stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always thought of me in terms of costume drama,''
he says. ``I think I have a whiff of the previous century about me.
I must have more showers.''
</P>
<P>
   His own joke obviously amuses him.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many British actors, Northam certainly doesn't behave or
speak stuffily _ he jokes around and uses slang _ although there is
no mistaking the British accent.
</P>
<P>
   After he did ``Emma,'' the Jane Austen adaptation in which he
played Mr. Knightley opposite Gwyneth Paltrow's title character,
Northam worried that he might be too typecast as an Englishman of
the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you do something that people respond to, then
that's what you do (all the time),'' Northam says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he tried to break out of the mold. After ``Emma''
and another period role as a judge in Amistad, he played an
American in the offbeat horror film ``Mimic'' and an Irish thug in
``Gloria.''
</P>
<P>
   He also made the upcoming ``Happy, Texas,'' a small independent
comedy in which he plays an escaped convict who hides out as a gay
pageant organizer.
</P>
<P>
   But the switch to contemporary was temporary. In his two films
this summer he plays English gentlemen from the past, both
barristers (lawyers) with the title ``Sir'' in front of their
names.
</P>
<P>
   In ``An Ideal Husband,'' the new film version of the Oscar Wilde
play due here June 25, Northam is Sir Robert Chiltern, a politician
whose marriage and position are threatened when a former fiancee
(Julianne Moore) rattles a skeleton in his closet. That film
co-stars Cate Blanchett and Rupert Everett.
</P>
<P>
   In ``The Winslow Boy,'' Northam is Sir Robert Morton, the lawyer
and politician who takes the case of a 12-year-old boy accused of
stealing at his school. The boy is expelled and denies the charges.
</P>
<P>
   There is a small irony in Northam's playing these two roles.
Morton is based on the real-life Edward Carson, the lawyer who
prosecuted Wilde.
</P>
<P>
   The 1910 case that inspired ``The Winslow Boy'' was that of
13-year-old George Archer-Shee. Rattigan changed all the names and
many of the personalities involved, although the story remained
basically true. It was filmed once before, starring Robert Donat
(``Goodbye Mr. Chips'') in Northam's role.
</P>
<P>
   There has been much speculation about Mamet's decision to turn
this particular play into a movie. No doubt he was influenced by
the chance to direct his wife, British actress Rebecca Pidgeon
(``The Spanish Prisoner''), in a British role. He also cast her
brother, Matthew Pidgeon, as her brother in the film.
</P>
<P>
   But Northam thinks it was mainly Mamet's longtime interest in
the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``David just loved the mechanics of the play, the craftsmanship
that went into the structuring and the telling of the story, the
way it worked like a perfect little machine, which it does.''
</P>
<P>
   After doing ``The Ideal Husband,'' ``Happy, Texas'' and ``The
Winslow Boy'' in a row, Northam has had more down time than he
really wants recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've actually not worked since August last year,'' he said.
``I did a play in London that finished (at) the end of February.
I'm looking forward to working again.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in a wing collar.

WINDOWS 98 SE CLEARS THINGS UP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In late 1996, Microsoft upgraded Windows 95 with a new version
that included, among other features, a new file system that gave
users more space on a hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   Despite that tantalizing option, Windows 95 OSR2 was not
available to most PC users.
</P>
<P>
   That's because it was only sold with a new machine or, in some
cases, a new hard drive. Microsoft argued that most of its new
features were only applicable to newer machines. Thus, if you
wanted a better Windows, you also had to buy a better computer.
</P>
<P>
   The Windows faithful were not amused. I suspect OSR2 became one
of the most-pirated operating systems of all times, as folks with
older machines discovered their neighbors brought home a new
computer _ complete with a Windows 95 install CD. ``Hey, Bill,
wanna come over for a beer? And say, bring your Win95 disk with ya.
How 'bout it?''
</P>
<P>
   Now Microsoft has updated Windows 98, and clearly has learned
from its past mistake. Windows 98 SE (Second Edition) will not only
replace the current boxes of Windows 98 now on store shelves, but
users of existing Windows 98 systems will be able to order a $20
upgrade CD via Microsoft's Web site in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MODEM-SHARING MADE EASY &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I've been using Windows 98 SE for several weeks. While it's
certainly not as compelling an upgrade as Windows 98 was from
Windows 95, it's definitely worth considering, particularly if you
currently have or plan to add a home network.
</P>
<P>
   The installation process is virtually identical to that for the
original Windows 98. In fact, I had to check to make sure I wasn't
reinstalling my old version.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever you update an operating system, you run the risk of
breaking something else on the computer. Sure enough, installing
Windows 98 SE on my PC gave me problems with my Turtle Beach
Montego II sound card _ some games invoked the Blue Screen of Death
when I tried to run them. Reinstalling the sound card's drivers
fixed the problem.
</P>
<P>
   (Obligatory safety warning: Whenever you upgrade your operating
system, back up your key data files and make sure you have all the
latest drivers for your hardware at the ready.)
</P>
<P>
   If the FAT32 file system was the big deal with Windows 95 OSR2,
then Internet connection sharing is the main attraction for Windows
98 SE. If you have PCs connected via a network, this lets one
computer act as the conduit to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Those who promote home networks as the next wave in consumer
computing tout modem-sharing as the ``killer app'' for linking PCs
around the house. While I think higher-speed connections such as
cable modems will make modem-sharing obsolete, it's nice to have
this feature built into the Windows operating system while waiting
for the future to get here.
</P>
<P>
   When you install the modem-sharing feature, a simple wizard pops
up that asks a few questions about your computer and how you want
other machines to use its modem. At the end, you're asked to put a
blank disk in your floppy drive, and the wizard places a program on
the disk that's used to configure other PCs on the network.
</P>
<P>
   The sharing feature works well enough in most cases. However, if
you have an unusual setup in which your Internet provider has given
you a fixed numeric address (most dial-up connections assign a
random address upon log-on), you may run into problems. This is
because Windows changes the address of your machine so that the
others on the network know how to talk to it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MAKING PEACE WITH USB PORTS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the other features in Windows 98 SE is better support for
Universal Serial Bus, or USB, devices. Windows 95 OSR2 had support
for USB, but it was lousy. The original Windows 98's USB support
improved dramatically, but still choked occasionally. So far, I've
found the USB support in the SE version to be rock-solid.
</P>
<P>
   The new OS also comes with Internet Explorer 5, which I believe
currently to be the best Web browser available (See
www.chron.com/content/chronicle/tech/99/03/26/compute.html). If
you've been holding off getting IE5 because of the amount of time
it would take to download the browser via the Net, getting it along
with this operating system upgrade is a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   There are other benefits _ a new version of NetMeeting,
Microsoft's Internet phone program; support for IEEE 1394, also
known as FireWire and iLink, a high-speed connection found on some
new computers; and, of course, numerous bug fixes.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the fixes, by the way, already have been posted to the
Windows Update area of Microsoft's Web site. A Windows 98 Service
Pack will be posted soon that rounds all these up, and adds a few
more that are part of the Second Edition.
</P>
<P>
   One new feature that Microsoft has not touted but I think is
excellent is that some error messages are linked to help files. I
discovered this when my modem tried to connect and got no dial
tone. In previous versions of Windows, there's a cryptic message
that says ``No dial tone.'' With Windows 98 SE, however, I got a
button that took me to a modem trouble shooter.
</P>
<P>
   Is this new version of Windows 98 a must-have? Certainly, if you
still have Windows 95 or, heaven forbid, Windows 3.1, and have been
holding off making the move to 98, then yes, this OS is for you.
Ditto if you have a home network and don't have multiple phone
lines.
</P>
<P>
   However, if you've already upgraded to Internet Explorer 5; have
kept up with the various patches Microsoft's released for Windows
98; don't have any USB problems; don't have a FireWire port on your
computer; and you don't have an in-home network and have no plans
for one, then probably not. Just grab the Windows 98 Service Pack
when it comes out and get on with life.

AOL CONNECTION LETS USERS BROWSE WITH REGULAR INTERNET SOFTWARE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DWIGHT SILVERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: I have a computer that has Netscape Communicator set up as
the browser for my Internet service provider. However, I have AOL
now, but I still want to use Netscape with it. How do I go about
changing from AOL's browser to Communicator?
</P>
<P>
   A: In most cases, this is much easier to do than most people
realize.
</P>
<P>
   When you connect to America Online, you are using the same kind
of connection you'd use with any other Internet provider. That
means you can use other software for accessing the Internet when
you log on to AOL.
</P>
<P>
   Simply launch Netscape Communicator _ or Microsoft's Internet
Explorer, if you prefer _ and use it. That's all there is to it.
</P>
<P>
   There is one caveat, however. If you previously were using
another Internet provider, it's possible that you were required to
configure Communicator to go through a firewall _ a piece of
security software designed to keep hackers out of your provider's
system. If Communicator is set up to look for certain firewall
settings for your previous provider, then it won't work with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   To undo those settings, go to Edit, then Preferences, then
Advanced, then Proxies. Click on ``Direct connection to the
Internet.'' That will turn off the firewall settings.
</P>
<P>
   The settings will still be in place, in case you want to go back
to your old provider. Just recheck the item there that enables the
proxy connection.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am curious and confused. Is it a good idea to dump the
contents of the Windows temporary folder? It can get quite large
and I am not sure how often and at what intervals that Windows will
dump it automatically. I am a neat nut and I don't like unneeded
stuff on my hard drive _ but I don't want to do something that
might present a problem either. I seem to have enough without
provoking any more.
</P>
<P>
   A: Unlike the Recycle Bin, which is actually a folder with an
adjustable limit as to the number of items it can hold, the Windows
temporary folder (usually windowstemp) doesn't get ``dumped.'' This
is something you have to do yourself.
</P>
<P>
   The temporary folder is a kind of staging area where programs
place temporary files. For example, if you install new software,
the components of that program are often compressed, and must be
expanded before they can be installed. When you run the install
routine, the components are placed into this temporary folder
before they are moved or copied into their permanent folder.
</P>
<P>
   However, not all programs clean up after themselves like they
should, leaving digital detritus in the temporary folder. It's a
good idea to check in there about once a month and delete its
contents.
</P>
<P>
   Be careful, though, not to delete any temporary files that are
currently in use. But how can you tell what's being used?
</P>
<P>
   Right-click in the folder, choose View, then Details. Click on
the Modified bar that appears at the top of the list, and the files
will sort themselves by date and time. If you see any files that
were created in the past hour or so don't delete them. If you want
to be extra safe, don't delete anything created that day, unless it
happens to be the leftovers of a software installation.
</P>
<P>
   Everything else can go.
</P>
<P>
   Q: My computer's modem will sometimes connect in the middle of
the night. This bothers my sleeping wife. How can I turn off the
modem sound?
</P>
<P>
   A: Go to the Windows Control Panel, and click on Modems. Choose
your modem from the list that appears, then click Properties.
</P>
<P>
   You'll see a panel that includes a volume slider. Move it all
the way to the left, to the Off position.
</P>
<P>
   On some computers, the modem sound is controlled in the same way
that other sounds are _ via the speaker icon found in the system
tray. If the previous strategy doesn't work, double-click on the
speaker icon and look for a modem volume control there.

 &HT;    RUGOVA VS THACI: KOSOVAR ALBANIANS ALSO FACE CRISIS OF
LEADERSHIP
 &HT;    By BERT ROUGHTON JR. 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _If and when ethnic Albanians are returned to
Kosovo by NATO, they must confront yet another formidable challenge
to unifying their shattered province.
</P>
<P>
   Each other.
</P>
<P>
   Pushed into exile here and elsewhere by the crisis in Kosovo,
two rival groups led by two equally popular men are engaged in a
bitter campaign to gain acceptance as the legitimate government of
Kosovo, the embattled southern province of Serbia, Yugoslavia's
dominant republic.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is beginning to worry Western diplomats, who are
pressing the two sides to resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Rugova, who has held the title ``president of the
Republic of Kosovo'' for seven years, had been the most visible
Kosovar leader before the NATO air war against Yugoslavia. But
Rugova, who is called the ``Ghandi of the Balkans,'' is seen by
many Kosovar Albanians as too moderate in his push for an
independent Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   He earned the enmity of committed separatists in April when he
was seen on television news tapes meeting with Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic and signing a joint declaration calling for an
end to the air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   His detractors were unmoved by explanations by Rugova supporters
that he was pressured by Serb authorities, who held him captive in
his home in Pristina, Kosovo's provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova's softening support has been exploited effectively by the
more militant Hashim Thaci, who is described here as the prime
minister of the Interim Government of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci is closely associated with the Kosovo Liberation Army, the
rebel force that helped elevate the struggle in Kosovo into warfare
by attacking Serb police and soldiers last spring. On Friday, Thaci
arrived in the United States to meet with government officials.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   The men couldn't be more different. Rugova is a 54-year-old,
Paris-educated literary academic. In 1992, he was elected president
of the self-proclaimed Republic of Kosovo in polls ignored by
Belgrade. He was re-elected last April but more militant and
impatient ethnic Albanians boycotted the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci, 28, is a handsome former student activist who has been
sentenced to jail by a Serb court for subversion. His nickname is
``Snake.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   While Western diplomats have favored Rugova, they are finding it
hard to ignore Thaci, who has demonstrated keen political skills.
Yet, his status is complicated by his association with the KLA,
which NATO intends to disarm as part of any peace arrangement with
the Serbs when Kosovo is liberated. Additionally, Thaci and the KLA
want Kosovo to be completely independent of Yugoslavia, a goal NATO
officially opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Thaci also enjoys the support of the Albanian government and has
been making the rounds here over the past week seeking broader
political support.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the week, Thaci made a series of highly publicized
appeals to Rugova to come to Tirana so the leaders could patch up
their differences.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova refused, intensifying the rivalry. Some critics have come
close to calling Rugova a traitor. Paskal Milo, the Albanian
foreign minister, on Thursday accused Rugova of recklessly
undermining Albanian unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``By skipping his meeting, Rugova has rendered the greatest
possible disservice to the cause of Kosova and to his standing as a
politician,'' Milo told a local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   He said NATO officials had also expressed concern about the
rift. ``When foreigners see there is no unity among Kosovar factors
they are in a dilemma,'' Milo said.
</P>
<P>
   Rugova supporters here dismiss Thaci as a Marxist troublemaker
who is allowing his own ambition to create confusion over Kosovo's
leadership. They also worry that the presence of two Kosovo
governments is harming their ability to raise money abroad.
Albanians in the United States and elsewhere have funded Rugova's
government with a voluntary 3 percent income tax.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very difficult problem,'' said Ramadan Musliu, the
editor of Rilindja, a Kosovar newspaper printed in exile. ``Who
will win is not clear. The KLA is divided, too, but they put their
divisions away to fight the Serb criminals. Who knows what will
happen when they no longer have the Serbs to unite them.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, U.S. officials are trying to forge a
settlement but have been frustrated by their inability to talk to
Rugova, who has visited Italy and Macedonia since being freed by
Milosevic, but not Tirana.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian government officials believe Washington is beginning to
side with Thaci, who emerged as a leader during talks in
Rambouillet, France. The talks produced the peace plan, signed by
both Thaci and Rugova, that NATO is seeking to impose on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers here reported that Thaci has been engaged in lengthy
talks with U.S. officials. ``The United States will now have their
final say and it seems that luck will be with Hashim Thaci,''
reported the independent daily, Koha Jone.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy here did not respond to requests for a
clarification of the government's position on the rift.
</P>
<P>
   Musliu believes that the only solution will be internationally
monitored elections in Kosovo once its people are returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``But these people have no homes or food, no way to live,'' he
said. ``First, these things must be addressed. Only then can we
decide the politics.''

FCC CONSIDERS WAYS TO LIMIT NUMBER OF AREA CODES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Consumer groups and state regulators in
California applauded a Federal Communications Commission proposal
to curb the manic growth of new area codes.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC announced Thursday that it would look at ways to limit
the creation of area codes in the future. The boom has been created
in part by the growing number of lines dedicated to facsimile
machines and Internet connections.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most prominent measure under consideration is
reducing the size of number blocks awarded to phone companies.
Currently, companies are assigned 10,000 new phone numbers at a
time. Under that system, many numbers go unused. The FCC proposes
to reduce the number blocks to 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting the size of number blocks, the agency said, would
prevent telephone companies from controlling or hoarding unused
numbers that could be allocated to other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Because numbers can only be assigned in huge blocks, ``There are
over 160 million phone numbers that could be available in
California, but only 30 to 40 million are being used,'' said Regina
Costa, a telecommunications specialist at the Utility Reform
Network in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Sullivan, a telecommunications adviser at the California
Public Utilities Commission, said the FCC's proposal was ``an
encouraging first step. It's been long-awaited. It appears the FCC
now understands the problems we're facing in California.''
</P>
<P>
   That problem is a potential tripling of the state's area codes
from 13 in early 1997 to at least 39 by 2001 if new federal
guidelines are not created and enforced.
</P>
<P>
   There are 215 area codes across the United States, almost double
the 119 in service in 1991. Industry officials project the need for
30 new codes a year unless changes are made.
</P>
<P>
   Adding digits to existing phone numbers could solve the problem,
the agency said, but that could take years and cost billions of
dollars.

DOCTORS HURRIED AS HMOS SET PACE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By L.M. SIXEL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Holding his cellular phone in one hand and checking
his pager with the other, Alan Glombicki careened down the freeway,
swerving in and out of traffic.
</P>
<P>
   He nearly ran up the back end of several cars, putting on his
brakes in the nick of time. Seeing me trembling with fear in the
passenger seat, Glombicki assured me that he's a professional at
this high-speed dodge 'em game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be a cab driver in Boston,'' said the
gastroenterologist, who was in a hurry to see patients at Methodist
Hospital and Park Plaza Hospital in Houston because he had a
waiting room full of patients back at the office.
</P>
<P>
   Fast driving has become a critical skill in this environment of
managed care. Doctors need enough volume to pay their overhead
expenses because of lower managed care reimbursements. Many, like
Glombicki, actually trot from exam room to exam room.
</P>
<P>
   Employers change health plans to save money, so they sign
contracts with a variety of hospitals, said Glombicki, as he tore
down an alley marked ``wrong way.'' Glombicki logs an average of
100 miles a day in his car, seeing patients scattered around area
hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   I got a chance to watch Glombicki in action because the Harris
County Medical Society has a mini-internship program that pairs
members of the community with doctors in a variety of practices.
This week I spent two days with four doctors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A DROPOUT FROM MANAGED CARE &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The speed at which Glombicki worked is the reason David Miller
got out of the managed care business three years ago. Miller, an
internist whose office is at the Texas Medical Center, dropped his
health maintenance organization contracts and sees only 17 patients
a day, about half of what many doctors see.
</P>
<P>
   It was crazy seeing 30 patients a day, said Miller, who never
appears to be in a hurry and always calls his patients by their
names. ``How's your mother?'' he asked one patient. ``Is she
feeling OK?''
</P>
<P>
   When he had HMO contracts, Miller said, he didn't have enough
time to visit with his patients. Instead he was spending time with
clerks on the phone trying to get tests approved, filling out forms
and faxing them back and forth. And then he'd wait three to six
months to get paid.
</P>
<P>
   There is room for a small-town doc who doesn't do managed care,
said Miller, who is proud his patients are referred by other
patients and not from ``the book,'' the derogatory term referring
to the list of approved providers that insurance carriers publish.
</P>
<P>
   For most doctors, a constant flow of patients is a way of life.
And all that meeting, greeting and doctoring can be emotionally
exhausting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like being on stage,'' said Margaret Kinalska, a
pediatrician who saw 39 patients on a recent day. Every few minutes
she goes into an exam room to meet another child and parent and
tries to establish rapport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every five minutes it's solving a problem,'' she said with a
sigh, as she noticed she had to spend so much time on her first
afternoon patient that she was already way behind. She apologized
to all of the patients she had kept waiting.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kinalska tried to explain why the experience is so
emotionally draining. ``I feel the burden. I know they expect
something from me. They examine me and it's very important what I
say.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THE BATTLE OVER REFERRALS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doctors seem to spend an inordinate amount of time filling out
forms proving they need to refer a patient to a specialist, then
fighting with insurance companies that refuse the request.
</P>
<P>
   It's so frustrating, Glombicki said, as he sorted through a
stack of parking access passes while waiting to enter a hospital
garage.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he said, some insurance companies don't want to pay
for liver transplants unless a patient is at death's door, even
though the plan they sell employers clearly says that liver
transplants are covered.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies know patient turnover runs 20 to 30 percent,
so if someone is a candidate for a liver transplant before getting
really sick, chances are they will be with another carrier when the
transplant becomes critical, Glombicki said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at his office, Glombicki counsels one patient, who has been
off from work, about the perils of long-term disability. Many
times, that's an excuse for an employer to fire an employee who is
seriously ill, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After the patient left, Glombicki said he gets calls from
insurance companies complaining that employers believe the doctor
is being too lenient with time off from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not subtle,'' he said. ``They'll say: `Of course, use
your medical judgment, &QL; 
but ...'''

`PC DADS GUIDE' WRITTEN FOR PARENTS IN DIGITAL AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: This story duplicates material in the DIGITAL-LA column for
use May 29). 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Worried more than ever in the wake of various
school shootings about what your children are doing on the
computer? Two Intel senior managers have recently come out with a
book that may provide some useful suggestions, ``The PC Dads Guide
to Becoming a Computer-Smart Parent'' (DTP Trade Paperbacks;
$13.95)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the entire 311-page book can be encapsulated by one
piece of sage advice on Page 118: ``You have time to spend together
with your child. Avoid the temptation to use the computer as an
electronic baby sitter. Instead, make it a partnership affair,
something you both share and enjoy. We call this
shoulder-to-shoulder learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book includes much else, with chapters on topics such as
``Raising a Computer-Smart Daughter'' and ``Boys, Game Addiction
and Violent Software,'' and appendixes with suggestions for
child-friendly Web sites, nonviolent popular games (such as the
sainted SimCity and many high-adrenaline racing titles) and more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tips for digital parenting: Put the computer in the
areas where you live, rather than tucked away in a bedroom or other
back area; create a software ``diet'' that balances various needs _
and rotate the offerings; create and post rules on usage; keep an
open mind to the inevitable changes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It also has suggestions for managing how much time children
spend on games, suggesting tricks like using poker chips as chits
to track how much time children spend on educational programs and
uses. For every half-hour of such usage, they get a chip they can
cash in for an equal amount of time playing games.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put into practice some of what you've learned
from the book, go to their Web site,
at &UR;  &LR; www.intel.com/intel/educate/pcdads/index.htm &UR; . &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; History lessons &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Here's a big idea: Little books illuminating complicated
subjects. Doubleday has now published four books under the rubric
``The Big Idea,'' each focusing on one thorny technical topic by
way of one particularly intriguing historical figure.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Strathern authored all four books, two of which have just
come out. One focuses on Albert Einstein and his theories of
relativity; the other on cryptography and artificial intelligence
pioneer Alan Turing and the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect great depth in 100 pages (with large type, even),
but they are brisk reads that give a quick rundown of both a large
figure in 20th-century thought, and the ideas they helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   The books also come with brief annotated bibliographies for
further reading, key points and sayings, and a chronology of their
subjects' lives and times.
</P>
<P>
   The other two books in the series, by the way, are about
physicist Stephen Hawking and black holes, and Isaac Newton and
gravity. Nothing like thinking big. &QL;

KIDSAFE-COMPUTERS) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Worried more than ever in the wake of various
school shootings about what your children are doing on the
computer? Two Intel senior managers have recently come out with a
book that may provide some useful suggestions, ``The PC Dads Guide
to Becoming a Computer-Smart Parent'' (DTP Trade Paperbacks;
$13.95)
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the entire 311-page book can be encapsulated by one
piece of sage advice on Page 118: ``You have time to spend together
with your child. Avoid the temptation to use the computer as an
electronic baby sitter. Instead, make it a partnership affair,
something you both share and enjoy. We call this
shoulder-to-shoulder learning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the book includes much else, with chapters on topics such as
``Raising a Computer-Smart Daughter'' and ``Boys, Game Addiction
and Violent Software,'' and appendixes with suggestions for
child-friendly Web sites, nonviolent popular games (such as the
sainted SimCity and many high-adrenaline racing titles) and more.
</P>
<P>
   Among the tips for digital parenting: Put the computer in the
areas where you live, rather than tucked away in a bedroom or other
back area; create a software ``diet'' that balances various needs _
and rotate the offerings; create and post rules on usage; keep an
open mind to the inevitable changes ahead.
</P>
<P>
   It also has suggestions for managing how much time children
spend on games, suggesting tricks like using poker chips as chits
to track how much time children spend on educational programs and
uses. For every half-hour of such usage, they get a chip they can
cash in for an equal amount of time playing games.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to put into practice some of what you've learned
from the book, go to their Web site,
at &UR;  &LR; www.intel.com/intel/educate/pcdads/index.htm &UR; . &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
HISTORY LESSONS
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Here's a big idea: Little books illuminating complicated
subjects. Doubleday has now published four books under the rubric
``The Big Idea,'' each focusing on one thorny technical topic by
way of one particularly intriguing historical figure.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Strathern authored all four books, two of which have just
come out. One focuses on Albert Einstein and his theories of
relativity; the other on cryptography and artificial intelligence
pioneer Alan Turing and the computer.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect great depth in 100 pages (with large type, even),
but they are brisk reads that give a quick rundown of both a large
figure in 20th-century thought, and the ideas they helped shape.
</P>
<P>
   The books also come with brief annotated bibliographies for
further reading, key points and sayings, and a chronology of their
subjects' lives and times.
</P>
<P>
   The other two books in the series, by the way, are about
physicist Stephen Hawking and black holes, and Isaac Newton and
gravity. Nothing like thinking big. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
GET IN THE GAME
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Among the tidbits gleaned from the massive Electronic
Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles comes this little fact:
</P>
<P>
   The recently released Game Boy Color hand-held machine, with its
56-color display, is roughly 100 times more powerful than the
original Atari 2600 console of the mid-1980s, according to one
estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Even more powerful is SNK's new handheld game machine, the Neo
Geo Pocket, with a 16-bit processor that's roughly twice as
powerful as the Game Boy. We won't even talk about what to make of
Palm Pilots and the like that have an increasing array of games
available.
</P>
<P>
   And though the 128-bit processors in the Sega Dreamcast, the
Sony PlayStation 2 and the Nintendo Dolphin all promise to make
possible astounding new games as those machines hit the market in
the next two years, current machines are far from dead.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is doing the most to make sure that doesn't happen by
promising backward compatibility in its PlayStation 2; any game you
buy for the original PlayStation will play in its successor machine
as well.
</P>
<P>
   But even with new machines tempting everyone in coming months,
consider this: Majesco recently announced it will start making and
selling its own version of Nintendo's 16-bit Genesis game box,
which came out the generation before the N64.
</P>
<P>
   At $30, the Majesco Genesis is supposed to provide gaming
opportunities to families that can't afford the expensive
next-generation machines and software. And there's plenty of games
for the box still around, with Majesco selling titles through major
outlets such as Toys ``R'' Us. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
FOOTBALL GOES HDTV
</P>
<P>
   &LR; In a development that will surely send the number of
high-definition television sets in sports bars around America
skyrocketing, ABC-TV said it will broadcast the next Super Bowl and
all its Monday Night Football in HD.
</P>
<P>
   ABC will work with Panasonic to broadcast all 17 Monday night
telecasts, one wild-card playoff game and next January's Super Bowl
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   A few sporting events _ including some of KTLA's Los Angeles
Dodgers baseball games and two playoff football games last season _
have been broadcast in HDTV, but nothing with the drawing power of
Monday Night Football _ and certainly not of the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Having seen some of the HD demonstration footage shot at the
Super Bowl a couple of years back between the Dallas Cowboys and
Pittsburgh Steelers, I'll tell you now that fans' jaws will drop
when they see their favorite teams on a large-screen TV in
high-definition resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In the demonstration I saw some months ago on a wonderful
Vidkron projection system, you could practically pick out the beads
of sweat on Deion Sanders' brow at 200 feet. As an onlooker said,
it's more like a window than a TV set. So who really needs an NFL
team in Los Angeles anyway? Besides the NFL, I mean. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR;  &QL; 
LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   `` &LR; The Next Twenty Years,'' a seminar series in its second year,
is making its Los Angeles stop this week at the Pantages Theatre
with a crew of thinkers pondering the future of entertainment while
two dozen companies show the technology they're offering to help
get there.
</P>
<P>
   The Thursday seminar will feature Digital Domain CEO Scott Ross,
theoretical physicist Michio Kaku and Warner Bros. Online executive
vice president Jim Bannister talking about entertainment and the
future. Their discussion will be moderated by Dan Farber, a vice
president and editor in chief of ZDNet.
</P>
<P>
   At a cocktail party beforehand that's part of the event, about
two dozen companies will be showing off their bleeding-edge
technologies for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second year for the seminar series _ other events will
be held in San Francisco, New York and London _ and if it matches
last year's stimulating discussion, it should be a blast.
</P>
<P>
   The event will be held at the Pantages, 6233 Hollywood Blvd.,
from 5:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. Some tickets are still available, for $25
online at &UR;  &LR; www.next20years.com, or $35 at the door. &UR;  &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
VIRUS KILLER
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Here's a useful site for people worried about Melissa,
Chernobyl and all the other fast-multiplying viruses out in the
digital universe these days, not to mention more basic computer
maintenance needs.
</P>
<P>
   McAfee.com (at www.mcafee.com), from the software division of
Network Associates that creates anti-virus and other programs, is a
boon, replacing all that packaging with convenient online access to
a suite of infection cleaners and other services for your home
computer.
</P>
<P>
   And for the time being, the services are available for a free
trial, though the company will charge modest subscription fees soon
enough. The services available include VirusScan, the Oil Change
automatic updater program, Uninstaller QuickClean and 2000 Toolbox
for Y2K checkups.
</P>
<P>
   The site does raise some privacy issues, of course. You'll have
to decide whether you want to give some company unfettered access
to your hard drive to allow for the scans and other cleanup work to
be done. But McAfee officials said they've bent over backward to
assure they don't invade anyone's privacy while giving them a hand
managing their machine. &QL;

 &HT;    SENTENCING AGENCY HAS $9.3 MILLION, 87 WORKERS, NO BOSSES
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The seven spacious offices have posh furnishings,
magnificent views of the Capitol grounds and a staff of 87
assistants down the hall. All that's missing at the U.S. Sentencing
Commission is commissioners.
</P>
<P>
   For seven months, this agency with a $9.3 million budget has had
no one to oversee its guidelines for the 51,000 federal criminal
sentences a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the last occupant of the suite,'' Tim McGrath said this
week. As the former top aide to the last chairman, he has been left
in charge after the commissioners left one by one, starting more
than two years ago. President Clinton and the Senate have been
wrangling much of that time over who will replace them.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, unfinished work stacks up, with Congress
sending new directives for tougher sentences for sexual predators,
trafficking in methamphetamines, and cellular phone fraud. With no
commissioners, no decisions can be made on new guidelines and no
adjustments made to existing ones.
</P>
<P>
   That has frustrated lawyers and judges alike, many of whom were
already critical of the agency, which was established as a
non-political effort to bring uniformity to federal criminal
penalties. Without a commission, they say, the system becomes too
rigid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason Congress established a commission rather than
passing mandatory sentencing laws for every offense is they wanted
to build in flexibility, so that, as the commission received
feedback, the guidelines could be amended,'' said U.S. District
Judge Frederic N. Smalkin in Baltimore. ``It's pretty hard to do
that without a commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan J. Chaset, a Virginia attorney who chairs a sentencing
committee for the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers,
said that without a functioning commission, there's no one to
resolve disputes among courts over sentencing guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-year-old commission, whose chairman is paid $145,000 a
year, was supposed to be non-political. But for years, vacancies
have touched off contests among politicians over whose top aide or
ally will be appointed. Senate Democrats competed with each other
for months over their four slots, and Senate Majority Leader Trent
Lott, R-Miss., and Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
have vied over the three posts allotted to Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``So they're saying, 'we can't agree on it, so we won't do
anything,' `` Chaset said. ``If it's not important enough to give
this $10 million agency the people to run it, why have it?''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to President Clinton are promising action soon. ``We're
aware of the situation. We'd like to nominate a bipartisan slate
shortly,'' said White House spokesman Jake Siewert. He said that
``shortly'' means ``in the next month or so.''
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Hatch said that the senator ``has been working with
the White House to try to get names up here who are confirmable.''
</P>
<P>
   Back at the vacant commissioner suite, McGrath said his headless
agency is continuing to enter case information into computers,
draft options for the unnamed new commissioners to rule on later,
and give briefings on sentencing rules. They also check White House
and congressional offices for news of appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hearing the word 'imminent,' `` McGrath said. ``But I've
been hearing 'imminent' for the last seven months.''

LAWMAKER PUTS EUTHANASIA BILL ON HOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ The lawmaker sponsoring a bill that would
legalize assisted suicide in California conceded that she did not
have enough support for the measure, but said she might revive the
``Death with Dignity Act'' next year.
</P>
<P>
   Modeled after an Oregon law, the measure would allow terminally
ill patients to choose death with the help of a doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to try to get the Legislature up to where the
general public is, because clearly the public supports this,''
Assemblywoman Dion Aroner, a Democrat from Berkeley who sponsored
the bill, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Aroner's decision came after some legislative arm-twisting in
the Assembly Appropriations Committee Thursday. Aroner had worked
all day trying to get an 11th lawmaker on the 21-member committee
to support her bill.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democrat from Los
Angeles, agreed to temporarily replace an unsympathetic member of
the committee with Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth Jackson, a Democrat
from Santa Barbara, and the bill was approved by the committee.
</P>
<P>
   That exhaustive effort convinced Aroner that it would be nearly
impossible to get the 41 votes she would need for the bill to pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle to get 11 votes, can you imagine getting
41?'' said Hans Hemann, Aroner's aide.
</P>
<P>
   Almost immediately after introducing her measure this year,
Aroner said she believed it would be a tough sell in the
Legislature. She said it could take years of convincing skittish
members to support such a controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
   The measure requires that two doctors certify an ill person to
be mentally competent and ``reasonably determine'' that the patient
will die within six months. The patient would have to make four
requests, some in writing, before the lethal drugs would be
administered. Doctors would not be allowed to suggest assisted
suicide as an option; the patient must bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Aroner said recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings that directed the
states to begin addressing the right-to-die issue, and strong
public support for euthanasia, meant it was ``finally time to begin
the discussion in California.''
</P>
<P>
   Although California voters rejected a ballot initiative on
euthanasia in 1992, a Field Poll released recently showed 75
percent of those surveyed now believed terminally ill patients
should have the right to get life-ending medication.

GRADUATION DAY IS A FAMILY AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MICHAEL DOUGAN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ If the story of Scott, Toni and Junile Smith
were made into a movie, the last scene would be filmed Saturday
during graduation ceremonies at San Francisco State University.
</P>
<P>
   A freeze-frame finale: Three diploma-waving Smiths fall into
each others' arms, their commencement gowns blowing in the breeze;
a family healed as their future is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths are college roommates who share apartment rent and
food expenses equally, who have studied, partied and attended
classes together.
</P>
<P>
   They are also father, mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths will enjoy their last academic exercise as a team
Saturday, receiving simultaneous bachelor's degrees from the
university's School of Speech and Communication.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish that they abandoned their traditional family
relationship. In doing so, they strengthened it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helped us a lot,'' said Junile Smith, 24, who had
attended the University of San Francisco on her own after
graduating from high school near Seattle. ``Before I went to USF,
we weren't really close. We weren't a family unit.''
</P>
<P>
   They weren't ready for what three years later would become an
unconventional family experiment. ``If we had been roommates while
I was at USF, we would have killed each other,'' Junile said with a
laugh.
</P>
<P>
   The family's troubles began 18 years ago in San Diego, when
Scott and Toni Smith, both now 43, were married, and Scott adopted
Junile, Toni's daughter by a previous marriage. But at 6 years old
Junile was unwilling to accept Scott as her father. Scott, in turn,
did not respond well to her resentment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of conflict,'' Toni Smith said, ``a lot of
stress and anger between those two. They used to just bump heads
all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   After three years the family moved to Seattle. Scott worked for
the Department of Defense as an engineering and design technician.
Toni took a job at Seattle University Law School and owned her own
insurance company. They bought a house. By the time Junile started
high school, she and Scott had achieved a truce.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like a truce of love or anything,'' Junile
explained. ``We had come to an understanding, but we weren't really
as close as we are now.''
</P>
<P>
   Junile eagerly left home to attend college, to pursue her own
life unburdened by adults who loved and annoyed her. Then, she
said, reality set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``College wasn't like it is in the movies,'' she recalled. She
missed her mom and, to her own surprise, she missed Scott.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think perhaps when she went to school she felt that `this
guy's been there for me,''' Toni said. ``He is my dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Junile dropped out of school and returned home. She returned to
parents who were also not content with their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were both doing well in our jobs as far as moving along,
but we were not satisfied with where it was taking us,'' Scott
said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next year, the three Smiths hatched a plan to pursue
their educations together.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked this out and realized that if we were going to make
it work, we would have to sell our house, we would have to scale
down quite a bit,'' Toni said. ``We talked quite a bit about it. I
think we went into it with our eyes wide open.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of acceptance extended to the family relationship:
``We just came to an understanding that we all had to look at each
other as adults,'' Toni said. ``She (Junile) couldn't just look at
us as her parents, and we couldn't look at her only as our
daughter. We decided how much money each of us needed to make for
it to work.''

<P>
   The Smiths chose San Francisco State. Four years ago, they
packed their bags, moved into a Burlingame apartment and began what
Scott calls ``an excellent adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Smiths are contemplating their careers. One idea is to start
a family consulting business.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever career path they choose, they are now a family, the
long-standing rift between Scott and Junile having been consigned
to history.

   NITEOUT-FLYER (New York) _ Surveying the crowd last Thursday
night at Stylus, a weekly party held at a Lower East Side sushi
lounge called Never, Hosi Simon, 24, nodded approvingly that few
people were eating. ``If people were eating and ignoring the music,
that would be a bad sign,'' said Simon. He is the editor in chief
of Flyer, a palm-size monthly club listing guide that has become
the equivalent of Zagat's for the deejay set. Riding around the
city on his mountain bike, Simon is an obsessional inspector,
visiting as many as eight clubs a night. By Julie Chaplin. Photo.

   STORE-RETURNS (New York) _ Shoppers and retail analysts say that
at many boutiques in New York, as well as at local branches of some
regional and national chains, return policies have gotten leaner
and meaner in recent years. By Monique P. Yazigi.
</P>
<P>
   BOUTIQUE-HOTELS (Undated) _ In recent years, I have gotten used
to staying at so-called boutique hotels _ lodgings that are long on
style, even when they're notoriously short on space; hotels like
the Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach. By Frank
De Caro.

   GARDEN-COLUMN (Undated) _ A great many people do not like beets.
Beet detesters may find solace in the fact that the ancients _

either. Beets were grown for their greens. The roots, which Pliny
referred to as ``the crimson nether parts,'' were used only
occasionally for medicinal purposes. By Cass Peterson.

TAKE DOWN NINE TILES AS A UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. We are about to gut a bathroom, but there are nine 1950s wall
tiles (4- by 4-inches) put together to form a 12- by 12-inch
picture of a salmon that I want to preserve and mount. Are there
any tried and true ways of removing the tiles from the wall before
or during the gut without chipping them to death?
</P>
<P>
   DERRICK JACKSON, Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If the tiles were put on the wall with an adhesive, and not
mortar, you might be able to pry or pop them off. Experiment by
trying this with tiles you don't want to save. Place a wide chisel
or stiff putty knife under the edge of a tile and tap lightly, then
pry. Tiles set with adhesive so long ago should yield. Then you do
the same with the salmon portrait tiles. Be careful, and, if in
doubt, don't.
</P>
<P>
   If the tiles were set in mud (mortar), which they might have
been that long ago, it is impossible to pop them without breaking
them.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, or if you are reluctant to try popping the tiles,
try this:
</P>
<P>
   Chip off the tiles surrounding the nine-tile portrait, cut out
the portrait as a unit, wall and all, and pull it off, keeping the
plasterboard or plaster wall intact. If the plasterboard or
plastered wall behind the nine tiles is nailed or secured to a
stud, you have to cut the nails holding the plasterboard or
plastered wall before removing the whole thing as a unit. You can't
pull the nails out the back of the wall without endangering the
tiles or tearing the wall apart.
</P>
<P>
   Build an open box of 1 x 2 boards and insert the unit in the
box. Nail 1/4-inch hardboard to the back of the box, stain and
varnish the box and mount the whole thing on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart would approve.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I wrote to you last week requesting help with finding a door
hinge. This is a specialty hinge that raises a door as it opens to
accommodate sloping floors. Do you know of any such thing and, if
so, where can I find them.
</P>
<P>
   BILL MARKOS, No town
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. The hinges are called rising butt hinges, which raise
the door as it is opened. Try the Constantine catalog,
800-223-8087.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My neighbor is very nice, but odors from her cooking waft
into my house. I have soffit vents venting the attic, but it
doesn't help. Is there something that I can do?
</P>
<P>
   M. J. B., West Palm Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   A. Smells from a neighbor's kitchen, house to house, can be a
nuisance, and while the odors may be wafting into your attic via
the soffit vents, it is unlikely that they are getting into your
house through the attic floor, unless the attic floor is not
insulated. Besides, the vents in your attic (soffit vents, and
perhaps even a ridge vent) exhaust air, and any odors going into
the attic will also be pushed outdoors.
</P>
<P>
   I think odors are coming directly from the neighbor's house to
your house. If you have air conditioning and windows are closed, I
don't have an answer, because a closed, tight house should keep
odors out. If you do not have air conditioning, I think central
air, with windows and doors closed, would keep the odors out.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My neighbor's kitchen odors are coming through the walls, I
think, from her condo to mine. How can I keep them out?
</P>
<P>
   P. H., Walpole, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. If your neighbor's unit is attached to yours, I don't think
there is a solution, unless you close all windows and install air
conditioning. This also may be iffy if the walls between your units
are leaking air. It would be difficult to seal that wall, although
caulking all joints might help. Be thorough in caulking joints; one
joint left open will be the conduit for the odors.
</P>
<P>
   There may be hope. Install a fan in a window, exhausting to the
outdoors, with at least one other window open so you can get a flow
of air in and out. This constant, slow exchange of air might keep
the odors within tolerance.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. Water is seeping through joints in my concrete-block
foundation. How can I stop it?
</P>
<P>
   BALBIR SINGH, Somerville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Repoint the joints in the concrete block and see what
happens. That is, chip out old mortar and insert new. This should
help, even stop the water from coming in through the wall. If it
doesn't, you may have go to a pro who could pump in a waterproofing
agent on the outside, covering the wall without excavating. The
only other way is to excavate, apply hot tar or other waterproofing
material to the wall, and backfill.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. When I put up screens, I notice they are not dirty but look
dirty. How can I clean them?I.
</P>
<P>
   S., Peabody, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A. Try dry-sweeping with a stiff broom, on both sides. Lay the
screen on a flat, even surface (sidewalk or driveway). That will
improve things but not cure them. Second, scrub with a stiff broom
dipped in a strong solution of Spic and Span and water. That is as
clean as you will get them, short of givng them an acid bath to
reduce innate mineral buildup.
</P>

GROWING BEETS: IT'S NOT EASY BEING CRIMSON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By CASS PETERSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A great many people do not like beets. The majority of them are
either adolescents or adults who formed their opinion of beets as
adolescents, probably as a result of being confronted at school
lunch counters by canned Harvard beets _ crimson cubes coated with
a sticky magenta-colored sauce.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt it is futile to suggest that hidebound beet-haters try
them roasted or baked, with a bit of butter. I served roasted beets
to a young friend, who assured me that they were wonderful. Upon
cleaning up after dinner, I discovered the vegetable uneaten,
mashed into near oblivion and hiding under a large crust of French
bread.
</P>
<P>
   Beet detesters may find solace in the fact that the ancients _
Greeks, Romans and Anglo-Saxons alike _ didn't think much of them,
either. Beets were grown for their greens. The roots, which Pliny
referred to as ``the crimson nether parts,'' were used only
occasionally for medicinal purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But then, the ancients saw so many now-common vegetables as
poison or medicine rather than food that it's a wonder they ate any
vegetables at all.
</P>
<P>
   Beets are in the goosefoot family, Chenopodiaceae, along with
spinach, chard and lamb's quarters (a tasty weed that grows
abundantly in most gardens and is nutritionally superior to spinach
and beets _ a fact worth remembering in case you need some cooking
greens and have trouble growing its domesticated relatives).
</P>
<P>
   The beet's botanical name is Beta vulgaris, beta because the
root was thought to resemble the second letter of the Greek
alphabet. It looks more like omicron to me, but it would be
difficult at this point to get used to the idea of putting up a few
jars of pickled omicrons.
</P>
<P>
   Beet lovers know that good ones are hard to find at the market.
They aren't so easy to grow, either, but are worth the trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Garden gastronomes regard beets as a treat _ greens, roots and
all. The thinnings are delicious in salads, and there are always
plenty of thinnings because beets grow from compound seeds. What
looks like a single, star-shaped seed is actually a cluster of
several seeds stuck together.
</P>
<P>
   If all the sprouts were allowed to grow, they would be too
crowded for roots to form. So the gardener thins beets, leaving an
inch or so between plants, and eats the sacrificed seedlings mixed
with other tender spring greens.
</P>
<P>
   If thinning seems too much work, there are monogerm varieties of
beets, like Mobile, which have only one seed per cluster. My
experience is that those beets germinate poorly.
</P>
<P>
   After thinning, a few more weeks of growth provide baby beets, a
delicacy to be found only in the garden or at above-standard
farmers' markets. When the roots are about the size of a quarter,
pulling every other one will provide plenty for eating and leave
the remaining beets at the correct spacing to grow to maturity.
</P>
<P>
   The greens on baby beets are too large and coarse to eat raw in
salads, but they are perfect for gentle steaming. When the beets
are full size, the greens are usually over the hill, good only for
serving to the family iguana.
</P>
<P>
   Garden beets need not be round, nor even red. Formanova and
Cylindra are carrot-shaped beets, easy to slice into perfect disks
for pickled beets. There are white beets and golden beets, and the
delicious Chioggia beet, an Italian variety whose interior consists
of concentric red and white circles, like a bull's-eye.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, Chioggia beets turn uniformly pink when cooked,
but they are so sweet that they can be sliced wafer thin and served
raw in salads, preserving the beauty of their interior rings.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage to white and golden beets is that they do not
bleed when cooked and can be mixed with other vegetables or used in
stir-fries without turning the whole dish carmine. Red beets must
be cooked unpeeled, with the root intact and an inch or so of the
leaf stems attached, to keep from bleeding their color out. You
peel them after cooking, as soon as they cool enough to be handled.
</P>
<P>
   The color is from betacyanin, a form of the same chemical
compound that gives color to red roses, red apples and red
cabbages. Some people are unable to metabolize betacyanin, which
passes intact through their systems. Urinating pink after enjoying
a big bowl of borscht is not necessarily cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difficulty in growing beets is getting them to
germinate properly. Beets can be grown all season long, but like
spinach they germinate best in cool soil. In summer, a sowing of
beets may fail to sprout because the soil is too warm.
</P>
<P>
   One trick for summer beets is to grow them from transplants.
Beets are among the few root vegetables that can be transplanted
successfully. Sow the seeds thinly in a nursery flat; set the flat
in a cool, shady place until the beets have sprouted, and then move
it into the sun. When the seedlings are large enough to handle,
transplant them into the garden.
</P>
<P>
   It's also possible to get an early start on spring beets with
indoor seedlings, but don't try transplanting the carrot-shaped
varieties. They will grow but will be malformed.
</P>
<P>
   Beets are content in average soil, but they like it to be evenly
moist. If the soil fluctuates between wet and dry while the beets
are sizing up, the roots may have white blotches inside, called
zoning. It doesn't affect the flavor, but it will cost you points
at county fair competitions.
</P>
<P>
   You can camouflage the blotches by cooking the beets, cubing
them and coating them in sticky magenta-colored sauce. But why
perpetuate the ranks of beet haters? &QL;

MARRIED TO THEIR CHURCH AS WELL AS TO EACH OTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TARA DOOLEY 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HURST, Texas _ As far as Ginger and David Jarman are concerned,
there are clear advantages to having separate but married
personalities sharing the responsibility of running a church.
</P>
<P>
   Take the chore of finding a memo in an office.
</P>
<P>
   ``David's is neat and clean and organized,'' said Ginger Jarman,
half of the husband-and-wife pastor team at Richland Hills
Christian Church. ``Sometimes it's easier to come in here and say,
`Can I borrow your copy?' ''
</P>
<P>
   But alongside such incidental advantages, David and Ginger
Jarman also have offered their congregation the skills and the
talents of two people committed by vows to ministry and to each
other.
</P>
<P>
   As separate and equal co-pastors of the Disciples of Christ
church, the couple have learned to divvy up the tasks to accentuate
each other's talents. And although the Jarmans are one of two
clergy couples co-pastoring a church in Tarrant County, their
ministry is anything but a novelty, Ginger Jarman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of ways, we try to get along with the work of the
church and not make a big deal of being a clergy couple,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   As married co-pastors, they are a rarity in the area, joined
only by David and Diane Drach-Meinel of St. Andrew Lutheran Church
in Hurst.
</P>
<P>
   As more women become pastors in some Christian denominations,
they often are accompanied by husbands who have a similar calling
to the ministry. Although most of these couples do not find
themselves sharing the pulpit, they do share some of the pressures
of two-career couples _ finding time for the marriage, insisting on
time off and making sure they don't always talk shop.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure is that you lose sight of time to nurture the
marriage and the family, and that is probably one of the biggest
dangers,'' said Joyce Coalson, vice president of the Christian
Church (Disciples of Christ) Center for Leadership and Ministry in
Homeland Ministries in Indianapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the denominations that ordain women _ including the
United Methodist Church, the Christian Church and the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America _ are most likely to have clergy
couples.
</P>
<P>
   Within Disciples of Christ, there are about 200 active clergy
couples among almost 7,000 ordained ministers in the United States,
Coalson said. Of those, 10 percent to 15 percent work in the same
congregation, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Northern Texas-Northern Louisiana Synod of the Evangelical
Lutheran Church in America has three clergy couples, but two of
them are not active, leaving the Drach-Meinels to carry the torch,
Bishop Mark Herbener said.
</P>
<P>
   The Drach-Meinels, the second clergy couple to take the pulpit
at St. Andrew Lutheran, share 1 1/2 positions at the church.
Keeping work in its place can be a challenge, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes when we're at home, we'll say, `Let's not talk about
church,''' Diane Drach-Meinel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because you are always available,'' her husband said. ``Every
time you are together, it's a potential staff meeting.''
</P>
<P>
   But the setup has allowed the Drach-Meinels to spend time with
their children _ 8-year-old Paul and 5-year-old Mark _ who may well
be the ones who keep them honest with their work hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has given us a chance to be with our children quite a bit
and work on our careers,'' Diane Drach-Meinel said.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Jarmans, they divide church tasks.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Diane Drach-Meinel is in charge of the church's
Christian education programs, confirmation classes and social
ministries.
</P>
<P>
   David Drach-Meinel takes on many of the administrative and
financial responsibilities, designs the worship services and
coordinates the music. He also is the resident computer specialist,
working on the church's Web site, and has designed a 9:30 a.m.
Sunday service that makes use of computers for the music and the
message.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to youth retreats, Diane Drach-Meinel takes the
junior high school students to the beach and David Drach-Meinel
takes the high school students skiing in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it just feels a little bit like juggling,'' Diane
Drach-Meinel said. ``You are always passing the baton, and that
gets tricky.''
</P>
<P>
   However, splitting tasks has created an atmosphere in which
congregation members are encouraged to take initiative and start
projects, such as a Braille Bible ministry that was launched in
March at the church, the couple said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to be a permission-giving church rather than an
authority-driven church,'' David Drach-Meinel said.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the advantages come difficulties, many of which are
the same ones that women face when they become pastors, Coalson
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, when the Jarmans' ministry began at Richland Hills
Christian Church, Ginger Jarman was occasionally introduced as the
pastor's wife _ a confusion that they were careful to clarify.
</P>
<P>
   But the confusion can run two ways.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Bryan Feille, a professor at Brite Divinity School
at Texas Christian University and a former pastor of South Hills
Christian Church in Fort Worth, has been introduced twice as the
``pastor's wife'' by members of his wife's congregation, Arlington
Heights Christian Church in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people have in their minds expectations of a minister's
wife, but no one has in their mind an expectation of the minister's
husband,'' said Feille, whose wife, Laurie, took the job in
November 1997 and is senior minister at the church.
</P>
<P>
   Though one benefit of having a spouse with the same career is
that he or she understands the 2 a.m. calls to come to the hospital
and the dinner plans that must be postponed for a funeral or an
emergency meeting, pitfalls sometimes can come with expecting too
much understanding, the Rev. Laurie Feille said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of work and you have to be respectful of each
other's ministry,'' she said. ``Bryan's ministry is just as
important as my ministry. Just because I'm tired doesn't mean he
isn't also tired.''
</P>
<P>
   Though working in ministry with a spouse can be challenging
whether or not the couple shares the pulpit, success can offer an
example to many dual-career couples struggling with similar issues,
Coalson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the couple has worked this out well and has a strong
marriage and family life, there is a sense that they can model that
for other dual-career folks,'' she said. ``That it is not easy, but
it is doable and it is doable in light of one's faith.''

FINDING THE SPIRITUAL MESSAGE IN A MEGAHIT MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``May the force be with you,'' said a Texas minister as he began
his sermon last Sunday. His congregation, of course, knew exactly
what he was talking about.
</P>
<P>
   He focused his sermon on the latest megahit movie: ``Star Wars:
Episode I _ The Phantom Menace,'' part of a film series loaded with
moral and spiritual symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Chris Hughes said he and other ministers he knows are
using the new Star Wars film to reach out to those searching for
spiritual renewal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie is not from the Christian point of view, but that's
OK,'' said Hughes, pastor of United Methodist Church of the
Covenant in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in a time when a huge part of the population is looking
for spirituality,'' he said. ``And we need to reach out to people
who are searching and help them understand that yes, there is a
force out there bigger than themselves. And for us that force comes
from one God.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said his sermon drew wide interest from all ages. The
fact that the spiritual symbolism touches on principles not
strictly Christian doesn't bother Hughes.
</P>
<P>
   ``As Christians we know that Jesus Christ has impacted our lives
with a force that is with us all the time,'' said Hughes. ``We also
have the force of the Holy Spirit.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing the religious and theological themes of the ``Star
Wars'' series is not uncommon.
</P>
<P>
   Even an Internet site created by Eli Williamson-Jones of
Laporte, Colo., is based on the spiritual aspects of the series.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' _ the Religion'' is at
hamp.hampshire.edu/~elwF94/s_w_religion.html. It includes sections
about grace, fall from grace, the dreamer, the journey, friends,
devotion, trials, the master, the test, temptation, compassion,
darkest hour and home.
</P>
<P>
   Williamson-Jones writes that the films are ``like a religion
that teaches great wisdom about the nature of our lives in this
vast universe. From watching ... we can gain tremendous insight
into human nature. We see our deep longings to find adventure,
purpose and peace in our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet site discusses several main characters in moral or
religious terms, including Anakin Skywalker, a man of great promise
who evolves into the evil personage of Darth Vader.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before he fell from grace, Anakin Skywalker was gifted and
blessed with many talents,'' the site narrative states. But he
becomes twisted and malevolent and mistakes good for bad and bad
for good.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Star Wars'' films have provoked theological discussions
since the beginning of the series, said Lonnie Kliever, professor
and chairman of religious studies at Southern Methodist University.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the same old gods and goddesses, the same old conflict
between good and evil, virtue and vice,'' Kliever said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a provocative blending of classical mythology, elements
of Christianity, Hinduism and Buddhism with technological and
scientific forces, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all these extraterrestrials _ kind of angels in modern
garb _ struggling in a kind of world that transcends the everyday
world,'' the professor said. ``And all those persons are bound
together by this transcendent, impersonal force.''
</P>
<P>
   Kliever said interest in the spiritual accounts for much of the
appeal of all the ``Star Wars'' films.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the success of these movies can be laid simply
to their entertainment value, although they are entertaining,''
Kliever said.
</P>
<P>
   The ``force'' in the ``Star Wars'' films is a vast,
incomprehensible power that is more akin to Hinduism and Buddhism
than to traditional Christianity, said Kliever.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the films resonate with the problems that every religion
wrestles with,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   None of this spiritual talk surprises George Lucas, the creator
of the ``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Lucas personally consulted with the late Joseph
Campbell, an authority on mythology who became the subject of a
popular Bill Moyers public television series. In several interviews
and television programs, Lucas reveals that he purposely sought to
involve religion and myth in the ``Star Wars'' series.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to encourage us earthlings to look beyond our
earthbound lives to a ``force'' much higher than ourselves.

THANKS TO THE INTERNET, THE TRADING PUBLIC GETS WHAT IT WANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Five years ago, when the idea of extended trading hours on Wall
Street was first broached, California brokerage houses rose up as
one to kill the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Most West Coast traders begin their days at 4 a.m. so that they
can work in sync with their colleagues in the Eastern time zone.
Working until 7 p.m. (Pacific Time), as extended trading hours
would require, promised them 15-hour workdays every day. That was
not their idea of the California lifestyle, and so the plan was
discreetly shelved.
</P>
<P>
   Today, West Coast brokerage houses have accepted that extended
trading hours will soon be a reality. They did not protest when New
York Stock Exchange Chairman Richard Grasso announced earlier this
week that starting in July, the NYSE would remain open for business
until 10 p.m. Eastern time. And they didn't even bother to contest
NASDAQ's decision to go forward with a similar schedule.
</P>
<P>
   What changed the equation was the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the markets did what the market makers told them
to do. Today, markets do what the trading public tells them to do.
</P>
<P>
   Extended trading hours are costly and inconvenient for Merrill
Lynch and Morgan Stanley, but that's their tough luck. What the
trading public wants, it now gets. That's why stock exchanges will
soon remain open until 10 o'clock at night.
</P>
<P>
   This power shift is illustrative of a much larger shift that is
occurring in what has come to be called the new economy. Simply
put, (itals)Internet technology transfers power to the
end-user.(unitals) The consequences of this fundamental shift are
profound.
</P>
<P>
   Above all, it means that the customer (or end-user) can never be
taken for granted. Businesses that do not understand this basic
tenet of the new economy will come to learn it the hard way.
They'll be eaten alive in the new e-commerce marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the business of Internet connections. The Regional Bell
Operating Companies could have owned this business and won
themselves a huge, devoted customer base if they had just done
three things end-users wanted done:
</P>
<P>
   Had they double-timed the launch of high-speed modems, offered
affordable T-1 Internet access and even more affordable ISDN
service, they could have owned the Internet access market forever.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they tried to gouge their customers, including their
best ones, by overpricing T-1 and ISDN service. To make matters
worse, they were unacceptably late in bringing high-speed modems to
market. As a result, end-users everywhere (and particularly best
customers) hate the Regional Bell Operating Companies.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake the RBOCs made was simple: They thought it was about
them (and their balance sheet) and not about the end-user. That is
not a mistake you will ever see AOL or Yahoo or IBM or Amazon.com
make. Their e-commerce models focus on one thing and one thing
only: How can we better serve our customers so they don't go
somewhere else? They understand that power has shifted to the
end-user.
</P>
<P>
   The second major consequence of the Internet power shift is that
companies can't raise prices unless they can save time or add value
for their customers. Companies that try to raise prices without
providing additional value (as the automobile manufacturers used to
do routinely) will find themselves stuck with acres of inventory.
Companies that provide that extra value (time-saving or personal
service) will be generously rewarded with repeat business and
positive word-of-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The third major consequence of this power shift is that
mid-sized companies will find it hard to survive. Small companies
that fulfill the needs of niche markets (like high-end money
management firms and specialty law firms) will continue to thrive.
Large companies that can afford the most advanced technologies (and
continuously upgrade them) will be able to meet the demands of a
vast customer base. But mid-sized firms will be caught in a
squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   In order to compete with big firms, they will need to make huge
technology investments that will eat into their profit margins. In
order to provide the kind of service niche market firms offer, they
will need to dedicate additional resources for that purpose. That
too will eat into their profit margins. The squeeze will be
relentless as the technology advances and as end-users (and
particularly so-called best customers) grow accustomed to better
and better service.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ decided to extend
trading hours because they feared losing customers to Internet
after-markets. End-users demanded change and the wealthiest and
most powerful financial institutions in the world acquiesced.
Anyone who doubts the power of Internet technology should consider
that it has now brought the very emblems of American capitalism to
heel.

THINGS THAT GO CREEP IN THE NIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By VICKI CROKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Spiders get a bad rap, according to Ed O'Brien, an assistant
curator at Zoo New England. ``People get creeped out by them,'' he
says. ``They often have a real aversion to them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder why? Just because most of them have eight eyes and eight
legs? Or because they liquify prey with digestive glands and then
slurp down the bug juice? Or because they so often spin
horror-movie-style webs?
</P>
<P>
   If we weren't so repelled, we'd be awestruck. There is a
phenomenal array of spider species all around us. ``While they can
be easily overlooked,'' O'Brien says, ``there are so many types.
Spiders are really diverse.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, you may feel there are times when you need a field
guide just to keep up with the creepy crawlies with whom you
begrudgingly cohabitate.
</P>
<P>
   The notion of a quickie field guide to the spiders around us
makes one of the sultans of spider biology chuckle. Herbert W.
Levi, now retired from Harvard's Museum of Comparative Zoology,
says, ``There are about 500 kinds of spiders in the area, many
without common names.'' There is still much to be learned in the
world of spiders. Their numbers, range, and behavior in many cases
are still mysterious. About 37,000 species of spiders have been
named, but that's probably only a fourth of those out there.
</P>
<P>
   Some things we know: For the most part it's females that build
webs. ``Males just hike around the world looking for females,''
says Dr. Greg Mertz of the New England Wildlife Center. And
certainly, not all spiders spin webs. Some go out hunting for
little bugs to eat. Also, Levi points out, ``A female does not
ordinarily feast on her mate, as many people believe, but males
usually die after mating.''
</P>
<P>
   In the quest to identify the spiders close at hand, we can at
least point out a few of the more recognizable characters.
</P>
<P>
   First on just about everyone's list are the little jumping
spiders. Yes, that's right, those extra petite spiders that hop are
called jumping spiders, and all arachniphiles love them. Mertz says
these little guys are ``among the most intelligent spiders.''
They've also been called the most entertaining and the cutest. (If
spiders had high school yearbooks, these guys would clean up on the
superlatives: ``best dressed spider,'' ``spider most likely to
succeed,'' etc.)
</P>
<P>
   Since they don't spin webs, they hunt prey. Not exactly simba on
the veldt, but they do stalk and ambush, using their jumping
abilities for the final, deadly pounce. Two of their eight eyes are
large and forward facing _ which inspired the writer of an article
in Audubon's Sanctuary magazine to assert that these spiders have a
``humanlike appearance.'' Hmm. Well, come to think of it, maybe I
can think of a few people . . . .
</P>
<P>
   With their terrific vision and charisma, jumping spiders seem to
invite interaction with people. ``You can box with them,'' Mertz
says. They will draw back and leap forward to spar with your pinky
if you're in the mood. O'Brien says you can wave a finger in front
of one and ``if you're lucky,'' the spider will hop on.
</P>
<P>
   Jumping spiders, as well as others, O'Brien says, often will
throw a line of silk out, like ``a bungee chord,'' as they leap.
</P>
<P>
   We all know cellar spiders too, being particularly familiar with
the daddy longlegs. These slender-legged spiders look other-worldly
and spin messy webs in and around our basements. Cellar spiders are
quite ``cosmopolitan,'' according to Levi's wonderful little
volume, ``Spiders and Their Kin,'' (Golden Books, $5.95). I don't
think he means that they summer on the Vineyard, collect Limoges,
or drink Pouilly-Fuisse with every meal. But they do live all over
the place, and often turn up in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The American house spider is aptly named. We see them around all
the time. They are members of the cobweb weaver group, a large
spider family. These spiders are pretty sedentary, hanging upside
down on the web, waiting for action. Levi tells us that cobweb
spiders ``have few or no teeth, and do not chew prey.'' Instead,
one bites its prey and ``sucks it dry.''
</P>
<P>
   Orb weavers: These common spiders with poor vision build
beautiful, complex-looking webs all over the world. The shamrock
spider is a familiar member of the family. Brown recluses and black
widows are the two biggies in the United States for venom. Neither
lives normally in New England, according to most sources. But they
are ``easily transported,'' Levi says. They may make it here in
suitcases or cargo shipments.
</P>
<P>
   That would explain the ``web of intrigue'' at Dudley Street
police station in Boston's Roxbury section in 1994. That's when a
brown recluse nested behind a file cabinet (complete with her
babies and eggs) and proceeded to bite two sergeants, who survived
the itching and swelling. While experts tell you these audacious
arachnids aren't found here, they often will tell you to keep
storage areas uncluttered and to shake out stored clothes before
wearing them.
</P>
<P>
   Several spiders deserve honorable mentions. Ed O'Brien likes
fishing spiders, which can walk on water, and nursery web spiders
that carry eggs with them (``a little bit of parental protection
that people might be surprised by,'' O'Brien says). Not to mention
how romantic the males are. When courting, he will often present
the female with a bug. Wolf spiders, low-slung and predatory, are
common. They have good vision and are sensitive to touch. Levi
alleges that they make ``nice'' pets.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Spider activity: Mertz reveals that striking a tuning fork
(middle c works well) near a web will bring out the host spider,
because it mimics the vibration of prey bugs hung up on the silk.
Mertz says you can also slip a piece of paper behind a web and
spray paint (in a contrasting color) as you lift the paper toward
you to capture the design. ``She'll have to spin a new web,'' Mertz
says. ``But that will give her something to do.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Authors may rival rock stars as the juiciest of movie subjects.
After all, the alcohol-soaked barbs of ``Dash and Lilly,'' A &AMP; E's
biopic of Dashiell Hammett and Lillian Hellman, aren't too far a
cry from the narcotic histrionics of ``Sid and Nancy.'' And all the
sexual posturing in Showtime's ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' would
not be entirely unfamiliar to a few freewheeling rock bands. Unlike
actors, who at least try to craft a harmless, beloved persona,
rockers and writers don't bother much with good behavior or false
modesty. They're not afraid of a little extremity.
</P>
<P>
   Living on the edge is what fuels this excellent pair of new
made-for-cable TV movies. Both take on passionate, brainy writers
who willfully ignored the pressures of conventional thinking. Ayn
Rand, in particular, was a pioneer, living out her daring theories
on individualism, sex, and self-interest _ theories that are still
debated by armchair philosophers and in academia. Hammett and
Hellman were originals of a more ordinary stripe, leaning to
leftist causes, drinking themselves into oblivion, clinging to
integrity in the face of the House Un-American Activities
Committee. ``The Passion of Ayn Rand'' airs on Showtime Sunday at 8
p.m., and ``Dash and Lilly'' airs on A &AMP; E Monday at 8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The more fascinating of the two movies is ``Ayn Rand.'' Director
Christopher Menaul steeps his exotic drama in a New York filled
with mirrors and windows, as all the characters do a dance around
Rand's massive ego. Helen Mirren is absolutely wonderful as Rand,
cutting the writer's shamelessly judgmental personality with a tad
of fragility. She uses Rand's Russian accent (Rand escaped in 1926)
as a sort of weapon, spitting out lines with sharply edged
self-confidence. ``I don't like surprises,'' she yells at the
guests of an unexpected publication party. Later she immodestly
announces, ``I will have an influence someday, but not, I think, in
my lifetime.'' But when she hears her young lover has been sleeping
with another woman, she is shattered behind her controlled veneer.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Ayn Rand'' turns on her open affair with that
young lover, psychologist Nathaniel Branden, and his wife, Barbara.
At first Rand treats Branden like a protege, but soon he is her
lover and her muse. ``Dis is not a threat to you,'' she assures _
or commands _ her husband, Frank O'Connor, and Barbara. But the
affair is a threat to all of them, as Nathaniel becomes
increasingly reckless in his arrogance. The melodramatic spin cycle
of this foursome inspires the weaker moments in the script,
particularly as it chronicles Barbara's victimization (the movie is
overly sympathetic to her, since it's based on the real Barbara
Branden's 1986 Rand biography). It doesn't help that she's played
by Julie Delpy, an expressive actress who makes a noble, but
distractingly unsuccessful, effort to purge her French accent. But
the movie gains plenty of intensity from Peter Fonda's ``Mr. Rand''
take on Frank, and from Eric Stoltz as the duplicitous Nathaniel.
</P>
<P>
   Mirren is a miracle of hard and soft edges, and she makes ``The
Passion of Ayn Rand'' entirely worthwhile, just as Judy Davis and
Sam Shepard lift ``Dash and Lilly'' well above its predictable
moves. Judy Davis: She's one of the best movie actresses right now,
a powerhouse who always acts with _ and not over _ the other actors
in a scene. To say she is ``in the moment'' is an understatement.
In ``Dash and Lilly'' her energy level is at a peak and her wit is
quick, but she drops the neurotic Annie Hall-with-a-PhD shtick that
she's used in Woody Allen movies. Her Hellman is bold, persistent,
insecure, and deeply in love. ``None of it means anything unless
you're there,'' she confesses to Hammett after he sneaks out of
``The Children's Hour'' opening for a night of carousing.
</P>
<P>
   The movie zooms in on the power balance between Hellman and
Hammett, which is ever-changing and seismic in its shifts. It's
never easy for two giant individuals to merge, especially when they
are in the same business and share a fondness for booze. Indeed,
``Dash and Lilly'' is explicit in portraying the role of the bottle
in the pair's relationship. At their first meeting at a movie
premiere in 1930, Hammett says to Hellman, ``I like the way you
drink,'' and for most of their courtship they are seen falling down
drunk together. Later in their 30-year affair, Hammett's dependency
becomes less of a romantic-comic potion and more gruesome, as his
health and talent deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dash and Lilly'' marks the film-directing debut of Kathy
Bates, and it's clear she is an actor's director. Not only does she
enable Davis to create a complex Hellman, but she helps Shepard
come up with one of his finest performances. He gives Hammett a
placid, pithy, remote exterior, but you can always see the fear
playing right beneath the surface. Shepard doesn't sentimentalize
the crime novelist, who could be violent and stubborn, but he
provides the movie with its lovely emotional climax, after the
couple moves to Martha's Vineyard. (They both deserve Emmy nods,
along with Mirren.) Bates also gives Bebe Neuwirth some choice
screen time, as a tart Dorothy Parker.

<P>
   The plotting of ``Dash and Lilly'' succumbs to biopic cliches,
particularly in the overfamiliar framing story about Hellman's
appearance before the House Un-American Activities Committee. But
the dialogue is always smart _ and miles above anything you might
have seen during the networks' May sweeps extravaganza. Indeed,
when TV despair visits upon us, and ``Noah's Ark'' just will not
do, it's important to remember that ambitious movies like ``The
Passion of Ayn Rand'' and ``Dash and Lilly'' are readily available
on cable TV.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 28 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PEARL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 52-47, a resolution to exonerate
two American military commanders who were charged with dereliction
of duty regarding the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Adm. Husband E.
Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short were in charge of the American
military forces in the Pacific at the time of the attack in 1941.
Supporters said the two men were unfairly singled out and that
recent reports show that broad blame for the attack is warranted.
Opponents said that exonerating the men would be rewriting history
and that numerous other investigations have failed to prove that
others may have been responsible. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: BASES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 40-60, an amendment to the
defense spending bill that called for another round of military
base closings by 2001. The amendment was supported by both
President Clinton and the Pentagon. Supporters said many bases have
outlived their usefulness and that keeping them open was a waste of
money that could be spent elsewhere in the military. Opponents said
the closures were not needed and that the amendment would lead to
bases being chosen for closure as the result of political games,
rather than merit. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
allowed abortions at military bases overseas, which are currently
prohibited even if they are privately funded. Voting 51-49, the
Senate tabled, or set aside, the measure. Supporters of the measure
said the ban on abortions on military bases overseas puts women
there at an unfair disadvantage compared with those living in the
states. Opponents said allowing abortions on military bases would
be unfair to the taxpayers who, in the end, would be paying for
them. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the amendment.

   HOUSE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: LOCKBOX
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 416-12, legislation that would
put all of the budget surplus generated by Social Security into a
``lockbox,'' which would mean the money could only be used for
Social Security reforms or emergency spending measures. A special
vote would be required in both the House and the Senate before the
money could be spent on anything other than Social Security or
Medicare. Supporters said the lockbox would ensure that the
government did not waste the money that belongs to the senior
citizens. Opponents said the measure was pointless and nothing more
than an attempt by Republicans to win points on the politically
sensitive issue of Social Security reform. A ``yes'' vote favors
the measure.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Surveying the crowd last Thursday night at Stylus, a
weekly party held at a Lower East Side sushi lounge called Never,
Hosi Simon nodded approvingly that few people were eating. ``If
people were eating and ignoring the music, that would be a bad
sign,'' said Simon, surrounded by hipsters in the latest Asian
dragon tank tops.
</P>
<P>
   They sipped sake, eyes fixed on the deejay spinning his
turntables from a perch in an aluminum-covered space. ``The night
definitely has potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 24, is the editor in chief of Flyer, a palm-size monthly
club listing guide that has become the equivalent of Zagat's for
the deejay set. Riding around the city on his mountain bike,
wearing khakis with oversize pockets for stuffing club invites,
Simon is an obsessional inspector, visiting as many as eight clubs
a night. Last Thursday, his first stop was at 10 p.m. at Never. By
10:20, he was out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an after-work party for people that don't really work,''
said Simon, who can assess a scene in 10 minutes. He started Flyer
a little more than a year ago with fellow German expatriates
Florian Peter and Anselm d'Astner.
</P>
<P>
   Flyer's staff distributes 50,000 copies by hand and backpack to
choice hangouts like Urban Outfitters and the Paramount Hotel.
``Pretty much every bar in the city that has a CD player tries to
pass themselves off as a deejay party now,'' Simon said. ``We get
the grandiose claims like `Oh, Amber Valletta hangs out here.'
Sometimes, you can tell if they're exaggerating on the phone, but
stopping by is the only way to be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon's criteria: ``a deejay who plays music that challenges,
and people who are having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding down Houston Street to check out a soiree called N'ice at
the 205 Club, Simon spotted a freshly painted bar called Frankie
Blue. Inside, he found a deejay with a shaved head trying to come
up with an alias for his Saturday debut. ``Deejay names can be so
silly,'' he said. ``What about calling myself Deejay Spaz or Deejay
Retard?''
</P>
<P>
   Simon gently broke the news that two guys on the West Coast had
those names already. Minutes later, at 205, an Icelandic deejay
manned the turntables as dry ice billowed over the crowded dance
floor. ``A little on the ratty side,'' Simon said, noting the worn
furniture and beer-stained cushions. ``But it has quality
underground music, and a crowd that's hip but not trendy.''
</P>
<P>
   Next was Vanity, a club on 23rd Street, for a weekly drum 'n'
bass party called Physics. It was empty except for a few kids
bobbing up and down by the speakers. Learning that the party had
moved on to Vinyl, Simon did, too.
</P>
<P>
   But first, a stop at Polly Esther's, a 1970s retro club chain in
Greenwich Village, for a party called College V.I.P. Under a strobe
light, inebriated frat boys hobbled about, trying to dance like the
rapper Snoop Dogg.
</P>
<P>
   An older tourist, a woman with a fanny pack, attempted some
lambada moves that looked like step aerobics. Simon was not put
off. ``This party is so mainstream that it is more underground than
some underground parties,'' he said. ``In this business, I've
learned that it's important to be open-minded.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after 2 a.m., he was outside Vinyl amid a crowd waiting to
get in and hear Deejay Zinc. A Lincoln Continental with New Jersey
plates pulled up, and a woman in a glittery bustier screamed out
the window, ``Do you know how to get to some club called Webster
Hall?''
</P>
<P>
   Simon stepped forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, actually I do.'' 4

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mountain thunderstorms will erupt from southern California
across southern Nevada to Arizona and New Mexico as the uneven
heating of mountains and valleys promotes rising currents of moist
air. Farther north, mountain storms will also erupt across
northeast Nevada, northern Utah and southern Idaho as a pocket of
fast jet-stream winds enhances the lift of moist air. A few of
these storms could approach severe levels.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, scattered showers and thunderstorms will develop
along a cool front draped from Wyoming to western South Dakota.
Behind the front, broken areas of cool rain will fall on portions
of Montana, with temperatures in the upper 40s while steadier rain
falls in the northern part of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of thunderstorms will again burgeon across Texas. Heavy
rain, hail or gusty winds will result from some of these storms. A
few thunderstorms could become severe, particularly in west Texas,
where humid breezes from the southeast are forced to rise up the
sloping terrain.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered clusters of heavy thunderstorms will roam the Deep
South as the remnants of an old front shift northward, enhancing
the lift of humid surface air. Areas such as the Tennessee Valley
could receive heavy rains in a relatively brief time. Isolated
heavy storms will also flare across Florida in concert with moist
air being lifted by the leading edges of Atlantic and Gulf sea
breezes.
</P>
<P>
   Warmth will build in the Northeast, except for parts of the
northern Middle Atlantic and southern New England coasts, where
cooling sea breezes develop.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Mountain Thunder
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a month ahead of schedule, a swarm of thunderstorms
erupted over mountain peaks from southern California to New Mexico
on Thursday. Typically in the Southwest, mountain thunder begins
around July 1 as waves of Pacific moisture are drawn inland over
the hotter, lower-barometric-pressure land. As the morning sun
warms mountain summits, moist air in contact with rocky peaks also
warms and becomes less dense. Like a hot-air balloon, air then
rises to form storms. On Thursday, moisture aloft left in the wake
of upper-level disturbances teamed with the sun to incite mountain
thunder.

LITTLETON FALLOUT FORCES GOP LEADERSHIP TO EMBRACE GUN-CONTROL
MEASURES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, May 30) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After years of trying to block measures aimed at
stiffening gun control laws, the Republican House leadership
abruptly reversed course last week to embrace the concept of
mandatory background checks regardless of where handguns are sold.
</P>
<P>
   The decision was prompted by public pressure in the wake of the
Littleton, Colo., school shooting last month and ``the political
reality,'' as one Republican put it, ``that the votes are there in
the House to require background checks at gun shows and pawn
shops.''
</P>
<P>
   There also was a desire on the part of House Speaker Dennis
Hastert, R-Ill., to avoid ``taking a political beating'' on the
issue that Republicans certainly would have received from the
Democrats and the public had they continued to oppose efforts to
attach modest gun-control measures to appropriations bills and
other legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Although a firm date for considering gun-control legislation in
the House has not been set, Republican leaders announced that they
intend to allow amendments in mid-June to the juvenile justice
bill, which was used by the Senate to pass several measures
designed to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and young
people.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate passed its version of the juvenile justice bill last
week, but only after GOP leaders were forced to make a series of
embarrassing concessions to the Democrats on background checks and
other gun-control issues. The Democrats were able to use the
Columbine High School shooting and bombing incident, in which 15
people were killed and 21 wounded, as a catalyst for action on
gun-control measures that otherwise would not have been considered
this year.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats hope to at least match the Senate initiatives,
which would expand the current background check laws to include
handguns purchased at gun shows and pawn shops. The bill also
contains measures requiring that trigger locks or other child
safety devices be sold with all new handguns, and that the
importation of large capacity ammunition clips be banned.
</P>
<P>
   While embracing the general concepts of the Senate bill, House
Republicans have warned that what they end up supporting could be
different.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many Republicans and some Democrats don't like the
Senate measure requiring up to a 72-hour waiting period on gun
purchases as opposed to an instant background check. An expected
move to raise the age for gun ownership to 21, which is supported
by Hastert, also troubles some Republicans and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``What comes out of the House bill could be less, it could be
more,'' said one Republican leadership aide. ``The whole game for
Republicans here is just to avoid the mistakes and the
embarrassment the Senate made.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be (background) checks at gun shows and pawn shops
because most members support some kind of background check. And
there will be gun locks in the (House) bill because that's not a
huge issue since most makers are already including them with their
guns. The question is how far will we go in accepting the Senate
language?'' the aide said.
</P>
<P>
   By giving ground on gun control, Republicans are hoping to win
support from Democrats on a few other issues they consider more
important in the fight to curb youth violence. Those issues include
stricter enforcement of current gun laws and tougher jail and
prison sentences for youthful offenders.
</P>
<P>
   Michelle Davis, press secretary to House Majority Leader Dick
Armey, R-Texas, also said Republicans want to focus more attention
on ``cultural issues,'' such as violence depicted in movies and
television, which they believe are contributing factors to
tragedies like the Colorado incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``The country as a whole knows that the answer to Littleton
involves much more than gun control ... and we want to make sure
that these other problems are addressed,'' said Davis, who accused
the Democrats of ``shamelessly'' using Littleton as a ``political
tool'' to help pass tougher gun-control measures.
</P>
<P>
   By trying to head off an extended fight in the House over
gun-control issues, she said, House leaders are hoping to avoid the
disaster that occurred during the Senate debate. In that debate,
the Democrats succeeded to some extent in portraying Republicans as
supportive of loopholes in the current laws that actually make it
easier for criminals and kids to get guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``After what happened in the Senate, we figured ... we want
things to be a little more orderly,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by the House Republican leadership to endorse a set
of gun-control measures before a vote came in a meeting last week
in which Hastert, Armey and Majority Whip Tom DeLay of Texas agreed
that there would likely be enough votes among Republicans and
Democrats in the wake of Littleton to pass moderate legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than risk a split within their ranks over the issue, and
to head off a Democratic effort to portray them as weak on
gun-control issues, Hastert decided to announce that amendments
would be allowed to the juvenile justice bill when the House takes
it up in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the floor, Hastert acknowledged that recent
incidents of school violence had understandably shaken the nation
and that parents were right to demand that their representatives do
more to protect their children.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support common-sense legislation that keeps guns out of the
hands of unsupervised children,'' the speaker said. But he added
that passing gun-control measures ``is only part of the solution''
as he called for support of measures to ``reinforce positive
values'' in the nation's culture that will help ``create a safer
and more secure society.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Hastert's floor speech caught Democratic lawmakers by surprise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they were clearly under a lot of pressure from the
public because of what happened in Littleton,'' said Rep. Ken
Bentsen of Texas, one of several Democrats who has been pressing
the Republican leadership to allow votes on gun-control amendments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Republican leadership doesn't want it to appear that
they're being pushed into this, knowing they'll have to accept
it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The writing was on the wall,'' agreed one Republican aide.
``It was either give 'em what they want or go through weeks of hell
while the Democrats tried to use gun control as a political issue
against us.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Hastert's decision, there were signs late last week that
some GOP members might revolt if pressed to accept the Senate
initiatives as written.
</P>
<P>
   Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., for example,
expressed support himself for ``common sense'' gun-control
measures, but warned that some measure in the Senate-passed bill
could conflict with the constitutional right to bear arms.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts by some Democrats to broaden the scope of the Senate
initiatives could cause problems for some of their own colleagues
who generally favor tougher gun-control measures, but only up to a
point.
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen, for one, said he would find it difficult to limit gun
purchases to once a month as some Democrats are proposing. He said
he would also be reluctant to go along with a proposal by Hastert
and others in both parties to raise the age limit on gun purchases
from 18 to 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to be cautious in raising age restrictions too high,''
he said ``It's a question of responsible gun ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats were trying to force a vote on the Senate-passed
bill before mid-June even as the House was adjourning last week for
its Memorial Day recess. At a news conference with Vice President
Al Gore, several Democrats demanded that the House consider gun
control ``an emergency measure,'' as Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee of
Texas put it, ``to deal with the crisis situation in the nation's
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans refused, insisting that more time is needed to
study the Senate initiatives and to give House members a chance to
draw up their own measures.
</P>
<P>
   Their refusal to hold a quick vote drew charges from Gore that
House Republicans are trying to delay consideration of gun-control
measures just to give the National Rifle Association more time to
build opposition to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NRA,'' he said, `` is hoping against hope that if they
slow walk this measure the public will lose interest.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gore said the Senate vote on the issue was ``a reflection of
the newly strengthened will of the American people'' to make sure
that Congress passes tougher gun-control laws.

   WASHINGTON WATCH VOTE CHART Questions regarding this
transmission should be directed to 202-628-3100, ext. 224.
WASHINGTON, May 28 -- The following chart shows how senators and
representatives voted on key bills and amendments within the last
week. A ``Y'' means the member voted for the measure; an ``N''
means the member voted against the measure; a ``?'' means the
member did not vote; and a ``P'' means the member voted
``present.''
</P>
<P>
   SENATE VOTES:
</P>
<P>
   1) BILL NUMBER: PEARL
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Tuesday approved, 52-47, a resolution to exonerate
two American military commanders who were charged with dereliction
of duty regarding the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Adm. Husband E.
Kimmel and Gen. Walter Short were in charge of the American
military forces in the Pacific at the time of the attack in 1941.
Supporters said the two men were unfairly singled out and that
recent reports show that broad blame for the attack is warranted.
Opponents said that exonerating the men would be rewriting history
and that numerous other investigations have failed to prove that
others may have been responsible. A ``yes'' vote favors the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   2) BILL NUMBER: BASES
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday rejected, 40-60, an amendment to the
defense spending bill that called for another round of military
base closings by 2001. The amendment was supported by both
President Clinton and the Pentagon. Supporters said many bases have
outlived their usefulness and that keeping them open was a waste of
money that could be spent elsewhere in the military. Opponents said
the closures were not needed and that the amendment would lead to
bases being chosen for closure as the result of political games,
rather than merit. A ``yes'' vote favors the amendment.
</P>
<P>
   3) BILL NUMBER: ABORTION
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Wednesday failed to pass a measure that would have
allowed abortions at military bases overseas, which are currently
prohibited even if they are privately funded. Voting 51-49, the
Senate tabled, or set aside, the measure. Supporters of the measure
said the ban on abortions on military bases overseas puts women
there at an unfair disadvantage compared with those living in the
states. Opponents said allowing abortions on military bases would
be unfair to the taxpayers who, in the end, would be paying for
them. A ``yes'' vote favors setting aside the amendment.

   1) BILL NUMBER: LOCKBOX
</P>
<P>
   The House on Wednesday approved, 416-12, legislation that would
put all of the budget surplus generated by Social Security into a
``lockbox,'' which would mean the money could only be used for
Social Security reforms or emergency spending measures. A special
vote would be required in both the House and the Senate before the
money could be spent on anything other than Social Security or
Medicare. Supporters said the lockbox would ensure that the
government did not waste the money that belongs to the senior
citizens. Opponents said the measure was pointless and nothing more
than an attempt by Republicans to win points on the politically
sensitive issue of Social Security reform. A ``yes'' vote favors
the measure.

YOU BUY IT, YOU KEEP IT, MORE STORES ARE SAYING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MONIQUE P. YAZIGI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Virginia Sullivan was walking up Park Avenue not long
ago, her arms overflowing with purchases, looking every bit the
battle-hardened New York shopper. But there's one thing that Ms.
Sullivan, a professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology, no
longer has the strength to endure: returning unsatisfactory
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime I've tried to return something, people in the store
make me feel embarrassed, dishonest, like I'm a criminal,'' Ms.
Sullivan said. She has a closet full of unwanted pants and dresses
with the tags still attached to prove it.
</P>
<P>
   As the shopping urge strikes many New Yorkers during the
Memorial Day sales, they may want to keep Ms. Sullivan's experience
in mind: 'tis easier to buy than return.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers and retail analysts say that at many boutiques in New
York, as well as at local branches of some regional and national
chains, return policies have gotten leaner and meaner in recent
years. The complaints mention chilly sales clerks who seem
instructed to intimidate customers out of making returns, return
periods of merely a week and return policies that give only credit
toward new purchases rather than a refund.
</P>
<P>
   Heaven forbid that a customer change her mind about a Prada bag
more than 10 days after she bought it and the bag is no longer
stocked _ it's hers to keep. At Daffy's, the off-price chain, if an
item is taken back without the price ticket attached, consumers
should expect to take it back home with them.
</P>
<P>
   Even some famously tolerant retailers like L.L. Bean, once known
for taking back 30-year-old Hudson Bay blankets with no questions
asked, have become more restrictive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The policies started tightening up two years ago,'' said Rich
Donaldson, a spokesman for Bean, whose customers are now asked to
explain why they are dissatisfied. The company's policy is meant to
discourage the kind of shopper who showed up at the flagship store
in Freeport, Maine., last year and, as a kind of tongue-in-cheek
test, tried to trade in a pair of worn-out bluchers. The sales
associate looked dismayed. ``Dear, why don't you just throw these
away?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that as the retail industry has become increasingly
competitive, with profits squeezed by the growth in the number of
stores and competition from the Internet, many merchants have had
to tighten return policies to protect their bottom lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers are finding it difficult to be profitable because of
the increasingly competitive nature of the business, and as a
result have clamped down on everything, including return
policies,'' said Walter F. Loeb, publisher of the Loeb Retail
Letter, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   There seem to have been no surveys of customer attitudes toward
return policies, but interviews with shoppers on Madison, Park and
Fifth Avenues, the city's fanciest retailing strips, turned up many
tales of woe.
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers may be particularly affected, because small
boutiques tend to be the most restrictive stores of all, and in
recent years they have become more prominent in the city, from
NoLIta to Madison Avenue, while department stores, which have the
most liberal policies, have been retreating.
</P>
<P>
   One woman recalled a trip to the Robert Clergerie shop on
Madison Avenue near 61st Street, where she tried to return a shoe
with a broken heel. The salesman dismissed her with a curt,
``Sorry, we have no responsibility,'' said the woman, who declined
to give her name.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the incident, Kim Gracianette, the store's
manager, said that Robert Clergerie's return policy had not changed
in recent years, and that the New York branches of the French chain
were more lenient than their foreign counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``In France they say, `We're not Maytag,''' she said. ``They
say, `You buy it, it's yours.''' The store currently gives
customers credit on their credit cards for goods returned with a
receipt in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Blake, a Manhattan resident, recently tried to return a
baby outfit she received as a gift shortly after giving birth. But
when she went to La Petite Etoile, on Madison near 65th Street,
about three weeks after the outfit was bought, the chic shop
rebuffed her. It accepts returns for only seven days.
</P>
<P>
   ``How was I suppose to run out after seven days?'' Ms. Blake
asked, standing outside the store, still holding the gift box. ``I
just had a baby.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillippe Edelman, La Petite Etoile's owner, stands by his
seven-day window for returns. ``The policy is correct,'' he said,
``The season is very short. We're not strict. We're like most of
the retail stores.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, in many clothing boutiques, even those for infants,
new styles are introduced more rapidly, so shop owners keep smaller
stocks. They limit the time for returns to avoid being stuck with
unsalable goods.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Stores bring in clothes and want to move them out to make room
for more merchandise,'' said Jennifer Maxwell Parkinson, an image
consultant with a personal shopping service in Manhattan and
Westchester County. ``So their return policies have become
stricter. The smallest boutiques are the strictest.''
</P>
<P>
   Several clerks at Madison Avenue boutiques, saying they had to
speak anonymously if they expected to keep their jobs, said they
were told to try as hard as possible to dissuade customers who
enter with merchandise to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tell us to discourage returning, but if the customer
really causes a fuss, we are told not to let them go out the door
without talking them into buying something else,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Gap, known for its generous rules, is clamping down in
some ways. The chain recently reduced its period for price
adjustment _ the time during which a customer who buys an item at
full retail price may claim a rebate if the item later goes on
sale. Now, the customer must return the item, with its receipt,
within 14 days, instead of the previous 30, and may do so only
once, rather than two or three times, as some once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Retailers had an open-door policy on returns,'' said Bruce Van
Kleeck, a vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade
group. ``Unfortunately, a number of consumers began to take
advantage, returning items that would not normally be returned.
Returns are an expensive item.''
</P>
<P>
   Many retailers say their stricter policies are necessary to
protect them from less-than-honest customers. Marcia Wilson, the
president of Daffy's, which has 13 stores in the East, said that in
the last year she had decided to accept returns only when they are
presented within 14 days of purchase, with both a cash-register
receipt and a sales ticket still attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have ticket guns at home,'' Ms. Wilson said. ``They
wear the garments, take off the ticket and shoot the tickets when
they're done wearing it. Nervy, huh? They bring back clothes
pilled, stained and stinky.''
</P>
<P>
   Upscale shoppers are no better. In the world of parties on the
Upper East Side, it is an old trick to hide the price tag, wear
sweat pads underneath the arms and spend the evening treading
carefully around red wine. ``Evening wear tends to be rental
items,'' said Teri Hardin, a vice president and director of
merchandise for Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As a deterrent, Ms. Hardin said, the store has started hanging
price tickets on the front of dresses, at the breast. ``But you
never know,'' she said. ``They may call it a fashion accessory!''
</P>
<P>
   Clothing stores aren't the only ones tightening up. Jennifer
Roberts, a director at the International Mass Retail Association,
said stores ``have really tightened up on the electronics
returns.'' She cited abuse as the reason. ``People would buy
computers, use them for tests for school and then return them,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But by some customers' accounts, such policies can fail to
distinguish the wheat from the chaff. Herberth Morales, a Manhattan
doorman, said he tried to return a VCR to P.C. Richard &AMP; Son in
Woodhaven, Queens, because it stopped working after five days. He
said he had the original packaging, but the store at first refused.
After he demanded to speak to a manager, Morales said, ``they
agreed to send it out to be repaired.'' Two months later, the VCR
was fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gancio, a vice president of the P.C. Richard chain, said
the company's policy was to accept VCRs within 20 days as long as
they are ``like new'' and customers have receipts and the original
packing.
</P>
<P>
   A few retailers, like Lands' End, are seizing on customers'
frustrations over the tighter return policies to play up the fact
that they take back anything, even if it is worn or dirty. ``As so
many people are tightening, we're making a point of letting
everyone know that our policies haven't changed,'' said Anna
Schryver, a spokeswoman for Lands' End. The company's policy, as
its catalogs put it, is ``Guaranteed period.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Schryver even boasted that Land's End is being sued by a
German trade group, the Association Against Unfair Competition,
because of its liberal return policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Germans feel it's unfair that we take back anything
anytime,'' she said, ``whether it's washed, worn or old.''

THE PLEASURES OF A BOUTIQUE HOTEL, EVEN IF THE HELP IS PRETTIER
THEN YOU  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By FRANK DeCARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One recent midnight, I found myself walking up to a White Castle
drive-up window on the fringes of downtown Nashville. After a
five-and-a-half-hour delay on a flight with no meal service, I was
forced to beg a teen-ager to disregard the ``No Walk-Ups'' sign and
sell me two double cheeseburgers, a small order of fries and a Diet
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   My hotel, a historic train station converted into a hotel in
1986, didn't have 24-hour room service, so dinner ended up costing
me $4.85 _ plus my last shred of dignity.
</P>
<P>
   This humbling experience _ strangely reminiscent of a
``Designing Women'' episode in which Dixie Carter is arrested for
being a pedestrian in a drive-through lane _ reminded me how
spoiled I've become. In recent years, I have gotten used to staying
at so-called boutique hotels _ lodgings that are long on style,
even when they're notoriously short on space; hotels like the
Mondrian in Los Angeles and the Delano in Miami Beach.
</P>
<P>
   These small hotels pamper guests with CD players and VCRs in the
rooms, designer bath products, food on demand day or night, and
mini-bars stocked with enough haute snacks to avoid nights like my
fast-food fiasco in Music City. Such modern amenities as Smart Food
popcorn and safe-sex kits cost hoteliers little, but they seem to
be winning over guests.
</P>
<P>
   The boutique hotel is the trend of the moment in the lodging
industry, so popular that even giant chains like Hilton and
Sheraton are hurrying to get into the game, which began when Ian
Schrager opened Morgans in Manhattan in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   I have a love-hate relationship with these places, which
invariably are staffed by men and women who are better looking than
you and 98 percent of the people you know. That's their job. They
couldn't care less if they ever see you again.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, guests do come back to soak up the ambiance,
rub elbows with the right crowd and then brag to friends that
they've done so. Hotels like these are inherently pretentious _
designed to be gorgeous but distant, much like the employees.
</P>
<P>
   Our parents' generation _ which stayed at the Delano when people
knew it was named for Franklin Roosevelt and pronounced it DEL-ano,
not de-LAN-oh _ would look at these tiny ``done'' rooms and say,
``You spent $250 a night for an all-white walk-in closet with a
boom box?''
</P>
<P>
   But they would miss the point.
</P>
<P>
   Travelers today know that it is not necessarily the size of the
room, but the attention to detail that makes the modern hotel
experience, even if it's not a boutique hotel. A single,
spectacular corn muffin, for instance, colored my entire stay a few
years ago at the Four Seasons in Milan.
</P>
<P>
   But my visit to the Bellagio in Las Vegas in October was nearly
sunk when I had to trot down to the Origins store in the lobby
before I could have a good soak in my room's tub. What kind of
hotel provides a bathtub but no bath gel?
</P>
<P>
   Not a boutique hotel, that's for sure.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, new boutique hotels have been rolling off the
assembly line faster than new models of sport-utility vehicles. The
Hotel _ formerly known as the Tiffany _ is an instant Miami Beach
destination, thanks to an interior design by Todd Oldham, the
fashion designer. Its restaurant, Wish, in which Oldham is a
partner, is the place to be seen in a town that thrives on such
trendiness.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in West Hollywood, the Standard is the place to stay
if you're in your 20s and cute. This ``boutique motel,'' owned by
Andre Balazs of Mercer and Chateau Marmont fame, looks like a page
out of Wallpaper magazine, with a groovy 70s lobby with shag
carpeting on the walls, vintage doughnut-shaped house phones and
egg chairs.
</P>
<P>
   The rooms, ranging from $95 to $200, have Andy Warhol-print
curtains and inflatable chairs, while around the pool, there are
electric blue Astroturf and white lounge chairs.
</P>
<P>
   I remember my first boutique hotel experience some years back at
the Paramount Hotel on 46th Street. Before it opened, I had seen a
picture of a suite with a Dutch Masters painting for a headboard.
When I checked in, however, my room had only a blank canvas above
the bed. I said to the bellboy, ``What is this _ `Day Without
Art?'''
</P>
<P>
   He explained that the painted headboards came with more
expensive rooms. But even in my more basic room, the charms of this
hotel soon revealed themselves. The pillow bolsters were
comfortable and the lighting glamorously dim, and there was a
perfect peanut butter and jelly sandwich on the room service menu.
</P>
<P>
   Such glamour has its price. Every time I stay at the Mondrian,
for instance, I leave with a sore foot. The hotel's mattresses are
very comfortable. But in these Philippe Starck rooms, the bed is
constructed so that you can't help but kick the frame if you dash
for the phone.
</P>
<P>
   Still, who cares? When you're sleeping at one of these places,
you're sleeping with the right people, even if you sleep alone.
They are velvet rope establishments _ no surprise, considering that
the pioneer, Schrager, ran Studio 54 in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Many travelers, myself included, will take snarky doormen and
designer furniture over free Sanka and a borrowed hot pot. An
all-white castle like the Delano beats a White Castle drive-through
any day.

WHAT MURDER SAYS ABOUT THE SOCIETY IT EXISTS IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (Ideas) 
(lb) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the heart of the analysis of the killings last month at
Columbine High School in Colorado has been a deceptively simple
question: Were the killers chillingly aberrant monsters or were
they a part, however perverse, of something in our culture as a
whole?
</P>
<P>
   But long before Columbine, this question and others were being
asked by professors as homicide became an increasingly conspicuous
slice of American scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   Recent books have surveyed murder in the United States and the
world, explored the meaning of murder narratives and unearthed vast
detail and sociological significance in celebrated 19th-century
cases. There is a 3-year-old journal, ``Homicide Studies: An
Interdisciplinary Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   These and other projects suggest that just as ``true crime'' has
become a permanent fixture in publishing, murder may be
establishing itself as a valid course of study in academia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Homicide has always been the backbone of history _
`legitimate' homicide, which is war,'' said Roger Lane, a Haverford
College historian and author of ``Murder in America'' (Ohio State
University Press, 1998). ``It has only been in the past generation
that social historians have discovered how much homicide has to
tell us about the society in which it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, historians have been drawn to celebrated murder
cases, and criminologists and sociologists have long studied the
incidence of homicide and how to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
   But only recently have scholars begun to focus so intensely on
murder as a window on society and a revealing subject for social
historians or intellectual historians. Lane's book, for example,
tracks the incidence of murder and the culture's response to it
from medieval England to modern times, using murder _ and which
murders are deemed to matter _ as a way to take the social
temperature on issues of race, class and attitudes toward children
and the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Cline Cohen of the University of California at Santa
Barbara and Amy Gilman Srebnick of Montclair State University each
examined different 19th-century cases of murdered women in New York
to analyze attitudes about women, sexuality and class.
</P>
<P>
   ``Murder Most Foul: The Killer and the American Gothic
Imagination'' (Harvard University Press, 1998) by Karen Halttunen
of the University of California at Davis tracks the way the culture
has imagined and portrayed murder.
</P>
<P>
   She argues that the depictions of murder reveal a shift from
values based in the Puritan religion to secular ones. In the first
case, murderers are seen as sinners in a community of sinners,
whose fall is a warning to everyone. In the second, the killer is
seen as an alien monster whose crimes reflect his separation from
the rest of society. She calls this the Gothic homicide narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Dwayne Smith, a sociologist at the University of North Carolina
at Charlotte and editor of the Journal of Homicide Studies, said
that it is natural for scholars to be drawn to murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a joke that if a total alien came and did a content
analysis of American literature and pop culture, he'd conclude that
we kill one another and we fall in love,'' he said. ``The culture
has such a tremendous fascination with homicide, you would expect
to find academic interest as well.''
</P>
<P>
   But until recently homicide was largely left to the
criminologists and sociologists, whose research tends toward the
pieces in Homicide Studies on topics like ``Suicide Following
Homicide in Canada'' or ``Murder as Self-Help: Women and Intimate
Partner Homicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Cohen, a historian at Florida International University
who wrote a survey of crime literature, cited two developments that
made homicide more appealing to historians and other scholars.
</P>
<P>
   The first, he said, was the development of the New Social
History in the 1970s, which argued for depictions of the poor,
minorities, women, religious and ethnic minorities and others who
had been often overlooked in histories geared toward the rich and
powerful. The second was a renewed respect for narrative rather
than quantitative or technical analysis in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``The Murder of Helen Jewett'' (Knopf, 1998) by Ms. Cohen
and ``The Mysterious Death of Mary Rogers'' (Oxford University
Press, 1997) by Ms. Srebnick take murders of women, the first a
prostitute in 1836, the second a 20-year-old descendant of
prominent New England settlers in 1841, and combine compelling
storytelling with bottom-up social analysis. (Edgar Allan Poe based
``The Mystery of Marie Roget'' on the Rogers case.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cohen said newspaper accounts and trial transcripts _
usually kept unofficially by reporters rather than by the courts _
provide much material about the lives of ordinary and marginalized
groups that would otherwise be extraordinarily hard to find.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the best ways to hear from people who don't
normally publish books or get their words written down,'' she said.
``There were 20 different court reporters putting out transcripts
in the Helen Jewett trial. Normally you would not hear about the
life of a prostitute except through the eyes of moral reformers.''
</P>
<P>
   For some scholars homicide is most interesting not as a
reflection of cultural forces but as a subject in itself,
particularly given the consistently high murder rates in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Monkkonen, a historian at the University of California at
Los Angeles, has spent nearly 12 years studying 200 years' worth of
homicide in New York City. Monkkonen is part of a loosely knit
group of about 250 researchers from various disciplines called the
Homicide Research Working Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't usually get much of a long view of homicide,'' he
said. ``We're always thinking of the past 10 years and very seldom
looking at the past 200. If someone were to say to me, `Why 200
years _ it's not enough _ it should be 300?'' I'd say, `I agree _ I
just couldn't do it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Monkkonen said his research more than anything convinces him
that the shifts in homicide rates reflect a web of social, economic
and technological factors, ranging from changes in policing and
weapons to shifts in employment that may take a generation to take
hold, rather than any single government policy. That leads him to
be wary of attributing credit for the current plunge in homicide or
expecting lower crime levels to be permanent.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Some aspects of homicide seem eternal, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Cases that get the most attention, like those of O.J. Simpson
and JonBenet Ramsey now or those of Mary Rogers and Helen Jewett,
often include salacious elements of passion and mystery that also
cross into the tense territory of race or sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   And despite widespread worries about the toxic effects of
tabloid media, murder has always sold. The sensational murders of
the 19th century were perhaps the greatest sales tools for the
fledgling newspapers of the time reaching out for a mass audience.
And before there was Geraldo Rivera pumping up ratings with daily
coverage of the Simpson case, there was Cotton Mather, the famous
preacher of Colonial America.
</P>
<P>
   ``As early as the 1680s you had ministers who realized that
murder cases provided them with a much larger audience than they
normally had,'' Cohen said. ``Usually sermons were reprinted with
maybe 200 or 300 copies. Cotton Mather used to brag how he could
print 1,200 or 1,500 copies of execution sermons, and they would
sell out.''
</P>
<P>
   One element that seems new to many scholars, however, is the
current wave of school shootings, which because of the age of the
killers and the way they strike at schools and schoolchildren, defy
most of the common conventions of American homicide.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Halttunen's book argues that some recent murder accounts,
like the book and film ``Dead Man Walking,'' veer back toward the
earlier Puritan sense of the killer who reflected society's sins
rather than an alien ogre. Yet she admits that the recent school
killings have elements of both.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very torn in the way we view them,'' she said.
``Something about these school shootings may be pushing us through
a wall. It's almost as if we are searching for a new language with
which to discuss them.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen says that this has always been the case. In his 1993 book,
``Pillars of Salt, Monuments of Grace: New England Crime Literature
and the Origins of American Popular Culture,'' he argues that
accounts of and reactions to homicide show that killers have
traditionally been seen as insiders and outsiders simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the increase in scholarship began when murder rates were
soaring. Now they are plummeting. But Lane said homicide was
unlikely to disappear, either as a crime or as a subject of
scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave a talk to the Mystery Writers of America in January,
and I told them not to worry _ murder isn't going away,'' he said.
``The factors that appear to be driving down homicide, I think, are
short-term with clear downside boundaries, and homicide is going to
rebound. Sex and violence have always sold. The interest in murder
doesn't flag. We academics are finally catching up with it.''

<P>
   HORSESHOE BEACH, Fla. _ Former mullet fisherman Teddy Kight
isn't getting much sleep these days. When his 22-month-old baby
isn't waking him up in the middle of the night, a mess of
soft-shell crabs are.
</P>
<P>
   Soft-shell crabs are just blue crabs that have shed their
shells, but they're worth many times more. Problem is, it takes
only a few hours before the new shells are too hard to eat, and the
crabs like to shed at night.
</P>
<P>
   So Kight, his wife and his three brothers have to check on his
crab tanks around the clock. Kight makes his rounds at midnight and
3 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bad part about it: The baby doesn't correspond to this,''
he said with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Kight, 44, would rather be catching mullet. But the mullet
industry sank in 1994 when Florida banned the use of nets in
commercial fishing. Kight and scores of other fishermen have turned
to soft-shell crabbing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. Soft-shell production is up 20 percent from
1996, according to the University of Florida Sea Grant Program. The
most recent statistics show that people new to soft-shell crabbing
harvested 21,000 dozen crabs worth more than $500,000 during the
first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   And, fisheries experts say the fledgling industry has room to
grow. Blue crab populations are healthy and closely monitored, they
say. More soft-shell crabbers won't hurt it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Florida can supply restaurants and seafood markets
for several months every year before blue crabs begin shedding up
north. The spring season in Florida runs from February to June.
There's also a fall season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida's crabbers take the summer off when the rest of the
states get into their soft-shell production,'' said Paul Zajicek, a
seafood specialist with the Department of Agriculture and Consumer
Services. ``Florida farmers do the same thing _ hit the market
early. That's when they get the best prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, soft-shell crabbing in Florida had never taken
off. Commercial fishermen were too busy catching redfish and mullet
to set crab traps.
</P>
<P>
   But when Florida voters passed the net ban amendment in 1994,
putting 6,500 net fishermen out of work, some began to take another
look.
</P>
<P>
   Kight and his brothers burned their nets after the net ban and
reluctantly got construction jobs. Crabbing brought them back to
the water. Between that and clamming, they're able to make as much
as they did fishing, Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're raised up on the water, it's hard to leave,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea Grant program helped. It conducted 40 workshops around
the state, provided technical advice to fishermen and distributed
more than 100 starter kits for crab tanks worth $500 a piece.
</P>
<P>
   ``That kind of popped our eyes open,'' said Debbie Bryan at
Bryan Crab Farm. She and her husband, Vernon, have harvested blue
crabs and stone crabs for years, but never tried soft-shelling. ``I
don't know why we didn't do it before.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Jackson, who is coordinating the Sea Grant project, said 65
fishermen have put the starter kits to use. In Horseshoe Beach, a
Gulf Coast town of 300 people 70 miles west of Gainesville, there
are as many as 35 crabbers now _ up from seven or eight before the
net ban, Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson said soft-shell crabbing is more likely to be a
part-time job than clamming, another sector of the seafood industry
that blossomed after the net ban.
</P>
<P>
   Hard crabs are worth 15 cents before shedding, $2 after, Kight
said. Consumers are willing to pay much more for crabs that can be
fried whole for sandwiches or plopped into gumbos without messy
peeling.
</P>
<P>
   Kight said he has invested $25,000 in equipment for his crabbing
operation. His whole family is involved.
</P>
<P>
   His brothers check on hundreds of traps every morning to find
``peelers.'' Since blue crabs can't mate until they shed, a male
crab is placed in each trap to attract females, which then attract
more males, Kight said.
</P>
<P>
   Crabbers can tell which crabs are ready to shed by a line of
color on their flippers. The redder the line, the closer the crabs
are to shedding.
</P>
<P>
   Kight keeps the peelers in a briny-smelling building that once
housed the town's general store. Dozens of crab traps are stacked
outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, plastic pipes carry water from wooden beams overhead to
a dozen shallow, wooden tanks. Scores of crabs scuttle around in
each as water pours down.
</P>
<P>
   Every few minutes, another crab cracks its old shell and backs
out of it, like a snake sloughing off its skin.
</P>
<P>
   Kight weighs each shed crab, sorts them by size and stacks them,
still alive, in hay-lined cardboard boxes. He sells them to a
nearby dealer who ships them to Miami, New York, Philadelphia and
other crab-hungry cities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Kight said this year's spring harvest is down from last year's,
although prices are still high. His brothers are bringing in about
250 crabs a day compared to 1,000 a day last year.
</P>
<P>
   The spring drought might be responsible, or the natural ebb and
flow of crab populations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, he said after a pause, ``There's more boats on the
water, too.''

 &HT;    Summer is good time to deppen spirituality
 &HT;    By John Blake
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poets say summer is the season for love.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists claim it's a time for travel.
</P>
<P>
   But many others think the summer is the perfect time to deepen
your spirituality.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of years, people have used travel for renewal.
Ancient Greeks traveled to the oracle of Apollo at Delphi for
counsel. Eastern mystics sought solitude atop mountains.
Christians, Muslims and Jews have been making pilgrimages to holy
sites in the Middle East for many centuries. Such ``sacred travel''
continues to be a part of spiritual life and is the theme of a new
book, ``Sacred Roads'' (HarperSanFrancisco, $22, 268 pages), by
Nicholas Shrady that details his travels to the world's holiest
sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a tourist returns from a holiday, they've added a couple
of pounds around their waist and they're rested, but there's
nothing that's changed their perspective,'' Shrady said during a
recent telephone interview from his home in Barcelona, Spain.
``When the pilgrim returns from a journey, the pilgrim is never the
same person.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacred travel is one road people are taking these days. But
there are many other spiritual paths, and the summer is a good time
to begin such a trip.
</P>
<P>

 By ELIZABETH HAYT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Over lunch at a sidewalk table on Madison Avenue,
Josh Patner and Bryan Bradley took one look at a young woman
hurrying by in a navy blue pinstripe suit and shook their heads
sadly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women have been so oppressed,'' Patner said. ``They can be
successful and come from very enlightened backgrounds, yet they
still feel compelled to blend in. New York will not allow a woman
to look'' _ he pursed his lips and shimmied his shoulders _
`` &UR; ooh-la-la &LR; .''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley then said, ``New York will not let her expose her
fantasy of being Tuleh!''
</P>
<P>
   Tuleh, a collection of luxurious and romantic clothes, including
1950s-style beaded dresses, lavishly printed cocktail pajamas and
sable stoles, was created by Patner and Bradley a year ago. But
Tuleh is more than just a label. The name refers to the designers'
fictional muse, as well as the desire for frilly femininity that
they believe has long smoldered under the dark, minimalist uniforms
of today's working woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The monochromatic wardrobe that was supposed to give women
freedom to move from the boardroom to the bedroom is actually
limiting,'' Patner said, waving a fork in the air at La Goulue,
between 64th and 65th Streets, an ideal perch from which to observe
some of the city's most put-together women. ``Tuleh releases the
pink in them. Tuleh is a persona that lives in every woman. Her
style is exaggerated. She might leave the house in her favorite
robe, but the cuffs are chinchilla because she can't help herself.
Life is her party. She dresses to please herself, whereas that
navy-blue-suit lady is dressing to be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two men studied the menu at the bistro, Patner, the more
gregarious of the pair, was suddenly distracted by an elderly woman
in a lime-green sweater, green embroidered shoes, green eye shadow
and green earrings, who was getting up from a nearby table.
``You've got to see this,'' he said, nudging Bradley, his more
contemplative partner. ``She's a friend of Tuleh's.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as the woman in green left, another in a long black skirt
and mandarin jacket passed by, her hair in a severe bun and face
made up Kabuki-style. She was all Patner needed to begin a screed
against the color black, as fashion uniform and symbol of
irreproachable chic in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a particularly New York look,'' he said. ``It's a
refusal. It's high Linda Dresner style, a very exclusive club. But
when women wear black, I don't see them anymore. They're
anonymous.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, that view has made Patner and Bradley darlings of a
certain segment of the fashion world. Their sparkly, ruffled
garments _ just right for a modern-day Auntie Mame _ have been
featured in high-end fashion magazines, and when the spring
collection was put out on racks at Bergdorf Goodman in March, about
40 of the 50 or so pieces disappeared in four hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're in touch with the end of the century,'' said Andre
Leon Talley, the editor at large of Vogue. ``There is a need for
glamour and sophistication. There has to be people who give women
ballgowns with yards of imaginative fabric. Tuleh has a Southern
Gothic feeling. There is a sophistication lacking in American
clothes. Everyone thinks it's enough to put a pale blue cashmere
sweater in six-ply with a terra-cotta skirt and call it fashion.
Tuleh is the antidote.''
</P>
<P>
   Patner, 37, and Bradley, 32, have been nominated for a Perry
Ellis award for new talent in women's wear by the Council of
Fashion Designers of America, along with Katayone Adeli and Rebecca
Danenberg. The honor, which will be announced at the American
Fashion Awards on Wednesday, has been won in the past by
stars-to-be like Marc Jacobs and John Bartlett.
</P>
<P>
   But as other winners can attest _ like David Cameron and
Christian Francis Roth, each of whom went out of business shortly
after winning _ it is no guarantee of anything more than a burst of
attention.

</P>
<P>
   For a moment, at least, the spotlight is shining on Patner and
Bradley, whose label is in touch with the desire for decoration,
bright color and froufrou that anticipates the kicking up of heels
in the coming season of millennial parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Modern is not antiseptic,'' Patner intoned at the bistro, his
voice mounting. ``Why do people think the future looks so bleak?
Why do designers think modern women have to look like pod people?
Tuleh is a vehement reaction against techno sport fabrics that look
like heat repellent. We believe in violet, aqua and red. No stone,
pumice, earth and sky-malt colors. Modern is a pretty dress. That's
our manifesto.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite such enthusiasm for eye-catching fashion, Patner, who
wears anonymous tortoise-shell eyeglasses, and Bradley, who sports
a half-grown goatee, are pretty unstylish characters themselves. In
washed-out, rumpled shirts and jeans, the two men, both from the
Midwest, are anything but sleek.
</P>
<P>
   As a twosome, they are a Bob Hope and Bing Crosby act: Patner
spouting droll, tongue-in-cheek observations; Bradley occasionally
blurting out witticisms but mostly laughing heartily at whatever
his partner says. In the studio, they collaborate on designs.
Playing straight man, Bradley runs the pattern-making and sewing,
while Patner takes his charm offensive to the press and retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have the pulse of what's going on,'' said Lillian
Hirshleifer, the owner of Hirshleifer's, a high-fashion store in
Manhasset, N.Y. ``When we had the first trunk show in March, it was
a huge success. The dresses flew out of the store.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Tuleh's focused look, so fresh-seeming to adventurous
retailers and customers, could end up looking dated a couple of
seasons from now. The death of black has been predicted before by
fashion insiders, who continued to make it a staple of their own
wardrobes, proving the enduring appeal of a go-anywhere, drop-dead
wardrobe.
</P>
<P>
   Patner, a former women's fashion coordinator at Bergdorf Goodman
and freelance magazine stylist, and Bradley, a freelance designer
who had worked for Calvin Klein, conceived of Tuleh in April 1998
after meeting through mutual acquaintances in 1997. They created a
few samples, which they packed in a suite of vintage suitcases and
hand-carried to Bergdorf. Along with pastel voile blouses, a tulle
party dress and a purple wool suit, the suitcases included a pack
of Lucky Strikes, a diary, leather gloves, matchbooks with phone
numbers scribbled on them and a train ticket to New Orleans. They
presented the suitcases to Joseph Boitano, who was then the store's
executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a collection,'' recalled Boitano, who this week will
become the general merchandise manager for women's designer wear at
Saks Fifth Avenue. ``It was a concept. It was about the Tuleh
woman, her life style and what she wears. It was as if this woman
had been traveling and she'd popped open her suitcase. It was fun
and charming. So many companies have moved to simple sportswear,
Tuleh's idea of lady clothes seemed like a great option in the
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, Tuleh was sold at only two stores, Bergdorf and
Neiman Marcus in San Francisco, with prices ranging from $300, for
a top, to $12,000, for hand-beaded creations. Six months later, the
business includes 20 accounts nationwide. At Ultimo in Dallas, half
the stock was bought after the store held a runway preview of the
spring collection, and a $4,000 feather-trimmed stole immediately
sold out, said Lynne Henry, the women's buyer at Ultimo.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Fischbein, a lawyer from New York, was so eager for a
strapless floral dress she saw in a newspaper last fall that she
hunted it down for months, finally locating one in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phone rings off the hook with women who want our
dresses,'' Patner said with obvious amusement. ``You can hear the
craving in their voice for color. They want the gaze of desire.
They want their boyfriends and husbands to look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   But despite these successes, Tuleh is still in the vulnerable
position of most new independent labels. The partners have borrowed
money from family members, cashed out IRA's and maxed out their
credit cards. They are eagerly searching for a financial backer,
because they lack sufficient cash flow and have even turned down
accounts, they say, because they cannot afford enough fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Their showroom and work space is Bradley's former apartment on
the Upper West Side, grandly named ``the atelier'' but in fact a
small, run-down, five-floor walk-up shared with two seamstresses.
(The designers live together downtown now.)
</P>
<P>
   The men seem perfectly happy amid the peeling paint, chipped
moldings and thread-bare furniture in the atelier. They serve pink
lemonade to a parade of women who seem to drop by regularly,
including fashion editors and clients like Cameron Diaz and Candace
Bushnell, borrowing dresses for parties or photo shoots.
</P>
<P>
   At La Goulue, Patner was explaining why Arnold Scaasi is a hero
_ a designer who accepted that fashion's first job is to make women
beautiful _ when a blonde in a black and white window-pane suit
with a Pucci blouse stopped to talk to the maitre d'hotel. ``She's
very Bill Blass,'' Bradley said. ``Bill's the master of snappy
clothes. We think he's the coolest American designer. He's cool the
way Tony Bennett is cool.''
</P>
<P>
   As the two men polished off their dessert parfaits (``Just the
word `parfait' is delicious,'' Patner sighed), a pair of tanned,
20-something women jumped out of a Range Rover. They both had long
straight hair and were wearing skinny black pants, tight T-shirts,
black sandals and Gucci sunglasses. Waiting outside the restaurant
for a table, one spoke into a cell phone while the other kept
looking at her Cartier watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're vulgar,'' Bradley said, turning away. ``They have far
too many accessories of the wrong sort with other people's names on
them. And why buy black shoes when you can buy purple? Shoes should
be amusing both for you and for your public.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking a glance up and down the street, Patner said, ``Cool
older women, and really insecure younger women who all look the
same _ that's Madison Avenue.'' &QL;

CRITICS CHARGE OFFICIALS OVERREACTING TO POSSIBLE SCHOOL VIOLENCE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo., Mich., Texas, Wisc.) 
 
By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Could four 14-year-old boys really pull off a two-year plan to
hold a Texas high school ransom for $5 million?
</P>
<P>
   How about four Michigan youths who envisioned themselves ripping
off a gun shop, storming their middle school and ordering students
and teachers to the cafeteria, where they would then choose who
lived and died?
</P>
<P>
   Or the 13-year-old Wisconsin boy who scribbled bomb threats on
Popsicle sticks? To law enforcement agents, that infraction was
serious enough to arrest the Wisconsin boy.
</P>
<P>
   And while the teens from the Texas town of Wimberley pleaded
guilty to avoid being tried as adults, two of the Michigan boys are
being tried as adults and face an automatic sentence of life in
prison if convicted. The other two boys, both 13, could also be
tried as adults.
</P>
<P>
   While last month's violence at Colorado's Columbine High School
has yielded copycat threats across the United States, it has
likewise resulted in heavy-handed responses from school
administrators and authorities. Now critics are charging that
principals and police have gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are vilifying our kids,'' said Vincent Schiraldi, director
of the Washington-based Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice.
``We're mistaking zero tolerance for zero intelligence.''
</P>
<P>
   The Columbine tragedy in Littleton, Colo., and the myriad
threats that followed have touched off an almost hysterical
climate. Compared with May of last year, the Center on Juvenile and
Criminal Justice reports a 10-fold increase in reports of students
expelled for making threats.
</P>
<P>
   Around Houston, numerous threats in schools have been met with
dozens of suspensions and arrests, including one seventh-grader for
making terroristic threats. And in suburban Dallas, Allen school
district officials declared the school year canceled after 12 bomb
threats in less than two weeks, then reversed themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Allen school officials also suspended a 17-year-old student for
wearing a black arm band to protest new speech and dress policies
that took effect after the Columbine shootings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all the preventive measures they are taking, school
officials and law enforcement agents may be overlooking the fact
that incidents such as Columbine are rare.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than 1 percent of child homicides occur in or around
schools, according to the Centers for Disease Control. And while
the number of school shootings with multiple victims has risen,
from an average of two to an average of five a year, the total
number of shootings has declined.
</P>
<P>
   To some, the horror of Columbine, in which two teen-age gunmen
killed 13 people, and then themselves, is reason enough to crack
down.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Houston, executive director of the American Association of
School Administrators, says administrators should be expected to
act forcefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question schools have overreacted,'' said Houston.
``The problem you have is that if they're not overreacting, they're
underreacting.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the Texas junior-high boys were sentenced last week to
boot camp and juvenile probation after pleading guilty to
conspiracy to commit arson. Another received a lesser charge of
juvenile probation.
</P>
<P>
   Though Hays County District Attorney Michael Wenk admitted this
week that the plot involving Wimberley High school was not
imminent, he says the evidence suggests authorities thwarted an
attack. School officials agree.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many locals are skeptical. Searches of the Wimberley
boys' homes yielded what authorities initially described as crude
explosives. They turned out to be mostly fireworks, including
firecrackers stuffed into shotgun shell casings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly they talked more than they should have,'' said Ray
Green, a lawyer for one of the boys. ``But it's hard for me to
believe any 14-year-old has a long-range plan they're actually
going to follow through on.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether students, especially those in junior
high school and younger, should be prosecuted for what may simply
be acting like kids. In a class project that required Ohio
third-graders to provide fortunes for fortune cookies, one student
wrote, ``You will die an honorable death,'' a line he picked up
from a martial arts video. The boy was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, teachers in Littleton were criticized for failing to
pick up signs that Eric Harris, 18, and Dylan Klebold, 17, were
deeply troubled: Gothic music, black trench coats, even a video the
two killers made for a class project in which they act out a
terrorist attack on their school.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say most students, especially the younger ones, are
prone to acting inappropriately. Elaine Blechman, a professor of
psychology at the University of Colorado at Boulder, says the
recent trend toward zero tolerance ignores the fact that kids say
and do silly things.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the reason we have children in school,'' said Blechman.
``It's the reason parents are responsible for their children.''
</P>
<P>
   Blechman maintains that the crackdown, and in particular trying
kids as adults, is almost certain to force otherwise mainstream
youths to the fringes, creating the very types that might actually
wreak havoc on society.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we want to grow a whole bunch of monsters,'' said Blechman,
``let's just throw these kids in with a bunch of adult felons.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston says he expects the over-wrought responses to wane in
the coming months. If not, Houston says, then there will be reason
to worry.
</P>
<P>
   But that is not likely to mean much to the Port Huron, Mich.,
boys, who may have been out to mimic the Columbine massacre, or who
may have simply been enjoying a violent fantasy, not entirely
unusual for boys their age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all hearsay, rumor, guilt by association,'' said Frank
Mitchell, the lawyer for one boy. Mitchell says his 13-year-old
client told him he thought the other three boys were joking about
the killing spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next thing you know, he's in jail with $100,000 bond,'' said
Mitchell. ``He could go to prison for life.''

MAP MAKERS EXPLORE THE CONTOURS OF POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Wis.)  (rk) 
 By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The history of maps once seemed a quaint preoccupation. The
cartographer was a specialist in incomplete and antique vistas,
surveying terrains, boundaries and trade routes that were
decorously traced on tentatively shaped landmasses.
</P>
<P>
   Old maps _ with their compass roses, their illuminated borders
and their vast blank spaces _ were sought by collectors and
historians but were otherwise considered artful relics of
ignorance, faltering steps on the way to modern geography.
</P>
<P>
   No longer. In the past 25 years there has been a sea change in
the world of cartography. The study of maps has come to seem
urgently contemporary, taking on all the contours now familiar from
recent academic studies of history, literature and culture.
</P>
<P>
   In this realm, maps are not just a progressive record of
attempts to know the world; they are a record of attempts to
construct and control it. Maps are not innocent. They select the
data they wish to emphasize and ignore what is inconvenient. They
are being looked at as instruments of power.
</P>
<P>
   In 1973, for example, cartographer Arno Peters argued that the
familiar Mercator map of the globe, in which a country's size
increases the further it is from the equator, gives undue
geographical emphasis to Europe and diminishes the size of third
world countries.
</P>
<P>
   His proposed replacement, adopted by many international
agencies, is an ``equal-area'' map in which shapes are distorted
but size is preserved. This argument has its problems: the Mercator
map was never meant to associate size with importance (Greenland
was never a world power); its advantage was that it preserved
bearings for sea navigation. But the controversy was a sign of
change.
</P>
<P>
   Since then scholars have analyzed the role of maps in imperial
conquest (``Mapping an Empire: The Geographical Construction of
British India, 1765-1843,'' by Matthew H. Edney); the misuse of
maps (``How to Lie With Maps,'' by Mark Monmonier); and the
ideological presuppositions of maps (``Maps and Politics'' by
Jeremy Black).
</P>
<P>
   The last book concludes that politics and maps are inseparable
and that ``there is no unchallenged or obvious basis'' for a claim
of a map's objectivity. This challenge to objectivity _ an almost
axiomatic position in contemporary scholarship _ has been widely
accompanied by assertions that the standard notion of a map, as an
attempt to accurately render geographic space, is also Eurocentric,
eclipsing and distorting other cultures' map-making achievements.
</P>
<P>
   An important scholarly enterprise, the History of Cartography,
by the University of Chicago Press, provides further signs of the
field's evolution. Conceived 22 years ago, it is the most ambitious
overview of map making ever undertaken.
</P>
<P>
   With annual budget costs of about $200,000 (excluding its
publication), it engages in extensive fund raising and applies for
grants. The fourth volume in the series has just been published,
and the final four are expected in the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   In a review in the cartographic journal Imago Mundi, Paul
Wheatley of the University of Chicago proclaimed: ``It is permitted
to few scholars both to extend the boundaries of their field of
study and to redefine it as a discipline. Yet that is precisely
what the History as a whole is doing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first volume, published in 1987, one of the founding
editors, J.B. Harley, noted that ``by 1980 the history of
cartography was at the crossroads.'' By combining essays based on
original research by authoritative scholars with extensive
illustrations of rare and unusual maps, the project is an attempt
to illuminate the terrain beyond the crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   The History would, Harley suggested, move beyond ``a deeply
entrenched Eurocentricity'' and undertake ``a technical, a cultural
and a social history of mapping.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harley, who died in 1991, and his co-editor, David Woodward,
a professor of geography at the University of Wisconsin at Madison,
underestimated how much the field was changing, and to what extent
the project itself would affect the field being surveyed.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview, Woodward said the original plan was
for a four-volume history. The first was to include all non-Western
and pre-medieval materials, and then ``we would get on to the real
maps,'' as Woodward put it, in volumes devoted to the European
Renaissance, the European Enlightenment and the modern period.
</P>
<P>
   But the non-Western materials had until then been so cursorily
studied that ``it became obvious that we were in terra incognita,''
Woodward said. The planned single volume grew into four, which have
broken so much new ground that they are already having an impact.
</P>
<P>
   The History has inspired new interpretations of medieval
``mappaemundi,'' early Western maps of the known world, which often
appeared as geometrically divided circles. The third volume
(labeled Volume II, Book 2) awakened interest in the intricacies of
Asian mapping traditions. And the latest volume (labeled Volume II,
Book 3) provides, in the book's words, ``the first serious global
attempt'' to describe and explain the principles of cartography in
traditional African, American, Arctic, Australian and Pacific
societies.
</P>
<P>
   These volumes are not just accumulations of neglected materials.
Woodward said that the essays were written from a new perspective:
``We move beyond the idea of a map as a mirror of the world. The
emphasis is much more on the agendas people have when they make
them. Maps are treated less as representational devices than as
rhetorical devices.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   In discussing South American maps, for example, one contributor,
William Gustav Gartner, suggests that maps cannot be thought of as
flat surfaces geometrically rendering space: ``We will not
recognize Andean maps until we attempt to see through Andean
eyes.'' So an Andean ceramic vessel is described as a map because
its rendering of a house and a warrior's shield is accompanied by
sculptured images of the surrounding mountains, roads and canals.
</P>
<P>
   In another example, an Australian aboriginal painting of birds
on a cashew tree, an account of the tribe's mythic origins, is seen
as a map outlining the territorial landscape within which the tribe
dwells. A ``lukasa memory board'' from the Kabongo region of the
Congo that is decorated with shells and beads and is used in
initiation ceremonies is also a regional map.
</P>
<P>
   The authors point out that none of these cultures even had a
word for ``map'' before their contact with the West; a generation
ago, these objects might not have even been considered maps by
Western cartographers. But with the new view of maps as a
``cognitive system,'' a way of making sense of the world according
to a culture's customs, iconography merges into cartography. Maps
not only portray space but also display ritual and social
relationships within that space. ``Comparing maps,'' Woodward
writes, ``implies no less than comparing cultures.''
</P>
<P>
   This emphasis on cultural anthropology will also lead to the
remapping of more familiar territory as the maps of the West are
examined for their cultural contexts in forthcoming books. In the
next volume, scheduled for publication in 2003, Woodward said,
editors had planned to treat the Renaissance map as a ``metaphor
for science'' in which gaps in geographical knowledge are gradually
filled.
</P>
<P>
   But the emphasis has shifted from the accretion of knowledge to
how that knowledge is organized: what premises held in making maps,
what conclusions were drawn from them and what cultural and
political functions they served.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``it is now possible to say that some of the major
map-making figures in the 16th century, like Mercator, were a lot
more religiously motivated than we once thought,'' Woodward said.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the project draws to a close with studies of
20th-century mapping, the 21st century will be well under way and
the great cartographic project of the West will have been
completely reinterpreted. Although Woodward is careful to distance
the series from radical questioning of the possibility of objective
mapping, the History still has radical implications.
</P>
<P>
   By suggesting that all understanding may be a form of mapping,
it places maps at the center of social existence, as an almost
archetypal example of human knowledge. Indeed, in discussing their
thoughts or feelings, people often invoke a cartographic universe.
</P>
<P>
   Feeling bewildered, one talks about ``terra incognita,'' about
``being at a crossroads'' or ``losing our way.'' Gaining
enlightenment, one speaks of ``putting things in perspective'' and
``being on familiar terrain.'' People come to know the world the
way they come to map it _ through their perceptions of how its
elements are connected and of how they should move among them.
</P>
<P>
   This is precisely what the History is attempting by situating
the map at the heart of cultural life and revealing its
relationship to society, science and religion. It is tracing new
routes of cartographic influence, for example from Europe to Asia
and back to Europe, and from American Indians to European settlers
and back to American Indians. It is trying to define a new set of
relationships between maps and the physical world that involve more
than geometric correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   It is in essence a new map of human attempts to chart the world.
Since this cartographic enterprise has yet to encompass the
Renaissance and its aftermath, it is a map with vast empty spaces
and clouded boundaries. What, after all, made Western mapping so
different from that of other cultures? How important is the notion
of the Western map as a metaphor for science? What made certain
forms of mapping more important and more powerful than others?
</P>
<P>
   The answers go to the heart of many contemporary controversies.
But in its ambitious attempts to map the maps of the world's
cultures, the project ends up affirming the principles of
observation, imagination and abstraction that gave birth to Western
cartography in the first place.

`INHERIT THE WIND': TESTED FORUM FOR PIETY AND CONFLICT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In its decades of incarnations on and off Broadway and on big
and small screens, ``Inherit the Wind'' has attracted audiences
both by its righteous theme and its dramatic punch. Once again
Saturday night, the battle between benightedness and enlightenment
offers viewers of a liberal persuasion the satisfaction of sharing
in the play's assumptions and having their own advanced opinions
confirmed. The drama comes most forcefully in the climactic
confrontation between a spouter of the old-time religion and a
secular advocate of free speech.
</P>
<P>
   This time out, it's George C. Scott, exuding a narrow and at
moments ferocious piety, as Matthew Harrison Brady, facing off
against Jack Lemmon, representing science and open argument as
Henry Drummond. The case, of course, is the famous monkey trial
that agitated the town of Hillsboro, Tenn., in 1925; at issue was
whether a schoolteacher could introduce his pupils to evolution
despite a law against it. The champion of the fundamentalist locals
was William Jennings Bryan ( Scott); the voice of reason was
Clarence Darrow ( Lemmon).
</P>
<P>
   Scott and Lemmon make a strong pair of antagonists, right up
there with Fredric March and Spencer Tracy in Stanley Kramer's 1960
movie, and are the main reason for tuning into Showtime Saturday
night. Lawyer Darrow and politician Bryan had been allied in
Populist causes over the years, but on this issue there was no
meeting ground. When Drummond gets Brady in the witness chair as a
self-proclaimed expert on the Bible _ ``Everything in the Bible
should be accepted exactly as it is written'' _ the fundamentalist
self-destructs, and that makes the play.
</P>
<P>
   There is never any question about whose side the audience is
expected to take in a conflict between an earnest young teacher
(Tom Everett Scott) and a town full of nitwits. The script seems to
have been turned out by machine. ``What kind of life will we have
if I give up now?'' the teacher asks his fiancee. The issue is too
easy to be very interesting.
</P>
<P>
   But Scott and Lemmon invest their roles with a humanity that
cuts deeper than ideology. The show flags whenever they are off
camera, which happily is not often. Saturday night's treatment lays
on period atmospherics _ plenty of cardboard fans and straw hats _
and finesses current arguments over creationism by having Drummond
show respect for the Bible as well as for Darwin.
</P>
<P>
   As a newspaperman modeled on H.L. Mencken, Beau Bridges becomes
the play's heavy in an insufferably sarcastic performance that is
meant to stand as a contrast to Darrow's compassion for his
defeated foe. Mencken, whose reporting on the trial is a hoot and a
classic of journalism, deserves better. John Cullum as the
presiding judge brings a touch of credibility to the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   For plot convenience, the teacher's girlfriend, Rachel (Kathryn
Morris), turns out to be the daughter of the local minister (Lane
Smith), who seems half-crazed most of the time. The title, taken
from Proverbs, refers to this parent-child disagreement, but don't
worry about it.
</P>
<P>
   For the real pleasure of the evening, wait for the shirt-sleeve
exchanges over over how Joshua stopped the sun and the whale
swallowed Jonah and how Mrs. Cain got begat. ``I do not think about
things I do not think about,'' says Scott-Brady-Bryan. To which
Lemmon-Drummond-Darrow inquires, ``Do you think about things you do
think about?''  &QL;

PROSECUTORS TO FOCUS ON COOPERATION AT BORDER MEETING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANE SCHILLER  
 c.1999 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Cross-border justice, including how to handle car
thieves, killers, money launderers and dead-beat parents, will be
on the agenda this week as 10 attorneys general from U.S. and
Mexican border states gather here to talk strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The 18th Border Attorneys General Conference, which begins
Wednesday, is seen as an opportunity for chief law enforcement
officials to navigate a 2,000-mile border that is a maze of local,
state and federal jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the maze snares criminals in an inescapable web. Other
times, officials say, it has proven a frustrating and nearly
impenetrable wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we do not have any choice but to interact and
hopefully cooperate with the Mexican government on matters of
mutual interest,'' Texas Attorney General John Cornyn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have never met before, and as simple as it sounds,
this is a first step,'' said Cornyn, who is in his first term.
</P>
<P>
   They face a formidable task, as the U.S.-Mexico border is home
to almost 6 million people and is said to be the gateway for as
much as 80 percent of the cocaine and marijuana in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn's chief of financial crimes, Don Clemmer, testified
before Congress in April that approximately $30 billion a year in
Mexican drug cartel profits are laundered in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy de la Garza, a professor at the University of Texas at
Austin, said recent events show there is a lot of room for mistrust
among officials from both sides of the border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect Mexicans are chafing at the arrogance with which the
United States has implemented his drug policy,'' de la Garza said.
</P>
<P>
   As for attorneys general from the United States, de la Garza,
said they are likely suspicious of their Mexican counterparts and
question how they were appointed to office as well as their
loyalties.
</P>
<P>
   Cornyn said the challenge will be tackling so many issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk in dealing with an issue as big as law enforcement,
health and environmental issues along the border is that everyone
comes to the table with their own perspective,'' said Cornyn, a
former state district judge in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Presentations also will include child support and child
abductions, the free trade agreement and how authorities from
American states can pursue justice in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most high-profile fights for international justice is
the case of Jose Luis Del Toro, who is accused of shooting and
stabbing to death Sheila Bellush, a mother of six, including
quadruplets born in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Bellush was killed Nov. 7, 1997, in her home in Sarasota, Fla.
Two men are imprisoned in Florida for their parts in the killing.
Del Toro was caught by police in Monterrey, Mexico, later that
year, but his lawyer has launched a protracted legal battle,
including an appeal to Mexico's highest court, to block his
extradition to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, local officials have been able to get around
complicated extraditions by requesting help from Mexican state
officials to prosecute citizens for crimes committed in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case border crimes is the 1993 murder of Joey
Fischer, a Brownsville, Texas, high school student who was gunned
down outside his home.
</P>
<P>
   The killers, both Mexicans, fled across the Rio Grande, but they
were later arrested, tried and sentenced to 15 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Fugitives also flee to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The director of a Reynosa, Mexico, university was arrested by
the FBI in McAllen, Texas, earlier this year and sent back to
Mexico where he is accused of having a rival academic killed for
having an affair with his wife.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the U.S. State Department, the Justice Department nor
the Mexican Embassy could readily provide figures on how many
extraditions are requested each year.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Antonio Zabalgoitia, a spokesman for the Mexican Embassy,
said law enforcement agencies are working together to the point
that, he contends, escaping the law by crossing the border is
rarely an option.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is just in the movies,'' he said from Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are constantly returning criminals,'' Zabalgoitia said.
``There is a continuous flow of cooperation.''
</P>
<P>
   California officials also are praising their partnership with
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is probably the most evolved law enforcement cooperation in
existence,'' said Nathan Barankin, spokesman for the California
attorney general's office.
</P>
<P>
   But Guillermo Margandant, a professor of law at the National
Autonomous University in Mexico City, contends Mexico is hesitant
to hand over its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a question of patriotism and public opinion being much
too strong in Mexico,'' Margandant said. ``The extradition business
between Mexico and the United States is not the most flourishing
business.''

   YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO CONFLICT
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-RIVALS _ TIRANA, Albania _ One of the biggest problems
facing post war Kosovo will be resolving the conflict between two
rival groups, both of which claim to be the legitimate government
of Kosovo. This confusion is already a problem as the groups are
battling to get contributions from foreigners, including
Albanian-Americans who are asked to give 3 percent of their
salaries to support the cause. The problems between the rival
governments are so deep that they accuse each other of criminal
acts including murder. (Roughton, Cox News Service). 20.

Meanwhile, everyone from Wayne LaPierre of the NRA to parents of
the Columbine shootings appearbefore the House Judiciary committee
to discuss gun control. (Foskett, Atlanta journal-Constitution).
</P>

   SENTENCING _ WASHINGTON _ The seven offices have posh
furnishings, a magnificent view of the U.S. Capitol grounds and a
budget of $10.2 million. All that's missing at the U.S. Sentencing
Commission is commissioners. Political sparring has left a headless
agency with no one to fulfill the function of setting guidelines
for 51,000 criminal sentences a year. (Malone, Cox News Service).

   HACKERS _ WASHINGTON _ Attacks on public Internet sites like the

STUDY QUESTIONS STEREOTYPES OF GANG MEMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ A study of Mexican-American gangs has found that
their teen-aged members are not psychologically predisposed to
violence, providing hope that many could be turned from a criminal
path, researchers said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The still-unpublished study by researchers at the University of
Texas at San Antonio took aim at popular myths about Hispanic
gangs, said Avelardo Valdez, director of the Hispanic Research
Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio and investigator
for the study.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the most vicious kids are in gangs, but
it's not true,'' Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers identified 26 active gangs in San Antonio, and
randomly selected 50 male members for extensive psychological
tests.
</P>
<P>
   The study examined whether gang members felt shame, guilt and
remorse _ qualities typically lacking in those with antisocial
personalities.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers also looked at a comparison group of 25 non-gang
members with similar criminal behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that only 4 percent of gang members could be
classified as antisocial, making them more open to violence. None
of the non-gang members could be so classified.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conclusion is that the majority of aggressive, antisocial
behavior that's perpetuated by Mexican-American gangs is not
because of personality disorders,'' Valdez said.
</P>
<P>
   To Valdez, that means gang members would benefit from
intervention and other community services.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychopaths don't respond well to treatment. It (the study)
says these kids have hope. They shouldn't be locked up and thrown
in jail forever,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The study also challenges the idea that gang members are more
likely to come from dysfunctional families and experience more
childhood abuse than youths who are not in gangs.
</P>
<P>
   Gang members did not report significantly higher levels of
physical, sexual and emotional abuse, compared to non-gang members.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ability of these families to provide for the basic
emotional needs of their children is an indication of the
resiliency and strength of the Mexican-American culture,'' Valdez
said.
</P>
<P>
   But gang members did show a higher level of physical neglect,
complaining that at home they had gone without food, clean clothes
or access to medical care.
</P>
<P>
   That suggests gang members may have joined the groups more out
of a need for material benefit _ not a desire to belong, Valdez
said.

SCHOLAR RESIGNS OVER TRILLING'S `DIAGNOSIS' 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md.)  (rk) 
 By SARAH BOXER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last month, The American Scholar published ``My Father and the
Weak-Eyed Devils,'' an essay in which James Trilling, an
independent art historian, asserted that both he and his father,
Lionel Trilling, suffered from attention deficit disorder.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the journal is feeling the fallout. Paul R. McHugh, the
psychiatrist in chief at the Johns Hopkins Hospital, quit the
editorial board of The American Scholar earlier this month over the
story.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a clumsily written, meanly written article about a
defenseless father,'' McHugh said in an interview, adding that the
diagnosis the son offers ``is not given anything like the
foundation a psychiatrist would give.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh complained that the essay is merely ``sophisticated name
calling,'' and that James Trilling ``uses psychiatric principles to
settle personal scores.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, the only psychiatrist on the 15-member board of the
journal, was not consulted before the piece was published.
</P>
<P>
   The last board member to resign in protest, said Anne Fadiman,
the editor of The American Scholar, was Diana Trilling, who left in
1978 over an article that was also about Lionel, her husband.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fadiman, who said she regrets McHugh's departure, explained
that she never sends articles to the board members unless she is
unsure about whether to accept them. ``This is not a peer-reviewed
journal, not a fact-checked journal,'' she said. ``But I had no
doubts about whether to accept this one. It was beautifully
written, carefully constructed. I would have published it even if
it had been by an unknown writer about an unknown writer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a piece about psychiatry,'' she continued. ``It's a
memoir.''
</P>
<P>
   McHugh, who said he was sad to resign, suggested that we have
become so accustomed to offering psychiatric judgments that a piece
like this seems not to require a scholar's eye. But what then is
the purpose of the editorial board? he asked. ``Were we there to
just meet and schmooze?''

BUSH SIGNS CHILDREN'S INSURANCE BILL INTO LAW 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ At a ceremony Friday in which words of wisdom
from Dr. Seuss brought smiles, Gov. George W. Bush signed a bill
into law that promises healthier lives for hundreds of thousands of
low-income children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can think of no better use of tobacco settlement money than
for safeguarding and improving children's health,'' he said. ``I'm
pleased to sign this bill, and I congratulate you all for doing
what's right for Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also kicked off the Memorial Day weekend by signing a bill
to lower the legal blood alcohol limit for drinking and driving
from .10 to .08.
</P>
<P>
   The children's health issue took the spotlight, however, as
health officials &UR;  &LR; and lawmakers gathered around Bush for a round of
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children's health insurance has been a priority this
session,'' said Bush, who some accused earlier in the session of
not taking a strong enough leadership role on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The new law creates the state's Children's Health Insurance
Program to provide health coverage for kids under age 19 whose
parents don't earn enough to afford private insurance but aren't
poor enough for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
   Although Bush had begun negotiations on the issue asking that
only children at 150 percent of the federal poverty level be
considered eligible, a recent decision from the U.S. Congress
allowing states to keep tobacco settlement money suddenly made more
aid possible.
</P>
<P>
   Bush says now he is pleased with the more generous program.
``It's hard to commit the state ... when we weren't certain that
the supply of money would be available.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, lawmakers decided to offer coverage for children in
families earning up to twice the poverty level or $33,600 for a
family of four.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Patricia Gray, D-Galveston, who sponsored the legislation
along with Democratic Sen. Mike Moncrief of Fort Worth, gave Bush a
photo of children with a Texas flag.
</P>
<P>
   On the back, she said, is her favorite quote from Dr. Seuss:
``That unless someone like you cares a whole awful lot, nothing's
going to get better, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers also provided state funds to insure 7,000 children of
immigrants legally residing in Texas and said they made sure
children with special health needs are covered. Both preventive and
corrective dental insurance is part of the package as well.
</P>
<P>
   Federal funds of $423 million a year will pay for the program,
combined with $180 million budgeted by the state from its tobacco
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In signing the drinking and driving bill, Bush warned Texans to
play it safe behind the wheel on the Memorial Day weekend, although
the new law does not become effective until Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation will make our streets safer, and it sends a
clear signal to Texans that drinking and driving don't mix,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers partly said they want to ensure the safety of Texans,
who have led the nation with the highest number of alcohol-related
traffic deaths. Yet, the new law also makes it possible for the
state to collect an estimated $12 million in new federal highway
money.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Bill 114 was sponsored by Sen. Mario Gallegos, a Democrat
from Houston who served as a paramedic in the Houston Fire
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``During my tour of duty at Ben Taub Hospital Emergency Room, I
saw the faces of families who lost loved ones to drunk-driving
accidents,'' he said.

FREEDOM AND AFFORDABILITY DRAWING NEW RV DEVOTEES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(RUNS WITH SIDEBAR RV-INFO)  
By CAROL BIDWELL  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Burned-out homeowners Megan Edwards and Mark
Sedenquist needed a new home.
</P>
<P>
   Artists Katie and Gordon Angerman needed an affordable way to
see America's great art museums.
</P>
<P>
   Actress Lindsay Wagner needed a dressing room to double as a
day-care center for her two young sons.
</P>
<P>
   The answer for all of them: a recreational vehicle, one of those
head-down-the-highway-with-all-the-comforts-of-home houses on
wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Life on the move has never been so convenient, with microwave
ovens, toilets and showers, televisions and refrigerators now
standard equipment on even modestly priced RVs. Deluxe models can
include just about whatever a wanderlust-filled _ and well-heeled _
owner can imagine.
</P>
<P>
   Retirees aren't the only ones who love their home-on-wheels. A
University of Michigan study says as many as 7.2 million baby
boomers, in addition to families with young children, are quickly
discovering an RV is a way to have family togetherness while saving
money on a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   And there's something else, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be out on the open road is a kind of freedom you can't get
any other way,'' said Tara Calton, spokeswoman for the
Ventura-based Good Sam Club, with more than 960,000 members, the
largest RV club in the world. ``It's a kind of feeling you get,
knowing you can go anywhere you want and you'll have all the
necessities of home with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Lots of people have discovered that freedom.
</P>
<P>
   There are more than 9.3 million RVs of all size, shape and
description on the road in America, according to the Recreation
Vehicle Industry Association. About 8.6 million families _ 17.5
million people or more _ own their own RV. The rest rent the
behemoths.
</P>
<P>
   And more new RVs roll off the assembly line every year: 292,700
in 1998. That same year, sales of travel trailers topped 78,800,
and motor home sales rose to 42,900.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people started tent camping years ago and now can afford
a big RV,'' said Pamela Kay, spokeswoman for the Family Motor Coach
Association, a 95,000-member group based in Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as Jeff Beddow, spokesman for the RVIA, puts it: ``It sure
beats sleeping in a tent.''
</P>
<P>
   That was one of the possibilities that faced Edwards and
Sedenquist on Oct. 27, 1993, when their Arcadia home burned to the
ground. They moved into a friend's guest house, but the few
possessions they'd managed to salvage from the fire were ground
into dust when the Northridge Earthquake hit on Jan. 17, 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards, 46, told her husband it was time to rethink their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all started when I said, `We'd better go out and be like
fairy-tale children and seek our fortunes,''' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So they went on the road, in a custom-built, 32-foot-long,
$75,000 motor home they named Phoenix I, like the mythical Phoenix
rising from the ashes.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, they've caught fire twice (once when they tried
to bake bread in the microwave oven, again when wires under the
dashboard caught fire). They've ducked under a freeway overpass to
avoid getting blown away in a tornado, and driven a handful of
places that were too narrow, too steep, too rutted to accommodate
their vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Edwards has chronicled their adventures in a book, ``Roads From
the Ashes'' (Trilogy Books; $14.95).
</P>
<P>
   Five years and 150,000 miles later, they run their public
relations business from an RV equipped with high-tech
communications equipment. In addition to their public relations
firm, Edwards, a teacher-turned-writer, and Sedenquist, a former
property manager, started an online magazine,
!bold!www.RoadTripAmerica.com!off!.
</P>
<P>
   They not only have no plans to put down roots any time soon,
they're planning construction next year of a bigger motor home with
new, state-of-the-art communications capability.
</P>
<P>
   The modern communication system that makes their life on the
road possible is getting even better and is sure to lure more
people into life on the move, said Beddow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are now getting into RV-ing because they can get
away from home, yet still keep in contact, run their businesses,
communicate with their offices,'' said the RVIA spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, all the technology in the world doesn't make living
in confined quarters with your loved ones any easier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took awhile to learn how to live together,'' said
Sedenquist, 45. ``It was a little space, and we were literally
bumping into each other; it was psychological as well as physical.
We had to kind of reinvent the relationship we had.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the two spent several months apart before deciding
they'd make their new life work.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a lifestyle that requires a lot of commitment,'' said
Sedenquist. ``You really have to work at it. Everything you have at
home _ anxiety about money, relationships, the kids' future,
retirement _ is going with you. I think the biggest mistake people
make is they just look at this and think this will solve all their
problems. But it's not magical. The only thing you leave behind is
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   The saving grace: ``We have a 3,000-mile back yard,'' Edwards
said with a grin.
</P>
<P>
   Wandering here and there, home in tow, provided the perfect
segue into retirement for Katie and Gordon Angerman, both 71. They
sold their Thousand Oaks home, sold or gave away most of their
belongings and bought a 30-foot-long, $27,000 travel trailer to tow
behind their pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, Katie, who does quilting and textile art, had her art
books and sewing machine; Gordon, a ceramics artist, had his
potter's wheel. They also had the niceties of home: stereo,
television, computer.
</P>
<P>
   It was all they needed to embark on a trek from one art museum
to another. And if there was a pottery class in Savannah that
Gordon wanted to take, they'd head to the Georgia town for six
weeks or so. If there was a class in textiles in Boston that Katie
longed for, that's where they went.
</P>
<P>
   Both have mobility problems _ Katie wears braces as the result
of a congenital leg deformity, and Gordon battles problems from
childhood polio _ but found life on the road no more difficult than
getting around at home. They got to know doctors in a few major
cities and planned their route so they'd be in town when it was
time for a checkup.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if we were tired, we just didn't do a lot,'' Katie said.
``We were happy to stay in the trailer in a campground and rest
up.''
</P>
<P>
   It was exactly the retirement the two had envisioned. Gordon had
worked for years for Lockheed, Katie as a librarian for a local
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Gordon was still working, we decided to go on the road,''
Katie said. ``We went to every RV show at Dodger Stadium for 10 or
15 years before deciding what (kind of RV) we wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   They hit the road in March 1989 and put 192,000 miles on their
rig before settling into a new home in Las Cruces, N.M., in May
1994.
</P>
<P>
   They finally quit life as road runners, they say, because they
just ran out of art museums to visit.
</P>
<P>
   But their five years of enforced closeness in a 30-foot trailer
has changed their relationship forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``You become very appreciative of what you have,'' Katie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're still speaking to each other, it's a nice life,''
she added with a laugh. ``If you're not speaking to each other,
it's hell on wheels.''
</P>
<P>
   They sold their big trailer _ but, still yearning to hit the
road at a moment's notice, bought a smaller one for short jaunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We pick up and go whenever we want,'' Katie said. ``Life on
the road is great because you're always looking forward. There's
always a little bit of the unknown. When you live in a house, the
biggest unknown is what the mailman is going to bring you. It's an
adventure to be on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   For parents like Lindsay Wagner, an RV can be a prime family
gathering place.
</P>
<P>
   According to University of Michigan research, 92 percent of
parents who own an RV _ owners' average age is 48 _ say they're the
best way to travel with kids.
</P>
<P>
   For Wagner, 49, the decision to acquire an RV _ a cab-over,
40-foot-long trailer called a fifth wheel _ came after the birth of
the first of her two sons. It doubled as a place for her to nurse
and for the baby to nap and play while she was working.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went with me everywhere,'' said the actress, best-known for
her 1970s TV show ``The Bionic Woman,'' and, most recently, for a
series of Ford Motor Co. commercials. ``That was his home away from
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, with now-teen-age sons, she ordered from Rexhall
Industries Inc. of Lancaster a custom-made, extra-wide,
32-foot-long motor home that is her dressing room when she's
working _ and is a way to get her family close to nature when she's
not.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, she loaded her boys, two of their friends and her
boyfriend into the motor home and took off on a six-week vacation
through Montana, Idaho and Washington, stopping along the way to
canoe, white-water raft, fish and camp. When the weather's nice,
the boys sleep outdoors in a tent; when it rains, ``there are
bodies everywhere inside _ on the floor and on the couch, pulled
down as a bed, on the table. But my kids are used to that. They've
grown up on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Her favorite parts of an on-the-road vacation are the outdoor
shower and RV cooking. ``I'm inspired when I'm on the road; all
these gourmet meals come out of me.'' As much as she loves her
custom-decorated motor home _ filled with nature-patterned fabrics
and American Indian-style pottery _ she's contemplating trading it
in for a trailer that includes both space to transport her horses
and sleeping quarters for at least four people.
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure: She's one of those people who'll always
find a way to get away from work and all the other annoyances of
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, just to drive out to the middle of nowhere, to
drive out and just spend the night and see the stars, is so
rejuvenating,'' Wagner said. ``Being out in nature this way makes
me happy.'' &QL;

JUDGE BACKS SAN FRANCISCO EQUAL BENEFITS LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREGORY LEWIS and LARRY D. HATFIELD  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A federal judge, ruling in two cases involving
San Francisco's equal benefits ordinance, has backed the landmark
law that requires companies doing business with the city to provide
the same non-health benefits to employees with unmarried partners
as they provide to married couples.
</P>
<P>
   The rulings were cheered by city officials and gay and lesbian
politicians and activists, but the lawyers for a company in one of
the cases pledged an appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is in fact a great, great day,'' Mayor Willie Brown said
of Thursday's ruling. ``Efforts to remove discrimination ... are
alive and well and have been upheld in San Francisco and it says to
the rest of the world, `Get with it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Judge Claudia Wilkens ruled in Oakland Thursday that United
Airlines must provide the same non-health benefits to domestic
partners as it does for employee spouses. She also ruled that an
Ohio contractor choosing to ignore the city's domestic partner
ordinance was not entitled to a city contract.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides, however, claimed victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very good spin doctors, but (city officials) are
trying to cover a loss,'' said Sam Singer, spokesman for the Air
Transport Association, which sued San Francisco on behalf of United
and its other airline members. ``We're pleased with the judge's
ruling. We won 99 percent of what we wanted to win. And on the 1
percent we didn't get, we're going to see what steps we'll take
next.''
</P>
<P>
   The Air Transport Association, the trade group for the nation's
big airlines, contended that only the federal government has the
authority to force requirements on the air industry.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkens upheld in April 1998 the basic tenets of the law, but
said airlines enjoy a special status. She ruled that the airlines
did not have to provide health and pension benefits because those
matters can be dictated only by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   But the question of whether they had to provide other benefits
was left open until Thursday's ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Carol B. Hallett, ATA president and chief executive, said:
``This ruling allows San Francisco's local law to interfere with a
nationwide collective bargaining process. ... We will examine all
of our options, including the possibility of an appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Center for Law and Justice, founded by the Rev. Pat
Robertson and the lawyers for the Ohio company, S.D. Myers, said it
would appeal the decision. S.D. Myers maintains transformers at a
city power plant.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ruling changes corporate America by creating a culture
shift that legitimizes same-sex relationships,'' said Jay Sekulow,
a lawyer for the ACLJ. ``The ordinance redefines the institution of
marriage and conflicts with the moral values of most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Sheehy, a gay activist who helped shape San Francisco's
law, said activists would continue urging consumers to boycott
United until it complies with the law.
</P>
<P>
   For the airlines to continue to fight, Sheehy said, ``defies
reason, is irrational and it's homophobic to continue with the
lawsuit. That's not a pretty picture: United Airlines dancing with
Pat Robertson all the way to the Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's Equal Benefits Ordinance went into effect June
1, 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night of March 24, as NATO bombs began falling over
Yugoslavia, Hani Hoxha said he saw black-masked Serbs swaggering
through Djakovica, shooting, cutting throats and burning houses.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 in the morning, about nine miles east, a tank pulled up
and parked in front of Isuf Zhenigi's farmhouse in the village of
Bela Crkva. At daybreak the slaughter began there.
</P>
<P>
   That day, in Pec, 22 miles to the northwest, and Prizren, 15
miles to the southeast, Serbian forces began firing wildly and
burning Albanian-owned shops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Pristina, about 44 miles to the northeast, Serbian
operatives driving military jeeps and private cars set fire to
Albanian-owned cafes, clinics and the printing presses of Kosova
Sot, an independent Albanian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   These were the opening assaults in what quickly became a drive
to empty the city, the provincial and intellectual center of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   As it began, the Serbs' purge of more than 1 million ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo seemed from the outside to be a random
kaleidoscope of violence. But a reconstruction of the early days of
the operation _ based on interviews with scores of refugees, and
with senior officials in Washington and at NATO, as well as on a
computer analysis of reported horrors from many sources _ shows
that it was meticulously organized and aimed, from the outset, at
expelling huge numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   From this reporting over the last nine weeks, it is possible to
see the design behind the roster of atrocities cited by the U.N.
war crimes tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, in its indictment on
Thursday of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four of
his top officials for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   With specific charges including the wave of killings in
Djakovica and its surrounding villages and the forced expulsion of
Albanians from Pristina, the indictment accuses the Serbian forces
of a ``campaign of terror'' that ``intentionally created an
atmosphere of fear and oppression through the use of force, threats
of force and acts of violence'' in order to drive out Kosovo's
majority Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have insisted in recent months that most of the
refugees fled Kosovo because of NATO's bombing. Western officials,
however, say the plans were drawn up by the Yugoslav army and the
Interior Ministry of the Serbian Republic and carried out, under a
single command, by a variety of Serbian forces acting in concert:
regular soldiers, the blue-uniformed Special Police of the Interior
Ministry and the dreaded private armies of ultra-nationalist
warlords who had achieved a reputation for bloodlust and looting in
Bosnia and Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was a harsh refinement of a campaign last summer by
Interior Ministry forces that failed to crush Albanian rebels. It
was put into effect after a mounting campaign of terrorism on both
sides, including the ambushing of Serbian police patrols and
officials by the Albanians and several instances of the kidnapping
and killing of Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It seems evident that the operation had at least two major goals
from its inception: crushing the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and
permanently changing the ethnic balance of Kosovo by driving out as
many Albanians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hounding more than a million Albanians from their homes
accomplished two purposes for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   First, it removed the guerrillas' base of support and cover.
With the Serbs controlling the borders and scorched earth along the
highways, they could isolate and mop up the Kosovo Liberation Army
in the forests and mountains. Young men viewed as potential rebel
recruits were singled out and either killed or removed to an
unknown fate.
</P>
<P>
   In the longer run, depopulating Kosovo defused a demographic
time bomb for the Serbs: Albanians already made up 90 percent of
the population and were reproducing at a far higher rate than the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although killing and torching were extensive, the Serbs' most
potent weapon was fear. The seemingly random, flamboyantly public
killings of the first few days meant that as the campaign
progressed, all it took was a handful of armed, masked Serbs to
drive thousands of people from their homes, rob them and send them
off in caravans, their houses in flames.
</P>
<P>
   Independent accounts indicate that there have been killings of
from a dozen to roughly 100 people in more than 40 places. The
State Department now puts the death toll at 4,600, a number only
likely to increase as more is known. But even that statistic
indicates a goal of depopulation rather than extermination; it is
low by comparison with the ethnic cleansing of Bosnia, where in one
massacre alone, at Srebrenica, the Serbs were accused of killing
7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   To amplify the effect of the killings in Kosovo, Serbs gunned
down Albanians in the streets and in their homes, sometimes at
random, sometimes from target lists. Bodies have been mutilated,
with ears cut off, eyes gouged out or a cross, a Serbian symbol,
carved into foreheads or chests.
</P>
<P>
   In many places, the Serbs compounded the fear with humiliation.
Older men were beaten for wearing the white conical hats of the
Albanian mountains or were forced to make the Serbian Orthodox
three-fingered sign. One refugee convoy passed row on row of white
conical hats set atop fence posts.
</P>
<P>
   Two months into the campaign now, the terror has been
devastatingly effective and virtually unhampered by NATO's bombing,
judging by accounts from refugees, relief workers and officials
from international agencies, NATO and the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
   By early May, 90 percent of all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had
been expelled from their homes, the State Department says, 900,000
driven across the province's borders and 500,000 more displaced
inside Kosovo. Most of those remaining have been chased into hiding
in forests and mountains, huddled together in villages penned in by
snipers, or captured, their fate unknown.
</P>
<P>
   More than 500 villages have been emptied and burned, according
to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   And there has been another element to the pattern: The Serbs
made every effort to ensure that those who fled abroad would not
come back. Almost universally, refugees reported that they had been
not only robbed but also systematically stripped of all identity
papers, rendering them, in effect, stateless nonpersons, at least
in the eyes of the Serbian government, and making it difficult for
them ever to return home. Even the license plates of their cars _
the Serbs kept the good ones _ were methodically unscrewed at the
borders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not your land _ you will never see it again,'' the
refugees were told over and over. ``Go to your NATO _ go to your
Clinton.''

THE AFTERMATH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30, 1999)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   The China story is being explored in all its dimensions _
military, industrial, cultural, historical _ except the one in
which it is best understood: as the aftermath of the GOP's
impeachment campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It almost seems in bad taste to bring it up.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Cal.), who led the Congressional
committee that produced the long-awaited report on Chinese
espionage that was published last week, is not the most vociferous
of the GOP leadership. But the Orange Country Republican is among
the most conservative.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't make him a villain. Indeed, until he became
embroiled in the ill-fated crusade that was the ``Contract with
America'' and the follow-on fiasco of the impeachment campaign, Cox
was one of the most imaginative legislators on the Hill.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran staffer in the Reagan White House, he was first
elected to Congress in 1988, and managed to eliminate the federal
helium stockpiling program and close down the Interstate Commerce
Commission _ with Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) as co-sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   But the portrayal of the work of the House Select Comittee that
Cox led as ``bipartisan'' is seriously misleading. Every step taken
by parties on both sides of the investigation was played with an
eye toward next year's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Much is at stake, including Chinese membership in the World
Trade Organization and its further integration into the system of
global markets. Sen. Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) last week
forecast ``real problems'' with any trade agreement.
</P>
<P>
   True, four Democrats on the committee signed the report on U.S.
National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the
People's Republic of China. President Clinton praised the
committee's ``careful'' work. Nuclear secrets are serious business,
after all.
</P>
<P>
   And the sections of the report that deal with the activities of
the Chinese ``princelings'' _ children of the founders of the
communist party _ make fascinating reading. Wang Jun, chairman of
the China International Trade and Investment Corp., is son of the
late Chinese president Wang Zhen. Liu Shaoying, vice president of
China Aerospace International Holdings, which provides satellite
launch services, is the daughter of China's most powerful military
leader. Both were contributors to the Democratic Part in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``Princelings such as Wang and Liu present a unique technology
transfer threat because their multiple connections enable them to
move freely around the world and among the different bureaucracies
(in China,)'' the report states.
</P>
<P>
   The more the world understands about the relative handful of
powerful families that are China's characteristic form of
industrial organization, the better. Likewise, their determination
to acquire prevailing technologies by fair means and foul.
</P>
<P>
   But the US House of Representatives, which is in the midst of
its most bitter session in 130 years, is hardly the place to
examine the deepest and most perplexing issues of national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The National Academy of Sciences wasn't involved in attempts to
assess the damage. Nor were attempts made to enlist the scientific
community in an evenhanded appraisal of China's ``make-or-buy''
decisions in building its nucleaer arsenal. Instead, the presidents
of the national Academies of Science and Engineering and the
Institutes of Medicine issued a statement of alarm at what they see
as an unwarranted crackdown on scientific openness.
</P>
<P>
   The current proceedings began about a year ago ``as a gleam in
Newt Gingrich's eye,'' as Jeff Gerth and Tim Weiner wrote in The
New York Times last week, though in fact it was Gerth's stories
about technique-sharing by US companies using Chinese rockets to
launch their communications satellites that attracted the
then-House Speaker's attention. To lead the investigation, Gingrich
chose Cox.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation shifted into high gear in October as the
Select Committee learned more about a history of lax
counterintelligence in four presidential administrations.
</P>
<P>
   After the impeachment trial concluded, the China story continued
to be prosecuted mainly in the press. If anyone has any doubts
about partisanship, let them look to what happened to John Deutch
in April.
</P>
<P>
   After Energy Secretary Bill Richardson tapped the former
director of Central intelligence to review the national
laboratories' foreign visitors program, Deutch was forced to
quietly withdraw by news leaks that he had mishandled classified
data while serving as director _ by taking work home.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation is expected to clear the MIT professor of
anything more than mild carelessness _ but not to restore him to a
position of public authority in the matter before the Congress. The
charges against a distinguished scientist-bureaucrat are presumably
another episode from a revolution on the eve of entering its
Thermidorean phase.
</P>
<P>
   When the story of the 1990s is written, the events of the year
1989 will be its starting point. That was the year that the Berlin
Wall came down, that communism capitulated to capitalism, that
history was said (by the proponents of its inner logic) to have
``ended.'' How many ways were momentarily lost in that sudden and
unexpected peace!
</P>
<P>
   Especially the Republicans. The party has spent most of the
1990s engaged in bitter internecine warfare, achieving solidarity
only briefly, and probably disasterously, in a common hatred of
Bill Clinton. As the conservative political commentator Andrew
Sullivan has written, ``They wouldn't take yes for an answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the GOP is searching for a new foe. Strategists William
Kristol and Robert Kagan are urging Republican candidates to adopt
a strategy of bold confrontation with China, similar to Ronald
Reagan's 1981 ``Star Wars'' challenge to the Soviet Union, in the
expectation that Chinese communism too would quickly collapse.
</P>
<P>
   The next election is only 16 months away. Soon history will be
starting up again.

   DJAKOVICA: EMPTYING A CITY Of ALL BUT BODIES
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs began attacking Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds on
March 19, but their attack kicked into high gear on March 24, the
night NATO began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica was one of the first major targets.
</P>
<P>
   A look at a map explains the strategic significance of this city
of 60,000, which was populated almost entirely by Albanians. The
city and its surrounding chain of villages, stretching between
Junik and Prizren, lie in the shadow of the Accursed Mountains, a
remote, rugged range running along the border between Albania and
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army maintains its camps and staging areas
on the Albanian side of the mountains. A Western military officer,
sketching out a map, slashed a series of lines down the mountains
into the valleys around Djakovica, indicating rebel infiltration
routes. Clearly, he said, the Serbs want to empty the area of
ethnic Albanians, fortify and control it to block the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Those who survived it say they will never forget the focused
fury of the hundreds of Serbian forces who attacked Djakovica on
March 24, hours after the first NATO bombs fell.
</P>
<P>
   ``A group of six men with masks came, and they took the women
and children out of the houses, and they burned the houses,'' said
Mehdi Halilaj, a 27-year-old economist, recalling that first night.
``The first night they burned 50 or more shops and about 35 houses.
They were helped by the police.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They took 11 men and killed them, and some they cut up their
bodies,'' he continued, speaking in English.``They left their
bodies in the street for everybody to see, and nobody dared take
them away. The city was very scared from Wednesday on.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman called Ardina, who asked that her family name not be
used, said: ``The second night we saw their lights, cars, trucks,
an armored vehicle. They started shooting like I have never heard
in my life. I thought everyone was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky,'' she said, speaking in English. ``All the
houses around us were burned and people killed. That night killed
two brothers were, a man about 40 burned in his house and my
sister-in-law with Down's syndrome, they burned her in her house.
She is dead. There was a body on the street, nobody could touch
that body all day long.''
</P>
<P>
   As in many places, the Serbs were guided to the most affluent
and influential families, the people who helped give the Albanian
community its cohesion. It is not known whether this was on
instruction, or perhaps motivated by the greed, or grudges, of
individual attackers, but one effect may be to damage Albanian
prospects for rebuilding their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this block, they burned a lot of houses,'' Ardina said.
``They were the best houses in town, the rich people,'' she said.
``There was a Serb from the city guiding them. He told them: `Burn
this house. Kill this one.' Everyone in Djakovica knows him. They
killed a large number of intellectuals, especially doctors. They
shot a prominent surgeon, Dr. Izet Hima. They went for the rich
people, to steal their television sets or whatever they see, burn
their houses and kill them.''
</P>
<P>
   From the first days, the speed and scale of the Serbian campaign
were stunning, even by the violent standards of Balkan wars as
waves of paramilitary thugs, special policemen, regular soldiers
and armed Serbian civilians swept through region after region of
Kosovo, acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The burning and killing in the center of Djakovica went on for
three weeks beginning in the narrow streets and small Ottoman-style
houses of the Old Town, and then moved on to the newer high-rise
buildings in the more modern section.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning they were just burning at night,'' Ardina
said. ``But after a week they were burning all day long, starting
at 9 o'clock in the morning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There were selected homes burned in the beginning, after that
it was all the buildings,'' Dr. Flori Bakalli said, speaking in
English. ``There were special police, local police, paramilitaries,
and some of them civilians, armed. They were burning the houses and
they started to scream like a wolf _ `woo, woo' _ and they shot
people in the back. Near my house there were five of them I saw
myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Kosovar Albanians moved from house to house and apartment to
apartment, moving in with relatives and friends, they said, to stay
ahead of the advancing Serbs. In the old town, where many of the
dwellings were built close together, Albanians broke holes through
the walls so they could run from one home to another to escape if
the Serbs knocked on the door in the night.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody, children included, slept fitfully in their clothes
and shoes, ready to run. Someone always had to be awake, peering
through a corner of a window or the peepholes of steel gates to see
if the Serbs were coming.
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha, a dignified white-haired man, took a reporter's notebook
to sketch his family's compound and their futile attempts to elude
the Serbian attackers who killed and burned their way through the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from one house to another and finally to my older
daughter Tringa's house,'' he said. ``That night I saw an old man,
about 80, killed and burned and a 15-year old boy as well. We
stayed there for four nights, and the fifth night the Serbs came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around 12 o'clock, and we didn't have any electricity,
when they came, about 30 people, paramilitary, V.J. and Serbs from
Djakovica who had been given uniforms and guns,'' Hoxha said, using
the initials by which the Yugoslav army is known. ``We were
sleeping. My son-in-law was watching through the hole in the steel
gate and came and told us to wake up.''
</P>
<P>
   They had parked a car sideways across the gate to block it, but
the Serbs pushed through with a heavier vehicle. Thinking that the
Serbs were looking only for men of military age, Hoxha and two
other men climbed out a second-story window, dropped onto a wall
and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next seven hours hiding in the narrow space between
two buildings, squeezed between the concrete walls, listening to
shouts and screams and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning he came back to the compound and found the bodies
of everyone who had been left behind, some of the bodies burned.
Later he said he had learned that the Serbs had first shot his
15-year-old daughter, Flaka, in front of her mother, then the older
daughter, Tringa. His wife pleaded with them not to kill the
children, but then they killed her. One of his granddaughters,
Shihana, a spunky girl of 6, ran away and tried to hide in a
closet, but they killed her there and set fire to the closet.
</P>
<P>
   After he explained all this, he put his head in his hands and
cried.
</P>
<P>
   Next door, in the Caka family house, 20 people were hiding in
the basement, when the Serb forces broke in. They shot 18 people in
the back of the head. A 10-year-old boy, Dren Caka, was somehow
only wounded in the left arm, and escaped by pretending to be dead,
and later gave his account to reporters at the medical tent set up
at the Morini border crossing. After the Serbs left, he said, he
managed to slip out a window, but he could not take his 2-year-old
sister with him, and she was burned alive when the Serbs torched
the house. It was he who witnessed the killing of Hoxha's family.
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of the assault, more than 100 boys _ presumably
regarded as potential Kosovo Liberation Army recruits _ were
captured, refugees said, and taken to a sports center. No one knows
what happened to them.
</P>
<P>
   In just seven days, March 30 to April 5, some 51,880 people were
herded on foot, according to records of the U.N. high commissioner
for refugees, from Djakovica to a tiny remote border crossing in
the mountains called Qafar-e-Prushit. The way looks like a road on
a map, but it really becomes just a muddy footpath up the steep
climb, which can be traveled only on foot because vehicles would
set off the mines the Serbs had planted. They were city people in
city shoes, and they pushed the sick and elderly along with them in
wheelbarrows.
</P>
<P>
   As Djakovica suffered, other Serbs were at work nearby purging a
wide area they regarded as a Kosovo Liberation Army highway.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare account by one of the Serbs, a captured officer
described to NATO interrogators how his unit had descended on the
town of Pec, with specific orders to empty it of tens of thousands
of Albanians and burn their houses and shops. A nearby village, he
said, received even rougher treatment, with about 70 men rounded up
and shot dead.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the region's villages, Bela Crkva (Bellacrkva in
Albanian), on March 25, soldiers and special policemen torched the
homes and farm buildings and killed at least 62 people, most of
them gunned down with automatic weapons in a stream bend.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just started shooting,'' Zheniqi, a survivor, said in an
interview. ``The dead bodies behind me pushed me over a cliff and
into the stream. I was lucky because all the dead bodies fell on
top of me.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a series of mass killings over the next few days
along a seven-mile stretch of villages in the rolling hills,
including Celina, Pirane, Krush-e-Vogel (called Mala Krusa in
Serbian) and Krush-e-Mahde (Velika Krusa), where Bekim Duraku
remembered, life was so ``beautiful, if someone offered to take me
to the United States, I wouldn't have gone.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, the third day of the NATO bombing, the idyllic life
ended in one of the most well-documented of the mass killings,
including an amateur videotape of the bodies. Serbian forces
stormed through the village shooting down people in several areas,
burning some bodies, digging a mass grave with a backhoe for others
and leaving some lying in piles on the ground.

   SERB STRATEGY: CREATING A RELIEF CRISIS
</P>
<P>
   The violent emptying of the Djakovica region had a specific
military purpose: cutting off the Kosovo Liberation Army supply
lines. The Serbs followed it up by planting more mines,
strengthening their forces along the border and mounting raids into
Albania.
</P>
<P>
   But in a long stretch of villages, towns and cities across
Kosovo _ places either close to the border or on main
transportation routes _ there were similar, if less intensely
concentrated, outbursts of killing and burning in those same days
with another aim: driving out the majority Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   How it worked is readily discerned by comparing the refugee
figures kept at the Albanian, Macedonian and Montenegrin borders
with a map of Kosovo. What the comparison shows is how areas close
to the border were cleared first, often by wild bursts of killings
that served as an example. This cleared transportation routes that
facilitated the hounding out of people from other villages, who
gathered in the main town of a region, and from the cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeping his hands over a map in broad arcs across the major
roadways, Fron Nazi, an Albanian-American scholar heading up a
major human rights study and in touch with both refugees and the
rebels, demonstrated how the Serbian strategy was apparent: first
to empty the population centers and control that scorched earth,
then to isolate the rebel fighters in the forests where they could
be contained, squeezed and even starved out.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the refugees over the borders, NATO intelligence experts
believe, served another purpose: overwhelming NATO troops stationed
in Macedonia with an unmanageable relief crisis, calculating that
the task of feeding, housing and caring for hundreds of thousands
of refugees would consume the alliance's energies and divert it
from preparing a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first use of a weapon like this in modern
warfare,'' a NATO intelligence officer said. ``It was like sending
the cattle against the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Accounts by thousands of refugees bear a striking sameness as
they describe Serbian gunmen bursting into their homes, threatening
to kill if the Albanians do not give up jewelry, of seeing
relatives or neighbors killed. Almost every Albanian interviewed
begins by telling the exact time the Serbs arrived. But after days
of hiding or plodding along in refugee columns, they often could
not remember what day it was.
</P>
<P>
   In many accounts, it is possible to discern a division of labor
among the Serbian attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the Yugoslav army, usually the Pristina corps of the
third army, surrounded an area, shelling it with tanks, artillery
or Katyusha rockets. Then the police, local Serbs who were
sometimes reservists, and the paramilitaries moved in for the
close-in dirty work, going block by block, house by house, pounding
on doors, demanding money, and often shooting people on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   After the door-to-door terror, the military moved in to herd the
people out, either on foot or tractor, or sometimes on trains and
buses, the refugees say.
</P>
<P>
   The Pristina corps, in close conjunction with the blue-uniformed
Serbian Interior Ministry troops, cleared transit routes. As the
flow of refugees accelerated, regular soldiers in green camouflage
were deployed at key intersections to control movement.
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it was a tightly ordered, coordinated campaign,
from the artillery that shelled villages, to the masked gunmen who
killed, looted and spread terror, to the armored cars and lines of
troops who chased people hiding in the woods to corral them in
larger central towns for eventual expulsion. In some cases, human
rights workers interviewing refugees say, different groups of
gunmen were distinguished by different colored armbands or
headbands.
</P>
<P>
   Even the wild-appearing masked irregulars _ Arkan's Tigers, the
White Eagles and others _ were under tight control, NATO experts
said, and reported to the intelligence arm of the Yugoslav Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in there with Belgrade's blessing,'' a NATO
intelligence official said. ``What they would be allowed to do is
up to the local commander.''
</P>
<P>
   The level of violence varied widely, depending on the whim of
the local Serbian official in charge, or even individual gunmen. An
international official visited a woman of about 50 in a hospital
with both of her nipples hacked off.
</P>
<P>
   ``All she wanted was to tell her brother in Srbica what
happened,'' he said, referring to a town in north-central Kosovo.
``How could I tell her Srbica doesn't exist anymore?''
</P>
<P>
   Some people were clearly targeted, particularly men age 15 to
50, suspected or potential rebel fighters, and those who worked for
or rented space to the observer teams from the Office of
Cooperation and Security in Europe. One key political activist who
was a bridge between Kosovar factions, Fehmi Agani, was pulled off
a refugee train outside Pristina by the Serbian police and killed.
There were reports by human rights groups that doctors had been
singled out.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence on the incidence of rape is less complete. President
Clinton and other Western leaders often charge that there has been
organized rape. But while it is clear that there have been rapes,
accounts that are available do not resolve whether they were
systematic. Rape was not mentioned in the indictment by the war
crimes tribunal.
</P>
<P>
   But for all the signs of a logic behind the purge of Kosovo,
many of the individual episodes _ including the gunning down of
women and children _ seem inexplicable in military terms, except
that the very unpredictability of the savagery added the powerful
fear that drove the exodus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what's so terrifying _ there are no rules,'' said an
official in close touch with the international war crimes
investigation in The Hague. ``It's so random. One set of people
might be spared, and the people next door do the same thing and are
all killed. There was a man who gave the police 10 marks and they
let go, and another who gave them 250, so they thought he must have
more and killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time, three weeks into the campaign, that the Serbs came
to drive the ethnic Albanians out of the north-central city of
Mitrovica, said Jacques Franquin, a U.N. official, it was enough
for them to gun down an old woman and a teen-age girl in one
neighborhood for everyone around to quietly board buses and be
directed out of town through traffic control points.

   PRISTINA: `IN EVERY HOUSE THEY BROKE THE DOORS'
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the knock on Bajrum Kelmendi's door came at 1 a.m.
on the night NATO started bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will kill you if you do not open in five seconds,'' the
Serbian police shouted, Kelmendi's wife, Nedima, recalled. Five
uniformed policemen burst in, forced the family to lie on the floor
and demanded money, one warning, ``If you are lying, I will kill
the little children.''
</P>
<P>
   They took away Kelmendi, a well-known human rights lawyer, and
his two sons, age 30 and 16. They told the elder son, Kastriut,
``Kiss your wife and two children because this will be the last
time you see them,'' the elder Mrs. Kelmendi said.
</P>
<P>
   The family found the three bodies by the side of the road two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Djakovica region, the Serbs had a clear military goal: to
cut off the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Pristina, like the other cities the Serbs emptied, was not a
rebel stronghold. Indeed, in previous outbursts of fighting in
Kosovo, villagers often went to stay in the city until things
calmed down.
</P>
<P>
   Born in the Drenica valley, the Kosovo Liberation Army was
largely a rural movement and tied in with the traditional clans,
although it did begin to pick up urban sympathy with a Serbian
crackdown in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Within the divided Kosovar society, Pristina was the base of the
nonviolent leader Ibrahim Rugova and his Democratic League of
Kosovo, whose tactics won the praise of Western leaders _ mainly
because they did not cause trouble. Among the city's educated
elite, there had been suspicion and criticism of the Kosovo
Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the Serbian aim appears to have been depopulation.
</P>
<P>
   And from some of the targets chosen, like Kelmendi and Agani,
the political activist pulled from a train and killed, it also
seems clear that the Serbs set out to destroy the Albanian
political class and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Rugova's Democratic League was burned down on
March 24, and a guard was shot and killed by the police at the
newspaper Koha Ditore, whose publisher, Veton Surroi, had been a
delegate at the talks in Rambouillet, France, early this year. The
next night, the warehouse of the largest Kosovar charity, the
Mother Teresa Society, was burned. On March 28, the house of Rexhep
Qosja, a prominent academic, head of the Albanian Democratic
Movement and another member of the Rambouillet delegation, was
torched.
</P>
<P>
   The first few days of the NATO bombing were marked in Pristina
by nightly arson and bomb attacks on Albanian homes, shops and
businesses, refugees recall. Police cars raced through the night,
amid explosions and gunfire that terrified the Albanian residents.
Some people, mostly middle-class residents who had cars, began
fleeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, while the telephone was working, friends were
calling and telling us this house was burning, or they arrested
this guy and so on,'' said Ali Muriqi, 34, of the engineering
faculty at Pristina University. ``They were talking about
intellectuals. Then at 6:30 in the evening, the electricity went
off. Then the movement started, the police going around with
weapons.'' Muriqi fled Pristina by car on March 29.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, in a chilling display of force, the Serbs began
systematically emptying Pristina's neighborhoods _ Vranjevci,
Tashlixhe, Dardania, Dragodan _ marching the Albanians along
streets lined with gantlets of masked gunmen draped with weaponry,
refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   By the tens of thousands _ in an operation that required
extensive advance logistical preparations _ they were herded into
the city's railroad station overnight. At dawn some were packed
aboard trains _ one refugee said he was among 28 people in a
compartment meant for eight _ bound for Macedonia. Others were
loaded on buses and even a refrigerator truck that normally
transports sides of beef and dumped near the Albanian border to
leave the country on foot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked out into the garden, and there were three people with
black masks and big guns,'' said Suzana Krusnigi, collapsing in
tears as she crossed the Albanian border with her elderly parents
the next day.
</P>
<P>
   ``In every house they broke the doors,'' she said, speaking in
English. ``When we went out, everyone was in the street walking
between men with black masks and big guns.''
</P>
<P>
   The forced exodus of Pristina gathered momentum in April. When
the Serbs marched Ramadan Osmani and his family from their home to
the railroad station in early April, he said, it was so crowded
they had to wait 12 hours for a train to Macedonia, where they
slept in a field for six days before finding a space at the Bojane
refugee camp.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethnic Albanians tried to stay in Pristina, living a
cat-and-mouse existence after eluding the first wave of Serbian
looting and expulsions, hiding in other people's homes or fleeing
to nearby villages. Fearing discovery, they left always by back
doors, made little noise, lit candles only in rooms where heavy
blankets covered the windows, and sent old people out to buy food.
</P>
<P>
   Hafiz Berisha and his family evaded being expelled from Pristina
for two months, hiding in five different homes. But last Sunday,
the 70-year-old retired policeman was standing in line to buy bread
when Serbian policemen walked up and pulled his cousin and a
neighbor, both men under 30, out of the line and hustle them away.
Berisha said he had seen two people gunned down in front of him and
40 bodies in a mass grave, but the sight of the helpless men being
led away was too much.
</P>
<P>
   He fled the next day.
</P>
<P>
   Luljeta Jarina, 19, and her father, Ramiz, who had worked in the
personnel department of a mining company, were among those who went
into hiding. Once when she ventured, out of boredom, into the
garden behind her home, a Serbian sniper shot at her, she recalled.
And each night, Serbian soldiers and policemen cruised the streets
of the city, firing their Kalashnikovs wildly into the air. Just
this Wednesday, the Serbs rounded up 18 men, including her father,
at gunpoint. All but her father and two others were taken away, to
an unknown fate, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited two months, hoping something would happen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they found a Serb cruising the city in a bus _ a new
entrepreneur driving refugees to the border for 20 to 100 German
marks apiece, about $10 to $55 _ and fled their native land.

POLITICIANS' RIVALRIES ARE UNCOVERED BY BIG DIG SPAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the end, it seems the digs had very little to do
with the Big Dig itself.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, members of the Massachusetts congressional
delegation were seizing on a federal auditor's report that accused
state officials of improperly funneling $150 million of federal
money into a trust fund for the Central Artery project _ money the
congressmen said should have been spent on the state's decaying
roads and bridges. State officials countered that the trust fund
was an innovative self-insurance plan to protect the Big Dig from
catastrophic losses.
</P>
<P>
   But as the charges and countercharges were being sorted out, it
appeared to be mainly a war of personalities and personal issues,
not to mention political grudges from both parties.
</P>
<P>
   And by Thursday _ as Massachusetts Turnpike Authority head James
Kerasiotis fired off a nasty letter to Representative James P.
McGovern _ the fight seemed to be as much the product of a
dysfunctional relationship between the Democratic congressional
delegation and the Republican governor as about a highway project
that is hardly half complete.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please, Jim, stop whining,'' read Kerasiotis's letter, which
was immediately distributed to the entire delegation. ``More
importantly, find a constructive way to act out.''
</P>
<P>
   This week's incident follows another skirmish between
Massachusetts' elected officials. Two weeks ago, Senator John F.
Kerry and McGovern were caught circulating a letter that complained
about the way Governor Paul Cellucci was talking about them.
</P>
<P>
   And yet both public spats _ as well as a series of more private
ones between Democrats in Washington and Republicans in Boston _
seem to have much deeper roots, entangled in the nebulous world of
infrastructure appropriations and the politicians who take credit
for them.
</P>
<P>
   The ongoing conflict stems from a single source, according to
congressional and gubernatorial aides: last year's federal
transportation bill, in which Massachusetts saw its highway funding
slashed, providing the state's tiny Republican Party a giant hammer
with which to beat Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the bill, Cellucci has held the delegation
responsible for fiscal woes in Boston. Boston Republicans have
gleefully used it as a symbol of the ``cloutless Democratic
delegation.''
</P>
<P>
   And the delegation's Democrats, still smarting from their slide
into the minority in the House in 1994, have gotten agitated. They
have tried to puncture the argument time and again, arguing that
Massachusetts was bound to lose money after the Big Dig stopped
receiving new funds, that the state lost less money than expected,
that it still took in more federal funds than most other states.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained. They wrote letters. They said that they
were frustrated by the arrogance of the Cellucci administration,
and said that state officials refused to work with them and would
not stop torturing them with an inaccurate assessment of how they
did their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   This week, then, seemed to be payback.
</P>
<P>
   The transportation audit _ titled ``Overpayments of Premiums for
the Central Artery Project's Owner-Controlled Insurance Project'' _
was performed for the Federal Highway Administration by the
inspector general of the US Department of Transportation. It was
given to congressmen Tuesday, and was circulated among reporters
Wednesday. By Thursday, an arcane audit had sparked a full-scale
political war.
</P>
<P>
   The state set up an insurance company that invested in corporate
bonds as a means of building up a trust fund that could be used to
cover major losses during Big Dig construction. According to the
audit, $150 million in federal money was improperly used to buy the
bonds.
</P>
<P>
   State Republicans said they were simply using a creative method
that generated income, which would not only insure the Big Dig, but
end up saving taxpayers as much as $1 billion over the life of the
project.
</P>
<P>
   Kerasiotes's letter said the Treasury Department endorsed the
concept in 1995. And even the executive director of the FHA,
Anthony Kane, disagreed with the report and said the inspector
general had misunderstood the purpose of the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Some delegation members stayed quiet _ afraid the damaging
report could be used during the congressional appropriations
process as proof Massachusetts does not deserve more funding.
</P>
<P>
   But others, according to McGovern, got ``a little excited.''
Although he noted the audit was not commissioned by the delegation,
he did not altogether deny his rage was connected to a longtime
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the delegation trying to pick a fight,'' McGovern
said. ``We have been incredibly patient and silent for a long time
_ some say too long. The reality now is, it's time to set the
record straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Moakley agreed. ``It's always the same thing,'' he said.
``Cellucci and his minions go around saying there's not enough
money because Congress didn't get us enough money. Here, he's got
$150 million in a slush fund.''
</P>
<P>
   A Cellucci spokesman indicated Thursday that the spat was not
going to immediately disappear. Asked why the audit turned into
such a contentious issue, Jose Juves said: ``Some members are still
upset they were unable to secure Massachusetts' fair share of
highway funds.''

 &HT;    AGL appointment raises merger questions
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The recent appointment of Robert S. Jepson, who has
bought and sold a number of companies, to the board of AGL
Resources Inc. raises the question: Is a merger or acquisition in
the future for the parent of Atlanta Gas Light Co.?
</P>
<P>
   Walter M. Higgins, AGL's board chairman, president and chief
executive, said Jepson was selected because of his general business
expertise and experience with mergers and acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a company, built it into something more valuable ...
and then sold it as the logical extension of its future,'' Higgins
said in an interview this week. He was referring to Jepson's tenure
as CEO of Savannah-based Kuhlman Corp., which was sold to
Borg-Warner Automotive earlier this year for $750 million in cash,
stock and debt.
</P>
<P>
   Mergers and acquisitions are ``certainly one of our issues,''
Higgins said. But he denied that Jepson's appointment signals that
a particular deal is at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no relationship between him coming on the board with
any activities the company may be engaged in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Donato J. Eassey, a Houston-based utilities analyst with Merrill
Lynch Global Securities, called Jepson's appointment, announced by
AGL last week, ``a very appropriate step in today's environment''
in the fast-consolidating utility industry that has seen 20 major
mergers since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to get bigger or be part of somebody else,'' Eassey
said. ``If they (AGL) can't get bigger themselves, they'll be part
of another entity.''
</P>
<P>
   Higgins has been quite forthright, from the moment he arrived at
AGL from a Nevada utility last year, about the possibility the
company might acquire or merge with other companies or be acquired
itself. If such steps would ``create value for our shareholders,
then we're going to do it,'' he said in February 1998, following
his first AGL shareholder meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins said he first met Jepson when they served together on
the board of Washington Water Co. several years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jepson is currently chairman and CEO of Savannah-based Jepson
Associates, a private investment company, and CEO of Jepson
Vineyards, a Ukiah, Calif., wine maker.
</P>
<P>
   Jepson took over Kuhlman Corp. in 1993, moved the industrial
equipment manufacturer from Lexington, Ky., to Savannah, acquired
six other companies and grew profits 37 percent a year before
selling the company in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Jepson was founder and CEO of Chicago-based Jepson Corp. from
1983 until the manufacturer of airliner seats, playground equipment
and air conditioners was sold in 1989 to Great American Management
&AMP; Investment Inc. for $220 million.

SOME EXPERTS SAY DAMAGE FROM CHINA'S NUCLEAR SPYING IS OVERBLOWN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (For release Sunday, May 30)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite dire consequences predicted by a House
report on China's theft of coveted U.S. nuclear secrets, several
arms control experts say Beijing is years away from fielding new
weapons and still will be no match for the massive American
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in the surreal logic of nuclear politics the United
States may actually be more secure if China develops new atomic
weapons capable of surviving an attack because that would reduce
the chance that either side would launch a preemptive first strike,
these experts argue.
</P>
<P>
   But such views were drowned out last week by cries of alarm
triggered by the 700-page House report of a bipartisan panel of
lawmakers that detailed extensive Chinese espionage over two
decades and lax security at the nation's nuclear weapons
laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   The report said China stole U.S. nuclear warhead designs,
advanced radar know-how and missile-guidance-system-blueprints. It
concluded that an ``insatiable appetite'' for U.S. technology has
allowed China to leap from a 1950s nuclear weapons program to
state-of-the-art designs ``on a par with our own.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics charged that the Clinton administration, which first
learned of the security lapses in 1995, had appeased China and
failed to counter the Chinese spying quickly enough.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats joined in the outcry. Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.,
who cochaired the congressional panel, called the theft ``one of
the worst counterintelligence failures in the nation's history.''
</P>
<P>
   However, another Democrat who served on the panel, Rep. John
Spratt of South Carolina, said that the House report was based on
``worst case'' assumptions. Spratt said that the Chinese ``are not
on a par with the United States,'' but he added that they do have a
``capable'' nuclear force.
</P>
<P>
   While the report said China may have a mobile nuclear missile by
2002, some arms control experts insist that is highly unlikely
given the weapon's history of problems. ``I don't think it's likely
(to be tested) for several years,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a
nuclear weapons analyst with the Carnegie Endowment for
International Peace, a think tank here.
</P>
<P>
   Cirincione noted that the Chinese have had nuclear weapons
capable of striking U.S. cities for more than 30 years. But unlike
the Soviet Union, which placed a top priority on developing
thousands of nuclear warheads, China has not viewed the weapons as
the cornerstone of its security, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``China does not have an aggressive nuclear modernization
program under way, and nuclear weapons have never been a priority''
for its leaders, Cirincione added. ``There is basically nothing for
us to worry about. Even if all the spying allegations are true, the
impact is only marginal.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Norris, a nuclear weapons expert with the Natural
Resources Defense Council, an arms control and environmental
organization, said that ``it usually takes a long, long time for
the Chinese to introduce new nuclear weapons, and when they do,
it's often a disaster.''
</P>
<P>
   Norris pointed to China's failed attempt over the years to
develop a submarine like the U.S. Trident submarine capable of
firing intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) while submerged.
</P>
<P>
   Lisbeth Gronlund, a physicist and arms control expert with the
Union of Concerned Scientists, an anti-nuclear organization, said
Americans need to put the theft of atomic secrets in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``China has fewer than two dozen warheads that can reach the
United States, while the U.S. has more than 6,000 that can hit
China,'' she pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   Some arms control experts also stressed that the theft hasn't
tipped the nuclear scales in China's favor.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Aftergood, a nuclear weapons analyst with the Federation
of American Scientists, a nonpartisan military research
organization, said it was ``manifestly untrue'' that China could
now develop weapons as capable as those in the U.S. arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have also said China hasn't suddenly
leapfrogged and developed a modern nuclear force. In a damage
assessment of the Chinese spying prepared for Congress in April,
the agencies said China still has ``significant deficiencies'' in
its nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date, the aggressive Chinese collection effort has not
resulted in any apparent modernization of their deployed strategic
force or any new nuclear weapons deployment,'' the assessment
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   All of China's ICBMs are in fixed silos, which makes them
vulnerable to attack, while the United States has many missiles in
Trident submarines prowling the ocean floors and virtually
impossible for an enemy to locate.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Intelligence officials say one reason China has sought U.S.
nuclear secrets is that it wants to develop a mobile nuclear
missile to counter those on the Trident subs. Currently, the United
States or Russia could destroy Beijing's entire ICBM force in one
strike.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the spying, these officials say, is that
China sees America's so-called star-wars effort to develop a
nuclear shield against ICBMs as a move that would nullify Beijing's
nuclear deterrent and make it more vulnerable to a first strike
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear strategy that guided the United States and the
former Soviet Union during the Cold War held that the superpowers
weren't likely to start a nuclear war knowing that their enemy's
mobile or submarine-launched missiles would survive and fire back
in retaliation, thus destroying the aggressor.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, some see China's possible development of such a missile
as a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If China has greater confidence in its arsenal, that would
contribute to greater stability with the United States,'' said
Aftergood.

PINEDA HOPING TO PROVE TRINIDAD HAS A GLASS CHIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerty Rico _ Felix Trinidad may have been born and
raised in Puerto Rico, but his chin was made in China. Or at least
it is made of china, which is the one thought that will buoy Hugo
Pineda Saturday night as he steps into the ring at Roberto Clemente
Coliseum to face the undefeated International Boxing Federation
welterweight champion.
</P>
<P>
   There are many who believe Trinidad is the best welterweight in
the world, an opinion supported not only by his 34-0 record but by
his 29 knockouts and 13 successful title defenses since he won the
crown from Maurice Blocker six years ago. There are some who will
go so far as to argue he is the finest pound-for-pound fighter in
the world, a position Trinidad himself favors. Yet although both
positions may be true, Pineda realizes every man has an Achilles'
heel, and Trinidad's is at the end of his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember, Trinidad has been knocked down several times,'' said
Celso Chavez, Pineda's trainer, who notes Trinidad has been down
six times in his career. ``He's not the best at taking a punch, and
Hugo is a hard-hitting boxer. We have a strategy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   That strategy is self-evident. It is to hit Trinidad on the chin
the way Alberto Cortes did and Anthony Stephens did and Yory Boy
Campas did and Oba Carr did and Kevin Lueshing did. Hit him hard
enough to knock him flat.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, Pineda hopes, is that because he has packed the
power to knock out 27 of the 36 men he's beaten and to have dropped
former IBF junior welterweight champion Kostya Tszyu in the first
round of what turned out to be an 11th-round loss three years ago,
he can take it a half-step farther and finish the job five of
Trinidad's other opponents began. He hopes he can not only knock
him down but keep him down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I can knock Trinidad out,'' said Pineda (36-1-1).
``That's my goal, and I am confident of it.''
</P>
<P>
   If he truly is, Pineda is in the minority. It is not surprising
that few people here give Pineda a chance to beat their native son
and that Trinidad scoffs at the notion, but gamblers in Las Vegas
feel the same way. Pineda is a 10-1 underdog to even make it to the
final bell, let alone dethrone Trinidad, and HBO, which is
televising the fight, is gambling they are right. If not, its
planned Sept. 18 welterweight showdown between Trinidad and Oscar
De La Hoya will go down the tubes at considerable cost.
</P>
<P>
   HBO has paid Trinidad nearly $6 million to fight first Pernell
Whitaker and now Pineda on its network for the sole purpose of
building up the IBF champion and creating an atmosphere that would
lead inevitably to a fight with De La Hoya, with whom HBO holds an
exclusive television contract.
</P>
<P>
   That fight has not been finalized because Trinidad's father
continues to argue with promoter Don King over the numbers,
believing an $8 million guarantee is not enough of a payday to risk
his son and meal ticket (not necessarily in that order of
importance) against De La Hoya. But the belief is that the showdown
will come off because the numbers have grown too big to be ignored
for long.
</P>
<P>
   If that is true, only one man can stop it, and if that man is
correct in his belief in himself and the weakness of his opponent's
jaw, there will be many people rubbing their chins Sunday morning,
not just Felix Trinidad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that's the fight he wants and everybody wants, but
first it's me,'' Pineda said. ``Trinidad can't talk about a fight
against De La Hoya when there's another fight first. Boxing is
unpredictable, as this situation is an example.''
</P>
<P>
   It's only an example, of course, if Pineda can land those shots
he's hoping for and succeed in keeping Trinidad on his back, a
place he has thus far refused to stay. While he has been down an
inordinate amount of times, Trinidad has always gotten up. Guys
like Pineda don't like to talk about what happens after that.
</P>
<P>
   Cortes dropped Trinidad twice in the second round of their 1992
fight in Paris. The next round, Trinidad hit him so many times in
the face that they had to stop the fight before somebody got
arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens dropped him in the second round a year later. For his
trouble, he got knocked cold in the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   After an eight-month layoff, Trinidad stepped in with undefeated
power puncher Campas, who was 56-0 with 50 knockouts. Again in the
second round, Campas appeared to be on the way to his 51st when he
stunned Trinidad and dropped him. Two rounds later, Trinidad broke
Campas's face, shattering his nose and cheek and forcing referee
Richard Steele to jump in and literally save face _ Campas's _ by
stopping the fight.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Carr, who also dropped Trinidad in Round 2 (do we see
a trend here?), only to be stopped in the eighth round after twice
being knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   Lastly, there was the unheralded Lueshing, the only junior
middleweight Trinidad has fought. Second round, first knockdown.
Third round, Lueshing out cold.
</P>
<P>
   The message here is clear: If Hugo Pineda does crack Felix
Trinidad's chin, he had best finish the job immediately or rue the
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this sport, everybody goes down to the canvas,'' said
Trinidad. ``If you fight with power, you can go down. But Pineda
will visit the canvas, not myself. To hurt my opponent is my job.
It is what I am there for.''
</P>
<P>
   That's also what Hugo Pineda is there for. But he must do more
than hurt the china chin of Felix Trinidad. He must destroy it
before the man who carries that chin destroys him.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The card, promoted by Don King, will include 11 fights, three
for world titles. World Boxing Association featherweight champion
Antonio Cermeno (35-2, 23 KOs) will risk his crown against former
champion Freddie Norwood (33-0-1), and WBA flyweight champion Leo
Gamez (31-6-1, 23 KOs) will seek the interim WBA super flyweight
title against former World Boxing Organization champion Josue
Dickie Camacho (16-6, 6 KOs).

SERENA WILLIAMS SCOOPED AT FRENCH OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The Lady in Red was a troublemaker.
</P>
<P>
   She'd been around this block a few times and had the wiles,
will, and weapons to confuse and shake the young crusading
journalist named Serena Williams who was on her trail.
</P>
<P>
   This was bad news _ and no news fit to print _ for Serena, the
associate editor of the Tennis Monthly Recap. It was supposed to be
a day for banner headlines proclaiming that the pillars of the Palm
Beach Gardens, Fla., publishing family, Serena and sister Venus,
had together crashed the sweet 16 of the French Open. Alas, tear up
the front page.
</P>
<P>
   Venus, also associate editor, co-publisher, and fellow star
reporter of their home-produced newsletter, quickly completed her
assignment with a 6-3, 6-1 win over an Aussie, No. 97 Alicia Molik.
That was hardly stop-the-presses stuff since, aside from her
journalistic duties, Venus is the global No. 5 tennis player.
</P>
<P>
   The assignment for No. 10 Serena, getting the goods on the Lady
in Red _ Mary Joe Fernandez _ looked a little tougher. And it was,
6-3, 1-6, 6-0, as the newshound bit the bagel.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a series of wrist injuries, the rigors of age (she will
be 28 soon), and a ranking that has deteriorated to No. 37,
Fernandez still has the evasiveness and the spin-doctoring skills
to baffle a cub reporter. She had more answers than 17-year-old
Serena had questions. Most of them made the kid look uncomfortable,
as though she needed a dictionary or a thesaurus to figure them
out.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Mary Joe is sashaying about Stade Roland Garros for
the 13th year, a six-time quarterfinalist or better who barely lost
the 1993 title to Steffi Graf. But never had she been so
assertively and stridently turned out as Friday in a fire
engine-red frock that was appropriate for the blaze she caused.
</P>
<P>
   ``New. Special for this tournament,'' she beamed. ``Red hot,
huh?''
</P>
<P>
   It evoked lyrics of that old tune, ``The Lady in Red'' _ `` . .
. never saw you shine so bright . . . it took my breath away . . .
''
</P>
<P>
   The brick dust court . . . the dress . . . her own discomfort as
Fernandez outsmarted her by mixing attack and defense wisely and
surprisingly. There was plenty to make Serena see red, whack her
chair with her racket, and later declare, laughing at herself, ``I
should have been taken off the court and immediately asked to leave
the facilities, never to return again.''
</P>
<P>
   In this city of historically haute couture, it's very difficult
to outdress the Williams sisters: Venus in clinging semi-halter
creation and Serena in muscles-flaunting mini-gown. Both a lemon
hue, which doesn't necessarily mark them as exponents of yellow
journalism.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Mary Joe in freshly tailored scarlet was in the
sartorial running while keeping Serena running about wildly and
vainly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was out of control,'' said Serena. ``Mary Joe attacked and
went ahead to take the match. It's difficult because in actuality,
I had planned on doing very well here, even taking the title. I
never even dreamed in my wildest nightmares that I would have went
out in the third round.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus earlier described the Tennis Monthly Recap as something
she and Serena do for fun on their laptops, circulation
unannounced. ``On the front page of our latest issue,'' she said,
giggling, ``are two famous players. Uh, me and Serena. Also,'' she
added, cracking up, ``on the back page, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Their favorite subject is Pete Sampras, whom they've interviewed
and written about.
</P>
<P>
   How come Venus, with so little experience on clay, appears to
handle the footing better than Pete?
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never criticize someone who has won so many more
titles than me,'' she said, diplomat as well as correspondent.
</P>
<P>
   After her defeat, Serena was asked cautiously by this reporter,
``Will you write about this match for the Recap?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm no longer worthy of being in the news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you be fired? You, the co-publisher, associate editor . .
. ''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will not be featured in the Recap,'' she said, grinning
broadly. ``That's a big publication. You have to be a player to get
featured. I wasn't a player today. The editors don't want Serena to
be featured. I have to go home and practice to make sure there's a
great writeup after Wimbledon in the Tennis Monthly Recap.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So that there won't be an editorial shakeup?''
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was a cryptic smile.
</P>
<P>
   The Lady in Red had thwarted the power of the press (and no
journalist has more power than Serena). But Serena had been
scooped. It hurts, kid, but it's happened to all of us in this
game.

BUCHANAN IS CAMPAIGNING CONFIDENTLY DESPITE THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: La.)  (lb) 
 By FRANCIS X. CLINES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONROE, La. _ Early in the quest, Pat Buchanan seems to be
sounding his patented campaign reveille as much for himself as for
his political ``pitchfork brigades.''
</P>
<P>
   ``January and February _ that's when the armies will meet!''
exulted the once and apparently constant presidential aspirant,
sitting in a catfish restaurant here and waxing nostalgic for the
merry field marshal's persona that was his signature in the 1996
Republican primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Buchanan scored such a stunning defeat over Bob Dole
in New Hampshire that he decided to return for the 2000 contest.
And in Louisiana, site of a caucus victory for Buchanan in 1996, he
worked in obvious contentment among the discontented in the
economically burnt-out cotton fields and in the nearby Pentecostal
churches, preparing for the wintry battles to come.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing like it,'' the 60-year-old candidate enthused over a
mug of nonalcoholic beer, the strict Spartan campaigner in these
early organizing months of dogged trail work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last time, with the momentum we had, thousands and thousands
kept showing at our rallies even after we were finished, he said.
``I felt like El Cid up there on that horse after I was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's rich laugh pealed through the restaurant as he took
stock of how different the 2000 challenge will be. The field of
social and economic conservatives that he exploited so promisingly
four years ago is more crowded with candidates this time. He must
first prevail over them if he is to narrow things to another
showdown opportunity against ``the party establishment'' candidate,
as he puts it _ most likely Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, by
Buchanan's reckoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``You ask who I'm most concerned about right now, and my answer
is Steve Forbes' checkbook,'' Buchanan continued. ``Not the
candidate _ the checkbook,'' he said of the millionaire rival he
beat four times in 1996, only to see him come on with zombielike
persistence as an eventual spoiler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forbes had the money to stay in the game and wait down the
road,'' Buchanan said. ``When he finally won in Arizona, I lost the
momentum to beat Dole that I had won in New Hampshire.''
</P>
<P>
   Across his political decades as a superbly pugnacious polemicist
and late-blooming candidate, Buchanan has proved he is nothing if
not personally indomitable. He seems once more unfazed by the
assessment of political handicappers that, in his third time
around, the gleam has worn off his underdog candidacy as the irate
populist pleading for forgotten workers and impassioned moral
causes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wonder whether Buchanan's heart is in it,'' said the
political analyst Charles Cook Jr. ``He got traction in '92
challenging President Bush, and he had a semblance of that in '96
with Dole as a pretty good foil. But I don't really see it this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   In his recent campaign forays across the country, Buchanan has
been tuning up small but dedicated crowds with his old energy,
sharpening an early stump speech firmly rooted in opposition to
abortion, free trade, the bombing of Yugoslavia and a national
``culture of death.'' He sees Hollywood, not easy access to
weapons, as the dominant factor in the recent surge of school
shootings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was about evil in the human heart,'' Buchanan boomed here
at a Christian Life Pentecostal church after joining in the choir's
rafter-thumping round of singing and hand-clapping for Jesus.
``We're going to make America a pro-life country again!'' the
candidate shouted.
</P>
<P>
   He moved on the church stage hesitantly, a rusty political
evangelist searching for the old fire, far from the CNN
``Crossfire'' program that is his Beltway sparring perch between
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   One big difference this time is that behind the scrim of his
busy schedule, much of Buchanan's battle-tested '96 cadre had
already been hired away by rivals before he took to the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``After '96, Pat went back to his old career on television and
didn't keep an infrastructure in place to capitalize on what he
accomplished,'' said one disappointed Buchanan veteran who has
moved on to another candidate. ``He lost a lot of the grass-roots
field operation that makes things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, whose checkbook so haunts the conservative commentator,
hired the entire Buchanan '96 staff in New Hampshire as well as
influential coordinators in Iowa and Louisiana, plus Greg Mueller,
a political operative from the first two Buchanan campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan, insisting that he has found gifted ``rookies'' to
galvanize his new effort, is convinced that his early opposition to
the NATO attacks on Yugoslavia will make him the standout among the
second tier of conservative Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to dramatically underline this anti-war stance, in
contrast to Bush and other candidates, next week before the
National Press Club in a speech that his campaign director, Jay
Townsend, promises will be a crucial initiative in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now in a foreign war that's none of our business,''
Buchanan has been telling audiences, drawing applause from New
Hampshire to Virginia and from Iowa to Louisiana.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, he conceded that his economic-nationalism theme
of 1996 is a tougher sell this year, ``when the Dow's at 11,000.''
But he contended that his anti-war stance will be his definitive
rallying cry this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the American people's reflection on the fact
that I was right about that issue will convince them to look at my
candidacy and give me that extra momentum that I need to win,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan so obviously relishes the role of political guerrilla
fighter that some critics rate him as more a campaign addict than a
realist in his continuing quest for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There should have been more people this time around,'' said
Moon Griffon, a conservative talk-show host here in northern
Louisiana who checked out the Buchanan crowds and found them
dedicated but wanting, considering Buchanan's dramatic victory here
in the Republican caucus three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He should have more momentum, but I don't see it,'' Griffon
said, pointing to the more crowded social conservative primary
field that is threatening Buchanan this time.
</P>
<P>
   This includes the religious conservative Gary Bauer, Sen. Robert
C. Smith of New Hampshire, Rep. John Kasich of Ohio, former Vice
President Dan Quayle and Alan Keyes, a fiery anti-abortion orator
who attracted enough conservative votes in the 1996 Iowa caucuses
to deny Buchanan the margin of victory over Dole.
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan insists that he would not be running if he thought he
could not win or if there were a more promising candidate carrying
the same party challenges. He smiles in noting that he expects, if
not yearns, to once more be denounced as too ``extreme'' for his
party _ ``just as soon as I break through the pack again and
they're saying, `Good Lord, old Pat can win this thing!'''
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's pleasure in being back on the trail is only
compounded, he said, by getting away from his television show's
monotony in having to focus on ``the Monica thing.'' ``Oh, I was
sick of it,'' he sighed before listening, as if in grateful
expiation, to the plight of some bankrupt cotton farmers who blamed
global trading. In a matter of minutes, Buchanan seamlessly wove
their troubles into his next stump speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest game in the world,'' he happily declared
in an aside as the campaign trail opened anew for him. ``This is
fun. You're out of Washington, and you're up there with those
folks.''
</P>
<P>
   For all his bluff resolve, Buchanan, a passionate reader of
political history, already seems proud of his campaign record in
prodding his party away from the center. ``Archimedes said give me
a lever and a place to stand and I will move the world,'' he
declared. ``The presidential race is the real place to stand and
move the center of gravity in American politics.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're calling the whole Republican Party neo-isolationist
now, not just me,'' he beamed. ``That's very heartening.''
</P>
<P>
   The need for Buchanan to break out early from the social
conservative pack is critical in the view of such Buchanan doubters
as William Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard. ``I'm struck
that Pat must have 95 percent name identity in the nation, but
right now he's only at 4 or 5 percent in the political polls,''
Kristol said, citing the multiple competition on the right.
</P>
<P>
   But Buchanan's knack for polemics and strategic timing, honed
since his days in Richard Nixon's White House, has no equal in the
field, said Lyn Nofziger, a political strategist for President
Ronald Reagan who is a Buchanan adviser now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pat's different from the others because he doesn't weasel or
beat around the bush,'' Nofziger said, counting on an
anti-establishment wave in the primaries. ``What we're seeing here
is that Pat is not appealing to a broad spectrum of voters yet, but
he's kind of steadily picking off people who used to make up part
of the Reagan coalition, blue collars and the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Much the way Buchanan views Bush, the former president's oldest
son, as the ``inevitable'' candidate of the party establishment, he
sees himself as no less inevitably emerging from the conservative
pack as the governor's showdown challenger.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a perfect foil for my campaign,'' Buchanan said with a
glint of his old lock-and-load instinct for targeting competitors.
``A globalist like his father,'' he added, his grin widening.
``He's perfect.''

 &HT;    HACKER STRIKE SHOWS VULNERABILITY OF PUBLIC WEB SITES
 &HT;    Eds: Note language in graf 5.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The FBI and Senate Web sites remained closed Friday
evening after hackers launched a series of powerful cyberattacks
against the government computers.
</P>
<P>
   The hackers' strike underscored the exposure of popular Internet
sites to rogue electronic assaults, despite ever more sophisticated
protective ``firewalls.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's site (http://www.fbi.gov) was disabled by an attack
late Wednesday night, a spokesman said. The hackers ran a widely
available program that ``flooded'' the host IBM server with
requests for access, and the computer shut itself down. The result,
officials said, was similar to what would happen if millions of
Internet users were to seek access to a Web site simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI spokesman, Paul Bresson, said the Web site is used mainly
to distribute FBI press releases and other official texts and does
not contain any classified or essential data. He would not predict
when the site would be back in service.
</P>
<P>
   Following that assault, a group calling itself MAST3RZ 0F
D0WNL0ADING(cq) vandalized the official U.S. Senate site
(http://www.senate.gov) at 7:53 p.m. EDT Thursday, replacing the
welcoming page with a message to the FBI _ ``SKREW U GUYZ!''
</P>
<P>
   James Ziglar, the U.S. Senate's sergeant at arms, thereupon
closed the Senate's Web site, as well as senators' and committee
Web pages linked to it.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Sherry Little said the Senate site would be closed
indefinitely while the FBI sought to track the culprits through the
Internet's vast electronic plumbing. Congressional e-mail services
remained unaffected.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI has yet to identify any suspects responsible for the
twin attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But officials said they viewed the attack as retaliation for a
series of search warrants carried out earlier this week in Seattle,
Houston and Northern California in a ongoing probe of a group that
dubs itself ``Global Hell.''
</P>
<P>
   The combined attacks highlight the potential exposure of
critical computer networks to cyber-attacks.
</P>
<P>
   On May 12, President Clinton's Web site
(http://www.whitehouse.gov) was shut down for 24 hours after it
sustained a barrage of virtual assaults in protest of NATO's
bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1998, Clinton issued a broad presidential directive
ordering the FBI to mount a defense of the nation's electronic
central nervous system, including the ones used by the banking
system, power grid, telephone lines, and other vital services.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials privately acknowledge these systems could
easily be crashed by well-organized hackers in what would be an
``electronic Pearl Harbor.''
</P>
<P>
   Only ``this Pearl Harbor's going to be different,'' John J.
Hamre, the deputy secretary of Defense, told the Senate Armed
Services Committee on March 9. ``It is not going to be against Navy
ships sitting in a Navy shipyard; it's going to be against
commercial infrastructure, and we don't control that.''

 &HT;    Vets gather to remember World War II
 &HT;    By Joe Earle
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Pete Burnette examined a photocopy of the familiar,
grainy photograph of the U.S.S. Pope, a World War II destroyer, and
pointed to a spot at the stern.
</P>
<P>
   ``I literally stepped off this ship right about there,'' the
78-year-old man said. ``Into the water.''
</P>
<P>
   A Japanese photographer snapped the photograph moments later.
The image freezes the moment when giant plumes of water exploded
into the sky as bombs or shells struck the ship, sinking it.
</P>
<P>
   After the Pope sank, Burnette and his shipmates spent three days
and two nights in the water. Burnette never could find room in a
life raft, he said, so he just hung on to whatever floated. A
Japanese ship fished the American sailors from the Java Sea and
took them to a prisoner of war camp on Celebes, a nearby island.
Most, including Burnette, stayed there until the war ended. A small
contingent was taken to Japan to work. Thirty-one died.
</P>
<P>
   This week, a half-dozen survivors of the prison camp, now men in
their late 70s, joined about 80 veterans from across the country at
an Atlanta hotel to remember and celebrate their shipmates and
service in the Pacific. Their annual gathering concludes after a
formal banquet tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the men taking part in the annual reunion served on
``four-stackers'' _ destroyers with four smokestacks _ such as the
Pope, the U.S.S. Paul Jones, the U.S.S. John D. Ford and the U.S.S
Parrott, on the destroyer tender Black Hawk or on the submarine
U.S.S Perch. They served in the Navy's Asiatic Fleet, which
patrolled China and the Pacific islands from 1910 until 1942.
</P>
<P>
   Archie Eslick, now 83, served on the U.S.S. Barker in the 1930s
and remembers joining the search for missing pilot Amelia Earhardt.
``We never did find her,'' he said with a bit of a grin.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese Navy destroyed the Asiatic fleet in February 1942
in a battle for the Java Sea. After the battle, the ships that
remained serviceable were dispatched to other duties. The federal
government, these veterans say, wanted people to forget the battle.
Coming so soon after Pearl Harbor, they say, the losses in the Java
Sea were deemed bad for morale back home.
</P>
<P>
   The sailors took upon themselves to remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``As shipmates, we've now become a large family,'' said Charles
Ankerberg, 77, of St. Petersburg, Fla., a signalman on the Paul
Jones who now chairs the board of the Asiatic fleet organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a common bond,'' Burnette said. ``The people who were
in the prison camp were blood brothers and they always will be.''
Burnette nodded toward a Pope shipmate and fellow ex-prisoner who
lives half-way across the country. ``I'd go to his house in a
minute if it would help him,'' Burnette said. ``Mainly because we
helped each other at camp.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison life took a toll. Burnette lost use of an eye when a
guard struck him with a stick. When he finally reached the U.S.,
Burnette said he was a walking skeleton who weighed just 110
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Shipmate Lonnie McDuffie, 78, of La Place, La., recalled other,
less obvious scars. ``When I got out of prison, for 10 years I was
hard as a rock,'' he said. ``I'd let a (guy) beat me to death
before I'd cry.''
</P>
<P>
   Robbie Robinson, one of the prisoners taken to Japan, where he
worked in the Nagasaki shipyard and dug coal, scribbled a little
note to express his sentiments. ``Present feelings now are mixed:
grateful, humble, angry, guilty and hopeful,'' the note read. The
79-year-old, who lives in Seattle, thought a moment. Then he
pointed to the note and said, ``Hate. I left out `hate.' That's the
most important one.''
</P>
<P>
   He smiled slightly. ``Before I die, I'd like to forgive
everybody so I can go to heaven,'' he said. ``So I want to know a
few minutes before I go.''

 &HT;    Violence focus of gathering at Emory
 &HT;    By Gayle White
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As carnage piles up in schoolyards and war zones, a
group of scholars is gathering at Emory University in Atlanta
Thursday through June 5 to look at the causes and possible cures
for violence.
</P>
<P>
   The Colloquium on Violence and Religion centers on the work of
Rene Girard, a French scholar retired from Stanford University who
is known for his work on scapegoating. He will speak at 7 p.m.
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Scapegoating ``is a dynamic that plagues our relationships from
nursery school to global affairs,'' said Theophus Smith, an Emory
religion professor who is coordinating the meeting. ``It is our
fallback, our default mode, for creating unity in groups. If all
else fails _ negotiation, diplomacy, law enforcement, litigation _
one sure-fire way is to target one of us as the cause of our
conflict.''
</P>
<P>
   In school violence, this comes out in the retaliation of
children who have felt victimized and who, in turn, target others
for blame and sometimes for bullets, said Smith. In international
affairs, he said, ``ethnic cleansing is the perfect example of
creating unity in a dominant group by targeting another group.''
And dropping bombs on the people blamed for the ethnic cleansing
shows how violence, once used, becomes contagious, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So what hope is there to overcome violence?
</P>
<P>
   ``The true alternative, instead of creating another scapegoat,
is to offer one's self as a substitute,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   African-American slaves often relied on their religion and the
principles taught by the Gospels as an ``antidote'' to the violence
they were experiencing, said Smith. And in the civil rights
movement, nonviolent marches eventually won over the court of world
opinion and changed laws and society, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Christians, ``the Crucifixion is an anti-scapegoating
event,'' said Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Nonviolent approaches take time, patience and courage, he said,
and people are not often willing to invest the time or take the
risk. ``We think violence is the faster, more efficient, more
thorough way,'' said Smith. ``We idolize violence as if it were a
godlike power for rescuing us. We keep using it over and over with
no evidence that it's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said scholars hope their studies will evolve into practice
so they can train leaders to help dismantle violence.
</P>
<P>
   Because this year's gathering of the colloquium will occur at
Emory, Smith attempted to take advantage of Emory-related
institutions, from the Yerkes Regional Primate Research Center to
the Carter Center.
</P>
<P>
   At Yerkes, Frans de Waal, a Dutch-born zoologist and ethologist,
examines ethics and morality in primates. Officials of the Carter
Center travel the world attempting to head off or reduce ethnic,
civil and international expressions of violence.
</P>
<P>
   De Waal will address the group at 11:15 a.m. Thursday on
``Violence Reduction Among Primates.'' Other speakers include Jim
Grote of the University of Louisville, co-author of ``Clever as
Serpents _ Business Ethics and Office Politics,'' and Regina
Schwartz, director of the Chicago Institute of Religion, Ethics and
Violence, who wrote ``The Curse of Cain: The Violent Legacy of
Monotheism.''

 &HT;    What's wrong with the Braves pitchers, if anything?
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The visiting clubhouse at County Stadium in Milwaukee was a
lonely, quiet place Monday night when Tom Glavine walked inside the
bearer of nine earned runs and his fifth loss, something he didn't
have last year until August.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 National League Cy Young award winner went to his
teammate, friend and four-time Cy Young winner Greg Maddux, who was
charting Glavine's pitches from television and feeling his pain.
Glavine was looking for some answers to a question both of them
have faced all too often this season: What went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly thought after the first inning that I was giving my
pitches away because they didn't even offer at any change-ups, and
they were pretty good pitches,'' Glavine said.
</P>
<P>
   Maddux told Glavine the same thing he's been reminding himself
through his own struggles: nothing's wrong. Which left the
cornerstones of the Atlanta Braves franchise scratching their
heads. Are two of the hardest-to-figure pitchers in baseball no
longer difficult to figure out?
</P>
<P>
   But even in that frustrating moment, they took some small
comfort, because the two of them were in there together, sharing
the opposite end of the spectrum from their Nike commercial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it eases my questions, or questions that people have
about me, in terms of, 'Is this the end of the rope?''' Glavine
said. ``I don't think that. But I guess it makes it a little bit
easier. I think you just try to deal with it on a game-to-game
basis and try to win each game that you pitch and hope that each
time you pitch well it leads to another one.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine, 3-5 with a 5.54 ERA, will make his 11th start today
against the Dodgers. Maddux, who put together his best start of the
month on Tuesday night to hold at 4-3 and lower his ERA to 4.48
ERA, pitches Sunday. Neither one has been through a stretch like
this before _ not this long, not this ineffective and not when
they're supposed to be too young, both at 33, to be dealing with
such problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real easy to look at numbers and say, 'Ah, well, they're
throwing like crap,''' Glavine said. ``The hard thing to do is to
get into what's going on and try and really sit down and figure out
how bad are you and how far off are you. And when you've had the
kind of success that he and I have had for the last eight years,
obviously people are going to look at our numbers right now and say
that we're way off. I don't buy into that.''
</P>
<P>
   An easy answer would and could be the new, skinnier strike zone.
When two control pitchers who feast on and off the edges of the
plate are struggling at the same time, it seems too coincidental.
Neither will use it as an excuse, but Maddux's catcher will.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's any difference in the way they pitch,''
Eddie Perez said. ``It's the new strike zone. (Maddux and I) used
to go fastball away, fastball in, most of the time to get ahead.
Now we can't do that because it's got to be right in the middle.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Braves players have said privately that they think this
pitching staff, Glavine and Maddux in particular, have been
targeted by umpires, who are angry with the commissioner's office
for trying to change the way they do their jobs and have chosen two
of the highest-profile pitchers in baseball to point that out. It
even has been suggested to Braves by opposing coaches, who have
said their pitchers are getting better calls than the Braves'
pitchers in games against them. But that's not something players or
coaches are prepared to talk about publicly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blame it on mechanics, that's all you can do,'' Glavine said.
``I still maintain (that Monday) night I felt good out there; my
mechanics felt fine. I'm not going to sit here and say that I
didn't make any mistakes, but I didn't make nine runs worth of
mistakes. It's frustrating because I feel like I'm on the verge of
getting where I want to be, and then you have a game like (Monday)
night, and you're like, 'All right, now what?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care so much about what my numbers are and how I feel
as much as I feel bad that I'm letting guys in here down, Bobby
(Cox), the coaches, everybody else. I'll deal with the fact that on
a personal level things aren't going all that well, but if we're
going to get things going in the right direction, I need to get
myself going in the right direction. But I think that will all
come.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux is hoping it's already here. His seven shutout innings
against the Brewers on Tuesday night rescued him from a four-game
stretch in which he was 0-3 with an 8.14 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did some things well in that game,'' Maddux said. ``I'm
going to try to do them again. That's what I take out of (Tuesday)
night. Just like the losses. Yeah, I lost those three games but I
took things out of those games that will make me a better
pitcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez was more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he was showing when he was throwing the changeup,''
Perez said. ``He made some adjustments (against the Brewers), and
he was throwing OK. It happened in Chicago and in San Diego.
Hopefully, that's what it is. They were looking for that pitch; he
threw a perfect one down and away, and they were taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the pitch that hitters are usually induced to swing
through. It's the pitch Maddux's former Cubs teammate Mark Grace
hit for a double on a 3-2 count on May 20 for only his eighth hit
in 33 career at-bats off his former teammate. It was Grace's second
hit in a row after he homered in his first at-bat to help the Cubs
take a 5-0 lead on Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a pretty good pitch, a 3-2 changeup. I just stayed on
it and hit it good,'' Grace said. ``That's usually the pitch he
gets me out with. Every once in a while, you get a hit. I wouldn't
worry about him. . . . His stuff is still sharp, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dating back to Aug. 12, Maddux is 7-7 with a 4.51 ERA. But he
suggests that this year's struggles are different because he feels
better physically than he did last year when he was hampered by
some tenderness in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been making too many mistakes,'' Maddux said, ``throwing
too many hittable pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux has coped by studying his mechanics and working and
thinking hard between starts. But he said it's also a matter of
trusting himself that he's still doing the right things, pitching
the right way. He wants to put the negatives behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deal with it, blow it off and go on,'' Maddux said. ``I go
home and be a dad again. Then I come to the ballpark and get ready
for the next game. . . . I care about my job. I care about what we
do. But once it's done, it's over with. I'm done with it. That's
easier said than done, I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago's Jeff Blauser, a neighbor who shared a locker with
Maddux for five of his years when he was with the Braves, said
people need to cut Maddux some slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people expect him to be superhuman, and he's human,''
Blauser said. ``One thing I think people fail to remember is he has
pitched a lot of innings in his career. I think if you saw a guy
who was missing up in the strike zone, it'd be one thing, but he's
keeping the ball down. He's changing speeds. More than anything,
from what I've seen, if he does make a mistake, he's getting hit,
where in the past if he made a mistake a lot of time he was getting
away with it. . . .
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is this team certainly still respects what he can
do,'' Blauser said. ``I personally feel sorry for the rest of the
league when he gets going, because he's certainly going to get
going. He's too smart and he's too good for this, No. 1, to affect
him and, No. 2, for this to go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddux and Glavine are counting on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still maintain that somewhere along the line I'll get on a
roll, Doggie will get on a roll, and all this will be forgotten,''
Glavine said. ``It doesn't make right now any less frustrating. The
only good thing about it is, he and I haven't pitched well, we're
playing about as bad as we can play right now as a team, and we're
still in first place. So you try to focus on that.''

 &HT;    Most of Division I male college tennis players are foreign
 &HT;    By Norman Arey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS, Ga. _ On Court 1 in the quarterfinals of the NCAA Tennis
Championships here, Baylor's Johann Jooste of South Africa played
Georgia's Hisham Hemeda of Egypt. On Court 2, Baylor's Pawel
Gajdzik of Poland faced Georgia's Talito Corrales of Spain.
</P>
<P>
   The Baylor squad also featured Johannes Michalsky of Germany,
Fanda Stejskal of the Czech Republic, Csongor Bibza of Hungary and
Frederic Blaise of France, among others. Of the 10 players on the
Bears' roster, only Jorge Aldrete of San Diego was born in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of Division I male college tennis players are
foreign, says Stanford coach Dick Gould, one of the few coaches to
resist the influx of foreign talent in American college tennis.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest college rankings, 12 of the top 20 and 28 of the
top 50 were born outside the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to all of the Americans?
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has bastardized the system that I'm aware of, and as
long as the system is not taken advantage of, I don't have a
problem with (bringing in foreign players),'' said Gould, in
college tennis for 32 years. ``It makes my players better, but I
feel sorry for the American players who miss out (on scholarships).
And the number of foreign players is even higher at the Division II
level and at junior colleges.''
</P>
<P>
   Division 1 offers approximately 1,400 scholarships for male
players. American players receive about 400, meaning that foreign
born players are taking some 1,000 scholarships that could be going
to native U.S. players.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign players are nothing new. The first foreign-born player
to win the NCAA title was Edward Dewhurst from Sydney, Australia.
He did it in 1903 and repeated in 1905. He was 34 years old when he
won it the second time, taking time from his study of dentistry at
the University of Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get a good foreign player, they have a friend,''
retired Georgia tennis coach Dan Magill said. ``Pretty soon, you've
got a pipeline started. If you're not good enough to go on the pro
tour, the place to go is an American college. You know you're going
to play fall, winter and spring. The competition is going to make
you better, and you're going to get a free education.''
</P>
<P>
   Tennis isn't the only college sport to be influenced by strong
foreign talent. Track-and-field rosters read like a United Nations
roll call. Cross country, golf and baseball all have been affected.
Even college basketball has become international.
</P>
<P>
   Magill said the influx of college tennis players began after
King Gustav of Sweden hired American Bill Lufler to install a
system to help young talent get better. Lufler, an excellent coach
at Presbyterian and Miami, was successful, and other nations copied
his system.
</P>
<P>
   In the pro ranks, most of the top 100 players are foreign. Pete
Sampras, Andre Agassi, Jim Courier and Michael Chang are getting
older, and no one stands poised to step in.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Tennis Association is well aware of the situation.
``Five years from now, we don't want two Lithuanian players playing
in the finals of the U.S. Open,'' said past USTA president Harry
Marmion.
</P>
<P>
   Marmion and other top USTA officials installed a five-year, $32
million plan to bolster junior tennis and develop top-notch
American players. It hired Davis Cup captain Tom Gullikson to
oversee the ambitious undertaking.
</P>
<P>
   While some see no harm in college tennis becoming international,
Gullikson disagrees. ``I don't think it's good,'' he said. ``I
would be for limiting the number of foreign players. But I think
there's so much pressure on the coaches to win, the athletic
department at each school would have to support it.''
</P>
<P>
   Grover Hinsdale, the track coach at Georgia Tech, has been
outspoken about developing homegrown talent first. The longtime
Jacket coach never has recruited a foreign athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the national championships in the late '80s, and I
couldn't believe it,'' Hinsdale said. ``Where were the Americans? I
started thinking about it after that. Then in 1991, Tennessee won
the NCAA outdoors with an all-American team. They showed it's
possible with all-U.S. athletes. I made up my mind then that we
were going to try to develop our own players. No matter how much or
how little you give (in aid) to a foreign athlete, that's how much
you're taking away from an American athlete.''
</P>
<P>
   There was talk several years ago about limiting the number of
foreign scholarships, Magill says, but it stopped when the U.S.
State Department reacted disapprovingly. Four years ago, Hinsdale
said, coaches took a vote at the annual U.S. Track Coaches meeting
to limit scholarship aid to one foreign athlete, but the motion was
defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Manuel Diaz, whose team won the NCAA title Tuesday, has three
foreign-born players. ``The international players bring a lot to
the table, and our American kids benefit from being exposed,'' said
Diaz, who was recruited from Puerto Rico by Magill. ``We're a
nation of immigrants. Isn't the American way to enterprise? We're
so bottom-line. I just think there are more good, hungry, capable,
ambitious young coaches now who aren't willing to sit on the
sidelines and compete for the top U.S. players who are going to
Stanford, UCLA and Southern Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor coach Matt Knoll took over the Bears' program three years
ago when Baylor was ranked No. 300 in the country. This year,
Baylor finished in the top eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what makes America great,'' said Knoll, who has no
patience with those who question his almost all-foreign lineup.
``That's outdated thinking,'' Knoll said. ``It's prejudice. How
many years ago did Kentucky's all-white basketball team get beat by
an all-black team in the NCAAs? Now, guess what. Kentucky's team is
almost all black. Our foreign players stay four years and take
their academics seriously. We've had the highest GPA in the
athletic department for the past two years. An argument could be
made (that) the hardest-working students are first-generation
Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come to me and ask, 'Why aren't you recruiting more
players from this country?''' Knoll said. ``I say, 'Why aren't you
making (the U.S. player) better?' Don't bring me some player who
can't beat my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My take is, tennis is played all over the world,'' Florida's
No. 1 player, Jeff Morrison, said. ``In football, you don't have
that. The problem I have with foreign players coming in is with the
23- and 24-year-old guys. They just passed a rule last year that a
foreign player could only have five years to complete his
eligibility after graduating from high school, but I don't think
they're really enforcing that.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem is the American players have gotten so spoiled,''
Morrison said. ``Nobody wants to go to Starkville or Oxford, Miss.,
or Baylor. Everybody wants to go to Stanford or UCLA or Florida or
Georgia. So some schools have been forced to look for foreign
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison concedes that the U.S. has a way to go to bring up its
tennis standards. ``The depth in American tennis isn't there,'' he
said. ``In the past, the U.S. Tennis Association had a chosen few.
A lot of people are very bitter toward the USTA. But now they're
trying to do something about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One international player who has benefited from the system is
Georgia's Corrales, who completed his eligibility this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thankful for the system that allowed me to play, but if I
would be an American, I would not like it,'' Corrales said. ``I
think the solution is to limit the numbers of foreign players on
each team to two or three. The way it is, it's taking away
privileges to American players.''

   LA-GLOOM (Los Angeles) _ The bothersome weather phenomenon
marked by colder-than-normal Pacific waters is taking one last shot
before she leaves _ dropping sea and air temperatures a few degrees
below normal for the summer, extending the June gloom through the
summer, and increasing the smog level in Southern California. By
Steve Carney. (Will move in the ``n'' California news file.)
</P>
<P>
   LA-AIRLINE (Los Angeles) _ The Los Angeles City Council meets
and is expected to vote to reject a 23-year lease with United
Airlines and send the lease back to the Airport Commission for
revisions. The council is demanding the contract be rewritten to
include protections _ that already exist in federal law _ for an
airline subcontractor's workers who are in a union organizing
drive. By Rick Orlov. (Will move in the ``n'' California news
file.)
</P>
<P>
   MEDIA-DISNEY (Los Angeles) _ The bitter dispute between Jeffrey
Katzenberg and The Walt Disney Co. took a bizarre turn this week as
five news organizations filed a brief telling a judge that
documents about Katzenberg's DreamWorks SKG should be kept secret,
then reversed course a day later. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the
``f'' financial news file.)
</P>
<P>
   UNIVERSAL-BACK (Los Angeles) _ Universal, after enduring a year
and a half of flops and a messy series of high-level dismissals,
has finally managed to get its film business back in
order.``Universal has really rebounded,'' noted Drew Devlin, an
executive with Clark Film Buying. ``And their upcoming schedule
looks pretty strong.'' By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``f''
financial news file.)
</P>
<P>
   LITTON-MERGER (Los Angeles) _ The Pentagon on Friday torpedoed
Litton Industries Inc.'s proposed $1.9 billion acquisition of
Newport News Shipbuilding Inc., saying the potential cost savings
to the government are not big enough to justify less competition
among shipbuilders. By Gregory Wilcox. (Will move in the ``f''

(Sidebars slugged UNIVERSAL-KIDS and KIDDIE-PARKS)  
By CHRIS PARKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six Flags Magic Mountain has discovered that
teen-agers have little sisters and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the brain trust at Scream Central just noticed that
most of their customers are 5-, 6- and 8-year-olds before they turn
into thrill-seeking, money-spending teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only conclusion possible after spending a day at the
all-new Bugs Bunny World, which opened Thursday. It is Magic
Mountain for the under-4-foot crowd, complete with mini-thrill
rides and interactive zones. Even the drinking fountains are
kid-sized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never lose site of the fact that we own the thrill
market in Southern California,'' said Andy Gallardo, spokesman for
the Santa Clarita park. ``What we wanted to do was add an area that
brought thrills to the younger guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Magic Mountain has always had an area for the prepubescent
sect. But what began as a rather sad little troll village nearly
three decades ago had never gotten much better than a carnival
sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bugs Bunny World has more rides, better attractions and
just more stuff for the Nickelodeon generation than anything Magic
Mountain has done before.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight new rides and a handful of new attractions,
including a petting zoo and a new animal show. All of it is wrapped
up in a Bugs Bunny-themed bow, from the ties worn by ride operators
to the cartoonish-looking flowers and plants. Even the shrubbery
islands have been kid-sized so the youngsters can sit down without
needing a lift up from mom or dad.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the new kids zone is Looney Tunes Lodge, a
6,000-square-foot, two-story-tall hall filled with thousands of
foam balls. Kids can throw the balls at their friends. Kids can
throw the balls through hoops and holes. Kids can put the balls in
toy cannons and shoot them across the lodge. It's a
Colossus-strength ball pit; bigger, louder and more entertaining
than any fast-food play area.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Mountain also has upgraded its mini-roller coaster from
previous incarnations, ratcheting up the highest points and
twisting the curves a little tighter. In fact, many of the new
rides at Bugs Bunny World are either juiced-up kids' rides or
smaller versions of Magic Mountain's big-kid rides, depending upon
your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Blaster is a small version of Psychlone (OK, a much
smaller version). Sylvester's Pounce and Bounce is a two-story tall
version of Freefall, only Pounce and Bounce drops slower and
bounces as it drops, making it feel like riders are sitting on a
big spring.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the younger crowd will appreciate is that all the
rides are big enough for parents to ride along, too. If the ride
gets too intense, Mom or Dad is just a bucket seat away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's rather ingenious of Magic Mountain to give its kids'
rides some adrenaline. Once they've graduated from Sylvester's,
they can bounce over to Freefall or maybe the 41-story-tall
Superman: The Escape, which towers over Bugs Bunny World.
</P>
<P>
   For kids who want tame rides, Bugs Bunny World has a new
pint-sized train and its long-running small carousel. There's also
Yosemite Sam's Flight School, an airplane ride not unlike
Disneyland's Dumbo ride; Pepe Le Pew's Tea Party, which is a lot
like Disney's tea cups; and Taz's Trucking Company, a miniature
Autopia with 4x4 trucks instead of those Ramblers at Fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but it's hard to walk through the kids' section of an
amusement park without thinking about The House The Mouse Built.
How do Bugs' new digs stack up? It's fair to say Magic Mountain
does kid stuff about as well as Disneyland does thrill rides _ not
great but certainly not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Magic Mountain isn't the only Southern California
amusement park hoping to attract the entire family. Disney
practically invented the bait-the-kid-and-hook-her-dad's-wallet
trick, and it's spent the last 40 years or so perfecting its small
kids' world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, other amusement parks realize that the best way to steer
minivans into their parking lot is from the car seat in the back.
Children control their family's spending habits and amusement park
choices as sure as there's a ``Rugrats'' video in the VCR and
Disney sheets on the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland wasn't built in north San Diego County to attract
Marines from Camp Pendleton. It opened this spring a few plastic
blocks away from Interstate 5, within shouting distance of the car
loads of vacationers shuttling between San Diego and L.A. Shouting
distance, as in, ``Mommy, I wanna go there!''
</P>
<P>
   Universal Studios Hollywood is unveiling new attractions this
summer for Nick kids, literally. They include ``Blue's Clues
Live,'' a live version of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cable
television show, and an eating area where kids can have breakfast
with their favorite Rugrats, Marvel and Universal cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Magic Mountain's new Bugs Bunny World both
impressive and imperative. Magic Mountain had always been able to
attract teen-agers looking for a good scream; now, as its
competition diversifies, it also figured out a way to get the rest
of the family out of the car. &QL;

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD ADDS NICKELODEON ATTRACTIONS
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Universal Studios Hollywood will unveil a series
of new attractions and events this summer that will allow young
Nickelodeon fans to participate in a live ``Blue's Clues'' game and
eat pancakes with Woody Woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement park's Kids Fun Fest could propel its name to the
top of the ``to do'' list of every under-4-foot kid in Southern
California. That's because in addition to its stable of Universal
and Marvel cartoon characters, the park has the added attraction of
Nickelodeon's top cable television characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to get more families up here,'' said Pat
Moloney, director of entertainment for Universal Studios Hollywood,
``and make this a special thing for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, amusement parks have always wanted to attract kids
and their money-spending parents. But in previous years, parks did
that by building the biggest, scariest ride.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Southern California's amusement parks are turning
their attention to the under-4-foot crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Preteens are ``certainly a large segment of the marketplace,''
Moloney said. ``I think we accommodate them pretty well already,
but this extends the options.''
</P>
<P>
   The new attractions, which open July 2, are led by ``Blue's
Clues Live,'' an auditorium version of the popular Nickelodeon TV
show. Kids will be able to solve puzzles, play games and sing songs
along with Blue and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's character breakfasts will offer the youngest guests
a chance to meet some of the most popular Nickelodeon, Universal
and Marvel characters before heading into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Other new attractions include Woody Woodpecker's Clubhouse and
an updated Chipmunks Show.
</P>
<P>
   Tying the whole package together for Universal's pint-sized
guests will be a treasure hunt. Kids will receive a special map
when they enter the park that highlights the kid-friendly
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As they wander from attraction to attraction, they'll receive
stamps, like a tourist having her passport stamped as she enters
each country. Kids who collect the entire set of stamps will get a
prize.

NIGERIA FACES TOUGH REFORMS UNDER ELECTED PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KURT SHILLINGER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG _ Nigeria inaugurates its first elected president
in two decades Saturday amid cautious hopes that Africa's most
populous nation will finally break its long and devastating cycle
of corruption, military repression, and decay.
</P>
<P>
   There will be no honeymoon for Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired
general who ruled for three years while in uniform in the late
1970s and was elected in February as a civilian. Years of debauched
military rule have left the nation and its economy in tatters.
</P>
<P>
   Cities suffer from shortages of water and electricity, roads
crumble, and the country's oil refineries _ the pistons of its
economy _ lie in disrepair. Nigeria's currency is worth a penny and
the country is $31 billion in debt, according to the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
   One sign of weakness, and Obasanjo runs the risk of another
hostile takeover from a military that has shown it preference for
palaces over barracks too many times in the past 40 years. ``We are
optimistic. We are basking in the excitement of a return to
civilian government,'' said Felix Morka, a human rights activist in
Lagos, Nigeria's sprawling commercial capital. ``But people are
impatient. Obasanjo must take control immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The guest list at Obasanjo's swearing-in provides a measure of
how anxious the international community is to see Nigeria succeed.
Last year, when the West African giant was still under the boot of
General Sani Abacha, its most ruthless and corrupt dictator,
President Clinton conspicuously avoided the West African giant on
his tour across the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Since Abacha's sudden death last June, however, his dovish
successor, General Abdulsalami Abubakar, has won plaudits for
honoring his promises to hold elections and hand over power.
President Nelson Mandela of South Africa and Susan Rice, US
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, are part of a
long entourage of foreign dignitaries who will be on hand.
</P>
<P>
   The transition is good news on a continent so badly shaken in
the past year by the multinational conflict in Congo, a return to
civil war in Angola, and renewed fighting between Ethiopia and
Eritrea. A country rich in ill-managed natural resources, Nigeria a
potential economic engine for all of West Africa. The change also
opens an important new diplomatic axis between democratically
elected governments in Abuja and Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
   But observers are loathe to make too much of the moment.
Obasanjo's rise marks only the third time since independence from
Britain in 1960 that the military has stepped aside gracefully. The
last civilian government was thrown out in 1983 after just four
years in power, and military control has changed hands three times
since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hesitate to give this much historical significance in the
continental sense because there have been so many fits and
starts,'' said Makau Mutua, a visiting professor at Harvard Law
School. ``This is a tortured transition, engineered by the
military. It does not threaten the military's interests. But what
is important is that the most powerful nation on the continent now
says that democracy is essential.''
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria won't make a clean break from its troubled past, and
Obasanjo comes in with mixed credentials. He rose to power
indirectly, first as the second in command in a new military
government installed after the 1967-70 civil war against the
secessionist state of Biafra, then to the helm with assassin ended
the rule of Brig. Murtala Muhammad seven months later. He
suppressed democratic protests with violence, but three years later
became the only military leader in Nigeria's history to yield power
to an elected government.
</P>
<P>
   He retired to raise chickens and pigs, and over the years
cultivated his faith in the Methodist Church and became an
increasingly vocal advocate for human rights. He was considered for
secretary-general of the United Nations in 1991, and spent the last
three and a half years of Abacha's reign as the dictator's
political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   But Obasanjo is not without ties to his former military
colleagues. He most prominent campaign supporter was Ibrahim
Babangida, the general who toppled the civilian government Obasanjo
installed. Babangida is a recent convert to democracy, becoming a
critic of military rule only in the face of Abacha's brutality.
Obasanjo also enjoys warm ties with the outgoing general, Abubakar,
and so far has not demanded that the military's top brass resign _
a tradition that has marked previous transitions.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo was vague during the campaign, vowing only to attack
corruption and promising that ``whatever we do in economic terms,
not only will it be transparent, we will provide level ground for
all.'' In the months since the February ballot he offered few more
clues about how he will lead.
</P>
<P>
   He faces urgent and difficult choices. Abubakar laid claim last
year to recovering $800 million that Abacha stole from the public
purse. It has never surfaced, and is believed to have been
distributed to senior military leaders to buy their cooperation in
the transition. More public funds, looted over the years and
estimated to be in the billions, lie in offshore accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Obasanjo needs to call the military to account for stolen money
and human-rights abuses to gain the public's confidence. But he has
vowed not to conduct ``a witch hunt,'' and if he digs too deeply he
could alienate the already twitchy ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obasanjo was recruited by a small clique with military ties.
If he ignores that constituency, he runs the risk of being
overthrown,'' Morka said. ``But he must weigh in on the side of the
people.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, Morka says, he may buy some valuable time to begin
sorting out Nigeria's destroyed economy.

BAFFERT IN THE RUN FOR THE MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- No mapmaker could measure the true distance from the
Arizona desert and white cowboy hats and quarterhorses to the
backstretch of Suffolk Downs in East Boston, a quarter-mile or so
from the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Trainer Bob Baffert, who has traveled that route, arrived late
Thursday afternoon, his first time in Boston, sidekick Mike Pegram
in tow, the two fun lovers here to watch their Real Quiet go to the
post odds-on Saturday in the 60th Massachusetts Handicap.
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, direct as always, said there was reason enough to come
to Boston. ``If they put up $600,000,'' said Real Quiet's owner,
``I'm going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   From shortly after 5:30 Saturday afternoon to shortly after 5:30
next Saturday afternoon, from the Massachusetts Handicap to the
Belmont Stakes next week, Baffert and Pegram will be at the center
as one of the more remarkable weeks in the history of American
horse racing unfolds. Heat, lightning, and thunder all will clash
and crash, no matter what the gods of weather deign to provide.
Baffert and Pegram have unleashed the forces.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet would have won the Triple Crown last year if it
weren't for jockey Kent Desormeaux's ride in the Belmont, where he
came up short by a whisker, and Charismatic will be going for the
Triple Crown next week. But Baffert and Pegram have decided to play
hardball with Charismatic's trainer, D. Wayne Lukas; they have
entered their spectacular filly, Silverbulletday, in the Belmont to
run against the big boys.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, the plot is flush enough _ the best girl against the best
boy _ but the subplots are even more fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Lukas are rivals, to use a genteel word. ``Foes''
might be more apt, while ``nemeses'' could be the best fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lukas and the rivalry is good for the sport,'' said
Baffert. ``It gives me something to shoot for. I mean, I think
we're good for each other. If it wasn't (for Lukas), I'd probably
get bored.''
</P>
<P>
   Boredom may be the greatest foe of all for Baffert and Pegram.
And while any quest for the Triple Crown is electric enough,
Baffert and Pregram have ensured that no electric meter can measure
the kilowatts of the coming week. So while he schmoozed outside
Barn 20 at Suffolk, observing that ``the barns here are pretty
nice,'' Baffert joked about the rivalry, which he said has cooled
in intensity in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been getting along with the guy pretty good recently,''
said Baffert. ``I really respect him and what he's done. I don't
want to take anything away from Wayne.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Baffert had quipped and wisecracked about the
rivalry, which has grown since Baffert burst upon the national
scene when his Silver Charm and Real Quiet won the 1997 and 1998
Kentucky Derby and Preakness and just missed the Triple Crown.
</P>
<P>
   ``With Wayne, he's a very competitive guy and his deal is he
strives to be the No. 1 guy,'' said Baffert. ``I actually got there
without striving, just fell into it.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he took a couple of Belmont barbs at his archrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne Lukas doesn't like the fact that I'm running her
(Silverbulletday) in there,'' said Baffert. ``He won't say that,
but I'm sure he doesn't like it. Like if it was me going for the
Triple Crown, you'd probably see five Lukas horses in there. But
that's not me.''
</P>
<P>
   He also addressed the matter of training philosophies and
fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I bought an $85,000 horse, Silver Charm, and I win the Derby
and almost a Triple Crown,'' said Baffert. ``I buy a $17,000 horse
(Real Quiet) and I almost win the Triple Crown. Lukas was one claim
slip away from (losing a shot at a Triple Crown horse).''
</P>
<P>
   For the non-horse crowd, owner Bob Lewis and Lukas had
Charismatic entered in a claiming race as recently as February at
Santa Anita. But no horseperson submitted a claim slip to buy him
for $62,500; now Charismatic is one race from immortality.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Baffert put the rivalry on a personal _ or, more
accurately, personality _ level.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wayne is serious and he comes across as a workaholic and he's
focused,'' he said. ``But you can still be like that and have fun.
I'm focused but I like to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert said he couldn't sleep at his Boston hotel Thursday
night because of his comments. Friday he said he wants everybody
``to enjoy the Belmont'' and didn't want his quips to ignite any
fires. The rivalry has cooled, he went on, and his respect for
Lukas has grown, especially with the training expertise Lukas has
demonstrated with Charismatic.
</P>
<P>
   Another subplot is that Baffert trains some 15 horses for Lewis.
This is most sensitive, Baffert conceded, entering his horse to
possibly ruin the Triple Crown chances of one of his prime owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit awkward,'' said Baffert, ``but I told Bob,
`We're not trying to spoil your deal. We're just trying to win the
Belmont.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Overshadowing all of this is that Baffert, according to his
critics, has metamorphosed into the Lukas who was so roundly
criticized in years past, the Lukas whose ego seemingly demanded
that he always have a horse in Triple Crown races. Lukas himself
just might point out in the next week that if he had done what
Baffert did with Baffert's Triple Crown horses this year, he would
have been hashed by the critics.
</P>
<P>
   Excellent Meeting, Baffert's other fine filly, pulled up in the
Preakness, unable to finish, while Prime Timber suffered a minor
injury and General Challenge was not up to the task.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what's coming,'' said Baffert of the critics-to-be,
``but we're going for it because we've never won the Belmont.''
</P>
<P>
   Pegram, for his part, had his take on the hardball being thrown
at the Belmont. Charismatic ``wins the Belmont and he's Horse of
the Year,'' said the owner of Silverbulletday, who otherwise might
be Horse of the Year. ``But we know we've got an exceptional filly.
She's a great athlete, and you hate to run her a mile and a half,
but at the same time, great athletes do great things.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As Baffert and Pegram talked, Real Quiet was a mere few feet
away, there in Suffolk's Barn 20. Pegram said he still has a ``hole
in his heart'' from Real Quiet's loss by a nose to Victory Gallop
in last year's Belmont. ``We were sure,'' said Baffert, ``that he
was going to win that race.''
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet did not win because Desormeaux made a premature move
on the colt and, as Baffert tells the tale, went against prerace
instructions. It was not until weeks later that Baffert and
Desormeaux talked about the ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him before the race, `Just cruise around there; you
only have one horse (Victory Gallop) to beat,' '' recalled Baffert.
`` `Just sit there and sit and sit and sit' '' _ running like a
turf race _ ``but Kent rode him like he did in the Derby and the
Preakness, where he made this huge half-mile move. But going a mile
and a half, you can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   And when ``we talked two weeks later,'' recalled Baffert, ``I
wasn't that upset by the move, I was upset by the way he came out
in front of (Victory Gallop right at the wire), and I told Kent
that. I had told him that `whatever you do, don't do anything to
get your number taken down.' And when he saw (Victory Gallop)
coming and got in front of him, intentionally tried to impede him,
he could easily have been disqualified, and that would have been
worse.''
</P>
<P>
   If Victory Gallop hadn't won by a nose, the unthinkable might
have happened; the Belmont stewards might have disqualified Real
Quiet, taking down a Triple Crown winner. ``I think he would have
been DQ'd,'' said Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Stevens is riding Real Quiet now, and the MassCap will be
the jockey's last in the United States. Less than two hours after
the MassCap, Stevens will be at Logan Airport for a flight to
England, where he will relocate . . . at least for a while. ``I
think Gary'll be back in 45 days max,'' wisecracked Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The irreverent Baffert now is well known to the public, who have
embraced the trainer as racing's true ambassador. His popularity
has grown and grown, but he obviously is a horseman first _ his 16
stakes wins in the recently concluded Santa Anita meet eclipsed the
late Charlie Whittingham's record.
</P>
<P>
   He came from Nogales, Ariz., and 13 years ago, Baffert and
Pegram first met and hit it off immediately.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the spring of '86, I bought a quarterhorse with a
partner,'' recalled Pegram. ``That horse was running and Bob had
him, so I went over to Los Alamitos (a quarterhorse track outside
Los Angeles) and I said, `How am I going to know you?' He said,
`I'm the guy with the white cowboy hat.'
</P>
<P>
   ``So I get to Los Alamitos and everybody in the place has got a
white cowboy hat on. Then we're out in Ruidoso (N.M.) at a sale and
there's no plane out and I tell Bob, `No way I'm staying in
(nearby) El Paso for the night.' So we end up in Las Vegas for the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have been winning since. Their horses are better, the
purses are larger, and the egos are greater. As racing will see
this coming week, when their Silverbulletday will take on D. Wayne
Lukas's Charismatic, filly to colt, ego to ego.

CHINESE CRAMMING TO GET INTO THE US 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ While thousands of Chinese students were hurling
chunks of concrete and abuse at the US embassy earlier this month,
tens of thousands more were otherwise occupied: They were busy
boning up at ``cram schools'' dedicated to going to America.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing's most famous cram school, the recent protests over
NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade seemed as far
away as Yugoslavia itself. While renewed US allegations that China
has been stealing military secrets prompted another round of
official tirades against Washington this week, there is scant talk
in the school's hallways of America as imperialist enemy. The
chatter is all about exam scores, scholarships, and who got into
Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I may dislike the American government, but American people are
very nice to us, and we all want to go there to study,'' said
Shirley Zhu, 21, a student who has came from distant Guangdong to
cram for the business school exam.
</P>
<P>
   At the famed Beijing Oriental School, where 50,000 students took
crash courses last year, the message is clear: forget politics _
study, study, study, and learn to think the American way.
</P>
<P>
   That mantra seems to work; the school boasts that 1 in 5 pupils
scored over 600 out of a possible 677 on the Test of English as a
Foreign Language. They claim half the students who went to America
for an MBA last year prepped here.
</P>
<P>
   But a Stanley Kaplan cram school this is not. The tricks
students learn to ace exams include advice like use ``American
reasoning'' when solving logic problems _ imagine you're foolish.
Another teacher's tip: If an American visa officer seems ready to
reject you because he thinks you're out to find a husband and stay
in America, tell him you're a lesbian.
</P>
<P>
   In the last academic year, 46,958 Chinese nationals studied at
American universities (2,023 of them in Massachusetts), making them
the second-largest group of foreign students in the United States _
close behind the Japanese. That's a phenomenal rise from the 1,000
Chinese students who went to America 20 years ago, in the first
year of communist China's ``Open Door Policy.''
</P>
<P>
   For America, overseas students offer not only intellect, but
cash. Foreign students contributed $7.5 billion in tuition and
living expenses to the US economy in the last academic year alone,
making education America's fifth-largest export. In Massachusetts,
the fourth most popular academic destination, foreign students
spent $618 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   For China, the impact of sending students abroad is even more
dramatic: Exposure to America is reshaping the mentality and goals
of a new generation.
</P>
<P>
   Many students may believe their government's line that
Washington is trying to thwart a rising China, but they still dream
of an American education as their ticket to success. And as
fiercely nationalistic as Chinese students may be, many never come
back. The government admits that more than two-thirds of the
320,000 students who went abroad in the last 20 years have not
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Wang Zhihong, 26, a biophysics student who is cramming at
Beijing Oriental School and dreams of attending Harvard, says he is
practical in his patriotism. ``The US has the best education in the
world, and after graduation, I can serve my homeland much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Wang insists he will return even if others do not. China may
seem backward after living in the United States, he said, and many
might find it hard to readjust. But that is changing, ``and in the
future they will come back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese government is trying to make sure of that. In recent
years, they have forced students who receive government
scholarships to study abroad to sign a paper promising to return,
or pay the money back.
</P>
<P>
   For most students, however, the main concern is not whether to
return, but how to get to America in the first place. A monthlong
course on the Graduate Record Examination, or GRE, is $100, which
is costly in a country whose per capita income is about $3,000.
Parents save up and students take extra jobs because studying
abroad is seen as an investment with a huge payoff.
</P>
<P>
   In rented classrooms scattered across the city, teachers at
Beijing Oriental coach students to memorize 1,000 English words a
day. They suggest sleeping four to five hours a night and taking
breaks only to eat. One teacher tells his students to ``treat the
GRE like your lover. You must have the passion to overcome it. If
you hate it, how can you do it?''
</P>
<P>
   There are special lectures on how to write a personal essay, how
to apply to universities, how to face a visa interview. There are
movies at night to hear conversational English and learn American
customs.
</P>
<P>
   Some teaching methods may seem slightly unorthodox, but they
seem to work. The school claims that 1 in 5 students scored above
2,000 out of 2,400 on the GRE last year. And at least one in every
class got a perfect score on the English language exam.
</P>
<P>
   One teacher advises students that if they don't know the answer,
choose ``D,'' the most likely choice based on his study of old
tests. Another counsels that when solving logic problems, ``Don't
use Chinese logic. You have to learn American ways of thinking.
Remember, Americans are foolish. Choose the most direct answer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In the US, if you need one step to get a conclusion, it's
called logic. If you need two steps, that's philosophy,'' he
quipped.
</P>
<P>
   What may seem like an insult to Americans is really just
training in shedding ``convoluted Chinese ways of thinking,'' said
Yin Zi, 28, a former student who crammed for the Graduate Record
Examination. ``If they ask a simple question, we think too much and
have a thousand reasons why.''
</P>
<P>
   For many bright students, getting into school is the easy part.
Getting an American visa and adjusting to a new life are far more
daunting tasks.
</P>
<P>
   Yin, for example, has been rejected three times for a student
visa, but now is equipped not only with admission to New York
University, but with the confidence to answer questions from
notoriously tough visa officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They think you're not going to study, (but) just to find some
guy and get married. So my teacher told us if a visa officer asks
if you're unmarried, you can say, `Sorry, I'm not interested in
men.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Teacher Guan Weidong also tries to prepare his students for
surviving and working hard once they get to America. ``They think
life there is heaven,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added with a laugh, some cultural shocks have nothing to
do with school: ``I tell them that in America, the most difficult
thing is to borrow money from others, and the easiest is to
divorce.''

CAN THE INTERNET BE A CASH COW FOR POLITICAL CANDIDATES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Here's the scenario: A presidential candidate with
relatively little money stuns everyone by winning the New Hampshire
primary. Conventional wisdom says the victory would be fleeting
because the winner would have little time to raise money during the
compressed primary schedule.
</P>
<P>
   But what if, click, click, the under-financed candidate with the
moment's momentum goes on the Internet and collects enough
contributions on line in a few days to become viable? If on-line
companies such as Amazon.com can collect millions of dollars
overnight in sales, can a presidential candidate tap the same
market?
</P>
<P>
   The odds of this happening may be about to increase
dramatically. The Federal Election Commission is on the verge of
allowing on-line credit card contributions to be eligible for
matching federal funds, changing the current rules that allow only
contributions by check to be matched. Once the FEC gives final
approval, the first $250 contributed on-line by each donor would be
matched equally with federal funds, making the Internet far more
attractive to presidential campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The potential is enormous,'' said Elaine Kamarck, co-editor of
a just-published book about Internet campaigning called
``Democracy.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, only 11 percent of the candidates running for
Congress or governor accepted on-line contributions, said Kamarck,
a Harvard University faculty member and an adviser to the campaign
of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``By 2000, it will be amazing to me if 100 percent don't do
it,'' she said. ``This is a godsend for political campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who has taken considerable flak for having claimed to help
invent the Internet, does not yet accept on-line contributions.
Instead, the Gore Web site, www.algore2000.com, provides only a
form that people can print out and send with a check. Still, Gore
collected $20,000 with the limited service during the first quarter
this year. Kamarck said the Gore campaign is waiting for the FEC
final ruling on matching funds before accepting credit-card
contributions on-line.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Gore's opponent, former senator Bill Bradley of New
Jersey _ who does collect on-line contributions at
www.billbradley.com. _ had taken in $100,000 through his Web site
as of last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be a very big factor,'' said Bradley spokesman Eric
Hauser. ``You have the prospect of having very quick donations,
which could be quite advantageous in the compressed primary
schedule. It is really something that hasn't been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Every presidential candidate has a Web page, and most campaigns
are using e-mail to organize activists, especially younger voters.
There is even talk of using the Internet for voting, with Louisiana
Republicans studying the possibility for its caucuses.
</P>
<P>
   Before allowing online contributions, the FEC has had to deal
with concerns over credit card fraud, and finding ways to ensure
that the identity of donors can be established.
</P>
<P>
   It is not yet clear whether current donors will use the Internet
as an alternative payment method, or whether an untapped group of
people will start contributing that way. The answer might come in
the climactic phase of the primary season when regular contributors
have ``maxed out'' at the $1,000 limit, leaving campaigns to seek
new donors.
</P>
<P>
   The major benefit of collecting on-line contributions is that
donors can type in their credit card number and push the ``send''
button, automatically transferring funds to the candidate. That is
far faster than the traditional method of mailing a check and
waiting for it to clear the bank _ a process that can take up to
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Those 14 days can be a lifetime in politics during the
presidential primary season.
</P>
<P>
   In past years, an upstart candidate such as Jimmy Carter had
time after the New Hampshire primary to go around the country and
raise money for the next phase. But by 1992, when the late Senator
Paul Tsongas won the New Hampshire primary, he did not have as much
time to raise enough money to capitalize on his success.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 campaign, about half of the delegates will be
selected in the month after the first-in-the-nation primary in New
Hampshire. A candidate entering the primary without a huge war
chest will have little chance to capitalize on a strong showing in
the Granite State using the traditional means of raising funds.
</P>
<P>
   That is why candidates such as Bradley, Republican Senator John
McCain of Arizona and Republican Patrick Buchanan have all signaled
they will rely heavily on Internet contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The model for Internet campaigning is Minnesota Governor Jesse
Ventura, according to several specialists in the field. The former
wrestler and Reform Party candidate raised $80,000 on-line last
year out of the $300,000 he collected overall. Until the final
weeks before the election, the Ventura campaign had no physical
headquarters, but instead was run with two computers at the home of
campaign ``webmaster'' Phil Madsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that without the Internet, we
would not have gotten the additional 3 percent we needed to put us
over the top,'' Madsen said, referring to Ventura's 37 percent to
34 percent margin of victory. ``Without the Internet, we would have
lost.''
</P>
<P>
   In the seven months since that election, Madsen said, the
acceptance of using credit cards on-line has grown. Madsen, who
founded Minnesota's Reform Party in 1992, believes a third-party
presidential candidate could spring up late in the 2000 campaign
and ride the Internet to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It happened with Ventura,'' Madsen said. ``Now the technology
exists to create not only an uprising, but an instant organization
as well. The only thing that is missing is the candidate.''

FOR BEHRENS, IT'S ALL COMING DOWN TO THE WIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- When trainer Bob Baffert announced early last week
that Kentucky Derby winner Real Quiet was coming to Saturday's
$600,000 Massachusetts Handicap at Suffolk Downs, he stole the
spotlight from fellow conditioner Jim Bond and handicap star
Behrens.
</P>
<P>
   Bond, who had been pointing for the MassCap since Behrens won
the Oaklawn Handicap April 3 to take the lead in the National
Thoroughbred Racing Association Champions series, went on the back
burner as soon as Baffert, racing's quotable quipster, showed up
for his first visit to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   While Baffert has been meeting and greeting, Bond has been up at
Saratoga, keeping a low profile and preparing Behrens over the
Oklahoma training track. The Oklahoma surface is deep, but Behrens
has put together a top string of works, most recently a 5-furlong
move in a sizzling :59 3/5 Sunday. Behrens has been idle for two
months, while Real Quiet ran an outstanding race to win the Pimlico
Special May 8. But if the stopwatch means anything, Behrens will be
one tough customer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll find out if he's ready at post time,'' said Bond Friday.
``He's been training very good. It's fair to say that his works
would have been even faster on the main track. I take it one day at
a time. I'm hoping to keep things rolling along. We hope he's
peaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything is going according to plan. Horses just do well up
here in the offseason. It's quiet. We have our own private barn and
we're out of the way. No agents. No racing secretaries to bother
you. The Oklahoma training track is a little more consistent. It
tends to stay in better shape when you don't have to run races on
it. The better stakes horses just seem to do really well over it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behrens, a 5-year-old son of Pleasant Colony, has made a great
comeback from a dismal 1998 in which he lost all four starts after
a promising sophomore season. Last year Behrens was beaten twice by
Horse of the Year Skip Away at Gulfstream, then ran fifth behind
Silver Charm, trained by Baffert, in the $4 million Dubai World Cup
March 28. Bond put Behrens on the shelf until the Brooklyn at
Belmont June 13, but when he ran ninth in that event, veterinarians
went over him with a fine-tooth comb and discovered he had a
hairline fracture of the left hock. They stabilized the fracture
with a pin, and Behrens was back.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a real good 3-year-old (he won the Pegasus and lost the
Travers by a nose to Deputy Commander), but he was a little lacking
in experience,'' said Bond. ``He's getting better now with every
start. Last year there was a horse named Skip Away who put quite a
few horses on the sidelines. When Behrens came up with the hock
injury, we gave him a lot of time off. The owners (Rudlein Stable
and William Clifton) deserve credit. They could have retired him,
but the doctors gave us a pretty good prognosis. He went to Florida
and blossomed.''
</P>
<P>
   On paper, the MassCap lacks early speed. It appears Behrens, who
has a nifty turn of foot, can just fall out on the lead. If jockey
Jorge Chavez so chooses, Behrens can easily dictate the pace, which
is always an advantage. However, Bond is loath to discuss strategy.
``We'll see what develops,'' said Bond. ``I'm going to leave that
up to Jorge. We'll watch and see how the races go. Behrens is very
versatile, but you never know how things are going to come up.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, 41, is the son of a trainer. He took out his trainer's
license when he was just 16 and has had some nice horses, including
Will's Way, who won the Travers in 1996 and the Whitney in '97.
Bond entered Will's Way in the 1997 MassCap, and while he ran well,
he could do no better than third behind Skip Away and Formal Gold.
This year there is a special buzz to the 60th running of the
MassCap because Real Quiet is the first Derby winner to run at
Suffolk since Riva Ridge, Secretariat's stablemate, won New
England's premier race in 1973. But Bond is less impressed with
having a horse who has worn the garland of roses in the field than
the media or the fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not really, personally, a big thing to me,'' said Bond.
``It would be a big thing to some people, but running against Skip
Away was more exciting. That's just my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Baffert and Real Quiet have won the week, but Bond and Behrens
can still win the race and take back the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have some ideas on where I would like to run Behrens next,''
said Bond. ``Nothing is etched in stone, but the bottom line is the
Breeders' Cup (at Gulfstream Nov. 6). Saturday, Behrens gets the
acid test, and we'll see if he's as good as we think he is.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behrens will be vanned down to Suffolk this morning. Real Quiet
and British invader Running Stag, considered the other legitimate
MassCap threat, continued to stretch their legs over the East
Boston oval Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Real Quiet was on the muscle and galloped 1 1/2 miles strongly
under exercise rider Larry Damore. ``He was very aggressive this
morning,'' said Baffert, who watched the move. ``He's a difficult
horse to ride, but Gary (Stevens, who will ride in the MassCap)
knows how to handle him.''
</P>
<P>
   Running Stag went a mile in the traditional European style,
under a tight hold from assistant trainer Roger Teal. ``My horse
just looks super today,'' said Richard Cohen, owner of Running
Stag. ``He just went out for a little trot this morning, and he
went real easy.''

BLACK HEBREWS FIND REDEMPTION IN ISRAEL'S SELECTION FOR FESTIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Sweet and soulful, the voices of Gabriel and Eddie
Butler resonate with a sound straight out of Chicago's South Side.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers' now live here far from their Chicago roots and
are proud to be representing Israel Saturday night in the
international Eurovision song contest, a kind of Super Bowl of
Euro-pop watched by 300 million television viewers worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   But there's this one little problem. Even though the Butlers are
good enough to be crowned Israel's ambassadors of pop, the Israeli
government doesn't recognize them as citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The Butlers are members of the African Hebrew Israelites of
Jerusalem, a community of African-American families who made their
exodus out of Chicago's South Side in the late 1960s through
Western Africa to the Holy Land.
</P>
<P>
   The roughly 2,000 members of this community who live in Israel
today are strictly observant followers of Orthodox Judaism and see
themselves as the ``true children of Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   But Israel's Interior Ministry doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the 1970s and 1980s the group, commonly known as the
Black Hebrews, was labeled a cult by the Israeli government. It was
accused of running a criminal enterprise that included credit card
fraud. In the 1990s its image slowly improved and Israeli officials
now tolerate the group enough to provide tourist or temporary
resident visas.
</P>
<P>
   American government officials here speak glowingly of how the
Black Hebrews have transformed their community and the US Agency
for International Development has provided development grants to
assist them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I live here and I have a strong love for this country. We are
Israelites,'' said Gabriel Butler, 34, who came with his family to
Jerusalem from a South Side ghetto when he was 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are Israeli in the soul. Yes, over the years there have
been problems. We haven't always been treated right,'' he said,
sipping lemonade in the executive lounge of a five-star hotel next
to the sound stage where Eurovision will be held.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's all water under the bridge,'' he added, flashing a
serene smile.
</P>
<P>
   On the 30th anniversary of the Black Hebrews arrival in
Jerusalem _ which they see as fulfilment of a divine prophecy _ the
community is brimming with pride that Israel is represented in
Eurovision by two of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli cultural commentators and the community itself see
the brothers' band, ``Eden,'' as an expression of acceptance in a
part of Israeli culture, if not a part of its citizenry.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the intolerance the Israeli government has
shown his community and a history of Israeli opression of millions
of displaced Palestinians, Gabriel shrugs his shoulders and smiles.
``A lot of those images come from CNN, but are not necessarily the
truth. We have Arab friends, and Jewish friends, and we see people
working together. I've seen both sides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of Israel is of bullets whizzing by, but it's not
like that. Look at America. The image on CNN is that it's a great
and peaceful country. But we know that is where the bullets are
whizzing by in poor neighborhoods in Chicago,'' said Gabriel, his
voice rising to a preacher's cadence.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hebrews arrived in Jerusalem in 1969 after passing
through two years in Liberia. To avoid an international scandal of
trying to deport them, the Israeli government gave them tourist
visas and dumped them in Dimonah, a dusty town next to a nuclear
facility on the edge of the Negev desert.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Hebrews claim descendency from the tribes of
Israelites. They believe their ancestors were forced out of the
Holy Land by the Roman Empire to Western Africa before they were
sold as slaves to America.
</P>
<P>
   The sect emerged out of the fires of rioting in Chicago in the
mid 1960s and the fiery tradtion of ``Black Hebrewism.'' In Black
Baptist and Methodist churches many slaves and their descendants
identified with the biblical stories of the exodus. It was a belief
echoed in yearning Christian spirituals that sang of the Jordan
River and the Land of Canaan.
</P>
<P>
   The Butler brothers' father, Prince Gabriel Butler, is one of
the community's founding fathers. As a busdriver in Chicago in the
1960s, the senior Butler loved Sam Cooke, the Persuasions, and
gospel music. He began attending the South Side storefront church
of Ben Ammi Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Following Carter to Israel, the Butler patriarch, now 62,
brought his old record player and R&AMP;B albums with him. So the
younger Gabriel and Eddie and their seven siblings were raised in a
home that observed the Torah, but moved to Motown.
</P>
<P>
   The children sang in a choir that the community formed at its
own schools. Five siblings formed a band that performed at weddings
and parties to earn money for a community that struggled in poverty
since members were not granted work visas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the Butlers formed Eden. The band, which also
includes two Sabras, or Israeli-born Jews, describes itself in
promotional material as ``a blending of cultures, black and white,
Israeli and American.''
</P>
<P>
   After winning the Jewish state's spot in the annual Eurovision
contest, Eden will compete against 23 other contestants. Although
Eurovision draws a blank for most Americans, it can be a
career-maker to win; at least it was for Abba, Julio Iglesias, and
Celine Dion.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Israel's Dana International, a transvestite, won the
contest with a pulsating club tune called ``Diva.'' This year Dana
_ whose stardom has stirred the ire of Israel's ultra-Orthodox _ is
hosting the event.
</P>
<P>
   Eden, which sounds a bit like Boyz2Men, sings in Hebrew and
English and will be performing their song ``Birthday.''
</P>
<P>
   The song title, Butler says, is an almost mystically vague
reference to the 50th anniversary of Israel, the turn of the
millennium and the 30th anniversary of the Black Hebrews' arrival.
The song's theme is appropriate for the backdrop to the stage,
which is done up in a sureal millennial motif that features a
laser-lit sun at center stage and 7,000 blinking lights to create a
canopy of stars in the desert night.

 &HT;    Rookies ready to roll at Indy
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS - It was his first start in the Indianapolis 500
and one of Jack Hewitt's main concerns during last season's race
was getting in a veteran's way and having a negative impact on the
outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who lives in Troy, managed to avoid hitting anyone and
finished 12th.
</P>
<P>
   John Hollansworth Jr., who will be making his first Indy 500
start on Sunday, hopes to at least match Hewitt's success, but
isn't overly worried about keeping a low profile.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike Jack, this isn't my first IRL (Indy Racing League)
race,'' Hollansworth Jr. said. ``We've had the good fortune of
being able to run in Orlando, Phoenix and Charlotte. With three
under my belt, I hope that's a calming force.''
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth Jr., 35, is the oldest rookie in the race and also
the fastest, having qualified in 221.698 mph (12th starting
position). He will be joined in the race by three other rookies:
Jeret Schroeder (220.747, 21st position), Robby McGehee (220.139,
27th) and Wim Eyckmans (220.092, 29th).
</P>
<P>
   All four agreed they've never been so excited for a race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's just say that I've never been so darn excited to qualify
so far back in a field,'' McGehee said. ``This is the race, the
biggest race. It means everything to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Qualifying for the race was especially gratifying to
Hollansworth Jr., whose experience at the Indianapolis Motor
Speedway the last two weeks has been a family affair. One of his
brothers is his spotter and his dad has been here everyday,
watching his son's every move.
</P>
<P>
   Hollansworth Sr. knows a little bit about racing, having driven
Indy cars in 1966 and '67, but never qualifying for the
Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   In his honor, Hollansworth Jr. is racing in car No. 42, just
like his dad did.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be here is obviously the pinnacle of my motorsports career
to date,'' Hollansworth Jr. said, ``and hopefully it will only be
eclipsed by ... what happens on Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   After a talk with Indy 500 qualifier Steve Knapp, Schroeder is
setting his sights high Sunday. Knapp told Schroeder he doesn't
have to be in the front row to do well at Indy and he should know.
As a rookie last season, Knapp started the race in the 23rd
position and ended third.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier to start in the front, but this is a race of
attrition,'' Schroeder said. ``Anyone can win it. There's a lot of
car breakdowns and there's a lot of accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trying to treat this like any other event and not let
myself get too excited. If I do, it'll be difficult to get any
sleep and that's dangerous to your chances. I'm going to try to
have a clean race. If I do that, I know we'll finish well.''
</P>
<P>
   If Eyckmans finishes well, he'll have teammate Eddie Cheever Jr.
to partially thank. Cheever Jr. won Indy last season and over the
past two weeks has shared his knowledge of the racetrack with the
rookie.
</P>
<P>
   But like the three other newcomers, Eyckmans is on his own
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never so nervous before in my life like I was last
Sunday (Bubble Day),'' Eyckmans said. ``I'm so happy that I made
the race and I will see how it feels in the race on Sunday. It's
only my fourth race in three years and it's my second oval race.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I will see how it works and where we finish.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night of March 24, as NATO bombs began falling over
Yugoslavia, Hani Hoxha said he saw black-masked Serbs swaggering
through Djakovica, shooting, cutting throats and burning houses.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 in the morning, about nine miles east, a tank pulled up
and parked in front of Isuf Zhenigi's farmhouse in the village of
Bela Crkva. At daybreak the slaughter began there.
</P>
<P>
   That day, in Pec, 22 miles to the northwest, and Prizren, 15
miles to the southeast, Serbian forces began firing wildly and
burning Albanian-owned shops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Pristina, about 44 miles to the northeast, Serbian
operatives set fire to Albanian-owned cafes, clinics and the
printing presses of Kosova Sot, an independent Albanian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As it began, the Serbs' purge of more than 1 million ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo seemed to be a random kaleidoscope of
violence. But a reconstruction of the early days of the operation _
based on interviews with scores of refugees, and with senior
officials in Washington and NATO, as well as on a computer analysis
of reported horrors from many sources _ shows that it was
meticulously organized and aimed, from the outset, at expelling
huge numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   From this reporting over the last nine weeks, it is possible to
see the design behind the atrocities cited by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, in its indictment on Thursday
of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four of his top
officials for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   With specific charges including the wave of killings in
Djakovica and its surrounding villages and the forced expulsion of
Albanians from Pristina, the indictment accuses the Serbian forces
of a ``campaign of terror'' that ``intentionally created an
atmosphere of fear and oppression through the use of force, threats
of force and acts of violence'' in order to drive out Kosovo's
majority Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have insisted that most of the refugees fled Kosovo
because of NATO's bombing. Western officials, however, say the
plans were drawn up by the Yugoslav army and the Interior Ministry
of the Serbian Republic and carried out, under a single command, by
a variety of Serbian forces acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was a harsh refinement of a campaign last summer by
Interior Ministry forces that failed to crush Albanian rebels. It
was put into effect after a mounting campaign of terrorism on both
sides, including the ambushing of Serbian police patrols and
officials by the Albanians and several instances of the kidnapping
and killing of Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It seems evident that the operation had at least two major
goals: crushing the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and permanently
changing the ethnic balance of Kosovo by driving out as many
Albanians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hounding more than a million Albanians from their homes
accomplished two purposes for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   First, it removed the guerrillas' base of support and cover.
</P>
<P>
   And in the longer run, depopulating Kosovo defused a demographic
time bomb for the Serbs: Albanians already made up 90 percent of
the population and were reproducing at a far higher rate than the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although killing and torching were extensive, the Serbs' most
potent weapon was fear. The seemingly random, flamboyantly public
killings of the first few days meant that as the campaign
progressed, all it took was a handful of armed, masked Serbs to
drive thousands of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent accounts indicate that there have been killings of
from a dozen to roughly 100 people in more than 40 places. The
State Department now puts the death toll at 4,600, but that
statistic indicates a goal of depopulation rather than
extermination. It is low by comparison with the ethnic cleansing of
Bosnia, where in one massacre alone, at Srebrenica, the Serbs were
accused of killing 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   By early May, 90 percent of all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had
been expelled from their homes, the State Department says, 900,000
driven across the province's borders and 500,000 more displaced
inside Kosovo. More than 500 villages have been emptied and burned,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs began attacking Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds on
March 19, but their attack kicked into high gear on March 24, the
night NATO began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica, a city of 60,000 in the shadow of the Accursed
Mountains between Albania and Kosovo, was one of the first major
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army maintains its camps and staging areas
on the Albanian side of the mountains. Clearly, a Westerm military
officer said, the Serbs want to empty the area of ethnic Albanians,
fortify and control it to block the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors say they will never forget the focused fury of the
hundreds of Serbian forces who attacked Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   As in many places, the Serbs were guided to the most affluent
and influential families. It is not known whether this was on
instruction, or perhaps motivated by the greed, or grudges, of
individual attackers, but one effect may be to damage Albanian
prospects for rebuilding their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were selected homes burned in the beginning, after that
it was all the buildings,'' Dr. Flori Bakalli said, speaking in
English. ``There were special police, local police, paramilitaries,
and some of them civilians, armed. They were burning the houses and
they started to scream like a wolf _ `woo, woo' _ and they shot
people in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha, a dignified white-haired man, told of his family's futile
attempts to elude the Serbian attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from one house to another and finally to my older
daughter Tringa's house,'' he said. ``That night I saw an old man,
about 80, killed and burned and a 15-year old boy as well. We
stayed there for four nights, and the fifth night the Serbs came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around 12 o'clock, and we didn't have any electricity,
when they came, about 30 people, paramilitary, V.J. and Serbs from
Djakovica who had been given uniforms and guns,'' Hoxha said, using
the initials by which the Yugoslav army is known.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that the Serbs were looking only for men of military
age, Hoxha and two other men climbed out a second-story window,
dropped onto a wall and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next seven hours hiding in the narrow space between
two buildings, listening to shouts and screams and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning he came back and found the bodies of everyone who
had been left behind, some of the bodies burned. Later he said he
had learned that the Serbs had first shot his 15-year-old daughter,
Flaka, in front of her mother, then the older daughter, Tringa. His
wife pleaded with them not to kill the children, but then they
killed her. One of his granddaughters, Shihana, a spunky girl of 6,
ran away and tried to hide in a closet, but they killed her there
and set fire to the closet.
</P>
<P>
   As Djakovica suffered, other Serbs were at work nearby purging a
wide area they regarded as a Kosovo Liberation Army highway.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the region's villages, Bela Crkva (Bellacrkva in
Albanian), on March 25, soldiers and special policemen torched the
homes and farm buildings and killed at least 62 people, most of
them gunned down with automatic weapons in a stream bend.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a series of mass killings over the next few days
along a seven-mile stretch of villages in the rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, the third day of the NATO bombing, one of the most
well-documented of the mass killings, including an amateur
videotape of the bodies, took place in Krush e Mahde. Serbian
forces stormed through the village shooting down people, burning
some bodies, digging a mass grave with a backhoe for others and
leaving some lying in piles on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The violent emptying of the Djakovica region had a specific
military purpose: cutting off the Kosovo Liberation Army supply
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in a long stretch of villages, towns and cities across
Kosovo _ places either close to the border or on main
transportation routes _ there were similar outbursts of killing and
burning with another aim: driving out the majority Albanian
population.
</P>
<P>
   The border areas with Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro were
cleared first, often by wild bursts of killings that served as an
example. This cleared transportation routes that facilitated the
hounding out of people from other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the refugees over the borders, NATO intelligence experts
believe, served another purpose: overwhelming NATO troops stationed
in Macedonia with an unmanageable relief crisis, calculating that
the crisis would consume the alliance's energies and divert it from
preparing a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first use of a weapon like this in modern
warfare,'' a NATO intelligence officer said. ``It was like sending
the cattle against the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it was a tightly ordered, coordinated campaign,
from the artillery that shelled villages, to the masked gunmen who
killed, looted and spread terror, to the armored cars and lines of
troops who chased people hiding in the woods to corral them in
larger central towns for eventual expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the wild-appearing masked irregulars _ Arkan's Tigers, the
White Eagles and others _ were under tight control, NATO experts
said, and reported to the intelligence arm of the Yugoslav Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in there with Belgrade's blessing,'' a NATO
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people were clearly targeted, particularly men age 15 to
50, suspected or potential rebel fighters, and those who worked for
or rented space to the observer teams from the Office of
Cooperation and Security in Europe. There were reports by human
rights groups that doctors had been singled out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time, three weeks into the campaign, that the Serbs came
to drive the ethnic Albanians out of the north-central city of
Mitrovica, said Jacques Franquin, a U.N. official, it was enough
for them to gun down an old woman and a teen-age girl in one
neighborhood for everyone around to quietly board buses and be
directed out of town through traffic control points.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the knock on Bajrum Kelmendi's door came at 1 a.m.
on the night NATO started bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will kill you if you do not open in five seconds,'' the
Serbian police shouted, Kelmendi's wife, Nedima, recalled. Five
uniformed policemen burst in, forced the family to lie on the floor
and demanded money, one warning, ``If you are lying, I will kill
the little children.''
</P>
<P>
   They took away Kelmendi, a well-known human rights lawyer, and
his two sons, age 30 and 16. They told the elder son, Kastriut,
``Kiss your wife and two children because this will be the last
time you see them,'' the elder Mrs. Kelmendi said.
</P>
<P>
   The family found the three bodies by the side of the road two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Djakovica region, the Serbs had a clear military goal: to
cut off the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Pristina, like the other cities the Serbs emptied, was not a
rebel stronghold. In Pristina, the Serbian aim appears to have been
depopulation.
</P>
<P>
   And from some of the targets chosen, like Kelmendi, it also
seems clear that the Serbs set out to destroy the Albanian
political class and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The office of Rugova's Democratic League was burned down, and a
guard was shot and killed by the police at the newspaper Koha
Ditore, whose publisher, Veton Surroi, had been a delegate at the
talks in Rambouillet, France, early this year. The warehouse of the
largest Kosovar charity, the Mother Teresa Society, was burned. The
house of Rexhep Qosja, a prominent academic, head of the Albanian
Democratic Movement and another member of the Rambouillet
delegation, was torched.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, in a chilling display of force, the Serbs began
systematically emptying Pristina's neighborhoods, marching the
Albanians along streets lined with gantlets of masked gunmen draped
with weaponry, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   By the tens of thousands _ in an operation that required
extensive advance logistical preparations _ they were herded into
the city's railroad station overnight. At dawn some were packed
aboard trains bound for Macedonia. Others were loaded on buses and
even a refrigerator truck and dumped near the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethnic Albanians tried to stay in Pristina, living a
cat-and-mouse existence after eluding the first wave of Serbian
looting and expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Luljeta Jarina, 19, and her father, Ramiz, were among those who
went into hiding. Once when she ventured into the garden behind her
home, a Serbian sniper shot at her, she recalled. And each night,
Serbian soldiers and policemen cruised the streets of the city,
firing their Kalashnikovs wildly into the air. Just this Wednesday,
the Serbs rounded up 18 men, including her father, at gunpoint. All
but her father and two others were taken away to an unknown fate,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited two months, hoping something would happen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they found a Serb cruising the city in a bus _ an
entrepreneur driving refugees to the border for 20 to 100 German
marks apiece, about $10 to $55 _ and fled their native land.

 &HT;    Coke seeks class-action dismissal
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola asked a federal judge Friday to dismiss
parts of a racial discrimination suit that would enable the
plaintiffs to seek class-action status.
</P>
<P>
   A ruling in Coca-Cola's favor would mean four current and former
workers who filed the suit would not be able to add another 1,500
black salaried employees as plaintiffs in a class-action case.
</P>
<P>
   They could still continue the lawsuit on their own behalf, but
class-action status is crucial to expanding the case into a broader
review of Coca-Cola's record as a minority employer.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs allege the beverage giant has
engaged in a companywide practice of discriminating against
African-Americans in pay, promotions, performance evaluations and
terminations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite these broad brushstrokes and general references to
discriminatory practices, the named plaintiffs' and prospective
class members' claims have virtually no commonality, other than the
race of their proponents,'' Coca-Cola argued in its dismissal
motion.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the company said, the case would break down into a
``series of mini-trials'' with a wide variety of circumstances that
are inappropriate for class-action treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But plaintiffs' attorney Cyrus Mehri suggested the company's
motion shows Coca-Cola's insensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The class-action device has been an important tool to advance
civil rights for a long time,'' Mehri said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will fight to the bitter end to protect the rights of our
clients and other African-Americans to bring employment
discrimination class actions against employers. We will do
everything in our power to prevent Coca-Cola from turning back the
clock on the rights of African-Americans and others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mehri will soon file a formal challenge to the company's motion.
Then U.S. District Judge Richard Story of Atlanta will decide the
issue.
</P>
<P>
   The company also asked Story to postpone discovery, or
information gathering in the case, until he rules on the dismissal
request, which could take weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the judge rules against Coca-Cola, the plaintiffs still
must convince him later that the suit, filed April 22, merits
class-action status. That decision would only be made after months
of information gathering by both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the plaintiffs filed a motion asking the
judge to order Coca-Cola to notify all employees that the company
cannot retaliate against them for participating in the suit.
</P>
<P>
   The plaintiffs in the case are administrative assistant Motisola
Malikha Abdallah, security officer Gregory Allen Clark, consumer
information specialist Linda Ingram and former director Kimberly
Gray Orton.

NATO SAYS IT MISSED SIGNS OF SERB WAR PREPARATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By MICHAEL R. GORDON and THOM SHANKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The purge of Kosovo this spring was led by Yugoslav army
officers handpicked by President Slobodan Milosevic to replace the
internal security forces who had tried and failed the previous
summer to wipe out the Albanian rebels, NATO officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Allied officials now acknowledge that they missed signs that the
Yugoslav army was preparing a much more extensive operation in
Kosovo than they had attempted in 1998, one that would move well
beyond attacking Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds to cities and
towns that had no direct ties to the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   The Interior Ministry's drive against the rebels last year was
no half-measure. Special policemen and soldiers drove as many as
400,000 ethnic Albanians from their homes in and around rebel
strongholds. Then they swept east to west across the province,
sifting through the hordes of refugees in search of the elusive
rebel fighters.
</P>
<P>
   But NATO officials say the Serbs made a tactical error in that
earlier purge. They did not seal off the borders with Albania or
Montenegro, allowing the rebels to mingle with civilians and
escape. The Kosovo Liberation Army was battered, but not defeated,
and NATO officials say the Yugoslav army concluded that an even
more brutal attack would be needed to quell the rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   The fighting continued sporadically into the fall, when the
United States brokered a cease-fire under which the Serbs agreed to
pull back many of their troops.
</P>
<P>
   That agreement did not last long. Plainclothes intelligence
operatives from the Interior Ministry filtered back into the
province as the Kosovo Liberation Army renewed its attacks. Western
nations convened talks at a medieval castle in Rambouillet, France,
in hopes of forcing a permanent settlement.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials say they failed to appreciate that the Serbs were
girding for war while they talked of peace. In November, Milosevic
fired the chief of staff of the Yugoslav army, Gen. Momcilo
Perisic, who had made clear his distaste for ethnic cleansing.
</P>
<P>
   He was replaced with Gen. Dragoljub Ojdanic, a career officer
who NATO officials say had close ties to Milosevic and had served
previously in Kosovo. A NATO intelligence official said this
appointment was ominous for another reason: reports that Ojdanic's
daughter had been raped by an Albanian when he was a commander at
the Yugoslav army base in Prizren in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic also replaced the overall commander of army forces in
southern Serbia, turning to a general whose wife is said by Western
officials to be related to the Serbian leader's wife, Mirjana
Markovic.
</P>
<P>
   That officer, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, had previously commanded
the main Serb army in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Even more sinister was the appearance in Kosovo during the
winter of the notorious paramilitary groups that had played such a
large part in the killing and purging of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
   There were Arkan's Tigers, the private army of the indicted war
criminal Zeljko Raznjatovic, a parliamentary deputy from Kosovo.
Also spotted were the White Eagles of Vojislav Seselj, the
pistol-waving law professor who is a Serbian deputy prime minister,
and a band known as Frenki's Boys, led by Franko ``Frenki''
Simatovic.
</P>
<P>
   Such units had previously been the strong arm of Serbian ethnic
cleansing in Bosnia and Croatia. In Kosovo, according to U.S.
officials, they were formally under Belgrade's command, reporting
to Serbia's intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   The United States threatened to bomb the Serbs if they did not
sign a peace deal, which the Albanians had reluctantly accepted. In
February and March, Western diplomats monitoring the shaky
cease-fire saw the Serbs building up their forces. The question was
why.
</P>
<P>
   Pavkovic's predecessor as Third Army commander offered a clue
early that winter, warning that his soldiers could look forward to
a ``hot spring.''
</P>
<P>
   By this time, NATO officials say, Pavkovic and his colleagues
had worked out a new plan for attacking the Kosovo Liberation Army
that took account of the lessons from the failed attack last
summer. The Yugoslav army was in charge, with the Interior Ministry
taking orders from army officers.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the army planned to seal Serbia's border with Albania
so rebel fighters could not escape. A torrent of refugees unleashed
by the ethnic cleansing would be pushed across the border with
Macedonia, tying down NATO troops there that were poised to enforce
any peace settlement. It was, NATO officials now say, a ``hammer
and anvil'' plan in which the army would drive the rebels against
the closed border and crush them.
</P>
<P>
   NATO officials said they had no proof that Milosevic reviewed
the specifics of the operation. But one U.S. official monitoring
the situation said the military campaign ``was signed off and
approved at the General Staff level, and then, obviously the final
go-ahead would have been given by President Milosevic, as head of
state.''
</P>
<P>
   This assessment is based on the fact that as head of the
Yugoslav state, Milosevic was president of the Supreme Defense
Council, with ultimate responsibility for military operations.
</P>
<P>
   At NATO headquarters, alliance diplomats signed off on a
military plan of their own to bomb the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides prepared to execute their plans in March.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs moved first. On March 19, the Yugoslav army attacked
key rebel strongholds and lines of communication on the periphery
of Kosovo, saying it was defending itself against new rebel
operations. The 1,300 Western observers pulled out of Kosovo the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Pavkovic made no secret of his intentions, warning publicly that
his troops were poised to take care of ``internal enemy'' if NATO
went through with its threats to bomb.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Serbian security forces began setting fire to
villages that had never known rebel activity and _ even more
telling _ began expelling ethnic Albanians from cities, which had
never been used as bases by the rebels. NATO began bombing at
nightfall. The war was on. Within days, tens of thousands of
refugees would be streaming across three international borders.

CHICAGO REGAINS CONTROL OF PUBLIC HOUSING FROM U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The city of Chicago regained control of its Housing
Authority this week, four years after widespread mismanagement in
the agency caused the federal government to take it over.
</P>
<P>
   The change comes at a time when public housing across the
country is facing a dramatic overhaul, as cities tear down decrepit
and dangerous high-rises and try to move residents into better
housing in better neighborhoods. Nowhere is that goal more daunting
than in Chicago, where the high-rises have become poverty-plagued
and drug-ravaged ghettos and the city wants to demolish 11,000
apartments, nearly 40 percent of its public housing for families.
</P>
<P>
   With the withdrawal of the Department of Housing and Urban
Development, Mayor Richard Daley is seeking to take control of the
public housing system in much the same way as he has the city's
public school system, where he has restructured failing schools in
a relatively successful effort to raise student achievement.
</P>
<P>
   He has appointed as chief executive officer of the Housing
Authority a high-ranking school board official, and is filling key
positions at the agency with staff from City Hall. He will also
nominate seven of the 10 Housing Authority board members (the
remaining three will be nominated by public housing residents).
</P>
<P>
   Daley will also try to persuade HUD to relax certain rules so
that Chicago can have even more autonomy over its public housing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The central thing we're trying to do is to get as much
flexibility as possible,'' John Camper, the mayor's deputy press
secretary, said Friday. ``What we want to do is be able to use the
money to solve the problems, rather than meet specific federal
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   One proposal in a plan that will be presented to HUD in a few
months could involve asking HUD to allow Chicago to change the way
that rent is calculated in the housing projects, Camper said. For
the last 30 years, tenants have paid a percentage of their income,
a policy that caused thousands of working families to leave public
housing rather than see their rents continually increase while
tenants on welfare paid nothing. Chicago may ask to place a cap on
rent to keep working people as tenants.
</P>
<P>
   Daley is also considering leasing public housing buildings to
private developers, who would manage them. And, at a news
conference on Thursday, he said he wanted to provide residents with
more social services, like day care, job training and drug
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most difficult challenges will be relocating families
who live in the buildings slated for demolition. The goal is to
break up the huge concentrations of poor blacks and move them to
working-class and middle-income neighborhoods in the city. But so
far, most people who have moved out have simply settled in other
poor, predominantly black neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   While the Chicago Housing Authority's fiscal accountability and
management operations were considerably improved during its four
years of federal stewardship, the city still inherits a lumbering
bureaucracy. And given the Housing Authority's history of
corruption and mismanagement, the return to city control is fraught
with potential minefields. In fact, the Housing Authority's Police
Department is under investigation by the Justice Department for
possible misuse of federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge task,'' Daley said of the changeover at a news
conference on Thursday. ``It won't happen overnight. It will take
years to complete. We all must be willing to experiment and learn
as we go.''
</P>
<P>
   The new chief executive officer, Phillip Jackson, 48, grew up in
public housing. He worked his way up from a stock boy to vice
president for store operations at the now-defunct bookstore chain,
Kroch's &AMP; Brentano's. He served in the city's budget department
before becoming chief of staff for the Chicago public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Given his accomplishments, Jackson said at the news conference,
``Some people may look at me and say, `You did pretty good. CHA
must be OK.' But I didn't succeed because of CHA. I succeeded in
spite of CHA.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Success no longer is going to be accidental.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The annual showcase for electric cars, the Tour
de Sol race, was so crowded this year that organizers were forced
to turn some entrants away.
</P>
<P>
   But the crowded field was not so much a result of electric
vehicles finally catching on as of the new emphasis on another
class of vehicles invited to join. These cars, known as hybrids,
use batteries and electric motors, but also depend on gasoline or
diesel engines as well.
</P>
<P>
   In a change that might have horrified the purists who ran in the
first race 11 years ago _ when there were only 5 participants and
not all of them could finish the course _ the event was held in
conjunction with a major conference on hybrid vehicles, organized
with the Society of Automotive Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Hybrids are now the subject of intense efforts by almost every
major automaker. Toyota and Honda even plan to begin selling them
from dealer showrooms in the United States within the next 12
months.
</P>
<P>
   While electric cars have so far failed to catch on, burdened by
high cost and weak performance, a genuine market is about to emerge
for clean, peppy hybrids that can go twice as far as a conventional
car on a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Van Amburg, a spokesman for Calstart, a private nonprofit
group that is trying to develop a clean-vehicle industry,
contrasted the choice facing buyers interested in helping clean up
the environment: Toyota Motor Co.'s Prius, a hybrid already
available in Japan and scheduled to go on sale in the United States
next year vs. General Motors Corp.'s battery-electric model, the
EV-1, which is available in California.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toyota is selling a hybrid for $16,000 in Japan, a four-seater
with an 800-mile range, or you can buy a two-seat EV-1 for $32,000,
with a 60-mile range,'' Van Amburg said in a telephone interview.
``That's an easy choice for most consumers, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, electric car advocates are going through something
of a reality check. Nancy Hazard, organizer of the Tour de Sol,
told an audience of more than 200 experts gathered here that during
the first race 11 years ago, ``we debated which electric
technologies would be the first to receive market acceptance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hybrids,'' she said, ``were not at the top of the list. They
seemed too complex and too costly.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, she said, people who have refined electric drivetrains,
including motor controllers and charging systems, ``need to embrace
the hybrid at this point,'' because it will give them a mass market
for their components. ``We are on the brink of an automotive
revolution,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Electric cars have always been hand-built, often by hobbyists,
and expensive. But Toyota is selling 2,000 of its assembly-line
produced Prius model every month in Japan, with a gasoline engine
that turns the wheels and charges the batteries for an electric
motor, which also turns the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, when the driver wants to slow down, the motor absorbs
energy from the wheels and puts it back into the battery. The car
drew plenty of stares running through the streets of Albany.
</P>
<P>
   So did DaimlerChrysler AG's slick-looking Dodge Intrepid ESX 2,
with a three-cylinder diesel engine, 133 pounds of lead-acid
batteries and an electric motor. Chrysler has not committed to
selling that car, but has other hybrids in the works, as do nearly
all the major manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Honda Motor Co. said it was giving up production of
its EV Plus, a battery-powered electric, after selling only a few
hundred. But from the same factory in Japan, it plans to build a
two-seat, 70-mile-per-gallon hybrid for sale later this year; it
hopes to sell 5,000 a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority, meanwhile,
is running six diesel-electric hybrid buses on city streets and is
contemplating the purchase of hundreds more, because they seem
better suited than straight diesel models for stop-and-go traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, they are a lot cleaner; the diesel-electric bus has an
engine that runs at a nearly steady state, with none of the moments
familiar to every pedestrian near a traffic intersection, when
straining diesel engines dump clouds of soot.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Allison Transmission, a GM division that makes one
of the buses now in use in the city, told experts at a conference
in Indianapolis recently that preliminary tests on that bus, which
is equipped with a trap to capture soot, showed no measurable
release of the smelly and dirty particles.
</P>
<P>
   The New York MTA is ``very, very near'' to being comfortable
enough for a large order, Millard L. Seay, the Transit Authority
vice president for buses, said. ``We believe hybrids are very close
to being a production-available bus,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This is not unalloyed good news for the people who have
championed electric vehicles. Among their customers, the small
group of affluent environmentalists and ``early adopters'' who like
to have the newest gizmo first, hybrids loom large. Consequently,
they are holding off buying electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, has it been frustrating,'' said James D. Worden,
president of Solectria Corp., a Wilmington, Mass., company that for
several years bought Geo Metros, junked their engines, and
converted them to electricity. Now the company has a deal with GM
to buy the cars without engines at substantial cost savings, but
the potential buyers, he said, are sitting on their hands waiting
for the Toyota and Honda hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Worden said Solectria now did as much business selling electric
drivetrains for hybrid buses, trucks and cars as selling pure
electric cars.
</P>
<P>
   Worden is a perennial winner of the Tour de Sol, but this year,
for the first time, he sent others to drive his company's entries.
Instead, he attended the conference on hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   Still, engineers are far from a consensus about the best hybrid
design. DaimlerChrysler's have big conventional engines with small
electric motors that help on acceleration, giving a modest increase
in fuel economy. Their advantage is acceleration that resembles
that of a sports car. Another design has the gasoline engine run
the back wheels and an electric motor turn the front wheels, giving
four-wheel-drive as a bonus.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The more experimental models in the race are far more fuel
efficient, using big electric motors and small gasoline engines to
gradually recharge a battery pack. And while the major automakers
are leaning toward diesel, environmentalists _ who comprise the
backbone of the racers _ say diesel will never be clean enough.
</P>
<P>
   Cleanliness is a big motivator. California dropped its 1998
requirement that 2 percent of new cars sold in the state should
produce zero emissions. But it still has a 10 percent quota on the
books for 2003. The California Air Resources Board's chief deputy
executive officer, Thomas A. Cackette, told conference attendees
that the state would give partial credit toward the electric car
quota for hybrids.
</P>
<P>
   But the benefits of hybrids to the environment could be small,
warned James A. McCargar, a senior policy adviser at the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The auto industry, he said, is ``caught up in a size and
performance arms race.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Will hybrid technology prompt manufacturers to downsize
engines and translate that into fuel efficiency gains,'' McCargar
said, ``or will they use the hybrid technology to get even more
performance than we've had in the past?''
</P>
<P>
   The range of options was clear during the race, which is run in
stages by managers with clipboards and stopwatches. Organized by
the Northeast Sustainable Energy Association, of Greenfield, Mass.,
with a variety of corporate and government sponsors, race results
are available at www.nesea.org.
</P>
<P>
   This year, it is being run over a 250-mile route on streets,
highways and country roads from Waterbury, Conn., to Lake George,
N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from single-seat solar vehicles to two New York City
buses, 46 vehicles in all, participated. They competed on many
factors, including performance and energy use. Some zoomed, some
cruised, but, reflecting their wonky backgrounds, organizers
insisted on no speeding beyond the limit.
</P>
<P>
   During the race, high school and college teams rubbed shoulders
with corporate entrants. Some vehicles were home built and others
were extensively modified production models. All were covered with
decals advertising component manufacturers and other sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Race teams carried conventional car tools but the device of
choice for monitoring their vehicles and making last-minute tweaks
was the laptop computer, jacked into a port on the dashboard or
under the hood.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few years, it could become a more frequent sight in
the garages of America.

   GM Removes Itself From Industrial Pedestal &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Though often misquoted and taken out of context, a remark by
Charles E. Wilson that ``for years I thought what was good for our
country was good for General Motors, and vice versa,'' has long
stood for the view that the business of America is very big
business, so get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever GM's president was driving at in 1953, if he made the
comment today it would have to be ``What's good for Ford Motor is
good for America.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, GM finished spinning off its giant Delphi parts
division, reducing revenues enough to slip behind Ford on the list
of the world's largest industrial corporations. GM had been No. 1
at least since the 1930s and has sold more vehicles than Ford since
1931. (That, at least, is unlikely to change soon, despite Ford's
purchase of Volvo's car business.)
</P>
<P>
   Here is the arithmetic: GM had 1998 revenues of $161.3 billion;
deducting Delphi's $6.2 billion of non-GM business leaves it with
$155.1 billion. For Ford, start with $144.4 billion, subtract $1.7
billion for Associates First Capital, which it sold, and add
Volvo's car business (roughly $13 billion) and Kwik-Fit Holdings, a
newly acquired chain of European repair shops (almost $1 billion),
and you get about $157 billion. Ford wins by a nose.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's tenure in the top spot may prove short. The company has
considered spinning off Visteon Automotive Systems, its
parts-making equivalent of Delphi. Without Visteon, the Ford-GM
revenue race is a dead heat.

   Some Lessons for Japan Learned by Merrill, in Japan &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the Japan Society's annual dinner last week, David
Komansky, chairman of Merrill Lynch, promised not to proffer yet
another prescription for Japan's economic woes, on the ground that,
had Japan taken all the previously offered cures, ``the patient
would be dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But then he did exactly that, using Merrill's Japanese foray as
an example of how businesses there must adapt to new realities. In
the 1980s Merrill got nowhere trying to build an American-style
retail brokerage business in Japan. Then it changed strategy,
adding Japanese workers, decentralizing management and generally
trying to behave like a nimble start-up, Komansky said. And it
played down the bull in its logo, which many Japanese thought was a
buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   The shift worked, and Merrill now expects a profit from Japanese
operations in 2002, Komansky told the group. He also said Merrill
expected Japan to reignite Asian growth and is bullish on
investments there.
</P>
<P>
   But Merrill still has work to do in Japan. According to
Komansky, on casual Fridays, some of its employees commute to work
in suits and then change in the restroom.

   No Personal Advice To the Donor Intended &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Microsoft announced that Melinda French Gates, wife
of Bill, had given birth to the couple's second child.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Johns Hopkins University announced that the couple
had donated $20 million for family planning in the developing
world.
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to a Gates family foundation said that the timing of
the family planning announcement, so close to the birth
announcement, was accidental. Approval of the grant to train
foreign health workers at Johns Hopkins had been made some time
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the grantee is notified of the award, they choose the
time to announce it,'' said Dr. Gordon W. Perkin, a global health
expert at the William H. Gates Foundation in Seattle. ``It becomes
entirely disconnected to any event, certainly, in the personal
lives of the Gateses.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Gates said he has taken a ``paternity leave''
of about a week to be with his family _ now including Rory John, an
8-pound, 12-ounce boy, and Jennifer, the baby's 3-year-old sister _
at their sprawling lakeside home in Medina, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, the founder and chairman of Microsoft, holds company
stock worth about $80 billion. He has said that his children will
get only a small part of his wealth and that most of it will be
given away.

   Like his friend Gates, Warren E. Buffett, the chairman of
Berkshire Hathaway, plans to give away most of his wealth. Charles
T. Munger, the vice chairman of Berkshire, has a different plan.
</P>
<P>
   Buffett _ estimated to be worth $36 billion, second in America
only to Gates _ has said that he will use most of his assets to set
up a private foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With regard to inheritances: I'm a big believer in
meritocracy,'' Buffett said at the company's annual meeting in
Omaha recently. ``I don't believe that people should get a big head
start on life because of what womb they came from.''
</P>
<P>
   Munger, on the other hand, pointed approvingly to the
Rockefellers and what they have done with large inheritances. As
for his smaller but still not inconsiderable wealth, Munger, who
holds $1.3 billion in Berkshire stock, said that he would give his
money to his children.
</P>
<P>
   The facts of each family are different, Munger said. For
example, he said in a telephone interview, Buffett has ``got three
children, and I have eight.''

   When you're Robert A.M. Stern, dean of the Yale School of
Architecture, and someone plans a condo tower blocking the view
from your Upper East Side apartment, what do you do? First, you
join Tony Randall and others to protest.
</P>
<P>
   When that fails, you design your own high-rise nearby and move
there. Stern will live in the 34-story Chatham condominium on 85th
Street, at Third Avenue, when it is completed in about a year.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Stern nor the project's developers would say what he was
paid for designing the building or what he is being charged for his
own sixth-floor apartment, with a garden view. At 1,700 square
feet, the standard price would exceed $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't shop around for apartments elsewhere. ``Why would I?''
he said. ``I have the best.''

   Edsel B. Ford II, who ran the Ford Motor Co.'s car loan division
from 1991 until he stepped down a year ago, is now working on
museums and charities.
</P>
<P>
   One of his projects, the $25 million Spirit of Ford museum,
opens this weekend near the company's headquarters in Dearborn,
Mich., and it emphasizes the future.
</P>
<P>
   Theater seats shake and tilt violently, as the screen follows
the progress of a car through a modern Ford assembly plant. A laser
draws a Mercury car in the air while a crash dummy discusses how
cars are designed.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, 50, carries the name of his late grandfather, for whom an
unsuccessful car was named in 1957. Active in more than a dozen
charities, he remains on the Ford Motor board. A cousin, William C.
Ford Jr., 42, won the chairmanship late last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of my main areas of focus right now is to do what I can to
celebrate the heritage of Ford Motor Co.,'' Edsel Ford said. Next:
more preparations for Ford's centennial in 2003.

   BEDFORD, N.Y. _ Dick Kraemer, the principal at Fox Lane High
School here, was on the phone in his office when his worst
nightmare suddenly flared to life: An assistant principal rushed in
to say there was a ticking bomb in a student's locker down the
hall.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Tom Readyoff, the principal at Mahopac High
School, 12 miles north of Fox Land High School, was handed an
anonymous note, found on the floor by a student, warning that bombs
had been planted throughout the school.
</P>
<P>
   And about a week later, Bill Colavito, the principal at White
Plains (N.Y.) High School, came face to face with this message
scrawled in chalk on a classroom blackboard: ``A bomb is going to
go off at 12 o'clock.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the threats turned out to be real: The ticking at Fox
Lane High was from a toy, and the two bomb warnings were pranks.
But the schools' principals _and their counterparts around the
country _ point to incidents like these as clear signs that after
Littleton, Colo., their jobs may never be the same.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not the April 20 massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton and other tragedies in recent years were aberrations,
high school principals say that instances of school violence have
made them fundamentally rethink what it means to be a principal. No
longer just academics and administrators, the principals say they
are now acting more like psychologists, drill sergeants, prison
wardens, even field medics.
</P>
<P>
   They deal swiftly and harshly with even the most innocuous
student misbehavior, enforcing ``zero tolerance'' campaigns to
confront insensitivity and diagnose any potential for violence.
They have also broadened their schools' missions, creating programs
to encourage teachers to befriend and counsel their pupils, not
just drill them, all the while keeping a wary eye out for whoever
might be the next unnoticed mass murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Until a month ago, Kraemer of Fox Lane High said, the trend in
American high schools was to treat principals like product
managers, teachers like foremen and students like high-end product.
``In some ways, we innocently believed that schools could be purely
focused on academics,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But academics were far from Kraemer's mind when he ordered all
930 Fox Lane students onto the school's football field while police
investigated the ticking-toy incident. All he could think about
then, he said, was, ``I've got kids on a football field who are
sitting ducks for someone in the woods with a long-range rifle.''
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, he said, such dark thoughts were the province of
guerrilla leaders, not high-school principals.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone. ``What may have been taken in the past as
hyperbole we now take very seriously,'' said Colavito, slowly
making his rounds through White Plains High's teeming hallways
during a lunch hour.
</P>
<P>
   At Mahopac High, Readyoff has imposed a virtual lockdown at the
hint of the simplest student misdeed, instructing teachers to
challenge lunch-room line cutters or any foul language muttered in
passing. One student's desktop doodle about a bomb, just the kind
of foible that not long ago would have been treated with a sponge
and shake of the head, provoked Readyoff to call the student's
parents and a school psychologist, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the usual routines of many principals have
been disrupted. After catching wind of a rumor that the sister of
an unnamed male athlete at Mahopac High had found a black rose with
a note that read ``you're next'' stuffed into her locker, Readyoff
spent his day methodically tracking down and interviewing every
female student with a brother on a school sports team, only to
discover the rumor to be nothing more than that: a rumor.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the while you're doing this you have this sense that
there's nothing there,'' Readyoff said, voicing a common sentiment
among high-school principals. ``But it all ties into this fear in
the community.''
</P>
<P>
   Many school officials say that Littleton struck a raw nerve in
suburban high schools that have long felt immune to the violence
and threats of violence that are facts of life in many city
schools. While the Arkansas and Kentucky school shootings that
preceded Littleton were passed off as aberrations, after Littleton
``It was really logical for us to say, `God, that could happen
here,''' Kraemer said at Fox Lane High, an affluent school set into
the sylvan hills of northern Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The previous ones did not capture the attention of our
students and our faculty,'' Kraemer said.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing like community fear, Colavito said, to motivate
principals to change how they do their jobs. ``Any time there is a
crisis in a society, schools are the first place people look to
solve the problem,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He noted how, in the 1950s, school-based driver education
started as a way to curb rising traffic fatalities among young
people. In the 1980s, schools became conduits for a national
antidrug campaign. To address the current crisis, Kraemer, a former
physics teacher whose experience in the 1970s included a real bomb
that blew up part of a school roof, plans to foster closer
relationships between teachers and students.
</P>
<P>
   At Mahopac High, Readyoff shook his head as he recalled how one
of the teachers in the high school he attended made bad students
wear dunce caps and sit in the corner. Soon he plans to implement a
classroom program to allow teachers and the 1,400 students at his
school to discuss the importance of respect for one's peers, no
matter how different they may be. ``There has to be time set aside
for teachers to talk about these things,'' he said. ``That
awareness is out there now among young people, and we have to help
that keep going. We can't just let it die off.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be other ideas and programs to help principals in the
post-Littleton era, no doubt. Indeed, many school administrators
are already being flooded with direct-marketing fliers offering
books, software and seminars, all with same theme: stemming school
violence.
</P>
<P>
   But no software or seminar will be able to recoup what many
principals believe could be a permanent loss of innocence in
American high schools. At Fox Lane High, evidence of that loss was
evident in the image of armor-plated bomb squad specialists
tiptoeing up to a student locker packed with a harmless toy.
</P>
<P>
   In Mahopac, the evidence lay in the harsh punishment given to
the student who wrote the anonymous bomb threat: suspension from
school the remainder of this year _ and all of next year, too.
</P>
<P>
   And in White Plains, a lost age of innocence was the subtext of
the school's decision to hand over the investigation of the
spurious bomb threat to the city's Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be joy in school,'' Kraemer said. ``If you can't
have joy in school, you can't have a human connection,'' he said.
``I have a feeling that those two boys in Littleton did not have
joy in school.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Investors who have chosen to leave the stock of Intel Corp. out
of their portfolios have missed a lucrative ride.
</P>
<P>
   Figure: By the end of 1998, a $100 investment made five years
earlier in Intel, the semiconductor giant, was worth $805. If the
investment had been made in 1988 instead, the '98 total would have
been $4,210. And day traders take note: anyone who bought $100
worth of Intel at its initial public offering in 1972 and held on
would have seen the investment grow to $162,338 by the end of last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers have shrunk since then, because Intel's stock
has stumbled over the last few months. The shares are down nearly 9
percent so far this year amid rumblings on Wall Street that Intel's
days as a bellwether technology stock may be numbered.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Slater, principal analyst at Cahners Microdesign
Resources, a Sebastopol, Calif., firm that publishes technology
industry newsletters, took some time last week to discuss the
company and the challenges it faces. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)For years, Intel has been one of the stock market's
most visible, most successful growth stocks. Is that likely to
continue?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. One of the dichotomies about Intel is that its ability to be
the world's most successful semiconductor company and its ability
to have a monotonically increasing stock price are separate.
</P>
<P>
   If Intel's profits dropped by one-third, the stock would go in
the tank. But they would still be the dominant force in the
industry.
</P>
<P>
   The difficulty in maintaining the stock price is that the market
wants increasingly higher rates of return. There is no question
that Intel is in an incredibly strong position, but it is also
facing more challenges and underlying change in the environment in
which it does business than it has in a long time. I'm not going to
lose any sleep over Intel's success as a company. But I would not
make any bets on the price of its stock. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What sort of changes are you talking about?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Five years ago, the company was totally focused on personal
computers. They are still interested in driving that market, but
they are looking beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   The steady decline in the price of personal computers and
movement toward lower-cost systems is putting pressure on Intel to
maintain its average selling price of $225 for microprocessors.
Microprocessors that go into personal computers that cost under
$1,000 sell for $60 to $70, at most.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Intel has been able to maintain enough demand for
high-end microprocessors that they have been able to maintain their
average selling price. But there has to be a lot of concern the
average price will drop. And on a grander scale, there is the
question of how big a part of the world personal computers will be
in the future. I think personal computers will be successful, but
not so dominant as they are today. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why is that?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Today, about half the homes in this country have personal
computers, and if you want access to the Internet, you buy a
low-cost personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   I think the day is not far off when lots of other products, like
palm organizers or televisions with built-in Web browsers, will
offer lots of access to the Internet. That has the potential to cut
into the future growth of the personal computer market.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Internet access will be as widespread as telephone
and television. I don't believe the personal computer as we know it
today, or as it will evolve over the next five years, can possibly
be the device to provide that sort of access. It has to be far
easier to use, and cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   These are developments which seem to play to areas where Intel
seems weakest. For example, when you look at portable devices,
which I think will be more important, they are not competitive at
all. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Is this to assume that Intel can't make up for a
drop in personal computer demand for microprocessors by supplying
them to another business?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They are making a big play to become the dominant
microprocessor supplier for servers and work stations. Servers in
particular are a long-term, high-growth market, one that will be
profitable for them.
</P>
<P>
   With the introduction in 2000 of Merced, the first generation of
the IC64 family, they will begin to make a move into the larger
server business. And they have a good chance to become a dominant
supplier in that business. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Looking at the string of Internet-related
acquisitions Intel has made over the last year or so, do you think
they will be able to molt into a different kind of company?(end
italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I wouldn't count them out, but it is a higher-risk strategy.
When they were focusing on just being a supplier of
microprocessors, they could concentrate on a fairly narrow range of
things. Now they are going further and further from their core
competency. But they have great assets, not the least of which is
$10 billion in cash.

CHARLES E. ALBERS: OPPENHEIMER MAIN STREET GROWTH AND INCOME FUND 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Graphic of Oppenheimer Main Street Growth and Income is
being sent to NYT graphic clients. Non-subscribers can make
individual purchase by calling (888) 603-1036 or (888) 346-9867.)  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30)  
 (af)  
 By VIRGINIA MUNGER KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In April 1998, Charles E. Albers moved his computer models from
Park Avenue to Main Street. Or, to be more exact, from the Guardian
Park Avenue fund, where he had been manager for 26 years, to Main
Street Income and Growth, managed by the Oppenheimer Funds.
</P>
<P>
   Having beaten the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index by an
average of 3.7 percentage points a year at Guardian, where he was a
pioneer among fund managers in using quantitative methods to pick
stocks, Albers was hired by Oppenheimer to turn around Income and
Growth, which had fallen on hard times.
</P>
<P>
   How is he doing? So far, the results from his Oppenheimer office
in the World Trade Center in Manhattan are encouraging, if not
overwhelming. In the 13 months since he and his associate, Nikolaos
Monoyios, have been in charge, the fund is up 18.2 percent,
substantially ahead of the 13.9 percent average for its peer group
of large-company blend funds.
</P>
<P>
   But the fund _ whose name has been reconfigured to Main Street
Growth and Income, to reflect the managers' emphasis on total
return, not just income _ has trailed the S&AMP;P by 1.4 percentage
points. Performance has weakened in 1999; the fund is up 6.3
percent through May 21, versus 7.2 percent for its peers and 8.7
percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Albers said the gains slowed because he had positioned the fund
to take advantage of the historically strong first-quarter
performance of value-oriented stocks, a phenomenon that failed to
develop this year. ``Although our models are good, they are not
infallible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   When Albers started managing money in the 1960s, most stock
pickers had no data-based system, he said. But after studying
econometrics at Columbia University and working at Value Line, he
developed a ranking system that, while primitive, imposed a logic
on his moves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like a one-eyed man in the land of the blind,'' the
professorial-looking manager told a recent Morningstar conference
in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   That initial model ranked stocks on three factors; he now
considers 15 to 20, from price and earnings momentum to valuation
and special events like stock buybacks. In 1990, when Guardian Park
Avenue was foundering because it was tilted toward small-cap and
value stocks, Albers started using some broad, macroeconomic
factors in his system, to help choose stocks both by market
capitalization and their growth or value bias.
</P>
<P>
   He is still updating his method. ``We're making midcourse
corrections every week,'' he said. ``It's a combination of science
and art.'' The Main Street fund's turnover is 81 percent, versus 63
percent for the average large-cap blend fund.
</P>
<P>
   His recent trimming of his position in Microsoft illustrates how
the system works. Through the end of April, Microsoft was the
fund's biggest holding, at more than 5 percent of the portfolio.
Since then, he has cut it to 3.6 percent, roughly equal to
Microsoft's weighting in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   He made the change for various reasons: Microsoft is no longer
scoring in the top 10 percent in his screens for likely
outperformers. And his model indicates that a genuine market sea
change may be in the works, finally giving value stocks an
advantage over growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to try to align ourselves with the way of the
universe,'' he said, using a phrase he often repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Among the signals, he said, are an improved picture for
corporate profits; a steepening of the yield curve, which indicates
stronger business conditions ahead, and the very high valuations on
growth stocks like Microsoft, which has a price-to-earnings ratio
of more than 50.
</P>
<P>
   Albers also thinks that the outcome of the government's
antitrust case against Microsoft will be a negative for the stock.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to tell whether the outperformance of value
stocks over the last month and a half will last, so, Monoyios said,
he and Albers are not making major changes to the fund. ``We want
to see a persistence of factors over the long term,'' Monoyios
explained.
</P>
<P>
   Technology remains a major focus of the fund; IBM is the biggest
holding, at about 4 percent of the portfolio. Albers also finds
Hewlett-Packard attractive. He first bought it in March at $71.35 a
share, and at $94.3125, where it now trades, he still considers it
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   Another big part of the portfolio is in consumer cyclicals,
primarily retailers. Demand remains strong, while many retailers'
costs for labor and goods are flat or falling, he said, resulting
in wider profit margins. Wal-Mart Stores and Home Depot, both of
which had positive earnings surprises recently, are among his top
10 holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Other stocks that he finds attractive in his favorite sectors
are BellSouth in telecommunications and Merck in pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   As Main Street's returns indicate, the big challenge for Albers
and Monoyios will be lifting this leviathan _ with $15 billion in
assets, counting all share classes _ above market averages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fund is not going to be the No. 1 fund in any one year,
because we don't take those kinds of risks,'' Monoyios said. Still,
he added, ``being consistently good in the short run makes you
excellent in the long run.''

OLD ENEMY USED TO TREAT DEBILITATING HEART BLOCKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Runs with Q&AMP;A-CARDIOMYOPATHY)  
By PHIL DAVIS  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ He couldn't work. He could barely walk. The simple
act of bending over to feed the dog left Armando Figueroa dizzy and
breathless.
</P>
<P>
   An overly thick heart muscle was strangling the blood supply to
his body. And medications weren't helping.
</P>
<P>
   A heart attack was his best hope.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the very thing doctors have worked for decades to
prevent is showing promise as a solution for 50,000 Americans _
including Figueroa _ who suffer from a heart condition called
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, the 61-year-old Whittier pharmacist became the
first Southern Californian to undergo a controlled heart attack.
The experimental procedure _ called a septal ablation _ employs a
mild heart attack to pare down the muscle that divides the two
chambers of the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Figueroa walked out of Cedars-Sinai Medical
Center in Los Angeles feeling like a new man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out of surgery, my wife immediately noticed color
had returned to my face,'' he said. ``That afternoon, I went for a
half-mile walk. I hadn't been able to do that for a year and a
half. It's nothing short of a miracle.''
</P>
<P>
   Only four years ago, Figueroa's only treatment option, if drugs
failed, was for surgeons to cut open his heart and pare down the
overgrown muscle with a scalpel. Open heart surgery is risky and
dangerous. Recovery time is measured in months.
</P>
<P>
   Cedars-Sinai cardiologist Raj Makkar said many with Figueroa's
condition fear open heart surgery so much that they opt to live
with the pain and accept the chance the ailment could kill them.
</P>
<P>
   But Makkar, who had just returned from Houston after learning
how to induce the so-called ``good heart attack,'' decided Figueroa
was a strong candidate to participate in a national study
evaluating the effectiveness of septal ablation.
</P>
<P>
   The nonsurgical procedure was pioneered by Swiss physician
Ulrich Sigwart in 1994. Cardiologists have long known that heart
attacks thin heart muscles. Sigwart came up with the concept of
harnessing a heart attack in a controlled setting and using it to
pare down the overly thick interventricular septum.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors feed pure alcohol through catheters into the specific
arteries that feed the interventricular septum, creating a mild
heart attack in only that muscle. The procedure is monitored by
ultrasound.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the 90-minute procedure are immediate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's dramatic. You see the obstruction go away before your
very eyes,'' said Makkar, one of only a handful of U.S. surgeons at
two dozen hospitals participating in a clinical evaluation of the
procedure. The American study is being led by Houston cardiologist
William Spencer, who trained Makkar.
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa was awake under local anesthetic during the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a twinge, sort of like a leg cramp. After that _
nothing at all,'' he said. ``When I came out of the operating room,
I was already feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   There are risks. The alcohol can be toxic to other heart
muscles, so physicians must know exactly where to administer the
injection and follow it on monitors. Not all people with
hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy qualify for the study.
Also, the procedure is so new, there is no information on how
patients fare in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hundred people _ mostly in Europe _ have undergone
the procedure. In a 1998 German study of the 25 patients who
received the treatment, one 86-year-old woman died eight days after
the surgery and five patients required permanent pacemakers. The
rest recovered fully, according to a Feb. 7 article in the British
Medical Journal the Lancet. The procedure has since been refined,
and doctors like Makkar are cautiously optimistic. He has performed
the procedure on two patients so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very enthusiastic about this procedure, but I am also
curious about how this will pan out in the long term,'' Makkar
said. ``I caution patients that this is an investigational
procedure and, while three of four patients benefit from it, we
still need information on what happens 10 to 15 years down the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa has no regrets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime they're working on your heart, you're going to be
apprehensive,'' he said. ``But my quality of life had gone down so
far I was getting depressed. This seemed a lot better than going
through a drastic heart operation. I thought the odds were in my
favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Figueroa returned to work this month and is feeling good about
the future. He's even planning to play a little golf and take a
vacation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm still recuperating,'' he said. ``I feel like an
athlete who is out of condition. But I'm going for walks with my
wife and doing things I had not been able to do for a long time.'' &QL;

GENETIC AILMENT MAKES THE HEART WORK HARDER
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:  &UR; What is hypertrophic obstructive  &LR; c &UR; ardiomyopathy? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: &UR;  &LR; An inherited condition that causes excessive muscle growth
in the interventricular septum, the muscle that separates the two
chambers of the heart. The condition restricts blood flow from the
left ventricle to the aorta, the main valve of the heart. This
means the heart must work harder to move the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the symptoms?
</P>
<P>
   A: Shortness of breath, dizziness, fainting and chest pain. Some
patients experience abnormal heart rhythms that can lead to death
if untreated.
</P>
<P>
   Q:  &UR; Who gets it? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A: The condition is found in 50,000 Americans, mostly young
people.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is the condition treated?
</P>
<P>
   A: In many cases, the condition can be treated with beta or
calcium channel blockers _ drugs that help the heart function. When
drugs fail, the only options are open heart surgery or the new,
nonsurgical procedure called septal ablation.
</P>
<P>
   Open heart surgery requires surgeons to actually cut down on the
overgrown muscle. The relatively untested septal ablation requires
feeding pure alcohol through catheters into the arteries that feed
the interventricular septum, causing a mild heart attack that thins
the affected muscles. &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The perfect investment strategy stops working the moment you
start following it.'' So argues Harry Browne, a former investment
newsletter editor who was the Libertarian Party's candidate for
president in 1996. He's right: Many strategies that look good on
paper have only been back-tested, and very few are as successful in
the real world.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the many attempts to improve on the ``Dogs of the Dow''
strategy, which recommends buying, on Jan. 1 of each year, the 10
highest-yielding stocks among the 30 in the Dow Jones industrial
average. The strategy has beaten the Dow by about three percentage
points a year, on average, over the last 50 years, though with
somewhat higher risk. But that hasn't been good enough for some
advisers, who over the last decade have proposed a number of
modifications to the strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The first revision to find widespread popularity is known as the
Dow 5, in contrast to the original strategy, which is sometimes
called the Dow 10. Under the Dow 5 strategy, investors would simply
buy the five lowest-priced stocks among the Dow 10. In
back-testing, the Dow 5 performed significantly better than the Dow
10.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow 5, in turn, gave birth to the Dow 4 _ a variation that
drops the lowest-priced Dog, which was found to be a true dog in
performance. As a result, back-tested returns of the Dow 4 were
better than the Dow 5s.
</P>
<P>
   Research also found that the second-lowest-priced stock in the
Dow 5 was an especially good performer. Under a strategy called the
``Penultimate Profit Prospect,'' as described by Michael O'Higgins
and John Downes in their 1992 book, ``Beating the Dow,'' an
investor would buy just that one stock. In back-testing, that
strategy was an even better performer.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a strategy called the ``modified Dow 4'' put two of
those ideas together. It used the Dow 4 stocks, but gave double
weight to the next-to-lowest-priced stock.
</P>
<P>
   How have these revised strategies performed in real life? The
Hulbert Financial Digest has been tracking the Dow 5 and the
Penultimate Profit Prospect since January 1993, soon after they
were proposed. There is less of a newsletter record for the other
modifications, but regardless of the tracking time, none has done
as well as the original Dogs of the Dow. In fact, none has beaten
the Dow itself.
</P>
<P>
   That shouldn't be a surprise. Back-testing is suspect, because
it can involve what statisticians call ``data mining'' _ searching
a data base for a desired result, regardless of causes. Such a
search eventually leads to a ``discovery'' of a strategy that has
worked wonderfully. But that isn't the same thing as passing a
real-time test.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, with fewer than 10 years of real-world results,
however mediocre, statisticians can't be sure that these various
modifications are inferior. But there are reasons to be skeptical,
according to Grant McQueen and Steven Thorley, associate professors
of business management at Brigham Young University.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the professors found, the modified Dow 4 was
significantly less profitable in the 20 years before 1972 than in
the 20 years after. That raises suspicions, they say, that it will
work in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Another finding raises more questions. The professors duplicated
studies that documented the strong post-1972 performance of the
modified Dow 4, making a simple change: using July 1, not Jan. 1 as
the date for making annual portfolio adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   That calendar shift significantly reduced returns. But if the
modified Dow 4 were truly onto something, its performance should
have been immune to that change.
</P>
<P>
   But the most important reason to be skeptical of the revised
strategies is risk. The Dow 4 and Dow 5 are about 50 percent
riskier than the Dow itself, and the Penultimate Profit Prospect is
nearly twice as risky.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, the proper benchmark against which to compare their
performance isn't the Dow, but a hypothetical Dow that has been
leveraged to match their heightened risk. Even during the
back-testing periods in which the revised strategies performed so
well, they nevertheless lagged behind this risk-adjusted index. &QL;

FOR AD AGENCY GIANTS, THE WEATHER IS JUST RIGHT

<P>
   Beneath the patina of economic abundance, business competition
is intensifying. Hard-pressed to fatten profits by cutting costs or
raising prices, companies are pursuing a time-honored alternative _
trying to bolster sales by shoveling money into advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Businesses hate sinking money into advertising,'' said Mark
Greenberg, manager of the Invesco Leisure fund, which counts some
big ad agency companies among its core holdings. ``But they can't
afford to underspend the other guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year was the fifth in a row that the growth in advertising
spending in the United States outpaced the growth of the economy,
rising 7.1 percent, to $200.8 billion, against a 3.9 percent
increase in the gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   That story has not eluded the stock market: The average total
return of the Big Four global agency holding companies _ Omnicom
Group, Interpublic Group, Young &AMP; Rubicam and WPP Group _ was 37.7
percent for the 12 months ending Friday, versus 18.6 percent for
the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say there is reason to believe that the stocks haven't
finished their climb. ``Ad stocks have a consistent record of
expanded earnings outperformance late in the economic cycle,'' said
William Bird, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   Bird attributes the outperformance to several factors, including
the big agencies' global scope, which limits exposure to any single
country's economy. He also cites flexible cost structures _ meaning
that with staff representing about 60 percent of costs, the big
companies can readily economize by trimming their work forces _ and
their ability to grow through acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, he thinks some of the stocks are relatively cheap, as
illustrated by their PEG ratios _ the projected price-to-earnings
multiple for 2000, divided by longer-term projected earnings growth
rates.
</P>
<P>
   Interpublic, Omnicom and Young &AMP; Rubicam have PEG ratios of 1.8,
2.0 and 1.2, respectively, versus 5.4 for the S&AMP;P 500, Bird said _
much greater discounts than usual. He expects Omnicom, which closed
on Friday at $70, to rise to $83 in 12 to 18 months; Interpublic,
now at $75.75, to hit $88, and Y&AMP;R, now at $38.25, to hit $50.
</P>
<P>
   There are worries, certainly. Lauren Rich Fine, an analyst at
Merrill Lynch, said that any weakening of the global economy could
pose a big risk to ad agency stocks, because corporate advertising
budgets are tied to sales forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   But what some investors do not realize, she added, is that more
agency revenue is coming from recession-resistant services like
public relations and direct marketing. Those businesses now account
for $200 billion of the $417 billion in industry revenue worldwide,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   The economic downturn of 1990-91, which contributed to the worst
advertising recession ever, was an aberration, according to Robert
J. Coen, senior vice president and forecasting director at
McCann-Erickson U.S.A., which is owned by Interpublic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies abandoned marginal brands and waged a no-win
strategy of slashing prices to move inventory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Fine is especially bullish on Omnicom. Excluding its growing
portfolio of Internet agencies, she expects the company's earnings
to keep growing 15 percent to 20 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg, the Invesco manager, also expects agency stocks to
keep generating double-digit earnings growth for the foreseeable
future. Omnicom represents 4 percent of his fund's assets; WPP, 3.3
percent, and Y&AMP;R, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whether marketers favor cable, billboards or the Internet, he
said, ``advertising will always be important.''

PUTTING CHILDREN FIRST IN A TOY INDUSTRY SETTLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, Toys ``R'' Us and two major toy makers agreed to pay
$50 million in cash and merchandise to settle one of the largest
antitrust cases the toy industry has ever faced. Attorneys general
in 44 states had accused Toys ``R'' Us of using its clout with
manufacturers to keep popular items like Barbie's Dream House and
Fisher Price Nursery Monitors out of warehouse and discount stores.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the New York State attorney general, Eliot L.
Spitzer, took the lead in bringing the case, and Linda Gargiulo, an
assistant attorney general in the antitrust division, was one of
the principal negotiators of the settlement, in which hundreds of
thousands of toys, books and other educational materials will be
distributed to needy children over the next three holiday seasons
through the Marine Corps ``Toys for Tots'' program. None of the
companies admitted any wrongdoing in the settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Toys ``R'' Us agreed to contribute $27 million in toys and pay
$13.5 million, which will be used to buy more toys and educational
products. Mattel agreed to pay $8.2 million in toys and cash, and
Little Tikes will pay $1.3 million in toys and cash. Another
defendant, Hasbro, agreed last December to pay $6 million in toys
and cash.
</P>
<P>
   Next comes the fun part for Ms. Gargiulo's division: monitoring
the settlement, including overseeing which toys are chosen for
distribution. Last week, she discussed the unusual settlement and
how it came about. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why wasn't the settlement structured to benefit
directly the parties you said were injured _ the warehouse clubs,
discount stores and their customers?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. In a situation like this, it would be very difficult to track
down specific purchasers _ unlike high-ticket items, where there
might be warranty cards or other records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the amount of alleged overcharge to individual
consumers would be a relatively small amount, and it would be very
costly to the settlement to implement a refund-type program, even
if we could find the purchasers. So in these kinds of situations it
is not unusual to do this type of recovery, to benefit a class as a
whole. We viewed it as a very appropriate way of benefiting the
class to get toys to children. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Why is most of the settlement made up of toy
donations rather than cash penalties?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I don't know that we would have characterized it that way.
The companies can characterize it as donations or toy
distributions, but what it is is damages: we are recovering damages
for consumers. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)Given that the damages are tax deductible for the
companies, is there any assurance that they have learned a lesson
from this case?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. They are being required to pay out, in cash and in toys, what
we view as a substantial sum of money. We certainly think that will
have an effect on their future conduct.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there are injunctive provisions in the settlement
which govern their conduct going forward, and require them not to
participate in the type of conspiracy that was alleged here. For
instance, Toys ``R'' Us is enjoined from orchestrating any type of
conspiracy among its manufacturers to limit the supply of products
to clubs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)What were the negotiations like?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. We negotiated on and off over a period of about 10 months. We
did have several mediation sessions, which were conducted by a
former federal judge.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement discussions were certainly long and arduous.
Obviously, we started from very different places. When we started,
the defendants were saying they did nothing wrong and were not
really interested in any type of meaningful settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In any settlement process, each side weighs the strength of the
case, the likelihood of prevailing and the length of time and
expense of litigation, and a determination is made whether it makes
sense to end the dispute. Then, after a period of time, an offer is
made. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. (italics)How will you oversee the mix of toys that will be
donated and distributed?(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. My office will review the toys they specify and make a
determination as to whether they meet the criteria in the
settlement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   We will look for a mix of toys, for quality, currently sold
toys. We will make sure none have been recalled, or any of those
things.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there have to be toys that appeal to both boys and
girls between 3 months and 12 years. The settlement also
specifically provides that no guns be included in the toy
distribution, or any other violent toys.

here when the city tried and failed. It was 15 years ago, when the
epidemic was raging and bathhouses, as bastions of anonymous,
unsafe sex, were considered major contributors to the spread of the
disease. Now, in a city still in an official state of health
emergency after 26,000 reported cases of AIDS and 17,800 deaths, a
movement is growing to allow the reopening of bathhouses where men
can meet and have sex in private cubicles. By Evelyn Nieves.

<P>
   For 16 years, the brooding Marlboro Man made of plywood and
paint was the colossus of the Sunset Strip in Los Angeles. But now
that most prominent billboard on the curving avenue of nightclubs
and hotels is gone.
</P>
<P>
   In his place is a parody of Marlboro's icon of machismo: a
cowboy puffing on a limp cigarette, with a vertical message
proclaiming ``Impotent'' and underneath the warning, ``Smoking
Causes Impotence.''
</P>
<P>
   Impotent Man rode into Marlboro Man's territory last month, part
of the agreement by tobacco companies to take down cigarette
billboards across the country in a settlement of lawsuits brought
by 46 states.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-smoking message on a boulevard that has long been a
destination for sinners and sybarites (think John Belushi; think
Hugh Grant and Divine Brown) is the latest in a tradition of
eye-opening billboards in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The city is ground zero for drive-by messages, and the art of
attracting motorists' attention with sharp humor or shock value is
more lustily pursued here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, if an advertiser wants to experiment with something,
they'll run it in L.A. first,'' said Stephen Freitas, the vice
president for marketing of Eller Media, which creates billboard
ads.
</P>
<P>
   Car-bound Angelenos are an affluent, captive audience, and
billboards are tightly woven into the urban fabric, part of the
city's collective memory and conversation. People still talk about
the day last year when traffic was brought to a halt on the 405
freeway by what appeared to be a meteor-shape patch of blue sky in
a 14-story office building. It turned out to be a clever, if
unauthorized sign for the movie ``Armageddon,'' and was soon taken
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Billboards and L.A. go together like smog and traffic jams,''
said Bradley Johnson, an editor in Los Angeles for Advertising Age,
the trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The sunset of cigarette ads on billboards has meant a new dawn
for the billboard industry, especially in Los Angeles. The
settlement has freed hundreds of prime-location billboards at a
time when the fragmenting of television audiences has drawn
marketers back to outdoor ads.
</P>
<P>
   Rental rates for billboards, which the industry feared would
drop after the loss of tobacco clients, are rising because of new
demand, said Allen Rossi, operations manager of Outdoor Systems
Advertising, which owns the old Marlboro Man billboard.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most eye-catching recent ads promotes a morning radio
DJ named Big Boy. Big Boy is indeed big. Actually, he is hugely
fat, which he celebrates in self-mocking advertisements parodying
Calvin Klein underwear ads.
</P>
<P>
   They show him posing like a sultry model in silk shorts, with
his rolls of fat displayed in all their glory. The billboard reads,
``Morning Obsession,'' echoing a perfume ad. It is simple, funny
and provocative in its unashamed grotesqueness.
</P>
<P>
   Dianna Obermeyer, director of marketing and promotions for Big
Boy's radio station, Power 106 (KPWR at 105.9 FM), designed the ad.
She said the station makes fun of Los Angeles every day on the air.
So what better way to mock the city's ``obsession with image and
body size,'' she said, than to have Big Boy flaunt his 450 pounds?
</P>
<P>
   Poking fun at the Los Angeles life style is also the message of
the local chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to
Animals. Its billboards mock the dating scene. A big basket of
kittens carries the legend, ``Not Every L.A. Female Is Looking for
an Agent.'' An image of a bulldog embracing a kitten says, ``Some
L.A. Males Just Want to Cuddle.''
</P>
<P>
   Critical Mass, the agency that designed the campaign, also came
up with one for gang-plagued neighborhoods, showing a puppy and a
kitten tussling.
</P>
<P>
   The message is, ``No Kid Ever Shot a Friend While Playing With
One of These.'' Animal adoptions have almost doubled since the
campaign began three years ago, the Los Angeles chapter of the
humane organization says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing more Californian that can tell the story
better or more clearly than the billboard,'' said Scott Svonkin, a
deputy city councilman in West Hollywood, who should know. A month
ago he rented a billboard on Sunset Boulevard proposing marriage to
Jennifer Shapiro. She accepted.
</P>
<P>
   On the Sunset Strip, where boards rent from $30,000 to $100,000
a month, rival movie and television studios show off their latest
hit or star to one another on adjacent boards. And one of the most
famous local celebrities is Angelyne, who first rented a billboard
in Hollywood in 1984, put an image of her voluptuous baby doll self
on it and has never looked back.
</P>
<P>
   Angelyne, who can occasionally be spotted driving around
Hollywood in one of her three pink Corvettes, does not act, sing or
dance but has become a celebrity solely by her cleverly
orchestrated 15-year billboard campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The future is rosy in Los Angeles as far as billboard companies
are concerned. Digital technology promises new signage
possibilities. Under construction now on the Sunset Strip,
incorporated into a newsstand and cafe development, is a
large-screen, 25-by-18-foot video monitor, like a huge television
screen, which will broadcast round-the-clock ads.
</P>
<P>
   Other innovations include ``tall walls,'' which are giant images
_ more than 5,000 square feet, and many stories high _ that are
hung or painted on the sides of buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the city's outdoor signs, as brash and
self-promoting as Los Angeles itself, are cherished by some, to
many others they are simply eyesores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be great if they banned them all,'' said Richard
Holguin, the executive officer of the city's Building and Safety
Department.
</P>
<P>
   No law prohibits signs on commercial streets, although there are
rules regulating size, height and materials. This month, the city
council passed his department's measure to ban ``inflatables,'' the
jolly blowup dinosaurs, balloons, hippos and other creatures that
advertise auto dealerships and the like and are synonymous with Los
Angeles car culture.
</P>
<P>
   John Chase, the urban designer for West Hollywood, the city that
controls the Sunset Strip, said, ``In Southern California, there's
a real confusion about how to deal with the commercial
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   While some see the proliferation of head-turning billboards as
urban blight, others defend them as a car-based culture's authentic
art. ``Personally, I think I've glamorized billboards,'' Angelyne
said. ``I've made them dreamy.''

   No Rush To Upgrade Internet Stocks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's been a black spring for Internet stocks, with the Bloomberg
Internet Index falling 26.5 percent since its high on April 13. But
are Wall Street analysts slapping ``buy'' signs on the
reduced-price merchandise? Not especially, according to the First
Call Corp. of Boston, which tracks analysts' recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, First Call looked at the changes in analysts'
recommendations for 10 large Internet stocks since April 13. They
found that of the 19 changes since then, 9 have been positive and
10 negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite these stocks' being down, analysts don't appear to be
ready to pull the trigger and get more aggressive on these
stocks,'' said Chuck Hill, the director of research at First Call.
``And that's probably because they're already quite bullish on
these stocks to begin with.''
</P>
<P>
   The 10 stocks First Call examined were Amazon.com, America
Online, Mind-Spring, Lycos, Excite, Yahoo, Ebay, At Home, CMGI and
Doubleclick. According to Hill, the 10 stocks now carry an average
recommendation of 1.6, on a scale of 1 to 5, with 1 representing a
``strong buy'' and 5 a ``strong sell.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 13, the average consensus recommendation on the 10
Internet stocks was 1.7. (By contrast, he said, the average
consensus recommendation for stocks in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 is
2.2.)
</P>
<P>
   Zacks.com, a Chicago research firm, said the ``strong buys''
that analysts have on the Internet stocks it tracks have remained
flat since the end of March at about 37 percent of total Internet
stock recommendations.

   An Irish IPO Is Smiling As a Nation Lines Up for Shares &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ireland, it seems, is one nation that needs no lessons when it
comes to working up an appetite for a hot new issue.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of the Irish population is seeking to buy shares of
Telecom Eireann, the country's largest phone company, a person
familiar with the sale estimated.
</P>
<P>
   By Friday's deadline, according to that estimate, 1.2 million
people out of the population of 3.7 million would have
preregistered to buy shares of the state-controlled company.
Preregistration entitles individuals to a preferential allocation
of shares when they are sold later this month in an offering worth
about $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The share sale is scheduled to start in mid-June, with the order
period for individuals closing on June 30. If the government sticks
to this timetable, the shares will be priced on July 6 or 7, the
person said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, however, said no more than 45 percent of those
registering for shares were likely to buy them once a price was
announced.

<P>
   Domini's Proxy Votes Are an Open Book &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder how your fund manager voted on proxy issues that may
or may not have a direct effect on a company's bottom line? Domini
Social Investments, a New York money management firm and adviser to
the $995 million Domini Social Equity fund, has begun providing
such information over its Web site, www.domini.com.
</P>
<P>
   The site details the firm's pending and past proxy votes as they
pertain to each of the 400 companies in the fund's portfolio.
Visitors can click on any of the stocks listed, read a description
of the issue being voted on and see where the fund stands. Domini
plans to post its intentions about two weeks before each company's
annual meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of proxy vote disclosure has been something of pet
cause for Domini. In 1992, it began disclosing in semiannual
reports how it would vote its proxies on a variety of issues. And
in 1996, it published guidelines for its proxy voting procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is shocking that proxy voting decisions are generally not
disclosed to shareholders,'' said Amy Domini, managing principal of
the firm. ``We believe that shareholders have an absolute right to
know how their fund managers are voting their shares. Fund managers
are not the ultimate owners of the assets.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund has been evolving into something of a corporate gadfly,
helping to file eight resolutions this year alone. And the fund is
persistent. Since 1996, it has filed a resolution every year asking
the H.B. Fuller Co., the specialty chemical maker, to stop sales of
glue to the tobacco industry.

INVESTORS CAUTIOUS AS DOW DROPS 2.5 PERCENT FOR WEEK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By EDWARD WYATT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After rising relentlessly for more than two months,
the Dow Jones industrial average has given up a portion of its
gains in the last three weeks as investors begin to worry that
cyclical stocks that seemed underpriced at the end of winter might
be heading into the summer having risen too far or too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The prospect that the Federal Reserve Board might raise interest
rates in a pre-emptory move against an overheating economy, and the
inflation that it might bring, has also put a crimp in some
investors' hopes for industrial companies like Alcoa, International
Paper and Caterpillar.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a gain of 92.81 points Friday, the Dow Jones industrial
average lost 2.5 percent of its value this week, finishing at
10,559.74. That was the worst one-week decline in the Dow since
mid-January, and it left the industrial average roughly 5 percent
below its peak of 11,107.19, reached on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   Even after those declines, however, the bellwether market index
was still 15 percent ahead of where it started the year. Trading
was relatively slow Friday on the New York Stock Exchange, with
657.8 million shares changing hands, among the lowest totals this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Other market indexes, which did not benefit as much from
investors' spring obsession with cyclical stocks, also fell this
week. The Nasdaq composite index, which gained 51.37, to 2,470.52
Friday, nevertheless dropped 2 percent of its value this week as
Internet-related stocks continued their recent declines. The Nasdaq
index is up 12.67 percent so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index rose 20.43, to 1,301.84,
Friday but also lost 2.1 percent for the week. And the Russell 2000
index, which gained 5.76 points, to 438.68 Friday and which had
risen 14 percent the previous two months, fell 2.3 percent this
week. Those indexes have gained 5.9 percent and 4.5 percent,
respectively, since Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a fairly remarkable run over the last eight
months,'' said Michael Clark, head of U.S. equity trading at Credit
Suisse First Boston. ``I always find it a little peculiar when
people then try to search for an answer when we're off 5 percent.
The market has been very efficient over the last three to four
years at backing off when things got a little too far ahead of
themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark acknowledged that several factors seemed to be weighing
heavily enough on investors that they were not eager to go into the
three-day Memorial Day weekend without some hedges against
potential losses. Among them is continued uncertainty about the
progress of the battles in Yugoslavia, including the possibility of
a ground war involving American troops.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a plentiful supply of new stock offerings has
continued to come to market, tipping the balance for some investors
to an oversupply of shares and not enough buyers, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   The recent declines in the Dow industrials and most other
indexes retrace only a portion of recent gains. After rising in
nine of 10 weeks from the end of February through mid-May, the Dow
industrial average has fallen in each of the last three weeks.
Those declines date to the May 13 announcement that Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin would resign and include last week's
announcement by the Federal Reserve that it might raise interest
rates if it continues to see signs of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   The list of Dow stocks that gained the most this spring almost
perfectly matches the list of losers in the last three weeks.
Alcoa, for example, rose from $40.50 to $63.875 from Feb. 28
through May 7, a gain of more than 57 percent; in the last three
weeks, the shares have fallen back to $55, a 14 percent decline.
Shares of Allied Signal, DuPont and Goodyear Tire and Rubber have
followed similar trajectories.
</P>
<P>
   Interest rates, which have generally been climbing since the
beginning of the year, have risen more sharply in recent weeks. On
Friday, the price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 9/32, to 91
29/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
fell slightly, to 5.82 percent from 5.84 percent on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most active stocks on American markets Friday,
Microsoft gained 2 5/16, to 80 11/16, making it the single biggest
contributor to the day's gain in the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo gained 14 5/8, to 148, with most of the gain coming after
the company announced that in completing its purchase of Geocities
it had dismissed about 200 of that company's employees, or 63
percent of the Geocities' total. Yahoo will take a $68 million
pretax charge in the second quarter related to the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Paine Webber, which will become part of the S&AMP;P 500 index after
the close of trading on June 4, rose 2 9/16, to 47. Paine Webber
will replace Bankers Trust, which is being acquired by Deutsche
Bank, in the index. The announcement of its addition to the popular
index usually bolsters a company's stock price, as buyers and
speculators rush to buy the shares in the hope that more buying
will come from large investors who track the index.
</P>
<P>
   The hottest stock in American markets continued to be Starmedia,
which Friday gained 13 3/8, to 58 7/8. Starmedia, an online network
whose content is aimed at Spanish and Portuguese speakers in Latin
America, completed an initial public offering of 7 million shares
on Wednesday. The shares, offered at $15, finished the first day at
just over $26. On Thursday, the shares gained another 75 percent,
to $45.50.

FRACTURES IN REPUBLICAN PARTY STALL WORK OF HOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL and TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaker Dennis Hastert won the allegiance of his
fellow Republicans with a pledge to restore order to the fractured
House. But the Republican Congress collapsed in disarray this week,
abruptly leaving hours early for a holiday recess, without being
able to act on military legislation and failing to pass several
budget bills that Hastert had counted on finishing by Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   These setbacks raise serious questions about the ability of
Republican leaders to govern a House with one of the slimmest
majorities this century, when any five defections can throw the
majority party off course. The last time control of Congress was so
tight was during the Republican-led Congress of 1955. After that,
Democrats won control and held on for 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Every day this week brought a new defeat.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of Republicans defied Hastert to work with Democrats
on campaign finance legislation. Conservatives brought the House to
a grinding halt by offering endless amendments to an agriculture
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders pulled back legislation to pay for
congressional offices, for fear the Democrats would try to tack on
gun control proposals. And a bill authorizing Pentagon programs
collapsed because both Democrats and Republican conservatives were
prepared to vote to block it from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Only the week before, Senate Republicans had been driven into
retreat by Democrats over gun control. To some Republicans, this
made the disorder in the House even more ominous.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a better week than the Senate did because they screwed
up so badly that everybody noticed it,'' said Rep. Peter King,
R-N.Y. ``We did so little that nobody realized we were doing
nothing.'' He added, ``But we can't survive many more weeks like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The events showed that the House Republicans, despite a facade
of unity after their 1998 election losses, have only papered over
their differences _ largely through inactivity. The House
Republican caucus is still composed of distinct factions:
hard-right conservatives, traditional conservatives and
northeastern moderates. At any given moment they pull in different
directions.
</P>
<P>
   Even the House leadership is splintered. Both Dick Armey, the
House majority leader, and Tom DeLay, the House majority whip,
voted at times with the rebellious conservatives on the agriculture
amendments.
</P>
<P>
   In one party caucus this week, Republican say, Tom Latham of
Iowa talked of the dissidents who were defying the Republican
conference by undermining the agriculture bill. He then pointed to
the front of the room and said it was the party leaders who were
voting against the bills. He asked how they could tell others to
stand together if they themselves did not have the courage to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   That, Republicans say, brought a defensive speech from Armey,
who the next day stopped voting with the conservative dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   Making matters worse for the Republicans is the fact that
Democrats, seeing the possibility of retaking the House in 2000,
are showing a high degree of unity and tactical aggression.
</P>
<P>
   They are seizing any opportunity to promote their own agenda,
including petitions designed to force legislation to the floor on
issues like campaign finance and regulation of health maintenance
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Republicans continue to do nothing, we are not going to
sit back and do nothing,'' said Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y.
``Whether it's campaign reform or the patients' bill of rights, we
are going to make sure that the issues are joined and they are
going to have to decide which side they're on.'' Even if their
efforts never make it into law, Democrats believe they are
showcasing themselves as the advocates of an agenda that will
resonate with voters in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   From the start this year, House Republicans knew they would have
trouble governing because of the size of their majority. ``We only
have a margin of five votes,'' said Rep. Christopher Shays,
R-Conn., who broke with his party this week on campaign finance.
``We all know it's making it difficult to run the place.''
</P>
<P>
   Their solution was to opt for a minimalist agenda and a
low-visibility leader and to put a high priority on passing the
year's spending bills in an orderly fashion. They would then bank
on a presidential candidate to provide an agenda and a face for the
party in 2000 to rally voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether anybody wants to admit to it or not around here,
George W. is going to be the Republican Party leader across the
next 18 months or so,'' Rep. Joe Scarborough, R-Fla., said
recently, referring to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats argue that the Republicans are repeating the mistake
they made in 1998 when, instead of putting forward an agenda, they
relied on the scandals surrounding Clinton to carry them forward.
And they say that no matter which party wins, a presidential
candidate has congressional coattails only in the case of a
landslide.``It's a risky strategy to rely on a landslide in the
presidential election to protect them,'' said Rep. Martin Frost, a
member of the Democratic leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Now even the orderly passage of spending bills seems in
jeopardy. The Republican leaders gave their members a full week's
vacation for Memorial Day because they had expected two or three of
the 13 spending bills to be passed this week. None were.
</P>
<P>
   The conservatives _ led by Rep. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma _
derailed the $60.8 billion agriculture bill, making their stand
against that legislation because it was the first of 13 spending
bills to come to the House floor this year. The conservatives
threatened the bill with more than 100 amendments as a way to
angrily say that their party had no strategy to keep President
Clinton from winning billions of dollars in new spending on
domestic programs. Such spending would most likely have to come out
of the Social Security surplus, which the Republicans have vowed
repeatedly to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he was methodically offering more than 100
amendments to the agriculture bill, Coburn wrote to fellow
Republicans: ``Leadership believes it is more important to stick to
the calendar, even when that may mean sacrificing good policy
(controlling spending) and great politics (saving 100 percent of
Social Security).''
</P>
<P>
   Republican moderates also worry about the spending bills. But in
contrast to the conservatives, they argue the bills are too lean to
pass.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the Democrats are content to sit back and let the
Republicans flounder over the spending bills. ``How they deal with
it is going to be intriguing and very interesting to all of us,''
said the Senate minority leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. And
his House counterpart, Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, said
recently of the Republicans: ``This is their budget, and I assume
they're going to implement it.''

JAPANESE CHIP MAKER NEC REPORTS A LOSS FOR THE YEAR 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ It's been an especially rough year for NEC Corp., one of
the world's largest makers of semiconductors and a symbol of
corporate Japan.
</P>
<P>
   NEC announced Friday that it had lost 157.9 billion yen, or $1.3
billion at current exchange rates, in the fiscal year that ended
March 31, compared with a profit of 41.3 billion yen the year
before.
</P>
<P>
   Its famous chairman, Tadahiro Sekimoto, and his
second-in-command were forced to resign after a military
procurement scandal. In February the company announced an extensive
overhaul that if completed would eliminate more than 12,000 jobs,
one of the most sweeping employment cutbacks ever undertaken by a
Japanese corporation.
</P>
<P>
   NEC has said it wants to become a company that integrates
telecommunications and computer technology into systems for
customers, rather than remain just a vendor of the components that
go into those systems.
</P>
<P>
   That means moving employees into new jobs and exiting businesses
that are no longer profitable, like making commodity components and
home appliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those businesses that are positioned farther and farther from
our core businesses of computers, telecommunications and
semiconductors may be closed or sold off,'' Kouji Nishigaki, NEC's
new president, said in an interview. ``Of course, given the
cultural importance of lifetime employment in Japan, we won't go
into any widespread cutting of jobs, but we will make changes.''
</P>
<P>
   How far-reaching those changes are, however, is the pivotal
issue. Company after company has signaled an intent to change but,
so far, has laid out few concrete plans.
</P>
<P>
   A similar wave of intended restructuring swept Japan in 1993 and
1994, but few plans ever became reality once the economy picked up
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   NEC will provide more details of its plan this fall, having
already said that it would eliminate 10 percent of its work force
and vacate unprofitable businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Nishigaki promises that this time around, the changes are real.
``I think Japanese managers have learned a lot, and one thing
they've learned is that the Japanese economy is part of a global
economy and that we simply can't stick to Japanese ways only,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he cautioned against expecting a revolution,
explaining that Japan's labor practices will prevent one.
``Lifetime employment is a tacit agreement that most employees _
except for young recruits _ take for granted, and they plan their
lives around that idea,'' Nishigaki said. ``I think Japanese
managers feel a great responsibility to secure employment for them,
so their lives won't fall apart.''
</P>
<P>
   That sense of obligation will not stop NEC, Nishigaki said. He
noted that the company had already cut almost two-thirds of the
6,000 positions it promised to eliminate from international
operations.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, a combination of shrunken recruiting and retirement
will result in the elimination of 6,000 jobs, he said, while
another 3,000 jobs will disappear as the company sells off or
merges unwanted businesses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nishigaki was less precise about the future of Packard Bell,
NEC's troubled U.S. operation, which lost $500 million last year
and was largely responsible for NEC's poor showing in the last
fiscal year. NEC moved to isolate the unit's European business by
taking full control of it in February, but the U.S. business
continues to suffer from falling prices in personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Nishigaki is himself perhaps the biggest sign of change at NEC.
He is not an engineer, which itself is a distinction in the world
of large Japanese industrial companies. Although as a graduate of
Tokyo University he has the appropriate academic pedigree, he
studied economics and has held marketing and business-management
roles within NEC.
</P>
<P>
   He considers that an advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is required more now is a broad perspective based on an
understanding of economics and social affairs,'' he said.

ELTON JOHN RUNS THROUGH A MARATHON OF SONGS IN SEATTLE
PERFORMANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GENE STOUT  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Elton John was the color purple Thursday night at
Seattle's KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a flamboyant, purple-and-white plaid suit (with
rhinestone trim), purple T-shirt and purple sunglasses, the British
rock star mixed songs that were alternately hot and cool, buoyant
and bittersweet.
</P>
<P>
   The English knighted singer-pianist (who also wore a
skull-and-crossbones earring) ran a marathon for fans, performing a
nearly three-hour retrospective solo concert of songs from the
beginning of his career through the present. Fans responded with
whoops, cheers and standing ovations.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the show, a large crowd gathered close to the stage,
some holding cell phones in the air so that friends and family at
home could hear. Others clamored for autographs, which John was
only too happy to provide between songs.
</P>
<P>
   Selections came from early albums ``Tumbleweed Connection'' and
``Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy,'' as well as ``The
Lion King'' soundtrack and his new, rather poorly received
``Aida,'' written with lyricist Tim Rice (the only song from
``Aida'' was ``Written in the Stars,'' originally a duet with LeAnn
Rimes).
</P>
<P>
   With stage fog swirling around him, John opened with ``Your
Song,'' which launched his career in the early '70s. Several early
songs followed, among them ``Skyline Pigeon'' and ``Talking Old
Soldiers'' (from ``Tumbleweed Connection'') and ``Daniel.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated at his black Yamaha grand, the singer-songwriter
refrained from his acrobatic feats of the past, but his playing was
vigorous and impassioned. The crowd often cheered as he tore into
the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Sure-fire crowd-pleasers included a rousing ``Honky Cat'' and a
stratospheric ``Rocket Man,'' with reverberating vocal effects.
Among the rarities were ``Sacrifice'' and Bernie Taupin's ``The
Great Discovery.''
</P>
<P>
   Above the stage hung three giant video screens that captured
many of the small details of John's virtuoso performance, including
the reflection of piano keys in his sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   Behind him were five ornate mesh screens. The stage was also
decorated with three giant reels, each with a Versace emblem in the
center.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, John did not perform ``Candle in the Wind 1997,''
which he sang at Princess Diana's funeral to a worldwide audience.
Nor did he do ``Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,'' one of his best songs.
But he included such old favorites as ``I Guess That's Why They
Call It the Blues,'' ``Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me,''
``Crocodile Rock'' and ``Levon.''
</P>
<P>
   John sipped from a can of Diet Coke throughout the concert, as
if he were doing a commercial. Occasionally he hoisted the can into
the air with a grin, as if to toast his fans.
</P>
<P>
   In the show's final moments, John thrilled the crowd with a
teasing, explosive ``Bennie and the Jets.'' He began by pounding
out a single note, bringing a roar from fans.

WITH INDICTMENT, VOICE OF MILOSEVIC EVEN LESS LIKELY TO BE HEARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By   SERGE SCHMEMANN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott,
President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland and Viktor Chernomyrdin of
Russia sat down to talk about Kosovo this week at Stalin's old
dacha outside Moscow, they pulled up an empty chair. The fourth
chair, according to an American official, was to remind them at all
times that the key figure in their endeavor was not there.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, since his indictment on Thursday on charges of war
crimes by the international tribunal in The Hague, it is virtually
certain that President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia will never
sit in that fourth chair, at least not with an American present. As
an indicted war criminal, he is unlikely to join in negotiations
with NATO.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration would like the indictment to impress
on the Yugoslavs that their options are narrowing as long as
Milosevic remains their president. They hope, too, that the
Russians might use the charge as a way to distance themselves from
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But the empty chair stands as a stark reminder to the American,
the Finn and the Russian that even as they try to steer through the
deep differences among them in search of a diplomatic conclusion to
the bombing of Kosovo, none of them _ not Ahtisaari, who represents
the European Union, and not even Chernomyrdin, the self-appointed
counsel for Serbia _ can speak for Milosevic, or even really gauge
his thinking.
</P>
<P>
   After the talks this week in Moscow, Chernomyrdin, President
Boris Yeltsin's personal envoy for the Balkans, made his fourth
journey to Belgrade on Friday to meet with Milosevic. As in the
past, no specifics of his mission were made public, but it seemed
certain that the indictment and its impact on Milosevic's readiness
to deal would be among the topics.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott flew back from Moscow to Washington Friday. ``We don't
know the effect of the indictment,'' he said in a telephone
interview from his plane. ``We have a strong view that the
indictment is justified, that it is a confirmation, a vindication
of one of the premises of our policies.''

REP. MCGOVERN DENIES BIG DIG CRITICISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after receiving a scolding from the head of
the Massachusetts Turnpike Authority, US Representative James P.
McGovern fired back, denying Friday he had ever criticized the
authority's pet project, the Big Dig.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, a Massachusetts Democrat, had attacked directors of
the Big Dig earlier in the week, after the release of an audit that
said the project was improperly funneling federal money into a
trust fund, which was then used as an insurance policy for the
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   The audit by the inspector general of the US Transportation
Department concluded that the Big Dig was required to return as
much as $150 million to the federal government. State officials
denied the charges, saying they had developed an innovative way to
protect their finances.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern, along with several other Democrats in the
Massachusetts congressional delegation, seized on the audit and
criticized the project's directors for being reckless with
taxpayers' funds. That sparked a battle with MTA chairman James J.
Kerasiotis, who wrote a biting letter Thursday imploring McGovern
to ``stop whining.''
</P>
<P>
   McGovern wrote back Friday, thanking Kerasiotis for his letter
and saying he was ``eager to work closely'' with Republican state
officials, including Governor Paul Cellucci. McGovern defended his
concerns about the audit findings. ``Only by supporting aggressive
oversight of these funds that the delegation can have the
credibility in Congress to request additional funds,'' his letter
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moreover, it's important to note that I have never been, nor
will I ever be, a critic of the Big Dig itself,'' McGovern
continued. ``But the Big Dig must not preclude or exclude other
vital transportation projects throughout the Commonwealth, and the
federal funding used in the Big Dig must always be used properly
and in accordance with federal guidelines.''

MASS. CONSULTANTING GROUP BUYING CALIFORNIA UNIT OF EDIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- A Massachusetts company is making an acquisition in
California's Silicon Valley, reversing a general pattern of late.
</P>
<P>
   Workscape Inc. of Natick said it plans to buy another
human-resources consulting group, based in Santa Clara, Calif.,
which will add about 70 employees to Workscape's current staff of
90.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Workscape declined to disclose how much cash it
spent to buy the business unit from Edify Corp., but said the unit
had revenue of about $20 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   Workscape is the successor company to what was once Employee
Communications Services, which Workscape's principals bought out
last fall with backing from Warburg, Pincus &AMP; Co. LLC in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To date Workscape has grown by operating databases and Websites
for companies which want to make benefits information available to
employees over the Internet. Clients include Fleet Financial Group
Inc., Citigroup Inc.'s Travelers units, and Cigna Insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Now it will add Edify's Employee Relationship Management Group,
which operates more extensive benefits-consulting services, such as
installing software at the employer's own facilities. Its clients
include the US Postal Service and Warner-Lambert Co.
</P>
<P>
   Workscape will also take control of a small Edify sales office
in Waltham, with about eight employees.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the purchase will help Workscape offer a wider range
of services, said Workscape president Tim Clifford. ``We're taking
on a lot of the mundane tasks and making them more self-service,''
he said. ``That allows employers' HR and benefits departments to be
more strategic partners of employees rather than having to spend
more time answering questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Workscape said it will gain about 200 new clients as a result of
the transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the Edify unit comes as the company is being
purchased by Atlanta-based Security First Technologies Corp.
</P>
<P>
   BancBoston Robertson Stephens analyst Jon Ekoniak said the
relationship-management unit didn't really fit the the rest of
Edify's business, primarily aimed at the financial industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unit deals more with the human-resources side,so they're
really going after a different group of customers than what
Security First wants,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ While Italy's phone company fell prey last week to
Europe's largest hostile takeover ever, the nation's banks are not
afraid, for the moment at least, of unfriendly suitors.
</P>
<P>
   Italian banks, like those across Europe, are struggling to
merge, to cut costs and create the larger capital bases they will
need to finance customers on the euro market. Yet recent efforts
have failed.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Banca Commerciale Italiana, the No. 4 bank
in Italy, rejected a $14 billion takeover offer from Unicredito
Italiano, the No. 3, after having concluded that the nation's
central bank would block the bid.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the central bank had refused to authorize a $9.7
billion bid by San Paolo-IMI of Turin, the nation's largest, for
Banca di Roma, after Banca di Roma's board defined the bid as
``hostile and unacceptable'' and the central bank's president,
Antonio Fazio, said he would not approve hostile bids for banks.
</P>
<P>
   The failure of those bids, the largest in Italian banking, has
led to a debate about the consequences for the beleaguered
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Emanuele Minotti of Salomon Smith Barney defended the central
bank's decision. ``Fazio is a fair man and a gentleman,'' he said,
adding that it was the duty of the central bank to ``protect the
savings of customers.'' Unlike bids in telecommunications, he said,
hostile bids in banking involved ``offering money to buy money,''
and he added, ``A bank is not a slot machine.''
</P>
<P>
   Giancarlo Forestieri, a professor of finance at the Bocconi
business school in Milan, agreed that the central bank acted out of
what he called a desire for stability as well as some unease over
the novelty of large-scale hostile bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a few years,'' he said, ``that managements are
accustomed to thinking in market terms.''
</P>
<P>
   But the impatience among stock traders for consolidation in
Italian banking is clear. Shares of Unicredito, for example, fell
for three consecutive days this week, and finished the week at
4.515 euros, down 6 percent for the week and down 10 percent since
the bid was disclosed late in March. San Paolo-IMI fared similarly,
closing at 12.931 euros, down 5 percent for the week and down about
14 percent since late March.
</P>
<P>
   Alessandro Profumo can understand investor sentiment. Profumo,
42, the chief executive of Unicredito, is a leading proponent of
consolidation in Italian banking.
</P>
<P>
   When European banks finish consolidating within their national
borders, cross-border consolidation will begin, he argues, and
Italy desperately needs two or three big banks to negotiate ``on an
even field, not as giants with pygmies.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the Italian banks have been standing still. Unicredito
itself is the fruit of a merger last year of Credito Italiano, the
former state bank that was taken public in 1994, and the Unicredito
savings bank. And San Paolo got bigger by acquiring the investment
bank IMI.
</P>
<P>
   The government has reduced its stake in the banking industry to
about 20 percent, from 68 percent two years ago, and banks have
increased productivity, cutting employment to 318,000 last year,
from 335,000 five years earlier. Henry MacNevin, Italian banking
analyst at Moody's Investors Service in London, said Italian banks
are ``headed in the right direction,'' even if ``there will be
jolts along the way.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Profumo is probably one of the Italian bankers best prepared for
the jolts. He is convinced that cross-border mergers and
acquisitions in Europe will begin sometime ``this year or next.''
</P>
<P>
   Since taking control at Unicredito in 1995, Profumo, a former
McKinsey &AMP; Co. bank consultant, has lifted return on equity to 15
percent, compared with a national average below 5 percent, and is
aiming for 22 percent in 2002, provided Unicredito finds an ally.
</P>
<P>
   In June, he hopes to conclude a deal for Unicredito to acquire
control of Bank Pekao SA, the No. 1 bank in Poland by assets, that
will give Unicredito a bridgehead into promising future markets in
Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, he says, harbingers of cross-border takeovers are
evident. In January, Deutsche Bank, the German market leader, took
a small stake, three-quarters of 1 percent, in Unicredito. Earlier,
Deutsche Bank, Commerzbank, also of Germany, and Paribas of France
had acquired more than 4 percent each of Commerciale, and ABN Amro
of the Netherlands had acquired an 8.8 percent stake in Banca di
Roma. Allianz, the German insurance partner of Dresdner Bank, holds
a stake in Unicredito through an Italian insurance affiliate, and
Banco Bilbao Vizcaya of Spain has a 12 percent share of Banca
Nazionale di Lavoro.
</P>
<P>
   True, this is all nibbling at the edges compared with Deutsche
Bank's pending $10.2 billion acquisition of Bankers Trust Corp.,
but Profumo says the foreign banks are, in part, simply staking
future claims. ``Everyone's laying down their chips,'' he said,
``betting on what the final picture will look like.''
</P>
<P>
   It also reflects a conviction that, for the moment, European
central banks like Italy's will not permit major cross-border
shopping. ``The governor of any central bank is quite scared to
have the financial sector controlled by foreigners,'' Minotti of
Salomon said.
</P>
<P>
   But some bankers contend that Fazio has gone beyond his European
colleagues. Profumo complains that Unicredito's bid for Commerciale
was wrongly branded hostile even though he had obtained the
agreement of Commerciale's management. Commerciale's board later
scuttled the idea.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're convinced we acted correctly,'' he said, adding that the
logic behind the alliance was to ``create a very strong national
banking business.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some argue that the central bank's reluctance to allow
hostile bids has encouraged back-room deals, not least by the
Italian investment bank Mediobanca, a power broker in Italian
finance.
</P>
<P>
   As a legacy of the old world of Italian finance, Unicredito and
Commerciale, oddly, together control about 17 percent of
Mediobanca, yet Mediobanca decided in large part the fate of the
Unicredito bid.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, Mediobanca had unsuccessfully sought to merge
Commerciale with Banca di Roma. When Assicurazioni Generali,
Italy's largest insurer and a Unicredito shareholder, appeared to
back the Unicredito bid for Commerciale, Mediobanca successfully
sought to dethrone Generali's chairman, Antoine Bernheim, a Lazard
Freres partner in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Though it remains unclear what goal Mediobanca now pursues, it
is clear that a merger of Unicredito and Commerciale was seen as
costing Mediobanca its independence.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India _ India on Friday launched a third day of
airstrikes against hundreds of Muslim guerrillas who have dug into
icy, barren mountainsides in the contested territory of Kashmir.
India says the men are backed by its bitter adversary, Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict between India and Pakistan over Kashmir _ a
gorgeous region caught in a 51-year-old tug of war between the
nations _ showed no signs of abating. And the images of the prime
ministers of Pakistan and India embracing in February, as they
promised to seek peace, faded a little more.
</P>
<P>
   After announcing that the guerrillas had shot down an Indian
helicopter Friday morning with a heat-seeking, shoulder-launched
Stinger missile, Indian officials said their military might use
even more potent weaponry to counter the guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The downing of the helicopter followed India's loss of two jet
fighters in combat on Thursday. Four soldiers died in the
helicopter, and one of the jet pilots died. India on Friday
demanded the release of the surviving pilot, who is being held by
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a war, and they have no basis to keep him,'' said
Air Vice Marshal S.K. Malik.
</P>
<P>
   For a conflict that is not a war, this one certainly has the
bellicose language and the body counts that go along with one.
India on Friday tallied 24 of its men dead and 131 wounded in its
three-week campaign to evict the militants from mountain ridges. It
said it was making progress in retaking the rugged terrain.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Russia, Japan and China _ worried about this
conflict between the world's newest nuclear powers _ have urged
India and Pakistan to avoid letting their dispute spin out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   But the fighting is going on perilously close to the boundary
that separates the Indian- and Pakistani-controlled parts of
Kashmir, a boundary that was established in 1949 and redrawn in
1972. The guerrillas are holed up on the Indian side, four to five
miles from the cease-fire line.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians are using jet fighters in Kashmir for the first time
since 1971, when they had their third war with Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   India, which is predominantly Hindu, claims Kashmir, which has a
Muslim majority, as one of its 25 states. Pakistan, an Islamic
nation, contends that the Kashmiris should have the right to decide
in an election whether to join India or Pakistan. This festering
disagreement is the great unfinished business of the moment in 1947
when British India was sundered into two nations.
</P>
<P>
   Pakistani officials have ominously said in recent days that
Kashmir could become a ``nuclear flash point'' and pressed for the
United Nations to mediate, a step that India has always rejected.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian officials said Friday that their country was acting
with restraint by confining its air and ground campaign to the
parts of Kashmir it controls in a completely justified drive to
reclaim its own territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``No civilized democracy in the world would tolerate this kind
of armed intrusion,'' said Maj. Gen. J.J. Singh.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistani officials said that they had given no military or
financial support to what they say are indigenous Kashmiri freedom
fighters battling what they describe as Indian occupiers.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, on the first anniversary of Pakistan's nuclear
tests _ a day when a celebratory 21-gun salvo sounded in each
provincial capital _ Pakistani officials said it was up to India to
defuse the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are urging India to de-escalate the present situation and
try to find a solution to a local problem at the local level rather
than try to expand it in the area and escalate into a much bigger
conflict,'' Pakistan's foreign minister, Sartaj Aziz, told
reporters in Islamabad.
</P>
<P>
   He said India had violated Pakistani airspace by flying into the
Pakistani-controlled part of Kashmir, prompting Pakistan to shoot
down the two fighter jets on its side of the cease-fire line. On
Friday, Pakistani army officials escorted reporters to the wreckage
of one of the MiGs strewn across a mountainside about seven miles
inside Pakistani territory.
</P>
<P>
   India gave a different explanation for the jet's location.
Officials said one of the jets had developed engine trouble on the
Indian side of the cease-fire line and suggested that it might have
flown into Pakistani-controlled territory as the pilot ejected from
the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
   India maintains that the other pilot, trying to spot where the
ejected pilot landed, was shot down on the Indian side of the line.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, the elected leaders of India's government, which has
been in limbo since the coalition led by Hindu nationalists lost a
vote of confidence in Parliament last month, have largely left it
to military officials to brief the press and define the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   The opposition Congress Party, which will face the Hindu
nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party in September elections, has
supported the military campaign to drive out the militants even as
it criticized the intelligence lapses that had allowed the
infiltration to happen in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The infiltrators have to be pushed out on the Indian side,''
said Manmohan Singh, a senior Congress Party leader. ``We're all
united on that point.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Hindu nationalists, who have staked their political
reputation on their ability to defend the nation and often boast of
the government's decision to test nuclear weapons a year ago,
cannot afford to be seen as weak in this conflict, political
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear at the briefings that the army and air force have
clear orders: Get rid of the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   They make no bones about the fact that it will not happen
overnight. Just locating the hideouts in the mountainous terrain is
very difficult. And attacking them from below would entail many
casualties. So the military's strategy is to attack them from the
air, and only then to overrun them. ``We'll clear these positions
in very careful, deliberate operations, which could take some
time,'' said Malik.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and analysts have already begun thinking about what
will happen after the militants are gone. Will India do what it has
done for the last 15 years on the Siachen Glacier: permanently
occupy frozen, treacherous territory at tremendous human and
financial cost in an unending standoff with the Pakistanis?
</P>
<P>
   K. Subrahmanyam, a member of the government-appointed National
Security Advisory Board, said that intelligence failures had led to
the current problem, and that rigorous surveillance of the area by
air and satellite might be enough to prevent future trouble. On the
other hand, he said, it might be necessary for India to occupy the
heights.

CHURCH BULLETIN WRITERS NEED FORGIVENESS
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Monday, May 31)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Lord works in mysterious ways, but not nearly as
mysteriously as the writers of these (supposedly) actual
announcements gleaned from (supposedly) actual church bulletins.
(Thanks to Dan Wychor of Bradenton, Fla., Internet joke purveyor
and Little League coach extraordinaire.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday night is Pot Luck Supper. Prayer and medication to
follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like somebody left the pot sitting out in the sun too
long. Next time, they might want to consider praying before supper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember in prayer the many who are sick of our church and our
community.''
</P>
<P>
   I don't know about the community part, but maybe people would be
less sick of the church if they didn't keep getting food poisoning
from the Pot Luck Suppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those of you who have children and don't know it, we have
a nursery downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds to me like we're talking about some seriously forgetful
people here. Better come up with better directions to the nursery
than simply ``downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday at 5 p.m. there will be a meeting of the Little
Mothers club. All wishing to become Little Mothers, please see the
minister in his private study.''
</P>
<P>
   Sounds like the minister is doing all he can to boost membership
in the Little Mothers club. It's a thankless job, but someone has
to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This being Easter Sunday, we will ask Mrs. Murphy to come
forward and lay an egg on the altar.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Murphy must absolutely dread Easter Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next Sunday, a special collection will be taken to defray the
cost of the new carpet. All those wishing to do something on the
new carpet will come forward and get a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Isn't this how the old carpet got ruined?
</P>
<P>
   ``The ladies of the church have cast off clothing of every kind
and they may be seen in the church basement Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm betting this draws at least as many people as come to watch
Mrs. Murphy lay her egg. For those of you who have children and
don't know it, the ladies will be on display in the room adjacent
to the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bean supper will be held on Tuesday evening in the church
hall. Music will follow.''
</P>
<P>
   Problems with food seems to be a recurring theme in church news
bulletins these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the evening service tonight, the sermon topic will be,
`What is Hell?' Come early and listen to our choir practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly a rousing endorsement of the choir's abilities.
Perhaps members had sampled the Pot Luck Supper before their
practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Montgomery will be entering the hospital this week for
testes.''
</P>
<P>
   And when she comes out, would you all be so kind to address her
as ``Mr. Montgomery?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Scouts are saving aluminum cans, bottles, and other items to
be recycled. Proceeds will be used to cripple children.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the worst arguments against recycling I've heard yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eight new choir robes are currently needed, due to the
addition of several new members and to the deterioration of some
older ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the new robes will make the older members' deterioration
seem less noticeable. Or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Weight Watchers will meet at 7 p.m. at the First Presbyterian
Church. Please use large double door at the side entrance.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of you who are unable to squeeze through the double door
can gather outside by the truck scale. Tonight's lecture topic:
``Losing Weight the Pot-Luck-Supper Way.''

IN INTERVIEWS, MOST AMERICANS SUPPORT U.S. MILITARY ACTIVITY IN
YUGOSLAVIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By DIRK JOHNSON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ill. _ With no end to the bloodshed in Yugoslavia
after two months of NATO bombing, Marcia DeClerk, a 54-year-old
computer programmer who initially favored the airstrikes, started
to wonder if maybe the American troops should just come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things drag on,'' she said, ``you start to lose sight of
what you're there for.''
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, on war crimes charges by a U.N. tribunal has washed away
her doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop him,'' said Mrs. DeClerk, tending a flower
garden on a brilliant spring day in this Midwestern city of 150,000
people. ``You can't ignore the people dying, the homeless. It would
be wrong for us to look the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than two dozen interviews conducted at barbershops and
bookstores, shopping malls and motorcycle dealerships since the
indictment of Milosevic, the people interviewed for the most part
expressed support for American military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These horrible things we've been hearing _ they're true,''
said Duard Bennett, a 38-year-old engineer sitting astride a Harley
Davidson motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   This old factory town on the Rock River, encircled by corn and
bean fields, has traditionally been guided by a middle-of-the-road
political ethos. Conversations with people here several days ago,
before the indictment of Milosevic, revealed a growing restiveness
about the presence of American troops in Yugoslavia, and plenty of
second guessing about whether President Clinton had acted too
hastily. But the sampling of those interviewed today tended to
amplify quite another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why weren't we there long ago?'' asked James Jackson, 59, who
works in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been obvious that Milosevic has been guilty of war crimes
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and many others called for the use of ground troops to
bring a quicker end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not quite enough and a little too late,'' said Brad Hyland,
42, an engineer, describing the American military strategy. ``We
need to commit to ground troops or we're not going to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many people remain opposed to American involvement
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a European concern _ it's not our thing,'' said Spring
Thompson, 22, a clerk at a convenience store along U.S. Route 20.
``I feel terrible about the awful things that are happening to
those people. But it's just not for us to stick our noses into.''
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized the American entrance into Yugoslavia but said
there was little choice now but to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think we're stuck there now,'' said Larry
Steltmann, 56, an executive for a gas-burner manufacturer here. ``I
don't think we utilized the diplomatic options effectively. We
didn't use Russia, which could have been helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people said they did not trust Clinton, expressing concern
that the president might be eager to secure a legacy that would
eclipse his impeachment. At the very least, said Steltmann, it is
difficult to have faith in a leader who has been untruthful with
the people before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wonders if he's telling the truth,'' said Steltmann.
``Even most of his supporters will tell you they don't really trust
the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hamilton, a 76-year-old retired phone company worker,
faulted Clinton for being naive about military affairs and
underestimating the mettle of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't announce right off that you're not going to use
ground troops,'' said Hamilton, as he stood outside the Cherryvale
shopping center. ``It puts you in a bad position to negotiate. Of
course, Clinton doesn't have the nerve to face the political
repercussions of sending ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president had a defender in Frank Livingston, a
37-year-old barber, who said it was quite a stretch to tarnish
Clinton's foreign policy because he had earlier tried to conceal an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his private life, he makes sound judgments as a
president,'' said Livingston, who added that he was inclined to
favor American military involvement if the White House deemed it
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent difficulty in stopping Milosevic has surprised many
people here.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Hahn, a 46-year-old technician for an aerospace company,
said he initially shrugged off Milosevic as a pipsqueak despot who
would wilt under the thunderstorm of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd go in, drop the bombs, and he'd quickly back
down,'' said Hahn. ``I think everybody thought this would be over
in 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dan Saalfeld, 19, who has peers entering the Army, the
American military action at first seemed to be a case of
unwarranted adventurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, we really shouldn't be there,'' he said. ``It
wasn't our business.'' But Milosevic's indictment and the details
of the war crimes have provoked a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a stand,'' said Saalfeld, who plans to enroll
at Boston University in the fall. ``People being killed simply
because they belong to an ethnic group, you just can't let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Creamer, a 48-year-old manager for Federal Express, said
he could not fathom how anyone needed a tribunal to validate the
accounts of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you had to do was look on TV,'' said Creamer. ``America
should be ashamed of itself if we don't stop this brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nelson, 46, a carpenter, said he had little hope that
Milosevic would ever be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   He also worried that the indictment could make Milosevic less
willing to negotiate. ``His back is against the wall,'' Nelson
said. ``He's got nothing to lose now.''
</P>
<P>
   Creamer's wife, Linda, a 48-year-old bookkeeper, expressed
concern about her 18-year-old son, and said she wished the United
States could take a break from acting as ``everybody's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it time somebody else around the world stood up and rose
to the challenge?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Moore, a homemaker in her 30s, said she had agonized about
the nation's proper role in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has become convinced that American ground troops should
be sent, even though it would almost surely mean some casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be the first time America lost lives in a fight
for freedom,'' she said. ``But that's what being an American is all
about.''

SPORTS COLUMN: CHALK TALK BY PARCELLS, THE KNICKS FAN
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The theme of the chalk talk was versatility, and the speaker was
Bill Parcells, the Jets' head coach. This was Day 2 of the Jets'
minicamp at Hofstra University this week and Parcells, who led the
Jets to the AFC championship game last season, was discussing the
theme of his coming 1999-2000 campaign: versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really believe that's one of the keys to having a chance to
be more successful, in any sport,'' Parcells said. ``If you've got
guys who can do more things and you really emphasize that with your
team, I really think you have a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   With that, the coach made an unexpected leap onto a topic that
has consumed every basketball fan in New York for the past week:
the Knicks and their playoff series with the Indiana Pacers. The
hype has been comparable to the buildup before the Super Bowl: a
week's worth of speculation, heated debate and controversy before a
single minute of action ever takes place. Parcells admitted that he
has been caught up in it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a Knicks fan,'' he said. ``I've always been a Knicks fan.
I know some of the other coaches coaching for other teams, but deep
in my heart I'm a Knicks fan.'' And then, in a brief, but
compelling, display of a coach's insatiable appetite for tactics,
Parcells dissected the series, turning over strategy and matchups
and counterstrategy as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking about this Indiana-Knicks thing,'' he said.
``I'm thinking, `Nobody thinks they can beat Indiana.' But I'm
thinking, `Rik Smits is hurt a little bit, maybe he's not going to
be at top form.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a way for the Knicks to do this,'' he continued, ``but
I'm trying to figure out: `Well, who can guard this guy? We need to
guard this guy, we need to guard this other guy. Now we need to
guard this third guy here.' Indiana has a lot of guys you need to
guard, and that worries me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, they're not great at guarding, themselves,'' Parcells
added, ``so they've got a few guys they've got to guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Just when it seemed Parcells was hopelessly out on an
improvisational tangent, he returned to the theme: versatility.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why Indiana's a threat,'' he said. ``If you look at
their basketball team, they've got a guy they can bring in who can
do things _ they got Rose, he comes in, he can do things. They got
those Davises _ they do certain things for their team. Then they
got Mullin, he can still do something. Then they got this Best,
what a pain he is. Then they got Miller. I'm telling you, they've
got versatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells said he wasn't looking at the series as a mere fan, but
as a coach who closely monitors why a team wins and loses. ``I look
at it from that perspective,'' he said. ``I don't look at it from,
`Oh, gee, I hope Sprewell gets 30 tonight.' I don't look at it like
that. I look at it like, `Here's where I see some problems.'
Whether I'm really right about that, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   When someone remarked that the Pacers created matchup problems
for opponents, Parcells brought the conversation full circle.
``That's what I'm trying to do,'' he said of his full-time job with
the Jets. ``I'm trying to create matchup problems for people, and
the more guys you got that can do it, the better we are.''

<P>
   As Parcells ended his news conference, I asked him about Jeff
Van Gundy, an issue as central to Knicks fans these days as is the
fate of their team against Indiana. Four months ago, Parcells
responded to a similar question about John Calipari, then the coach
of the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten to know this John Calipari a little bit in the
last year or so,'' Parcells said at the time. ``I kind of always
liked the way this guy did things, and now he comes over here and
watches practice. And I've talked to him about coming to a Nets
practice when the season is over. I like something about him, and I
want to watch this guy coach because I could probably learn
something from him.''
</P>
<P>
   That endorsement didn't carry much weight with the Nets' brass,
which fired Calipari midway through a painfully disappointing
season. But for better or for worse, Parcells was even more
enthusiastic when asked about the Knicks' head coach. ``I really
like Van Gundy,'' he said. ``I think he's a heck of a coach. I
don't know him _ I never met the guy _ but I watch him. I think
he's working hard.''
</P>
<P>
   As far as all the off-court intrigue surrounding the Knicks,
Parcells said: ``I don't know what the politics are. I don't know
what's being forced and what's not. I think he's got a lot out of
Camby, got a lot out of Sprewell. Some of the old guys like him and
they respond to him. I don't know what else you want from the guy.
I mean, these aren't the Chicago Bulls.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed. These are the New York Knicks.

NIGERIANS HOPEFUL BUT JITTERY ON RETURN TO CIVILIAN GOVERNMENT 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria _ At the U-Fine Barbers Shop in the slum of
Nyanya here, Nigeria's final day under military rule registered
with a mixture of great hope for the future and last-minute jitters
about a return to civilian government _ long promised, yet often
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a day we have been looking forward to,'' said Thomas
Idoko, a 29-year-old teacher, who was getting a trim. ``We thought
it would never take place, but now I am expecting great changes
both in the economy and society.''
</P>
<P>
   The barber, John Agbo, 21, wished that the long-awaited day
would bring a more personal change. ``I pray to God that I can get
a richer shop,'' he said, mentioning air conditioning, sharper
clippers, a bigger waiting area. He said he would settle, though,
for reliable electricity from the government so that his old
clippers would not stop working in mid-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, whose 122 million people make it Africa's most populous
nation, changes governments on Saturday; the generals who have
ruled it since 1983 are giving way to a civilian government elected
in February. Since the departing president, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, announced last July that a civilian government would take
over on May 29, the date has loomed before Nigerians as the
finishing line of a political marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And only 24 hours before the big day, there were doubts in
Nyanya, amid the expressions of optimism, that the line would be
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly elated that the handover will take place,'' said
Friday Nathaniel, 18, who was waiting for his turn at the
barbershop. ``We are praying that it should happen as it has been
promised. I expect the incoming administration will do something in
the area of job opportunities. I am now just like a beggar with no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyanya is on the outskirts of this capital's center, a world
away from the five-star international hotels, where Nigerian and
foreign lobbyists were furiously slapping backs this week, and a
dinner was held to honor Stella Obasanjo, the wife of
President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired general and one-time
military ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, ruled by the military for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960, teetered on the edge of collapse
under the extremely repressive and corrupt government of Gen. Sani
Abacha. But after five years in power, Abacha died suddenly last
June, setting off a series of political reforms that is culminating
in the inauguration on Saturday. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, President
Clinton's special envoy to Africa, is to lead the American
delegation at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the dirt road outside U-Fine Barbers was
flooded after a night of heavy rains. A block away, in a heap of
uncollected garbage, a baby goat could be seen butting a rooster
over an apparently tasty morsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nyanya came into existence in the 1980s after Nigeria, its
coffers flush from the oil boom, decided to move its capital to
Abuja from Lagos. Over the years, Nigerians from seemingly every
corner of this country gravitated to Nyanya, divided by religion
and ethnicity but seemingly united in their concept of a better
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the new government to increase the salaries of the
workers and to help the poor,'' said Ezekiel Oyeleru, 13, who was
milling around with other children outside the barbershop. The
children have not attended school in months, since unpaid teachers
began striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``To repair our roads,'' said Charles Jeremiah, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our homes,'' Ezekiel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To repair our schools and to reduce our school fees,'' Charles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus Mohammed, 26, struggled to push his wheelbarrow around
water-filled potholes in front of the barbershop. It was laden with
plastic containers that he had filled with water from a tap and
that he was going to sell in a remote corner of Nyanya for 5 cents
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mai ruwa!'' a woman cried to him in Hausa, the dominant
language and ethnic group in northern Nigeria. ``Water boy! Your
jerrycans are leaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The water boy stopped. ``Nigeria will be great a year from
now,'' he said before going on. ``We are suffering now. But after
suffering is enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Elegant Ukpong, 35, was not ready to celebrate yet. Ukpong was
one of the hundreds of men in Nyanya, called okada-men, who ferry
passengers on their motorcycles for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have doubts that the handover will take place,''
the okada-man said. ``They are afraid of all the rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we heard that Obasanjo was killed,'' he said,
referring to rumors that suddenly swept the country and caused
riots in Lagos. ``So we still have doubts. Until I see the new
government here _ 24 hours from now _ I will not go out and
jubilate.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the okada-man said, he will party. ``Anything my hand
can reach,'' he said, ``I will eat to make my mind happy.''

NATO PATROL RELEASED AFTER 8-HOUR YUGOSLAV GRILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN AND SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Six NATO soldiers patrolling the border between
Bosnia and Yugoslavia were captured at gunpoint by Yugoslav
soldiers and interrogated for eight hours before being released,
military spokesmen disclosed Friday.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of several tense episodes along the borders between
Yugoslavia and its neighbors as NATO kept up its intense
bombardment of targets across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In Belgrade, the capital, Russia's special envoy for the
Balkans, Viktor Chernomyrdin, renewed his call for a halt to the
NATO strikes as he arrived for a new round of talks seeking a
peaceful resolution to the conflict. He met with Slobodan Milosevic
one day after the Yugoslav president was indicted for war crimes by
an international tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Yugoslav officials sought to portray the meeting
as a breakthrough, and a source close to a cabinet minister said
Milosevic had accepted the principles for an end to the war
outlined last month by the so-called Group of Eight industrialized
countries.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from NATO. State Department
spokesman James Foley was cautious. ``We're going to have to talk
to Mr. Chernomyrdin before we can assess what was agreed to. NATO's
conditions in order to stop the air campaign remain the same.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, US Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott said in
Brussels that Chernomyrdin was speaking only for his own
government, not negotiating on behalf of the alliance nor acting as
a mediator.
</P>
<P>
   In other developments Friday:
</P>
<P>
   -- The Macedonian government indicated Friday that it will
approve the proposed deployment there of 14,000 additional NATO
troops if the Western alliance starts paying for the wear and tear
on local facilities and reiterates a pledge that the troops will
have only defensive or peacekeeping responsibilities. The added
troops would bring the total to 30,000 in Macedonia. Albania would
host another 15,000 to 20,000 troops under the new NATO plan.
</P>
<P>
   --Albanian forces conducted artillery exercises with live
ammunition along the border of the Yugoslav province of Kosovo in a
region that has been the site of fighting between Yugoslav soldiers
and the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   --Officials in Macedonia, which has been a reluctant host to
thousands of Kosovar refugees, complained that the United National
High Commissioner for Refugees was not paying attention to the
alleged ``vice, prostitution, drug abuse, criminal behavior, unrest
and political pressures on deportees'' in the refugee camps there.
</P>
<P>
   --In the Yugoslav republic of Montenegro, tensions remained high
between the republic's government _ which opposes Milosevic's
regime _ and Yugoslav army forces under Milosevic's command. The
border with Croatia remained closed and Montenegrin officials said
they were worried that two ships carrying food for needy citizens
would not be allowed to unload.
</P>
<P>
   --In Belgrade, conditions were increasingly grim. The city was
completely blacked out Friday, a result of damage done to power
grids by NATO missiles. The Western military alliance conducted yet
another record-setting bombardment Thursday night, flying 792
missions, including 310 attack sorties, said NATO spokesman Jamie
Shea.
</P>
<P>
   Two critical and beloved staples of the local diet _ Serbian
bread and hot, Turkish-style coffee _ were unavailable Friday.
Locals lined up to buy bread, but there was none to be had.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of power, there was relative order in the
capital. Cars were on the roads, negotiating traffic even without
stoplights.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin and Milosevic had what aides described as a
``jubilant dinner'' to conclude what they described as successful
talks. Chernomyrdin then left Belgrade, promising to return on
Tuesday or Wednesday with Finnish President Martti Ahtisaari, the
European envoy, to try to get more concrete agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The Yugoslav government has previously given vague assurances
that it accepted the G-8 nations' principles for a settlement,
which call for withdrawal of Serb forces from Kosovo and deployment
of an international peacekeeping force, but Milosevic insisted that
the peacekeepers be a lightly-armed United Nations force. However,
Yugoslav sources said he was willing to let the UN Security Council
decide the makeup of the force.
</P>
<P>
   One source said that prior to the Chernomyrdin-Milosevic
meeting, a senior western diplomat met with a Yugoslav cabinet
minister, Bogoljub Karic, and promised that ambassadors still
working in Yugoslavia would guarantee the safety of Serb forces
withdrawing from Kosovo. Karic, one of Yugoslavia's most successful
businessmen, is close to Milosevic, and has been urging him to cut
a deal to save the country from further ruin.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said that after next week's visit, he would return
to Belgrade only ``as a tourist.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident on the Bosnian border involved six soldiers on a
reconnaissance patrol for the Stabilization Force, a NATO-led force
charged with keeping the peace in Bosnia. The team spotted a
detachment of Yugoslav soldiers on the Bosnian side of the border _
a violation of the Dayton peace agreement of 1995 that ended the
Bosnian war _ and asked them to leave, said SFOR spokesman Colonel
Lee Hockman.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yugoslavs appeared to leave, more of their compatriots
showed up, and the group of 20 disarmed the Stabilization Force
soldiers, tied them up, and forcibly took them back to a village
inside Yugoslavia, Hockman said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident between the Yugoslav forces and SFOR troops in
Bosnia was a first, Hockman said. While Yugoslav soldiers had
wandered over the border before, they had always left when
confronted.
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``it's hard to say'' whether the detention and
harassment of the NATO troops was directed from Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no way of knowing whether this was planned, or a
spontaneous decision by a low-ranking'' officer, Hockman said.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers were mistreated while in custody and suffered minor
bruises, Hockman said. He said he could not detail the nature of
the interrogation. NATO would not reveal which member countries the
soldiers came from.
</P>
<P>
   The confrontation occurred about 7:30 Wednesday night in Rudo
but was only disclosed Friday. Rudo is in Republika Srpska, the
ethnic Serb area of Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
   There is an ongoing territorial dispute over the Rudo area, but
the land is now considered part of Bosnia. The peace-keeping troops
will use force, if necessary, to maintain the integrity of the
border, Hockman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't going to happen again,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The episode was a disturbing reminder that while one war is
raging on the Yugoslav side of the border, tensions from the
1992-95 war on the Bosnian side are still high.
</P>
<P>
   In Albania, President Rexhap Meidani watched from a hilltop as a
force of about 1,200 troops, 645 shells, artillery, tanks and
missiles performed for about an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to perfect our military capabilities so that the Serbs
will get the right response,'' said Albanian General Kudusi Lama.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' refugee agency said it feared the exercise
would provoke fire from Yugoslav forces across the border,
imperiling the safety of some 100,000 ethnic Albanian refugees in
northern Albania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, outgoing artillery tends to draw incoming
artillery, and we are extremely concerned that this could draw fire
from the Serbian side into an area which has a huge concentration
of refugees,'' said Kris Janowski, spokesman for the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees, in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In Macedonia, the UN agency was criticized by Defense Minister
Nikola Kijusev, who called on the agency to stop ``bureaucracy and
irresponsible behavior'' and to pay attention to the needs of the
106,000 refugees there.
</P>
<P>
   UNHCR spokesman Ron Redmond said he knew nothing about Kijusev's
charges, and noted that it was the responsibility of the Macedonian
government to maintain security at the camps.
</P>
<P>
   Macedonia, itself a breakaway former province of the Yugoslav
republic, is nervous about the impact of so many ethnic Albanians,
since they could swell an already restless Albanian population
there. Refugees have been hemmed in with barbed-wire fence to keep
them from wandering deeper into Macedonia.

 &HT;    Postal Service's new stamp promotes cancer awareness
 &HT;    By Mary Ann Roser
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Buy a stamp, save a prostate.
</P>
<P>
   That's the hope of health-care workers, U.S. Postal Service
officials and others who unveiled the 33-cent Prostate Cancer
Awareness stamp in Austin on Friday. World champion cyclist Lance
Armstrong of Austin, a survivor of advanced testicular cancer,
helped introduce the stamp, which went on sale here Friday _ a day
ahead of the rest of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   The stamp is aimed at making people aware of a leading killer of
men. The cancer strikes the gland below the bladder and initially
develops without symptoms, making early detection critical.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more we talk and the more we educate, the more success we
will have in battling this deadly disease,'' said Austin Postmaster
Dennis Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   Experts estimate this year that 180,000 new cases of prostate
cancer will be diagnosed and that 40,000 men will die. U.S. Rep.
Lloyd Doggett of Austin said at the ceremony that his father and
uncle suffered with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stamps are a wonderful vehicle for public awareness,'' said
Virginia Noelke, chairwoman of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory
Committee and a history professor at Angelo State University.
``They reach millions of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The stamp includes the male gender symbol and the words ``annual
checkups and tests.''
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling coincided with the ``Ride for the Roses,'' an
Austin and Hill Country bike tour Sunday featuring Armstrong and
other champions. Proceeds will go to the Lance Armstrong
Foundation, which raises money for cancer research.
</P>
<P>
   ``I commend the Postal Service for drawing attention to health
issues that aren't often talked about,'' said Armstrong, who also
mentioned last year's breast cancer research stamp.

SHUTTLE CREW PREPARES TO DOCK WITH SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Discovery astronauts Friday prepared their
cargo-laden shuttle for a late-night rendezvous with the new
international space station.
</P>
<P>
   With the four-man, three-woman crew docked on its six-day visit,
two of the astronauts will take part in a lengthy spacewalk
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Shuttle commander Kent Rominger's crew was to be the first to
dock with the new station, though not the first to float aboard.
</P>
<P>
   That distinction went to the shuttle astronauts who initiated
the six-year effort to build the station by joining the first two
components in orbit last December.
</P>
<P>
   The 750-mile gap that separated the shuttle and the space
station early Friday dwindled quickly. The astronauts filled the
early hours of their second day in space by checking out their
spacesuits, the shuttle's 50-foot robot arm and the radio equipment
needed for the spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had no problems with any of those,'' said Jeff Bantle, NASA
mission operations director. ``Overall, the shuttle and the station
are working like well-oiled machines.''
</P>
<P>
   On the ground, Russian and American flight control teams in
suburban Moscow issued remote commands to warm to 70 degrees the
station's unstaffed, 68-foot-long Zarya and Unity modules. While no
one was aboard, the temperature had been permitted to fall below
freezing.
</P>
<P>
   Observing a day-for-night schedule, the astronauts will move
into the station Sunday night with the first of nearly two tons of
supplies they plan to leave behind.
</P>
<P>
   Late Saturday, astronauts Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry will
embark on their 6 1/2-hour spacewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary task will be the assembly of small hand-operated
cargo cranes that will be installed on the exterior of the space
station.
</P>
<P>
   The spacewalk promises to hold challenges for both Jernigan, a
40-year-old physicist who is flying in space for the fifth time,
and Barry, a 45-year-old medical doctor and electrical engineer who
is on his second mission.
</P>
<P>
   After the docking, the station's Unity docking and Zarya
propulsion modules will jut more than seven stories out of the
shuttle's cargo bay.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts inside the shuttle will rely on videocameras
positioned inside the cargo bay to keep tabs on the spacewalkers.
</P>
<P>
   Jernigan will position herself on the tip of the shuttle's robot
arm so that arm operator Ellen Ochoa inside Discovery can move her
and the bulky crane segments into place. But Ochoa will have to
rely on radio commands from Jernigan.
</P>
<P>
   Barry will scale the outside of the outpost, using footholds and
handrails.
</P>
<P>
   While Discovery circles the Earth several times during the
excursion, the spacewalkers will be cycling between sunlight and
darkness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a real challenge to guide ourselves around the
station in low light conditions,'' said Barry, who logged a
previous spacewalk in 1996. ``I will be very deliberate and very
cautious because I am a little concerned about not touching
anything I should not.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another danger. While docked, Discovery will be unable
to fly instantly to the rescue if one of the spacewalkers drifts
away. For that reason both will be double-tethered to the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   They will wear back-mounted jet packs filled with a small amount
of fuel to propel themselves back to safety if both tethers snap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very pleasant to talk about,'' Rominger said of the
risk. ``If someone gets away, first of all you have to recognize
that maybe you could get to them with the arm. If you don't, and we
didn't train formally for it, it's pretty simple to undock and get
away. So within a matter of minutes we can be undocked and on our
way to rescue a crew member.''

`STAR WARS' SAGA IS JUST ANOTHER PIRATE STORY IN ASIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ If you wanted to be the first on your block in New
York to see the new ``Star Wars'' film, you had to line up three
days in advance for tickets or buy them from scalpers for $100
apiece.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to be first on the block in Hong Kong, you just have
to duck into a seedy shopping arcade in Kowloon, where you can pick
up the most eagerly awaited film in history for less than $3.
</P>
<P>
   Illegal videotaped copies of ``Star Wars: Episode I _ The
Phantom Menace'' are doing a brisk business throughout Asia, barely
a week after it opened in the United States and more than a month
before it is to open here.
</P>
<P>
   The illicit copying of Hollywood films is such a pervasive
problem that industry executives took it for granted that ``Phantom
Menace'' would turn up here on video compact disc. But the warp
speed with which it flew from American cinemas to Asian streets has
left people whipsawed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, that didn't take long,'' said Barbara Robinson, the
managing director of Columbia Pictures Film Production Asia. She
added, ``It would have been naive to think that ``Star Wars''
wouldn't have been pirated.''
</P>
<P>
   Most major films from the United States are illegally copied and
sold within a week of their release. ``Phantom Menace'' set a
dubious record, according to industry experts, with copies hitting
the streets in Malaysia two days after the release. They have since
turned up in Singapore, Indonesia, Macau and Hong Kong, where the
movie does not open until July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not some small fly-by-night organization doing one-off
copies; this is a very well-organized international conspiracy,''
said Rigo Jesu, the managing director of Intercontinental Film
Group, a local film distributor.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter of the ``Star Wars'' saga is considered such
a juggernaut that most industry executives said illegal knockoffs
would not doom it at the box office _ as it has done to some Asian
films. But the abysmal quality of the copies could drive potential
customers away, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Piracy experts said the copies were probably produced by someone
who surreptitiously filmed the movie off the screen of a theater in
the United States. In a copy that was playing in the arcade, the
bobbing heads of moviegoers, including a man's bald pate, obscured
the bottom of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good for the movie, and it hurts video sales if
everyone already owns a copy,'' said Sam Ho, the director of the
anti-piracy division at the Motion Picture Association, a trade
group that represents Hollywood studios, including 20th Century
Fox, which is distributing ``Phantom Menace.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at 20th Century Fox, a unit of News Corp., did not
return calls.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Radley, president of Lucasfilm Ltd., the company founded
by the ``Star Wars'' creator George Lucas, said in a statement that
the latest film ``is not unique in suffering the problems of
piracy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Piracy throughout the world is an extremely serious problem
for the whole motion picture industry,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Radley said Motion Picture Association officials had been
``extremely aggressive in combating any piracy in any way they can;
however, without the support of local governments and authorities
it's difficult to overcome this problem.''
</P>
<P>
   The purloining of movies is a flashpoint in trade relations
between the United States and several Asian countries. Hong Kong
was removed from a watch list by the United States in February
after it intensified efforts to raid factories that produce
illegally copied material. But other Asian countries, including
Indonesia and Singapore, are on the list of copyright violators.
</P>
<P>
   The surge of piracy also alarms filmmakers here, who say that it
is strangling the region's once-thriving movie industry. The
box-office revenue of Hong Kong films declined from $168 million in
1993 to $54 million last year _ largely because of the blizzard of
bootleg copies, according to executives.
</P>
<P>
   ```Star Wars' happens to be a massive phenomenon,'' Jesu said.
``But piracy can devastate a more run-of-the-mill movie.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Hong Kong Customs Department has assigned 250 officers to
raid shops that sell illegal material, and said it would add
another 48 this year. ``We don't care what the movie title is,''
said a spokesman, Richard Law. ``We are carrying out actions every
day to enforce laws on pirated films.''
</P>
<P>
   But piracy is so profitable that it seems to defy even the most
vigilant efforts. In the case of ``Phantom Menace,'' studio
executives were so nervous about illegal copies that they warned
even reviewers for news organization not to record the film at an
advanced screening.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas had also taken extraordinary security measures to prevent
prints of the movie from leaking out. Yet industry executives said
that in the last two days, a higher-quality copy of the film had
turned up in stores and that the copy might have been reproduced
from a print.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is the lag time between the release of films
in the United States and overseas. Executives said the delay was
caused by the difficulty of running simultaneous marketing
campaigns. Studios have tried to close the gap in recent years,
notably in 1997, when the James Bond film ``Tomorrow Never Dies''
opened on the same day around the world.
</P>
<P>
   An even bigger hurdle is the low price. Video compact discs sell
for $20 (Hong Kong), or about $2.58 (United States). Customers can
buy a package of six for $100 (Hong Kong), or $12.90 (United
States), and choose from other new releases like ``The Matrix,''
``Entrapment,'' and ``The Mummy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``People line up overnight in the States to see this,'' said a
shopkeeper, waving a copy of ``Phantom Menace'' that came with
Chinese subtitles. ``Have you seen it yet? You can have it for only
20.''
</P>
<P>
   The shopkeeper said he was selling 200 copies a day, which made
``Phantom Menace'' a popular choice but not his top seller. That
title belonged to ``The Ring,'' a Japanese horror film that was
selling 500 copies a day.
</P>
<P>
   There is still hope that Lucas' epic fantasy will draw people
into theaters. Two young women who were browsing through the
shelves of illegal copies stopped to look at ``Phantom Menace,''
but moved on. ``I'm not going to buy it,'' said Janice Ng, 25.
``I'll save this one for the theater.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - The HBO drama ``The Sopranos'' changed everything.
</P>
<P>
   An amazingly well-done series about a New Jersey mobster and
family man, ``The Sopranos'' launched in January and demoted TV
that once looked pretty good into TV that looks just OK.
</P>
<P>
   In an era deep in excellent TV dramas, only the gritty squad
from NBC's ``Homicide: Life on the Street'' can stand side-by-side
with Tony Soprano's crew.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Practice?'' ``Law &AMP; Order?'' ``ER?'' All once pretty good.
Now, OK.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Sopranos'' severely dented the TV grading curve.
</P>
<P>
   Premium cable standards helped the storytelling, true, but the
stories were so well told and the acting so fine, the series' 13
installments transcended the medium. If you missed it the first
time, HBO will offer a second chance to meditate on transcendence
starting June 9, when ``The Sopranos'' begins repeats.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy Award nominations are a lock for stars James Gandolfini
(Tony Soprano) and Nancy Marchand (his evil mom, Livia), among
several others involved. Unless Emmy voters opt to again reward
``NYPD Blue'' star Dennis Franz, who turned in yet another
heartfelt season as beleaguered grunt Andy Sipowicz, Gandolfini
can't lose come awards time.
</P>
<P>
   Emmy nominations will be announced July 22, or almost exactly
halfway between the 1998-99 TV season, which officially ended last
week, and the start of the 1999-2000 season, which officially
begins in September.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike almost all other cable or over-air networks, HBO doesn't
have to rise and fall with ratings or ad dollars. Its pay-for-play
status allows it to freely use adult themes and levels of sex,
violence and language not often seen outside of R-rated movies.
Because there are no commercials, there also is no concern with
specific demographics as a measure of success. It allows the
series' writers to be as unencumbered as it is possible to be in
television writing.
</P>
<P>
   The six broadcast networks (seven if you count Pax, nine if you
count Spanish-language networks), on the other hand, have revenue
and ratings masters to serve. Excellence isn't necessarily or often
a guarantee of success. Last season, ABC, NBC, CBS, Fox, WB and UPN
launched a total of 36 new shows. Only a handful are surviving;
only one was a ratings success.
</P>
<P>
   That lone winner was ``Providence,'' a midseason replacement for
NBC that earned the season's only signs of hit status. NBC's
``Jesse,'' one of the 10 new shows renewed for next fall, gets
counted as a hit thanks only to its cushy Thursday night time slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' ``That 70s Show'' and ``The Norm Show'' _ all
OK-to-pretty-good new shows _ survived to see another season
without making such ratings breakthroughs. We TV critics have
special terminology to describe such a circumstance. We call it ``a
lucky break.''
</P>
<P>
   In the long weeks between seasons, however, loyal viewers should
ask themselves: Which, of all the prime-time series aired during
the TV season just done, would you want to watch, start-to-finish,
season premiere to season finale, all over again?
</P>
<P>
   It'd be easy with ``Wind on Water,'' after all. That one lasted
just one episode.
</P>
<P>
   Or ``Conrad Bloom,'' ``Costello, The Secret Lives of Men'' or
``Buddy Faro.'' (On second thought, re-viewing whole seasons of
those shows, however mercifully abbreviated, would be very, very
hard.)
</P>
<P>
   The answer, of course, is none, save one. Rhymes with Bonannos,
kinda.
</P>
<P>
   OK, maybe two. Rhymes with fortnight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A lackluster year &QL; 
 &QL; 
The major networks have to be disappointed in their very lackluster
year, shedding overall audience by 7 percent year-to-year. CBS
dropped 8 percent for the season, but still won the ratings race
for total households. NBC was down 15 percent overall. ABC was down
4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The youth-appeal WB grew its audience by 13 percent, which is
why so many new shows next fall will look like something you'd see
on WB. CBS won the overall ratings race, but still skewed so old
that ``mummy'' is its strongest demographic category. In the
advertiser-desired 18-49 demographic, CBS finished fourth. NBC won.
</P>
<P>
   TV's down trend wasn't confined to financial returns.
</P>
<P>
   Although each delivered memorable episodes, even high-quality
stalwarts such as ``NYPD Blue'' and ``Frasier'' suffered uneven
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The fall departure of Jimmy Smits' Bobby Simone was
unforgettable, one of the TV year's dramatic highlights. Rick
Schroder's subsequent arrival was a pleasant surprise, although
there appears to be a risk that his inarticulate character will
suffer week-to-week sameness. Let him have some fun, and fast.
</P>
<P>
   The show's biggest weaknesses now are its serial abuse of the
Sipowicz character _ jeez, does this guy need a break! _ and the
ongoing misuse of female cast members, who provide eye-pleasing
window-dressing while remaining seeming dramatic afterthoughts.
</P>
<P>
   For example: Sharon Lawrence, who played Sipowicz's wife, Sylvia
Costas. Aside from her wonderful work in earlier seasons, she exits
the series as one long missed opportunity. Meanwhile, Medavoy
(Gordon Clapp) and Martinez (Nicholas Turturro), whose quirks and
goofy byplay grow thin in a big hurry, eat up hours and hours of
screen time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frasier,'' suffering by ratings comparison to its time-slot
ancestor ``Seinfeld,'' stumbled through the first half of the
season in an uncharacteristic slump. A series that will be
remembered as one of TV's best and brightest, ``Frasier'' improved
as the season moved on, yet the luster is off of NBC's
once-impenetrable Thursday night ratings champion. With George
Clooney's exit from ``ER,'' only ``Friends'' regularly hit highs
you could classify as must-see.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?,'' which ABC in the fall will
schedule against NBC's fading Thursday night, became must-see in a
hurry. No show this season packed as many laughs, and there were
few TV thrills to match watching those improv aces, especially
previous TV unknowns Wayne Brady and Colin Mochrie, turn themselves
into instant stars.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's ``Futurama'' came online at midseason and quickly became
one of the few hopeful new series on TV. It's not ``The Simpsons,''
although it was developed by ``Simpsons'' creator Matt Groening.
Then again, the phrase ``It's not `The Simpsons' '' could go for
everything on TV, ever. In the context of everything else on TV
right now, ``Futurama'' leapt immediately onto my 20-best list.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' was, no question, the most daring new series of
the year, and its renewal by ABC almost makes up for the early
cancellation of ``Cupid,'' a clever romantic comedy that never
found much of an audience. Of all the new shows, ``Cupid'' was the
only near-miss really worth mourning.
</P>
<P>
   Among the established shows that left or were ousted,
``Homicide'' will be the most missed. ``Home Improvement'' had its
fans, few of them TV critics. ``Mad About You'' and ``The Nanny''
also faded into rerun history this spring, surprising many viewers
who didn't know they hadn't died years ago. ``NewsRadio,''
mercilessly bounced around NBC's schedule, was never really given a
chance at viewer vitality.
</P>
<P>
   Next May's big send-off: ``The X-Files.'' The Hype is Already
Out There.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
The violence factor &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the same season where the most critically acclaimed series
was ``The Sopranos,'' the biggest reverberations continue to be the
controversy over violence on television. It's a contradiction
impossible to resolve in a capitalistic nation whose airwaves are
mostly free of government control. But that doesn't keep the battle
from raging.
</P>
<P>
   Discussing the possible cultural culprits in the Columbine
massacre is healthy. Be wary, however, of anybody rushing to place
blame or proscribe instant remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Quick explanations are the only thing that offer any feelings of
security for the future. And so they multiply: It was the video
game, it was the German music. It was the access to guns, or the
lack of enough guns. It was the hatred, or the Internet, or the
parenting.
</P>
<P>
   Out of all of that, television continues to be the easiest
target for culture cops, despite confusion over just how much
violence makes its way to prime-time viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Most TV violence today comes from Hollywood movies viewed on
tape or rebroadcast on cable, newscasts, sports and in reality
programs. Are we willing to prosecute bean-ball pitchers? Make
anchormen serve hard time? Sentence Jean-Claude Van Damme to
eternal VanDamnation? Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   On prime-time series _ the heart and soul of broadcast
television _ evil seldom triumphs, not even the cartoon bad guys on
``Buffy.'' (Evil may be winning on ``The X-Files,'' but how could
you tell?)
</P>
<P>
   Sex is a different story, and maybe the culture cops have a
point here. Broadcast TV continues to bust the boundaries in this
regard, in a futile attempt to compete with cable. Considering how
much time we've all invested in the president's sex life, however,
do you blame the networks for testing limits?
</P>
<P>
   Once you've seen the Starr Report, the naughty jokes on
``Friends'' or the PG-13 nudity of ``NYPD Blue'' seems pretty tame.
</P>
<P>
   True, the TV set is the delivery device for ultraviolent
Hollywood movies (allowing underage kids to bypass multiplex age
restrictions) and video games. Maybe that's where the confusion
starts.
</P>
<P>
   When you're periscoping through pop culture for scapegoats, keep
in mind that advertisers pay a premium for commercial time in shows
that reach young males, primarily because young males just don't
watch much TV.
</P>
<P>
   Violence-prone or otherwise, young males are taking their
cultural cues from sources other than network TV.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
Disgust for talk shows
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The ``Jenny Jones'' verdict can be read as a collective
expression of disgust for TV talk show standards, or as an
overreaction to an overheated courtroom. Although almost every
legal analysis I've seen or read predicts a reversal and/or
reduction in damages, the subtext is pretty clear: A significant
percentage of Americans evidently believe that a significant
percentage of TV is bad for America. Why, then, does the average
home consume seven hours of it every day?
</P>
<P>
   For a change, although probably not for long, TV executives
appear to be listening to what parents, politicians and culture
critics are saying. (Ratings always tend to speak louder, however,
reflecting reality instead of emotional rhetoric.)
</P>
<P>
   The company that owns ``The Jerry Springer Show'' announced,
again, that the daytime ratings dynamo will retreat from its
attack-TV conventions. In Littleton's wake, blustery talk from
Washington sparked a few TV execs to step back from programs that
could inflame censorship sentiment. A mafia series titled
``Falcone'' probably would've made CBS's fall lineup in other
years. Too violent, at the moment. And in any other spring, WB
wouldn't have hesitated over its ``Buffy'' season finale built
around a high school graduation erupting in mayhem.
</P>
<P>
   A clever fantasy about demons and vampires, ``Buffy'' isn't the
problem. Neither are mob dramas, when well done. Even when they
revel in chillingly casual violence, like a certain spectacular HBO
series.
</P>
<P>
   If violent TV were outlawed, ``The Sopranos,'' a show about
outlaws, would no doubt be, um, outlawed.
</P>
<P>
   You'll take my clicker only by prying it from my cold, dead
hands.

 By ROBYN MEREDITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TROY, Mich. _ Roughly a million General Motors shareholders will
get an unexpected present when they open their brokerage account
statements for this month: about 70 shares of Delphi Automotive
Systems for every 100 shares of GM they hold, the second part of
GM's divestiture of Delphi, its parts division.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is whether to hold onto an untested
auto parts company or to bail out by selling the shares and
investing the money elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Think of it as a choice between racing to your destination in a
cherry-red Corvette or taking a bus: You don't want Delphi if speed
is what you're after, but Delphi is cheap and it should get you
there _ it just might take longer, and the ride could get bumpy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite possible labor troubles and Delphi's overwhelming
dependence on a single ailing customer, many investors are bullish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Delphi can be a terrific investment,'' said Thomas F. Marsico,
chairman of Marsico Capital, who holds about four million GM shares
in the various mutual funds and pension accounts he manages.
Marsico likened GM's spinoff of Delphi to AT&AMP;T's spinoff of Lucent
Technologies. ``As it was able to sell its products to other
telecommunications manufacturers,'' he said, ``Delphi should be
able to see a lot of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Others see beauty in a bargain. ``It is hard to find liquid,
large-cap companies that are this cheap,'' said Scott F. Merlis, a
managing director at Wasserstein Perella Securities. Merlis rates
Delphi a ``buy'' and expects it to rise to the high $20s in the
next year. It closed on Friday at $19.625.
</P>
<P>
   Still, because Delphi lacks much of a track record as a public
company, a primer may be in order. Until Friday, when GM spun off
80.1 percent of it to GM shareholders and contributed an additional
2.2 percent to a nonpension retirement plan, Delphi was the 20
percent of GM that made auto parts _ from spark plugs to radios. It
is the nation's 36th-largest company in revenue, and its stock was
recently added to the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   In early February, GM sold 100 million Delphi shares _ about
17.7 percent of the company _ in an initial public offering,
raising $1.7 billion. Shares were sold at $17 and closed their
first day at $18.4375.
</P>
<P>
   Some advise caution. ``There are many unknowns,'' said Maryann
N. Keller, an analyst at ING Baring, an investment bank. ``Delphi
right now is going through its coming-out party.''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi's rivals, including Lear, Dana, Johnson Controls and TRW,
have longer track records. But Delphi trades for just 10.3 times
analysts' estimates for 1999 earnings. Johnson Controls, by
contrast, trades for 15.5 times 1999 earnings.
</P>
<P>
   So some say Delphi is a keeper. ``Delphi is attractive,'' said
Nancy T. Dennin, a manager for Legg Mason Total Return Trust, which
owns about 310,000 GM shares. ``The stock is very undervalued.''
</P>
<P>
   Delphi has two big challenges, one short-term and one long-term.
First, analysts worry that Delphi may face a strike this year. The
company's three-year labor contract with factory workers expires
this fall and must be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
   A strike at GM last year resulted in a special charge of $450
million for Delphi, one of three that contributed to its 1998 net
loss of $93 million. Without them, Delphi would have earned $889
million, down 36 percent from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, Delphi must win new customers as it holds onto its
business with GM, whose share of the automotive market has been
decreasing. Just $6.2 billion of Delphi's $28.5 billion in sales
last year came from non-GM business.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chief executive, has set ambitious
goals. By 2002, he wants Delphi to have a return on net assets of
12.5 percent, up from a pro forma 10 percent at the end of 1998,
and to hit a net income margin of 5 percent, up from a pro forma
3.1 percent. He wants earnings per share to grow more than 10
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   The company may also buy some rivals. But Battenberg promises to
be on the lookout only for those that would add to earnings in the
first full year. ``We're a growth stock at the right price,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In part to help convince investors to keep their shares, Delphi
is spending about $1 million on an ad campaign, starting Sunday, to
introduce itself to people who have never heard of it. In one ad,
an announcer says, ``We're probably in your garage right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Some GM shareholders will be surprised to find Delphi in their
portfolios, too.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 30, will move Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that a congressional committee has
released its three-volume, 872-page techno thriller on what it
believes was the theft of atomic secrets by Chinese spies, much of
Washington is agog. But the uproar overlooks an arresting fact. For
more than half a decade, the Clinton administration was shoveling
atomic secrets out the door as fast as it could, literally by the
ton. Free to all takers, including China's bomb makers, were
millions of previously classified ideas and documents related to
nuclear arms. The tale of that giveaway and what it helped
accomplish, its architects say, is more subtle and perhaps
ultimately more important than the congressional nail-biter. By
William F. Broad. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT-BEHAVIOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the nation's school year
limps to an anxious close, with teachers and principals exhausted
from worry about safety and undetected rage, educators and
psychologists say they are re-examing adolescent behavior _ the
moods, the cliques, the barely repressed violence _ and finding
that American society has failed to come to terms with how such
behavior has changed in recent decades. By Ethan Bronner. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   GUN-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Second Amendment, the orphan
of the Bill of Rights, has been written off as a legal backwater
for decades. Judges and legal scholars have glossed over its
guarantee of the right ``to keep and bear arms'' as if it were so
much propaganda for the National Rifle Association. But now, just
as gun control is gaining momentum, the provision one legal scholar
calls ``the embarrassing Second Amendment'' is being taken
seriously for the first time in modern memory, with some scholars
and at least one federal judge saying it may guarantee individual
citizens some rights to guns, after all. By William Glaberson. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SHOOTING-REVIEW (Washington) _ It did not happen after the
bullets flew and the bodies fell at a high school in West Paducah,
Ky., in December 1997, nor did it happen on the heels of the
gunfire and bloodshed at schools in Jonesboro, Ark., or
Springfield, Ore., last year. But after Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., became a deadly shooting gallery on April 20, the
earth finally moved, at least politically speaking, in subtle but
undeniable ways. By Frank Bruni. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should defense counsel do
everything in their power to defend a client? Defense lawyers say
that obligation includes suggesting almost any scenario that can
possibly create doubt in a juror's mind. By Laura Masnerus. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   NATO-REVIEW (Undated) _ NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia
has exposed more than policy differences between the European and
American alliance partners. As never before, it has revealed the
vast technological gulf that separates American military
capabilities from those of Britain, France and the others. And
that, in turn, shows just how much the Europeans remain militarily
dependent on the United States for their own defense _ dependent,
and resentful. By Craig R. Whitney. (i category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A
conservative one? Actually, it's hard to tell. By Patricia Cohen.
(i category)
</P>
<P>
   WEST-CODE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Spokane (Wash.) County
Commission this month published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the
West'' to forewarn new and prospective residents about the pitfalls
of supposedly idyllic country life. You might also call it ``How
the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are excerpts. By Tom Kuntz. (a

   SYMPHONIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Imagine being Franz Xaver
Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as
he's writing one of his greatest works. On his deathbed he explains
how he envisions completing it. The rest is up to you. Poor
Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he had to
make up, and he never wrote anything particularly good after that.
The ``Requiem'' case suggests that finishing the unfinished
artworks of the dead has never been an easy business, and recent
news from the art and literary worlds confirms it anew. By Jenny

   POETRY-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that the fanfare around National
Poetry Month in April has died down _ the readings, the poetry
slams, the tractor pulls _ there is time for a little serious
contemplation about the future of the form. Questions abound: Is
there a hot genre? What will the new millennium bring? Are the

again? By Jesse McKinley. (a category)

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, May 30, will move Saturday:
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-REVIEW (Undated) _ Now that a congressional committee has
released its three-volume, 872-page techno thriller on what it
believes was the theft of atomic secrets by Chinese spies, much of
Washington is agog. But the uproar overlooks an arresting fact. For
more than half a decade, the Clinton administration was shoveling
atomic secrets out the door as fast as it could, literally by the
ton. Free to all takers, including China's bomb makers, were
millions of previously classified ideas and documents related to
nuclear arms. The tale of that giveaway and what it helped
accomplish, its architects say, is more subtle and perhaps
ultimately more important than the congressional nail-biter. By
William F. Broad. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   With graphic.
</P>
<P>
   STUDENT-BEHAVIOR-REVIEW (Undated) _ As the nation's school year
limps to an anxious close, with teachers and principals exhausted
from worry about safety and undetected rage, educators and
psychologists say they are re-examing adolescent behavior _ the
moods, the cliques, the barely repressed violence _ and finding
that American society has failed to come to terms with how such
behavior has changed in recent decades. By Ethan Bronner. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   GUN-RIGHTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Second Amendment, the orphan
of the Bill of Rights, has been written off as a legal backwater
for decades. Judges and legal scholars have glossed over its
guarantee of the right ``to keep and bear arms'' as if it were so
much propaganda for the National Rifle Association. But now, just
as gun control is gaining momentum, the provision one legal scholar
calls ``the embarrassing Second Amendment'' is being taken
seriously for the first time in modern memory, with some scholars
and at least one federal judge saying it may guarantee individual
citizens some rights to guns, after all. By William Glaberson. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   COLO-SHOOTING-REVIEW (Washington) _ It did not happen after the
bullets flew and the bodies fell at a high school in West Paducah,
Ky., in December 1997, nor did it happen on the heels of the
gunfire and bloodshed at schools in Jonesboro, Ark., or
Springfield, Ore., last year. But after Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colo., became a deadly shooting gallery on April 20, the
earth finally moved, at least politically speaking, in subtle but
undeniable ways. By Frank Bruni. (a category)
</P>
<P>
   DEFENSE-LAWYERS-REVIEW (Undated) _ Should defense counsel do
everything in their power to defend a client? Defense lawyers say
that obligation includes suggesting almost any scenario that can
possibly create doubt in a juror's mind. By Laura Masnerus. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   NATO-REVIEW (Undated) _ NATO's bombing campaign in Yugoslavia
has exposed more than policy differences between the European and
American alliance partners. As never before, it has revealed the
vast technological gulf that separates American military
capabilities from those of Britain, France and the others. And
that, in turn, shows just how much the Europeans remain militarily
dependent on the United States for their own defense _ dependent,
and resentful. By Craig R. Whitney. (i category)
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-REVIEW (Undated) _ Is Kosovo a liberal cause? A
conservative one? Actually, it's hard to tell. By Patricia Cohen.
(i category)
</P>
<P>
   WEST-CODE-REVIEW (Undated) _ The Spokane (Wash.) County
Commission this month published a pamphlet called the ``Code of the
West'' to forewarn new and prospective residents about the pitfalls
of supposedly idyllic country life. You might also call it ``How
the West Is Not Fun.'' Here are excerpts. By Tom Kuntz. (a
category)
</P>
<P>
   SYMPHONIES-REVIEW (Undated) _ Imagine being Franz Xaver
Suessmayr. Your teacher, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, is dying, just as
he's writing one of his greatest works. On his deathbed he explains
how he envisions completing it. The rest is up to you. Poor
Suessmayr. No one can say which parts of the ``Requiem'' he had to

AT A CROSSROADS OF AN OIL BOOM, EVERYONE COMES TO CHARLIE'S  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: La.)   (af)  
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKU, Azerbaijan _ Night is falling over Baku, and Charlie
Schroeder is upset that there aren't any nutshells on the floor of
his bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone who comes in gets a free basket of peanuts, and they
throw the shells on the floor, just like they should,'' Schroeder
groused over a glass of imported beer. ``But I can't get my people
to understand that the shells create an atmosphere. They think it's
just a mess, and they go right over and sweep it up. What can you
do?''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the foreigners who are here to ride the great
Caspian oil boom, life without Schroeder is hard to imagine. He has
been in Azerbaijan for eight years, almost as long as the country
has been independent, and his bars and restaurants are temples
where the expatriate community worships.
</P>
<P>
   Boom towns always seem to have someone like him. He is a beacon,
a pillar, a taste of home. He makes money by giving people what
they want, and they love him for it.
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his customers, Schroeder, 58, is a lifelong oil
gypsy. He has worked in most places where oil is produced, always
playing a role similar to the one he fills here. He spent 20 years
in the Middle East, and when rumors about big Caspian Sea oil
strikes began to emerge in the early 1990s, he grabbed the chance
for a new adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is a supplier by trade. His company, Caspian Sea
Ventures, specializes in obtaining whatever foreign firms here need
but don't have the time or expertise to find and import. He likes
to say that there isn't a product or service he can't provide.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an oil company needs industrial lubricants or computer
disks, whether it wants to commission an underwater survey or
arrange catering for workers on an offshore platform, he can see to
it.
</P>
<P>
   When Schroeder arrived in Azerbaijan, it was a grim place,
spiraling toward anarchy and racked by civil war, hyperinflation
and despair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody held their head up,'' he recalled. ``You never saw a
local person smile. Toilet paper, food, whatever _ they couldn't
buy it and they didn't have it. The government was a mess. When I
say bleak, I mean it was (italics)really(end italics) bleak.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder wrought one of the first visible changes in Baku.
Hearing foreigners complain that there was no place for them to eat
or drink, he opened a restaurant and bar that served what he called
``good ol' American food'' like hamburgers and fried chicken, as
well as jambalaya, gumbo and other specialties from his native New
Orleans. The place was an instant hit, and he soon opened a second,
a third and a fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder gives much of the credit for the restaurants' success
to his wife, Marie, who oversees their day-to-day operation. But it
is Schroeder who has established himself as the life of Baku's
party.
</P>
<P>
   At his newest place, Finnegan's, done in an Irish-pub motif,
Schroeder cannot shoot a game of pool without being interrupted a
dozen times by greetings or slaps on the back. Everyone seems to
have a good word for him, right down to the casually dressed fellow
at the bar whom he described as ``the CIA _ I mean, the security
guy at the American embassy.''
</P>
<P>
   Over blackened fish at Schroeder's Ragin' Cajun, or burritos and
refried beans at his Margaritaville, or malt whiskey and peanuts at
Finnegan's, much of the talk is about oil. These are the places to
hear the latest speculation about which wells look good and which
are dogs, or to share the hot gossip about who's up and who's down.
What Schroeder doesn't know about the Caspian oil business is
mostly what he doesn't want to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a living legend,'' said Kerry Karvas, who heads a
geological research firm, as he finished a drink at Finnegan's on a
recent evening. ``Everybody knows him, and everybody respects him.
His handshake is golden. For him to have created what he's got in
Baku is just an outstanding achievement.''
</P>
<P>
   In Azerbaijan, as in much of the former Soviet Union, it is
difficult for businesses to function without judicious applications
of what Westerners might call bribery.
</P>
<P>
   Moving cargo through the Baku airport normally requires the
payment of emoluments, and since both Schroeder's supply business
and his restaurants depend on imports, it is universally assumed
here that he has longstanding financial relationships with many
customs officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said with a grin when asked about such practices,
``no comment.'' But he did agree to tell how he persuaded the
airport authorities that there were limits to what he would pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a big shipment of frozen fish and shrimp come in one
time, and they wanted to charge me so much,'' he said. ``Finally I
just said, `OK, you've got the shipment,' and walked out of there.
After a couple of days the stuff began stinking to high heaven.
They didn't know how to get rid of it, and I wouldn't take it. That
cost me a bit, but I loved it. They learned how to get reasonable
after that.''
</P>
<P>
   During the mid-1990s, oil companies and world strategists were
in a frenzy over the Caspian region, sensing that huge fortunes and
the interests of empires were at stake here. A few dry holes and
pullouts by several companies, together with falling oil prices,
have tempered that enthusiasm. Schroeder, however, scoffs at the
doubters.
</P>
<P>
   ``What made everyone nervous is that there was so much hype
here,'' he said. ``The media had it that anywhere you'd pick a hole
in the ground, you'd find oil. But oil men know better. They're
riding this thing out just fine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rest assured, there's oil here, from the top of this Caspian
right down to the bottom. All the big players are here. It's all
going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   As he rose to greet yet another customer, Schroeder winced to
see a waitress busily sweeping away a small pile of peanut shells
from under the bar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They just won't listen to me,'' he shrugged. ``And why should
they? These kids are way overqualified. Most of them speak anywhere
from 4 to 13 languages, which makes me sick to my stomach because I
can't even speak English. I speak New Orleans and a little bit of
Texan.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's enough to get along in this world,'' he added,
``and I'm having a hell of a good time doing it.''

AMERICAN FAMILY PUBLISHERS SETTLES WITH FOUR MORE STATES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Ind., Maine, Mich., N.J., S.C., W.Va.)  (rk) 
 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla., _ American Family Publishers, one of the nation's
two largest sweepstakes promotion companies, agreed on Friday to
extensive changes in its practices and a $4 million settlement of
civil charges by four states that the company deceived consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the company will stop telling recipients of
its mailings that they are winners or members of a group of
finalists or semifinalists unless that is true. It will also send
special notices to customers who buy large numbers of magazines in
a year, reminding them that no purchase is necessary to enter the
sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement resolved lawsuits charging deceptive practices
that were filed against the company in Florida, Indiana, South
Carolina and West Virginia. The states had accused American Family
Publishers of selling magazines by tricking customers into thinking
they had won a sweepstakes prize or falsely suggesting that they
had to buy something to win.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, the company entered into a similar agreement with 32
other states, and a lawsuit by Connecticut is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Butterworth, the attorney general of Florida, said:
``Unlike millions of sweepstakes entries sent out by American
Family Publishers, this agreement is definitely a winner. It is
intended to eliminate consumer deception in the future while
holding the company responsible for past abuses.''
</P>
<P>
   American Family Publishers, which is based in Jersey City, N.J.,
and owned in part by Time-Warner, the world's largest entertainment
company, did not admit any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Caughman, the chief executive of American Family
Publishers, said in a statement that the agreement demonstrated the
company's commitment to consumer protection. ``This multistate
agreement represents a major step forward for American Family
Publishers and, potentially, our entire industry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   People who bought magazines through the company's sweepstakes
promotions in the four states will share $3 million from the
settlement, though a formula has not yet been devised. The
remaining $1 million will cover the cost of the investigations by
the states.
</P>
<P>
   The company will also make two donations of $10,000 each to the
Muscular Dystrophy Foundation in the names of Dick Clark and Ed
McMahon, its two celebrity spokesmen who had been named defendants.
</P>
<P>
   About a third of all new magazine subscriptions are sold through
sweepstakes, which offer contests with multimillion-dollar prizes
to persuade people to buy magazines. Consumer advocates have long
accused American Family Publishers and the other major sweepstakes
company, Publishers Clearing House, of using official-sounding
language and gimmicks to lure people into purchases. The companies
have said that their contests are not deceptive and follow state
and federal laws.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Jeffrey A. Modisett, the attorney general of Indiana, said the
revised practices accepted by American Family Publishers had moved
the states a step closer to developing minimum standards for the
direct-mail industry.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously
approved a bill intended to prevent misleading sweepstakes mailings
by imposing new disclosure guidelines on contest entries and
raising civil penalties to $2 million. The legislation, sponsored
by Sens. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and Carl Levin, D-Mich, is
expected to go to the full Senate for a vote later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said the bill would provide new authority for the U.S.
Postal Service to investigate and stop deceptive mailings while
protecting the ability of states to impose tougher requirements on
sweepstakes companies.
</P>
<P>
   Elderly people have been the most visible victims of what the
state attorneys general described as deceptive practices. Advocates
for the elderly say they are often more vulnerable to
official-appearing documents and to the promises of Clark and
McMahon.
</P>
<P>
   Many people have complained that elderly relatives spend
thousands of dollars on subscriptions to magazines they never read
because they mistakenly believe they must buy magazines to have a
chance to win. Some have even traveled to Tampa, Fla., where the
customer service operations of American Family Publishers is
located, in the mistaken belief that they have won because their
entry form says they have.
</P>
<P>
   The practices that American Family Publishers agreed to are
intended to protect all vulnerable consumers, officials of the
various states said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to notifying people who buy large numbers of
magazines that no purchase is necessary, the company agreed to
clearly and conspicuously print on forms that no purchase is
necessary and that a customer's chances of winning are not enhanced
by previous purchases. Also, sweepstakes rules must be printed in
type that is at least one-ninth of an inch high.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As E-phoria ended? Highflying Internet stocks look
mighty weak. Even on Friday, when other NASDAQ stocks were strong,
many Internet shares couldn't muster their typical big moves up. As
the week ended, shares of Internet concerns were well off their
mid-April peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The Interactive Week index of 50 stocks is down 17 percent from
its highs, while Thestreet.com index of 20 Net companies has fallen
26 percent since April 12.
</P>
<P>
   Battered E-investors are wondering whether the recent action is
simply a pause in an upward trend or the beginning of the end of a
glorious ride in these stocks.
</P>
<P>
   While no one is certain, there is a host of reasons why the
downturn may continue. Broadly speaking, investing in Internet
shares has changed. And investors who don't realize that are
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   The factors working against these stocks are both macro and
micro.
</P>
<P>
   One of the big-picture problems is rising interest rates _ bad
for almost all equities, but especially damaging to stocks of
Internet companies, which rely heavily on debt to finance their
money-losing operations. As interest rates rise, these companies'
debt costs do, too.
</P>
<P>
   Recent figures on Web use are also worrisome. Merrill Lynch's
estimates of the total number of Internet users declined from 61.6
million in March to 61.1 million in April. While Merrill's resident
Internet bull, Henry Blodget, cautions that one month may not make
a trend, he points out that April's drop was only the second such
decline in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more significant than either interest rates or Web use,
however, is the shift in supply and demand that has changed the way
these shares trade. Simply put, there are many more E-sellers than
there were before _ a change, almost imperceptible, that is
weighing on many Internet stocks today.
</P>
<P>
   Start with the throngs of companies taking their shares to
market. According to Commscan LLC, an investment banking research
company in New York, there have been 69 initial public offerings of
Internet-related shares so far this year. During all of 1998, there
were only 42 such offerings.
</P>
<P>
   And while E-commerce companies accounted for 11.5 percent of all
new issues last year, excluding closed-end funds and American
depository receipts, Internet IPOs have accounted for 44 percent of
new stock issues in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Also adding to supply is the fact that as newly public Internet
concerns age, more stock hits the market from executives and
insiders. These individuals are generally prohibited from selling
any shares until several months after the IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   Even as extra Internet shares flood the market, demand is drying
up. One measure: The money going into Internet-related mutual funds
has dropped from $470 million in the week ended April 14 to $34
million last week.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating matters is a small-picture issue: a dearth of
natural buyers _ the short-sellers _ waiting to step in even if
these stocks keep falling. Investors willing to risk their money
selling stocks short must buy them back later to close their
positions.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, short-sellers represent future buyers. But since so
many who bought this way lost their shirts betting against Internet
stocks, few remain standing or solvent.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the craze, Internet buyers were many while the
sellers were few. Now the tables have turned. Ah, well. It was fun
while it lasted.

   ABUJA, Nigeria _ At the U-Fine Barbers Shop in the slum of
Nyanya here, Nigeria's final day under military rule registered
with a mixture of great hope for the future and last-minute jitters
about a return to civilian government _ long promised, yet often
postponed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a day we have been looking forward to,'' said Thomas
Idoko, a 29-year-old teacher, who was getting a trim. ``We thought
it would never take place, but now I am expecting great changes
both in the economy and society.''
</P>
<P>
   The barber, John Agbo, 21, wished that the long-awaited day
would bring a more personal change. ``I pray to God that I can get
a richer shop,'' he said, mentioning air conditioning, sharper
clippers, a bigger waiting area. He said he would settle, though,
for reliable electricity from the government so that his old
clippers would not stop working in mid-hum.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, whose 122 million people make it Africa's most populous
nation, changes governments on Saturday; the generals who have
ruled it since 1983 are giving way to a civilian government elected
in February. Since the departing president, Gen. Abdulsalami
Abubakar, announced last July that a civilian government would take
over on May 29, the date has loomed before Nigerians as the
finishing line of a political marathon.
</P>
<P>
   And only 24 hours before the big day, there were doubts in
Nyanya, amid the expressions of optimism, that the line would be
crossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly elated that the handover will take place,'' said
Friday Nathaniel, 18, who was waiting for his turn at the
barbershop. ``We are praying that it should happen as it has been
promised. I expect the incoming administration will do something in
the area of job opportunities. I am now just like a beggar with no
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Nyanya is on the outskirts of this capital's center, a world
away from the five-star international hotels, where Nigerian and
foreign lobbyists were furiously slapping backs this week, and a
dinner was held to honor Stella Obasanjo, the wife of
President-elect Olusegun Obasanjo, the retired general and one-time
military ruler.
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria, ruled by the military for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960, teetered on the edge of collapse
under the extremely repressive and corrupt government of Gen. Sani
Abacha. But after five years in power, Abacha died suddenly last
June, setting off a series of political reforms that is culminating
in the inauguration on Saturday. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, President
Clinton's special envoy to Africa, is to lead the American
delegation at the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday morning, the dirt road outside U-Fine Barbers was
flooded after a night of heavy rains. A block away, in a heap of
uncollected garbage, a baby goat could be seen butting a rooster
over an apparently tasty morsel.
</P>
<P>
   Nyanya came into existence in the 1980s after Nigeria, its
coffers flush from the oil boom, decided to move its capital to
Abuja from Lagos. Over the years, Nigerians from seemingly every
corner of this country gravitated to Nyanya, divided by religion
and ethnicity but seemingly united in their concept of a better
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the new government to increase the salaries of the
workers and to help the poor,'' said Ezekiel Oyeleru, 13, who was
milling around with other children outside the barbershop. The
children have not attended school in months, since unpaid teachers
began striking.
</P>
<P>
   ``To repair our roads,'' said Charles Jeremiah, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our homes,'' Ezekiel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To repair our schools and to reduce our school fees,'' Charles
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazarus Mohammed, 26, struggled to push his wheelbarrow around
water-filled potholes in front of the barbershop. It was laden with
plastic containers that he had filled with water from a tap and
that he was going to sell in a remote corner of Nyanya for 5 cents
each.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mai ruwa!'' a woman cried to him in Hausa, the dominant
language and ethnic group in northern Nigeria. ``Water boy! Your
jerrycans are leaking.''
</P>
<P>
   The water boy stopped. ``Nigeria will be great a year from
now,'' he said before going on. ``We are suffering now. But after
suffering is enjoyment.''
</P>
<P>
   Elegant Ukpong, 35, was not ready to celebrate yet. Ukpong was
one of the hundreds of men in Nyanya, called okada-men, who ferry
passengers on their motorcycles for a living.
</P>
<P>
   ``People still have doubts that the handover will take place,''
the okada-man said. ``They are afraid of all the rumors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Last week we heard that Obasanjo was killed,'' he said,
referring to rumors that suddenly swept the country and caused
riots in Lagos. ``So we still have doubts. Until I see the new
government here _ 24 hours from now _ I will not go out and
jubilate.''
</P>
<P>
   But then, the okada-man said, he will party. ``Anything my hand
can reach,'' he said, ``I will eat to make my mind happy.''

WESTERN CONFERENCE FINALS MATCHUPS
</HEADLINE>

By RICHIE WHITT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seeds: 1. San Antonio Spurs vs. 2. Portland Trail Blazers
</P>
<P>
   Season series: Spurs, 3-1. All were close games, with Portland
winning by five at home before the Spurs took the last three _ by
one and by eight (in overtime) in San Antonio and 87-81 at the Rose
Garden on May 4 in a game that clinched home-court edge throughout
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Spurs update: This is their fifth appearance in a conference
finals ('79 in the East; '82, '83, '95 in the West) but they are
still looking for their first NBA Finals berth. ... They are glad
to see Portland and not Utah, which eliminated them in '96 and last
season. ... Off since Sunday, they went 8-1 during the season after
at least two days' rest. ... They are 38-6 since March, including
7-1 in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Blazers update: They are in the West finals for the first time
since '92. ... Only reserves Stacey Augmon and Greg Anthony had
ever been on a playoff-series winner before this season. ... They
are a league-best 27-3 at home, including 5-0 in the playoffs. ...
The Blazers reacted as if they had won the NBA championship after
eliminating Utah, with several players taking off their jerseys and
jumping around in a jubilant mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   Injury update: Blazers F Stacey Augmon is nursing a sore knee
but is expected to play. The Spurs are healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Point guard: San Antonio's Avery Johnson is responsible for
getting the ball to Tim Duncan, but he has also started making open
jumpers. He has increased his scoring to 15 points per game in the
playoffs and upped his free-throw percentage from 54 to 68.
Portland's Damon Stoudamire is both electric and erratic, and is
often replaced down the stretch by defensive specialist Greg
Anthony. Stoudamire and Anthony are not counted on for scoring,
going a combined 1-of-14 in the Game 6 clincher against Utah. Edge:
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting guard: A crucial battle between Portland's offensive
leader Isaiah Rider and San Antonio defensive stopper Mario Elie.
The tenacious Elie often frustrated Kobe Bryant in the semifinals,
but will have to deal with a surprisingly strong and focused Rider
on the low blocks. Elie isn't afraid to take the key 3-pointer, but
Rider has flourished under late-game pressure by making his past 22
free throws. Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Small forward: San Antonio's Sean Elliott has his quickness and
shooting touch back, and is more likely to drive the lane than
Portland's Walt Williams. Basically living on the perimeter,
Williams is averaging only 5.0 points per game and is on the bench
in favor of Rasheed Wallace or Jim Jackson down the stretch. Edge:
Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Power forward: Portland's Brian Grant got the best of Karl
Malone last series despite scoring only 22 points the last three
games. He's a ferocious rebounder and decent passer out of double
teams, but the Spurs have the luxury of playing him straight up
with David Robinson. The former MVP is concentrating more on
defense and rebounding these days, but must avoid the foul trouble
he consistently found against the Lakers. Edge: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Center: San Antonio's Tim Duncan is the new kid on the blocks,
dominating Shaquille O'Neal to the tune of 70 points in the last
two games of the Spurs' sweep. Portland's Arvydas Sabonis had room
to operate against the Jazz as Utah was forced to double-team Grant
in the low post. But Sabonis will probably settle for top-of-the
key jumpers against San Antonio and get into early foul trouble
against Duncan. Edge: Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   Bench: Portland goes nine deep, but counts on just defense from
Anthony and Augmon. Forward Rasheed Wallace, who could start in
this series, dominates smaller defenders in the paint while Rider
backup Jim Jackson made the extra pass and knocked down key free
throws against the Jazz. Because of Malik Rose and Will Perdue, the
Spurs have the bodies to bang with the Blazers inside. San Antonio
needs another good-shooting series from Jaren Jackson, who produced
42 points in the last two games against LA. Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching: Gregg Popovich resurrected the Spurs from a 6-8 start
by handing the keys to the car over to Duncan. Portland's Mike
Dunleavy was named the NBA coach of the year by juggling
personalities and unprecedented depth. Dunleavy has more options
and isn't afraid to try peculiar lineup combinations in key
situations. Edge: Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Prediction: Defense wins championships, and, in this case, the
Western Conference finals. The Spurs can play at any pace, winning
games against the Lakers with point totals of 79 and 118. The Spurs
block an average of seven shots a game and will not wilt against
Portland's inside tenacity like Utah did. The Blazers put unmatched
pressure on the ball and have the luxury of a defender in Wallace
who can guard Duncan one-on-one. Portland is on a roll, but
Duncan's emergence has him headed to the Hall of Fame, and his team
into the Finals. Spurs in six.

LEGISLATIVE BILL MAY BE BIG WINNER WITH TEXAS LOTTERY PLAYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN W. GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Friday was a day for legislative compromises
under the Capitol dome, and among the likely winners were Texas
lottery players.
</P>
<P>
   Though final votes remain to be taken before Monday's
adjournment, a bill designed to increase some lottery prizes later
this year was reworked to the satisfaction of both lottery
officials and lawmakers who had alleged that the advertising budget
of the Texas Lottery Commission was excessive.
</P>
<P>
   The deal that was struck will allow scratch-off prizes to
increase in fiscal 2000, which starts Sept. 1, and doesn't require
changes in advertising spending that year. But come fiscal 2001,
for every 1 percent increase in prize payouts for the instant win
games, a reduction of $1 million will be required in advertising
spending the following year, said Rep. Ron Wilson, D-Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's House Bill 844, which was filed in January, has been
pending in a House-Senate conference committee for two weeks to
resolve a dispute that developed when the Senate amended his bill
to place new constraints on the agency's $40 million advertising
budget.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate wanted the agency, beginning Sept. 1, to reduce
advertising by $1 million for each 1 percent increase in prizes
over the fiscal year 1999 average prize payout.
</P>
<P>
   Lottery officials, who opposed the reduction in advertising
spending, have been hoping for authority to increase prizes since
1997, when lawmakers placed a cap on prizes in the appropriations
bill. The agency has blamed sagging sales in part on the prize
reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Before 1997, there were no specific legal caps on lottery
prizes, though rules were imposed by the commission to limit prizes
to 57.45 percent of proceeds. The 1997 law forced the commission to
lower from 62 percent to 52 percent the total prize payouts for
instant games. It also created a formula that capped online game
prizes at 52.95 percent in fiscal 1998 and 52.45 percent
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's bill would replace the 1997 law with a new formula. The
cap for online games would not be affected. The overall purpose is
to help the lottery reverse a trend of declining ticket sales by
allowing bigger prizes that could attract more players.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year, the lottery can raise the prize payout up to
the level it was before last session's change, so they can go back
to 57 percent as the total amount for prize payout _ without any
loss in advertising funds,'' Wilson said.
</P>
<P>
   After fiscal 2000, ``the advertising will be based on the amount
of prize payout over and above the 52 percent,'' he said. ``So if
they go from 52 percent to 53 percent payout, then the next year,
the budget decrease will be $1 million.''
</P>
<P>
   The lottery bill was one of about 150 measures in House-Senate
conference committees _ the last bills standing as the 76th
Legislature on Saturday entered the 138th day of its 140-day
session. Parliamentary rules require that compromises be put into
writing by midnight Saturday so that members can read the revisions
before final votes as late as Sunday. Monday is devoted to
technical corrections only.
</P>
<P>
   School finance and tax relief measures were the most significant
issues still unresolved, but dozens of other topics were the
subject of feverish bargaining sessions, mainly behind closed
doors.
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished were bills to increase some rural speed limits;
revamp annexation laws; create more district courts; force Austin
to leave open the airport that was closed last weekend; and create
the gang database sought by Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, meanwhile, carried through with his threat to veto a bill
that would have imposed a 2-percent sales tax on fireworks to
establish a Rural Volunteer Fire Department Assistance Program.
Bush said he killed the legislation because it imposed an
``unwarranted tax increase.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the program duplicated the efforts of the
Commission on Fire Protection.

AFTER A COMPUTER-AGE WINDFALL, WORKERS REINVENT THEIR LIVES  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please use this version)  
 (af)  
 By ANDREA ADELSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOUNTAIN VALLEY, Calif. _ Within the modest headquarters and
computer memory factory of the Kingston Technology Co. is a living
laboratory in how people react when blessed with windfalls.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, nine years after Kingston's start, its Taiwanese
immigrant founders, David Sun and John Tu, sold 80 percent of the
company to the Softbank Corp. of Japan for $1.5 billion. The
founders _ now fabulously wealthy _ generously set aside $100
million from the sale's proceeds for workers.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in January 1997, they lavished $38 million upon 530
employees, giving them bonuses that ranged from $2,000 to six
figures, depending on seniority, pay and performance.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, an additional $20 million was divided among 700
workers, and a like amount is expected to be distributed to more
than 1,000 employees in July.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the bonuses, the founders gave workers memos advising
them to pay off debts and become homeowners. While most employees
paid some heed, many also went on spending sprees.
</P>
<P>
   Most have remained on the payroll and are intensely loyal to the
founders. But some have seen the bonuses as a once-in-a-lifetime
way out of a humdrum existence _ not that work at Kingston is all
that humdrum. Thanks to the founders' management style, the company
still has free Friday lunches, 100 percent health coverage and
unstinting retirement benefits _ Kingston puts $3,000 a year in
each employee's 401(k) and then matches employee contributions of
up to $2,000, dollar for dollar.
</P>
<P>
   It's a situation that cries for independent financial advice.
Asked what his counsel would be for the employees, Mark D. Wilson,
a certified financial planner in Newport Beach, Calif., said, ``I'd
like them to realize what a wonderful gift they've been given.''
</P>
<P>
   He agreed with the founders that home-buying and eliminating
short-term debt would be prudent uses for the money, but he pointed
out that several of the employees had invested some of the money
for their children but had not put any of it away for their own
retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he would advise workers to invest half the bonus,
after taxes, for their own retirements _ a far better use than
whittling down mortgages, he said, because mortgage interest is
tax-deductible. For a young employee, he added, a long-term
investment could grow enough to allow an early retirement.
</P>
<P>
   He was not surprised, however, that some recipients did not see
things that way. ``Since they are young, I'd expect them to take
the money and run,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The bonus was a turning point for Darin Farriola, a four-year
product manager at Kingston who had written a screenplay after
hours. ``There's no more excuses,'' said Farriola, who quit
Kingston in 1997, shortly after receiving a bonus equal to a
half-year's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring that he could cover his bills for awhile, Farriola
began looking for investors to bankroll his film. ``The only thing
I ever directed before was traffic,'' said Farriola, who is 32.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he succeeded in attracting backers for the film,
``Ivory Tower,'' a drama about corporate America. A private showing
for Kingston employees at a local theater received raves. Recently,
broadcast rights were sold to the Showtime cable network, which has
scheduled the film to run sometime in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kingston was the best opportunity I ever had in my life,''
Farriola said. ``But it's not a world I'd go back to.'' The film
work, he said as he worked in his office on stories for movies yet
to come, ``is something I want to do the rest of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, the financial planner, applauded his choice. ``Following
your dream is wonderful,'' he said. ``Whether he's successful or
not, it's not blowing the money.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For Jaime Chavez, whose family in Mexico City owned a moving
company, America initially was a mean place. For four years, he
endured $4-an-hour landscaping jobs. Digging ditches made his hands
sore, and he got so tired that he fell asleep during lunch breaks.
After asking a boss about unpaid overtime wages, Chavez said, he
got the pay but lost the job.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His fortunes improved after a cousin working at Kingston told
him of a one-day job that soon became full-time, paying $9.50 an
hour. Now, Chavez is the company's maintenance and warehouse
supervisor, managing 12 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``They give you opportunities even if you are inexperienced,''
said Chavez, 34, who sends his parents in Mexico up to $1,000 a
month from his paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   His bonus, which moved him and his family solidly into the ranks
of the middle class, he used it for a down payment on a
2,200-square-foot home in Costa Mesa, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a good move, Wilson said. It also meant that his wife,
Marisol Chavez, who is now pregnant with the couple's third child,
did not have to return to work as expected.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider myself lucky,'' Chavez said. ``What I have right
now is thanks to Kingston.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The year before Kingston awarded its first bonus, the mother of
Roseanne Carrillo, a sales manager, died unexpectedly from liver
disease. Ms. Carrillo, 40, borrowed $9,000 for a modest funeral and
buried her mother in an unmarked grave. ``That weighed very heavy
on my mind,'' Ms. Carrillo said.
</P>
<P>
   The bonus paid for an elaborately engraved, $5,000 green
limestone grave marker. ``It was my tribute to her,'' said Ms.
Carrillo, whose father, 69, is Kingston's oldest employee.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the workers are referrals from others, and many
family members work alongside one another. She intends to use her
next bonus to buy the plot next to her mother's.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary payouts instill security, said Ms. Carrillo,
who also erased her credit-card debt. ``Money is such a big worry
for a lot of people,'' she said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Tim R. Westland, 35, Kingston's Webmaster, said the
bonus made him a cash-and-carry consumer, free of car payments and
monthly credit card bills for the first time in a decade. And he
intends to keep it that way.
</P>
<P>
   From a bonus worth more than a year's salary, Westland put 40
percent aside for the education of his 10-year-old daughter. He
also indulged a little, replacing two older-model cars with new
ones and taking a return trip to Maui with his wife, Marci, and
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortune smiled on me,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brandi LaPlante, 29, does not expect in her lifetime to see
another paycheck as big as her sole Kingston bonus, which totaled
three times her annual salary. Even so, Ms. LaPlante, who joined
the company at age 20 and in her six years there worked up to a
senior network sales job, left Kingston in 1997 for a start-up
concern where she expected better opportunities for advancement.
She cried on her last day on the job.
</P>
<P>
   A few months before she received the bonus, she and her husband
had moved into a new home. Much of the bonus went toward
improvements like carpeting, wood floors, custom landscaping and a
patio cover. The couple also opened savings accounts for each of
their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Other money went toward new cars _ and a $1,500, 32-inch
television, a gift for Ms. LaPlante's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first time I've seen my dad cry,'' she said.

PERSONAL WATERCRAFT GET POLLUTION RAP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOWE AND CAROLINE LOUISE COLE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAMPTON, N.H. _ When he's jumping waves at 50 mph aboard his
Yamaha Waverider, Marty Melucci knows he isn't the most popular guy
on the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely love to hate us,'' said Melucci, 28, of
Atkinson, N.H. as he waved to other beachgoers Friday while
dismounting his two-month-old jet ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love it for the speed,'' said Melucci, a salesman for Zales
Jewelers in Salem, N.H. ``I think jet skis have gotten a bad rap.
Sure, you're always going to have some jerks who hug the beach and
cause accidents, but the rest of us who are responsible have a
right to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the scorn of many beachgoers and picnickers who are
annoyed by the noise of their two-cycle, lawnmower-type motors, jet
skis have given the public an additional reason to hate them with a
new report issued this week.
</P>
<P>
   In just three hours of operation, the typical jet ski emits as
much smog-causing unburned gasoline as a new car driven 100,000
miles, according to California Air Resources Board figures cited by
the Izaak Walton League of America, a Maryland conservation group.
</P>
<P>
   And in waters across the country, each year the 1.3 million
personal watercraft (Jet Ski is actually a Kawasaki brand name) in
operation _ which include about 6,600 registered in Massachusetts _
collectively leave an amount of petroleum equivalent to 15 times
the 10.8 million gallons of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster, the
conservation group said, citing industry data.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly not against all forms of recreation, but the
issue is whether regulations concerning personal watercraft have
kept up with the pace of technology,'' said Laurie C. Martin, the
study author. ``I don't think a lot of the users have any idea that
they are so highly polluting.''
</P>
<P>
   But an industry leader sharply disputed the figures. ``There
isn't any science to support any of these numbers,'' said John
Donaldson, state affairs director for the Personal Watercraft
Industry Association. ``What we're dealing with is advocacy
organizations that have no responsibility to support facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson said manufacturers have cut emissions levels by 25
percent on this year's models and are on track to meet a federally
mandated 70 percent reduction by 2006.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody would argue that anything we can do to
make the waters of the country cleaner is not a bad goal,''
Donaldson said.
</P>
<P>
   Out at Hampton Beach for a three-hour ride, Melucci concurs with
Donaldson's assessment, claiming that his 1998 Yamaha has the most
recent emissions controls and he doesn't think it is doing much
damage to the Earth's atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a scuba diver so the environment's a big deal to me,''
Melucci said. ``That's why I make sure to use special oils that
don't pollute the water as much.''
</P>
<P>
   While noting that the chainsaw-like whine of a personal
watercraft ``drives you crazy after a while,'' the Massachusetts
Environmental Police director, Richard Murray, said since Colonial
times state law has stipulated that everyone has a right to ``fish,
fowl and navigate'' in public waters, including in personal
watercraft. ``We can't restrict jet skis outright, but we can
regulate them,'' said Murray.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last 10 years, personal watercraft _ which can reach 70
mph and provide users with exhilarating opportunities to jump over
waves _ have boomed in popularity. More than 200,000 are sold each
year in the United States, about a third of all new boats.
</P>
<P>
   But two-cycle engines of the kind found on personal watercraft,
snowmobiles, lawnmowers and other devices are far more polluting
than tightly regulated automobile engines and have only recently
come under federal scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials acknowledge that the typical two-cycle engine
emits unburned 25 to 30 percent of the gasoline it uses. Paul
Hansen, executive director of the Izaak Walton League, said US
regulators should demand manufacturers move immediately to adopt
European technology that can cut emissions 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond issues of air and water pollution, the noise, wake and
wildlife impacts of personal watercraft have led to growing moves
to restrict their use or ban them outright.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of complaints we receive has increased markedly,''
said Environmental Police Lt. Larry Chenier, head of its boating
safety bureau. ``A lot of the complaints from the public have to do
with the nuisance factor as much as safety-related concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1997, Vermont has banned use of personal watercraft in
any body of water smaller than 300 acres, limiting their use to
about 30 of the state's 285 lakes and ponds. Maine has a 200-acre
limit, and use on Lake Tahoe in California and Nevada will be
banned outright next year.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts regulations forbid personal watercraft in lakes
and ponds smaller than 75 acres and forbid high-speed operation
until they are 150 feet offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Murray, the Environmental Police director, said communities that
have recently imposed restrictions beyond state rules on personal
watercraft include Edgartown, Halifax, Lenox, Mashpee, Phillipston,
Tisbury and Webster.
</P>
<P>
   To date, four people have died in Massachusetts personal
watercraft accidents, including, earlier this month, an off-duty
police officer killed at Salisbury Beach.
</P>
<P>
   James Gomes, head of the Environmental League of Massachusetts,
said, ``There are many smaller water bodies in Massachusetts that
are inappropriate for jet skis. They're too polluting, they're too
noisy, and they're too disruptive.''
</P>
<P>
   But Donaldson, of the industry group, said personal watercraft
are ``a reasonable recreational pursuit. We're not saying we demand
unlimited access, but we don't think it's reasonable for people to
call for an outright ban when they haven't tried intermediate
steps. We do realize there has to be flexibility in managing
waterways.''
</P>
<P>
   David Marley, 27, who rode along with Melucci for his first-time
experience Friday, said he can't wait for another chance to try to
try the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives you a great sense of freedom,'' said the Haverhill
nutritionist. ``Definitely, I will be back.''

HACKERS SHUT DOWN FBI AND SENATE WEB SITES 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A cat-and-mouse game between federal agents and
computer hackers took a twist this week as the hackers turned on
their pursuers by disrupting the Internet Web sites of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Senate, forcing them to remain
shut down Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Both Web sites serve public relations functions, so no
classified, confidential or personal material was compromised.
</P>
<P>
   But as the latest in a series of attacks against government Web
sites, the disruptions underscored the growing concerns of
government investigators that computer systems in many federal
agencies, including those dealing with sensitive material, are too
vulnerable to outside interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical risk,'' said Jack L. Brock Jr., an official
at the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of
Congress, who has studied computer systems throughout the federal
government. ``We found that most agencies have weak computer
security systems in place. This is a serious problem,
government-wide.''
</P>
<P>
   In many cases, the hacking proves to be more annoying than
compromising. This week, for example, vandals succeeded only in
overloading the FBI Web site Wednesday night with requests for
electronic information and in posting inappropriate pictures and
text on the Senate home page.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the authorities said, hackers were retaliating
for raids this week conducted by federal agents against computer
hackers in several states. As a result of the attacks, both sites
were almost immediately shut down as government officials
investigated how the breaches occurred.
</P>
<P>
   But as GAO investigators found by testing government computer
systems in recent years, including those of the Defense Department
and the State Department, hackers can easily do more serious
damage.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 10
field centers, investigators reported to Congress that they
``successfully penetrated several mission-critical systems,''
including one that calculates positioning data for earth-orbiting
spacecraft and another that processes data from the spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The report concluded, ``We could have disrupted NASA's ongoing
command and control operations and stolen, modified or destroyed
system software and data.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration has taken steps to combat threats to
the nation's civilian and military computer systems, including a
directive last May ordering all major departments to develop a plan
to protect their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton proposed spending $1.46 billion to develop a
``Cyber Corps'' of computer security experts to deal with the same
issues.
</P>
<P>
   But Brock said that while government agencies have been
responding quickly to specific problems, like those encountered
this week by the FBI and the Senate, managers have been slower to
implement long-term solutions that would deny unauthorized access
to their computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   The incidents this week reflected a new aspect of the hacking
wars _ the tenacity and fearlessness of a group of cyber-vandals
who have taunted the investigators trying to track them down.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the online version of a tantrum,'' said John
Vranesevich, founder of AntiOnline, a Web site that educates the
public about computer security. ``It's like a parent with a
rebellious 16-year-old who sneaks out of the house, gets punished
and sneaks out again. It's a constant back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   By Friday afternoon, the FBI and Senate sites were still
inaccessible to the public, and officials at both places said they
did not know when they would be reopened.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Carter, an FBI spokesman, said the bureau shut down its Web
site before the hackers could penetrate so-called firewalls that
protect sensitive information. ``When we detected their activity,''
he said, ``we took the appropriate action.''
</P>
<P>
   But hackers made deeper inroads into the Senate computer system,
leaving an obscene message on Thursday that said the intrusion was
in response to the FBI raids.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Little, a spokeswoman for the office of the Senate
sergeant at arms, which operates the Senate Web site, said
unauthorized pictures and text appeared Thursday evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the very latest protective software installed and
updated as recently as two weeks ago,'' Ms. Little said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Web site provides general information on members,
bills before Congress and historical information. The FBI site
contains news releases, crime statistics and general information
about bureau activities, including the FBI's list of the 10 most
wanted fugitives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   FBI agents declined to discuss bureau activity that might have
precipitated the vandalism.
</P>
<P>
   But Vranesevich said that his organization, which closely
monitors hacking and communicates with hackers through their
computer names, has heard from at least six hackers in four states
_ New York, New Jersey, Texas and Washington _ who said they had
been raided this week by federal agents investigating their
activities. The six, he said, all claimed to know each other.
</P>
<P>
   Vranesevich said the attempts to penetrate the FBI Web site were
led by a hacker known as ``Israeli Ghost'' and came in retaliation
for those raids as well as for the grand jury indictment earlier
this month of Eric Burns, a 19-year-old northern Virginia man known
by his Internet name, Zyklon, which was the name of the gas used by
Nazis to exterminate Jews during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Burns was indicted on three counts of ``computer intrusion'' for
breaking into computers operated by the U.S. Information Agency and
two companies. Federal authorities say he is also believed to be a
member of a group that vandalized the White House public Web site
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Lloyd, a spokeswoman for the FBI regional office in
Washington, said Burns is scheduled to be arraigned next month in
Alexandria, Va.

CHEEVER RELIVES THE MOMENT HE WON THE 500 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The words, which came so easily and effortlessly
and served him so well on so many other occasions, escaped Eddie
Cheever Jr. when he arrived in Victory Circle after winning the 82d
Indianapolis 500 last year. Cheever had a microphone shoved in his
face and was asked to describe the range of emotions he felt as a
laurel wreath was draped over his shoulders and a cold bottle of
milk placed in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Emotions? There were so many.
</P>
<P>
   The words to describe them? There were so few.
</P>
<P>
   A man of letters and languages, capable of speaking English,
French, and Italian fluently, Cheever was rendered speechless in
the crowning moment of his racing career after he piloted the car
he owns to victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point in time, I had a team that was vastly
underfinanced, I had a very talented group of people, and I had to
have a good Indy 500,'' Cheever explained. ``I had no choice. I
mean, our company's future depended on it. There was an
unbelievable amount of stress. Throughout the whole 500, I kept
smelling the opportunity, but over 25 years of racing, that had
happened so many times, and so many times I had the rug pulled out
from underneath me that you almost cease to believe that something
good can happen to you.''
</P>
<P>
   So perhaps that was it.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever could scarely believe his good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got down to the last 20 laps and I had the opportunity
to win the race and I knew it was there, the buildup of pressure
was so big,'' he said. ``You focus so hard on what you're doing
that when I actually crossed the start/finish line, I had a hard
time believing it. I mean, I had a very hard time believing it, and
I had all these things going through my mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk about being pumped up on adrenaline. You've been
pumped up on adrenaline for 3 1/2 hours and you've been dodging
bullets and cars are crashing and somebody bumps you from behind
and I almost dragged the fuel pump down the straightaway. I mean,
it's a never-ending roller coaster of emotions, and you have to
keep on being focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``So when I won the race and came into the pits, I was . . . I
had nothing left. I gave everything I had. I had absolutely nothing
left.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived at Indy this year as a conquering hero, but Cheever
nearly had his triumphant return ruined when he almost suffered the
same fate as Al Unser Jr., who won the 1994 Indy 500 but failed to
qualify the following year.
</P>
<P>
   Cheever averted that embarrassment when he made the field on his
third and final attempt during the first day of qualifications a
week ago. Talk about time trials and tribulations. Cheever was
subjected to a hellish pole day when he was the first to take the
track and turned three quick laps that averaged 221.3 miles per
hour before waving off the fourth and final go-round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we win the village idiot award by not taking that
first run,'' said Cheever of the initial attempt that would've
placed him solidly in the fourth row.
</P>
<P>
   He also waved off his second qualifying attempt, leaving him
with one chance to make the race. With a little less than 1 hour 15
minutes left before the track's closing, Cheever set out on his
third attempt and turned four laps in an average of 221.315 m.p.h.,
good for the No. 16 starting spot in the 33-car grid, just on the
inside of Row 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not at all worried about starting off in the middle of the
pack,'' he said. ``We won last year from the 17th position. But it
was a very difficult day. We were like a dog chasing its tail. We
have a much better team than last year, but we still have a lot of
work to do. The most important thing about the 500 is to be in it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely my toughest day as a team owner. But when
I'm out there in my car, it's turn left and go fast. Of all the
open-wheel fans, Indianapolis fans know racing best. There is so
much more attention from the fans. It feels like a family, and I'll
try to win another one for them.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe this time he'll have something profound to say.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was way too powerful of an emotion,'' Cheever said,
recalling that glorious moment in Victory Circle. ``It was very
hard. It was like seeing your first child born. It's hard to
define, but I was very happy. I still am. So I told the story of my
dad (who had told Cheever that if he was going to win only one
race, the Indy 500 should be the one), which was on my mind. That
was what I said. But I'd rather be remembered for the good driving
I did in the Indy 500 than for something I said afterward.''
</P>
<P>
   Or didn't say.

COMMENTARY: WHICH SIDE ARE WE ON? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The indictment of Slobodan Milosevic by the International War
Crimes Tribunal told us nothing new about his character or his
record. He has been carrying out crimes against humanity since
1991, when his forces leveled the Croatian city of Vukovar and
executed 260 men in a Vukovar hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment does make a difference, a profound one. It
clarifies the nature of NATO's war against Milosevic over Kosovo.
And it requires those who have been critical of that war to think
again about which side they are on.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Milosevic is the first serving head of state to be
charged with war crimes, so this war is a first. The reason was
eloquently stated by President Vaclav Havel of the Czech republic
last month in a speech to the Canadian Parliament, reprinted in The
New York Review of Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is probably the first war that has not been waged in the
name of `national interests,''' Havel said, ``but rather in the
name of principles and values ...
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo has no oilfields to be coveted; no member nation in the
alliance (NATO) has any territorial demands on Kosovo ... It is
fighting out of concern for the fate of others. It is fighting
because no decent person can stand by and watch the systematic
state-directed murder of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO air attacks have killed Serbian civilians. That is
regrettable. But it is a price that has to be paid when a nation
falls in behind a criminal leader. It happened in Germany. And it
has happened again in Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   How can a young man, a Serbian paramilitary, demand money from
an Albanian family for a child's life _ and, when they have none to
give, knife the child? That, and other savageries, could take place
only because an evil leader had infected his people with the notion
that others are less human _ are untermenschen.
</P>
<P>
   Even Serbs distant from the atrocities have been affected.
Reports from Belgrade say most people see themselves as victims.
They are oblivious to what Serbian forces have done to other human
beings over the last eight years _ oblivious to Vukovar, to the
rape camps and ethnic cleansing in Bosnia, to the massacres in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 the Serbian commander in Bosnia, Ratko Mladic, told his
gunners in the hills around Sarajevo, ``Burn it all.'' And they
did: hospitals, universities, mosques, homes. That should be
remembered when Serbs today describe themselves as victims.
</P>
<P>
   That NATO's purpose is just does not, of course, mean that it
has fought the war wisely. It has not. Serious military analysts
are agreed that the alliance should not have forsworn the use of
ground troops at the start of its campaign, and should not have
begun the air war so tepidly.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the war inevitable. American diplomacy went in fits and
starts before the final crisis, seeming to lose its way in dealing
with Milosevic's broken promises on Kosovo. In the critical months
beginning in January 1998 President Clinton was persistently
distracted by a special prosecutor obsessed by sex. And Milosevic
well knew that.
</P>
<P>
   But we are in the war now, and for the most urgent political as
well as moral reasons we must win. Even achieving NATO's declared
objectives in Kosovo will not necessarily end the menace of
Slobodan Milosevic. Unless he is captured, he will no doubt make
more trouble in Montenegro and elsewhere. But victory, limited
though it be, is essential.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment of Milosevic may change the politics of the war
in this country too. Many Republicans have tried to use the war
politically. That was the strategy of Rep. Tom DeLay, the GOP whip,
when a motion to support the war came before the House. He urged
Republicans to vote no, making it Bill Clinton's war _ an
astonishing position for a party that usually touts its patriotism.
The motion lost on a tie vote.
</P>
<P>
   The president should go to the country now, on the strength of
the Milosevic indictment, to tell people what this war is about. He
needs stronger public support as a moment of truth approaches.
</P>
<P>
   A summit meeting of the seven leading economic powers and Russia
will be held in Cologne on June 18. If the air war has not brought
Milosevic to accept NATO's demands by then, the prospect of winter
means that the unthinkable will have to be confronted: a ground
war.

SOUTHLAND THEME PARKS   THINKING SMALL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)  
(Sidebars slugged UNIVERSAL-KIDS and KIDDIE-PARKS)  
By CHRIS J. PARKER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Six Flags Magic Mountain has discovered that
teen-agers have little sisters and brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe the brain trust at Scream Central just noticed that
most of their customers are 5-, 6- and 8-year-olds before they turn
into thrill-seeking, money-spending teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   That's the only conclusion possible after spending a day at the
all-new Bugs Bunny World, which opened Thursday. It is Magic
Mountain for the under-4-foot crowd, complete with mini-thrill
rides and interactive zones. Even the drinking fountains are
kid-sized.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll never lose site of the fact that we own the thrill
market in Southern California,'' said Andy Gallardo, spokesman for
the Santa Clarita park. ``What we wanted to do was add an area that
brought thrills to the younger guests.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Magic Mountain has always had an area for the prepubescent
sect. But what began as a rather sad little troll village nearly
three decades ago had never gotten much better than a carnival
sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bugs Bunny World has more rides, better attractions and
just more stuff for the Nickelodeon generation than anything Magic
Mountain has done before.
</P>
<P>
   There are eight new rides and a handful of new attractions,
including a petting zoo and a new animal show. All of it is wrapped
up in a Bugs Bunny-themed bow, from the ties worn by ride operators
to the cartoonish-looking flowers and plants. Even the shrubbery
islands have been kid-sized so the youngsters can sit down without
needing a lift up from mom or dad.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the new kids zone is Looney Tunes Lodge, a
6,000-square-foot, two-story-tall hall filled with thousands of
foam balls. Kids can throw the balls at their friends. Kids can
throw the balls through hoops and holes. Kids can put the balls in
toy cannons and shoot them across the lodge. It's a
Colossus-strength ball pit; bigger, louder and more entertaining
than any fast-food play area.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Mountain also has upgraded its mini-roller coaster from
previous incarnations, ratcheting up the highest points and
twisting the curves a little tighter. In fact, many of the new
rides at Bugs Bunny World are either juiced-up kids' rides or
smaller versions of Magic Mountain's big-kid rides, depending upon
your perspective.
</P>
<P>
   Canyon Blaster is a small version of Psychlone (OK, a much
smaller version). Sylvester's Pounce and Bounce is a two-story tall
version of Freefall, only Pounce and Bounce drops slower and
bounces as it drops, making it feel like riders are sitting on a
big spring.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the younger crowd will appreciate is that all the
rides are big enough for parents to ride along, too. If the ride
gets too intense, Mom or Dad is just a bucket seat away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's rather ingenious of Magic Mountain to give its kids'
rides some adrenaline. Once they've graduated from Sylvester's,
they can bounce over to Freefall or maybe the 41-story-tall
Superman: The Escape, which towers over Bugs Bunny World.
</P>
<P>
   For kids who want tame rides, Bugs Bunny World has a new
pint-sized train and its long-running small carousel. There's also
Yosemite Sam's Flight School, an airplane ride not unlike
Disneyland's Dumbo ride; Pepe Le Pew's Tea Party, which is a lot
like Disney's tea cups; and Taz's Trucking Company, a miniature
Autopia with 4x4 trucks instead of those Ramblers at Fantasyland.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but it's hard to walk through the kids' section of an
amusement park without thinking about The House The Mouse Built.
How do Bugs' new digs stack up? It's fair to say Magic Mountain
does kid stuff about as well as Disneyland does thrill rides _ not
great but certainly not bad.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Magic Mountain isn't the only Southern California
amusement park hoping to attract the entire family. Disney
practically invented the bait-the-kid-and-hook-her-dad's-wallet
trick, and it's spent the last 40 years or so perfecting its small
kids' world.
</P>
<P>
   Now, other amusement parks realize that the best way to steer
minivans into their parking lot is from the car seat in the back.
Children control their family's spending habits and amusement park
choices as sure as there's a ``Rugrats'' video in the VCR and
Disney sheets on the beds.
</P>
<P>
   Legoland wasn't built in north San Diego County to attract
Marines from Camp Pendleton. It opened this spring a few plastic
blocks away from Interstate 5, within shouting distance of the car
loads of vacationers shuttling between San Diego and L.A. Shouting

   Universal Studios Hollywood is unveiling new attractions this
summer for Nick kids, literally. They include ``Blue's Clues
Live,'' a live version of the hugely popular Nickelodeon cable
television show, and an eating area where kids can have breakfast
with their favorite Rugrats, Marvel and Universal cartoon
characters.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes Magic Mountain's new Bugs Bunny World both
impressive and imperative. Magic Mountain had always been able to
attract teen-agers looking for a good scream; now, as its
competition diversifies, it also figured out a way to get the rest
of the family out of the car. &QL;

BOEING SWEETENS DEAL TO TRY TO LAND ISRAELI ORDER FOR FIGHTER
JETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JAMES WALLACE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ In a last-ditch effort to improve its chances of
winning a crucial order, The Boeing Co. has sweetened its bid to
build fighter jets for Israel by offering companies in that country
an additional $500 million in subcontracting work, a Boeing
spokesman confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The latest offer was delivered personally to the Israeli Defense
Ministry by John Boyle, vice president for international
development for Boeing's military aircraft division.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is expected to decide soon whether to buy about $2.5
billion in new fighters from Boeing or Lockheed Martin, and it has
been pressing both defense contractors for steep discounts.
</P>
<P>
   The competition is between Boeing's F-15 and Lockheed Martin's
F-16.
</P>
<P>
   The fighter plane order, the largest ever by Israel, is
considered critical for Boeing, which recently announced that it
will cut up to 7,000 jobs by 2001 at its fighter plant in St. Louis
because of a lack of orders for its F-15 and F-18C/D fighters.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Israel ordered 25 of the most advanced version of the
Boeing fighter, the F-15I. The last of those planes recently was
delivered. The only F-15s still in the production line are
replacement planes for the U.S. Air Force and the last of a
72-plane order for Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing decided to cut its St. Louis work force after Greece last
month opted to buy Lockheed's fighter. Boeing had been counting on
Greece to order more than 35 F-15s, which could have extended
production of the fighter for another two years.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15 line will shut down early next year, and the F-18C/D
line later in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Boeing wins new orders from Israel, deliveries would not
begin until 2001, and that means a break in the F-15 line when the
last plane now on order is delivered early next year.
</P>
<P>
   The F-15 has been a highly profitable fighter for Boeing, and
company executives are doing all they can to win the competition
with Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is an important strategic customer of Boeing,'' said
Jim Schlueter, spokesman for Boeing's international fighter sales.
</P>
<P>
   He confirmed that Boeing, in its latest proposal to Israel, had
offered to provide an additional $500 million in so-called offset
work. Boeing already provides companies in Israel with about $1.7
billion in contract work.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's air force reportedly recommended earlier this month
that the government award the $2.5 billion fighter-plane contract
to Lockheed Martin.
</P>
<P>
   At about $60 million to $80 million apiece, the more advanced
F-15 from Boeing cost twice as much as Lockheed's F-16. That means
Israel could get more more F-16s for its money.
</P>
<P>
   There is still a possibility Israel will split the order between
Boeing and Lockheed Martin, according to defense experts.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Moshe Arens was expected to announce the winner
of the competition a couple weeks ago. Instead, Boeing and Lockheed
Martin were asked to sweeten their respective bids.
</P>
<P>
   The deal has been complicated by the recent election of the
Labor Party's Ehud Barak to the prime minister's post. Arens, of
the Likud Party, has not indicated if he will make a decision on
the fighter plane order before he leaves office when Barak takes
over as prime minister next month.

UNIVERSAL STUDIOS HOLLYWOOD ADDS NICKELODEON ATTRACTIONS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Universal Studios Hollywood will unveil a series
of new attractions and events this summer that will allow young
Nickelodeon fans to participate in a live ``Blue's Clues'' game and
eat pancakes with Woody Woodpecker.
</P>
<P>
   The amusement park's Kids Fun Fest could propel its name to the
top of the ``to do'' list of every under-4-foot kid in Southern
California. That's because in addition to its stable of Universal
and Marvel cartoon characters, the park has the added attraction of
Nickelodeon's top cable television characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really wanted to get more families up here,'' said Pat
Moloney, director of entertainment for Universal Studios Hollywood,
``and make this a special thing for kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, amusement parks have always wanted to attract kids
and their money-spending parents. But in previous years, parks did
that by building the biggest, scariest ride.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, Southern California's amusement parks are turning
their attention to the under-4-foot crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Preteens are ``certainly a large segment of the marketplace,''
Moloney said. ``I think we accommodate them pretty well already,
but this extends the options.''
</P>
<P>
   The new attractions, which open July 2, are led by ``Blue's
Clues Live,'' an auditorium version of the popular Nickelodeon TV
show. Kids will be able to solve puzzles, play games and sing songs
along with Blue and her friends.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's character breakfasts will offer the youngest guests
a chance to meet some of the most popular Nickelodeon, Universal
and Marvel characters before heading into the park.
</P>
<P>
   Other new attractions include Woody Woodpecker's Clubhouse and
an updated Chipmunks Show.
</P>
<P>
   Tying the whole package together for Universal's pint-sized
guests will be a treasure hunt. Kids will receive a special map
when they enter the park that highlights the kid-friendly
attractions.
</P>
<P>
   As they wander from attraction to attraction, they'll receive
stamps, like a tourist having her passport stamped as she enters
each country. Kids who collect the entire set of stamps will get a
prize.

MILOSEVIC INDICTMENT COLORS TALKS WITH RUSSIAN ENVOY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rm) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ A day after President Slobodan Milosevic
of Yugoslavia was indicted on war crime charges, a search for a
negotiated solution to the conflict in Kosovo proceeded Friday,
clouded by uncertainty and recriminations but with the Russian
envoy voicing modest expressions of hope.
</P>
<P>
   After nine hours of talks with Milosevic about a Kosovo
settlement, the Russian special envoy, Viktor Chernomyrdin,
pronounced himself ``very pleased,'' but added, ``We face the most
difficult negotiations in the next few days.''
</P>
<P>
   The sticking points remain the shape of any international force
to police a settlement, the command of such a force and the size of
the Yugoslav army and police contingents allowed to remain in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The talks Friday were important but not definitive. The
atmosphere was colored by the indictment of Milosevic and four top
aides by the international criminal tribunal at The Hague on
Thursday on charges of war crimes in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said he hoped to return to Belgrade next week with
Martti Ahtisaari, the president of Finland, after further talks
with Strobe Talbott, the deputy secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott took pains Friday in Brussels to say that
Chernomyrdin was not representing the United States or NATO.
</P>
<P>
   In an official statement issued Friday evening, the Yugoslav
government said that it accepted the principles for a settlement
issued by the Group of Eight main Western industrialized countries
and ``agrees that the U.N. Security Council should pass a
resolution based on those principles.''
</P>
<P>
   The government also said that ``the return of all the refugees
to their homes should be insured as soon as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   But Belgrade has accepted the principles before, and everyone
acknowledges that putting them into a substantive, detailed peace
settlement is the difficulty. Even the United States and Russia
still disagree over those details.
</P>
<P>
   The G8 principles, worked out in Bonn, Germany, on May 6, call
for a halt in the violence and oppression in Kosovo, the withdrawal
of Serbian forces from the province and the deployment of an
international security ``presence,'' now understood to be an armed
force under a U.N. flag with participants from at least some NATO
countries.
</P>
<P>
   The principles also call for the return of ethnic Albanian
refugees, the establishment of an interim administration before new
elections and the opening of Serb-Kosovar talks on the province's
future.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin flew Friday to a Belgrade without electric power
after renewed NATO attacks on the nation's grid in what NATO
officials said proudly was their heaviest day of bombing yet, with
792 sorties, a record in the air war that began March 24.
</P>
<P>
   He arrived in a sour mood, in part a function of what Russian
officials described as a very difficult set of negotiations over
two days with Talbott.
</P>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin said he was ``unsatisfied that all of our
negotiations have failed to achieve results'' and said: ``If they
continue in this vein, then their continuation would be
senseless.'' But he noted that the talks were currently the only
hope of a peaceful resolution and called again for a halt to NATO's
bombing as an important prerequisite for negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving Moscow, he told reporters about the indictment:
``We knew, we warned, we asked, `Don't do this, because it will
simply complicate the process.' But we are flying to Belgrade. We
deal with the lawfully elected president of Yugoslavia and will go
on dealing with him.''
</P>
<P>
   But Talbott, briefing NATO ambassadors in Brussels, Belgium, on
Friday, emphasized that Chernomyrdin is representing only the
Russian government in talks with Milosevic and not NATO or the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Talbott also criticized Chernomyrdin for an Op-ed piece in The
Washington Post in which the Russian complained about NATO policy,
called the Kosovo issue a ``domestic conflict'' and said Russia
would cease its efforts unless the bombing stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Chernomyrdin is not negotiating for NATO or the United
States,'' Talbott said. ``He will also refer to what he understands
to be the position of the U.S. government.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO's position is to be represented by Ahtisaari of Finland,
which is not a member of NATO. But Ahtisaari, long expected in
Belgrade, once again did not come with Chernomyrdin. The reason,
Chernomyrdin said, was the indictment of Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   But Yugoslav officials said it may be that Ahtisaari _ or NATO _
also wants to wait for the Russian and NATO position to move closer
before he speaks to Milosevic.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Chernomyrdin is bringing further ideas on the makeup of an
international force under U.N. auspices to police a Kosovo
settlement. The Russians are said to be willing to supply up to
10,000 soldiers, and to be exploring the idea of German troops as
the center of a NATO contingent. Belgrade would prefer NATO troops
from countries, like Germany, Italy, Greece and Spain, which are
not associated in the public's mind with the bombing of Yugoslavia,
as the United States and Britain are.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a dispute over who should command such a force,
with Russia wanting a neutral nation, and over how many Yugoslav
troops and Serb police should be allowed to remain in Kosovo, even
as a symbol of sovereignty. The Russians believe, as Belgrade does,
that if all Serb forces pull out, the vacuum will immediately be
filled by the Kosovo Liberation Army, which is supposed to be
disarmed in any settlement.
</P>
<P>
   While NATO says it wants a strong force with NATO at its core to
protect ethnic Albanians from Serbs and to prevent a reinfiltration
of Serb forces, Yugoslav and even some NATO officials believe that
the biggest threat to the international force will be the KLA and
are skeptical that NATO will disarm the insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians have complained bitterly, as have the Chinese, the
Yugoslav democratic opposition and even Western officials, about
the timing of the indictment. The Russian Foreign Ministry called
the indictment political, China questioned its validity and
Chernomyrdin said it greatly complicated his task.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is to have the bombing halted so that
political negotiations can continue,'' the state-run Tanjug news
agency quoted Chernomyrdin as saying.
</P>
<P>
   ``Concrete results were supposed to come with me,'' he said at
the airport on arrival here. ``But due to yesterday's situation
with the tribunal there was a change.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   On the night of March 24, as NATO bombs began falling over
Yugoslavia, Hani Hoxha said he saw black-masked Serbs swaggering
through Djakovica, shooting, cutting throats and burning houses.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30 in the morning, about nine miles east, a tank pulled up
and parked in front of Isuf Zhenigi's farmhouse in the village of
Bela Crkva. At daybreak the slaughter began there.
</P>
<P>
   That day, in Pec, 22 miles to the northwest, and Prizren, 15
miles to the southeast, Serbian forces began firing wildly and
burning Albanian-owned shops.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in Pristina, about 44 miles to the northeast, Serbian
operatives set fire to Albanian-owned cafes, clinics and the
printing presses of Kosova Sot, an independent Albanian newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   As it began, the Serbs' purge of more than 1 million ethnic
Albanians from Kosovo seemed to be a random kaleidoscope of
violence. But a reconstruction of the early days of the operation _
based on interviews with scores of refugees, and with senior
officials in Washington and NATO, as well as on a computer analysis
of reported horrors from many sources _ shows that it was
meticulously organized and aimed, from the outset, at expelling
huge numbers of people.
</P>
<P>
   From this reporting over the last nine weeks, it is possible to
see the design behind the atrocities cited by the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in The Hague, Netherlands, in its indictment on Thursday
of President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia and four of his top
officials for crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   With specific charges including the wave of killings in
Djakovica and its surrounding villages and the forced expulsion of
Albanians from Pristina, the indictment accuses the Serbian forces
of a ``campaign of terror'' that ``intentionally created an
atmosphere of fear and oppression through the use of force, threats
of force and acts of violence'' in order to drive out Kosovo's
majority Albanian population.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have insisted that most of the refugees fled Kosovo
because of NATO's bombing. Western officials, however, say the
plans were drawn up by the Yugoslav army and the Interior Ministry
of the Serbian Republic and carried out, under a single command, by
a variety of Serbian forces acting in concert.
</P>
<P>
   The plan was a harsh refinement of a campaign last summer by
Interior Ministry forces that failed to crush Albanian rebels. It
was put into effect after a mounting campaign of terrorism on both
sides, including the ambushing of Serbian police patrols and
officials by the Albanians and several instances of the kidnapping
and killing of Serbian civilians.
</P>
<P>
   It seems evident that the operation had at least two major
goals: crushing the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army and permanently
changing the ethnic balance of Kosovo by driving out as many
Albanians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   Hounding more than a million Albanians from their homes
accomplished two purposes for the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   First, it removed the guerrillas' base of support and cover.
</P>
<P>
   And in the longer run, depopulating Kosovo defused a demographic
time bomb for the Serbs: Albanians already made up 90 percent of
the population and were reproducing at a far higher rate than the
Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Although killing and torching were extensive, the Serbs' most
potent weapon was fear. The seemingly random, flamboyantly public
killings of the first few days meant that as the campaign
progressed, all it took was a handful of armed, masked Serbs to
drive thousands of people from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Independent accounts indicate that there have been killings of
from a dozen to roughly 100 people in more than 40 places. The
State Department now puts the death toll at 4,600, but that
statistic indicates a goal of depopulation rather than
extermination. It is low by comparison with the ethnic cleansing of
Bosnia, where in one massacre alone, at Srebrenica, the Serbs were
accused of killing 7,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   By early May, 90 percent of all ethnic Albanians in Kosovo had
been expelled from their homes, the State Department says, 900,000
driven across the province's borders and 500,000 more displaced
inside Kosovo. More than 500 villages have been emptied and burned,
according to the State Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs began attacking Kosovo Liberation Army strongholds on
March 19, but their attack kicked into high gear on March 24, the
night NATO began bombing Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Djakovica, a city of 60,000 in the shadow of the Accursed
Mountains between Albania and Kosovo, was one of the first major
targets.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo Liberation Army maintains its camps and staging areas
on the Albanian side of the mountains. Clearly, a Westerm military
officer said, the Serbs want to empty the area of ethnic Albanians,
fortify and control it to block the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors say they will never forget the focused fury of the
hundreds of Serbian forces who attacked Djakovica.
</P>
<P>
   As in many places, the Serbs were guided to the most affluent
and influential families. It is not known whether this was on
instruction, or perhaps motivated by the greed, or grudges, of
individual attackers, but one effect may be to damage Albanian
prospects for rebuilding their communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were selected homes burned in the beginning, after that
it was all the buildings,'' Dr. Flori Bakalli said, speaking in
English. ``There were special police, local police, paramilitaries,
and some of them civilians, armed. They were burning the houses and
they started to scream like a wolf _ `woo, woo' _ and they shot
people in the back.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoxha, a dignified white-haired man, told of his family's futile
attempts to elude the Serbian attackers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We moved from one house to another and finally to my older
daughter Tringa's house,'' he said. ``That night I saw an old man,
about 80, killed and burned and a 15-year old boy as well. We
stayed there for four nights, and the fifth night the Serbs came.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was around 12 o'clock, and we didn't have any electricity,
when they came, about 30 people, paramilitary, V.J. and Serbs from
Djakovica who had been given uniforms and guns,'' Hoxha said, using
the initials by which the Yugoslav army is known.
</P>
<P>
   Thinking that the Serbs were looking only for men of military
age, Hoxha and two other men climbed out a second-story window,
dropped onto a wall and escaped.
</P>
<P>
   He spent the next seven hours hiding in the narrow space between
two buildings, listening to shouts and screams and gunshots.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning he came back and found the bodies of everyone who
had been left behind, some of the bodies burned. Later he said he
had learned that the Serbs had first shot his 15-year-old daughter,
Flaka, in front of her mother, then the older daughter, Tringa. His
wife pleaded with them not to kill the children, but then they
killed her. One of his granddaughters, Shihana, a spunky girl of 6,
ran away and tried to hide in a closet, but they killed her there
and set fire to the closet.
</P>
<P>
   As Djakovica suffered, other Serbs were at work nearby purging a
wide area they regarded as a Kosovo Liberation Army highway.
</P>
<P>
   In another of the region's villages, Bela Crkva (Bellacrkva in
Albanian), on March 25, soldiers and special policemen torched the
homes and farm buildings and killed at least 62 people, most of
them gunned down with automatic weapons in a stream bend.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of a series of mass killings over the next few days
along a seven-mile stretch of villages in the rolling hills.
</P>
<P>
   On March 26, the third day of the NATO bombing, one of the most
well-documented of the mass killings, including an amateur
videotape of the bodies, took place in Krush e Mahde. Serbian
forces stormed through the village shooting down people, burning
some bodies, digging a mass grave with a backhoe for others and
leaving some lying in piles on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The violent emptying of the Djakovica region had a specific
military purpose: cutting off the Kosovo Liberation Army supply
lines.
</P>
<P>
   But in a long stretch of villages, towns and cities across
Kosovo _ places either close to the border or on main
transportation routes _ there were similar outbursts of killing and
burning with another aim: driving out the majority Albanian
population.
</P>
<P>
   The border areas with Albania, Macedonia and Montenegro were
cleared first, often by wild bursts of killings that served as an
example. This cleared transportation routes that facilitated the
hounding out of people from other villages.
</P>
<P>
   Forcing the refugees over the borders, NATO intelligence experts
believe, served another purpose: overwhelming NATO troops stationed
in Macedonia with an unmanageable relief crisis, calculating that
the crisis would consume the alliance's energies and divert it from
preparing a military campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first use of a weapon like this in modern
warfare,'' a NATO intelligence officer said. ``It was like sending
the cattle against the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, it was a tightly ordered, coordinated campaign,
from the artillery that shelled villages, to the masked gunmen who
killed, looted and spread terror, to the armored cars and lines of
troops who chased people hiding in the woods to corral them in
larger central towns for eventual expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the wild-appearing masked irregulars _ Arkan's Tigers, the
White Eagles and others _ were under tight control, NATO experts
said, and reported to the intelligence arm of the Yugoslav Interior
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were in there with Belgrade's blessing,'' a NATO
intelligence official said.
</P>
<P>
   Some people were clearly targeted, particularly men age 15 to
50, suspected or potential rebel fighters, and those who worked for
or rented space to the observer teams from the Office of
Cooperation and Security in Europe. There were reports by human
rights groups that doctors had been singled out.
</P>
<P>
   By the time, three weeks into the campaign, that the Serbs came
to drive the ethnic Albanians out of the north-central city of
Mitrovica, said Jacques Franquin, a U.N. official, it was enough
for them to gun down an old woman and a teen-age girl in one
neighborhood for everyone around to quietly board buses and be
directed out of town through traffic control points.
</P>
<P>
   In Pristina, the knock on Bajrum Kelmendi's door came at 1 a.m.
on the night NATO started bombing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will kill you if you do not open in five seconds,'' the
Serbian police shouted, Kelmendi's wife, Nedima, recalled. Five
uniformed policemen burst in, forced the family to lie on the floor
and demanded money, one warning, ``If you are lying, I will kill
the little children.''
</P>
<P>
   They took away Kelmendi, a well-known human rights lawyer, and
his two sons, age 30 and 16. They told the elder son, Kastriut,
``Kiss your wife and two children because this will be the last
time you see them,'' the elder Mrs. Kelmendi said.
</P>
<P>
   The family found the three bodies by the side of the road two
days later.
</P>
<P>
   In the Djakovica region, the Serbs had a clear military goal: to
cut off the Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
   But Pristina, like the other cities the Serbs emptied, was not a
rebel stronghold. In Pristina, the Serbian aim appears to have been
depopulation.
</P>
<P>
   And from some of the targets chosen, like Kelmendi, it also
seems clear that the Serbs set out to destroy the Albanian
political class and its institutions.
</P>
<P>
   The office of the nonviolent leader Ibrahim Rugova's Democratic
League of Kosovo was burned down, and a guard was shot and killed
by the police at the newspaper Koha Ditore, whose publisher, Veton
Surroi, had been a delegate at the talks in Rambouillet, France,
early this year. The warehouse of the largest Kosovar charity, the
Mother Teresa Society, was burned. The house of Rexhep Qosja, a
prominent academic, head of the Albanian Democratic Movement and
another member of the Rambouillet delegation, was torched.
</P>
<P>
   On March 30, in a chilling display of force, the Serbs began
systematically emptying Pristina's neighborhoods, marching the
Albanians along streets lined with gantlets of masked gunmen draped
with weaponry, refugees said.
</P>
<P>
   By the tens of thousands _ in an operation that required
extensive advance logistical preparations _ they were herded into
the city's railroad station overnight. At dawn some were packed
aboard trains bound for Macedonia. Others were loaded on buses and
even a refrigerator truck and dumped near the Albanian border.
</P>
<P>
   Some ethnic Albanians tried to stay in Pristina, living a
cat-and-mouse existence after eluding the first wave of Serbian
looting and expulsions.
</P>
<P>
   Luljeta Jarina, 19, and her father, Ramiz, were among those who
went into hiding. Once when she ventured into the garden behind her
home, a Serbian sniper shot at her, she recalled. And each night,
Serbian soldiers and policemen cruised the streets of the city,
firing their Kalashnikovs wildly into the air. Just this Wednesday,
the Serbs rounded up 18 men, including her father, at gunpoint. All
but her father and two others were taken away to an unknown fate,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We waited two months, hoping something would happen,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, they found a Serb cruising the city in a bus _ an
entrepreneur driving refugees to the border for 20 to 100 German
marks apiece, about $10 to $55 _ and fled their native land.

PLEA DEAL APPROVED FOR KIDNAPPER OF TWO DAUGHTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass., Fla., Va.)  (lb) 
 By CAREY GOLDBERG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Stephen Fagan, the Massachusetts father who
absconded with his two daughters nearly 20 years ago and raised
them in Palm Beach-style prosperity until he was caught last year,
clinched a plea deal on Friday that lets him off with no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, a Massachusetts Superior Court justice
approved the bargain: Fagan pleaded guilty to kidnapping and must
serve 2,000 hours of community service in a Florida hospital and
donate $100,000 to the New England Home for Little Wanderers, which
helps at-risk children, in his ex-wife's name. He also received a
suspended three-to-five-year sentence and five years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fagan's guilty plea, to which his ex-wife agreed, he
exhibited no regret: ``I believed at the time it was the right
decision,'' he told reporters outside the courthouse, referring to
his 1979 decision to steal his daughters, then 5 and 2, from an
ex-wife he described as dangerously neglectful. ``I still believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone hoping for the ultimate satisfying conclusion to the
Fagans' tale _ a moving reunion between the two daughters, now 25
and 22, and the mother they had long been told was dead _ would
have been deeply disappointed by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Barbara Kurth, now an immunologist at the University
of Virginia Medical School, did not see her daughters sitting far
across the large hall when she entered the courtroom, and appeared
never to make eye contact with them. She left immediately after the
judge's decision, and her relatives said that the daughters have
yet to respond to her overtures toward a reconnection.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, kept up the
solid wall of loving support for their father that they have
maintained since he was arrested and the case gained national
attention last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to thank our father for the many sacrifices he has
made on our behalf,'' they said in a statement to the court. ``For
the past two decades, he has forgone his identity, his profession,
and the comfort of family and friends for our well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, the daughters refused to discuss any plan
to reconcile with their mother, and said they had been thinking
only of their father. Asked whether they were condoning kidnapping,
Rachael Martin said: ``We're not here to judge the law or the
people who apply it. We're simply here to say we support our father
and love him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurth and her relatives described the daughters' reaction as
typical for kidnapped children who bond tightly with the abductor
who becomes their only anchor in the world. And though prosecutors
said that Dr. Kurth had agreed to the plea bargain, there was no
joy in the Kurth camp on Friday, in contrast to the celebratory
dinner-cum-photo-op that Fagan held with his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only victory here would have been for my daughters to have
known and loved me for the past 20 years,'' Dr. Kurth said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the case offered no easy out to either side. A lengthy,
media-ridden trial could have harmed the daughters, prosecutors
said; and yet Fagan was accused of serious crimes: two counts of
kidnapping and one of contempt of court, potentially enough to net
him more than 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he claimed that he had feared for the girls'
safety with his wife, and his lawyer accused her of getting into an
accident with them while driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no perfect sentences that can be imposed,'' Judge
Peter Lauriat said in a statement. At best, he said, the sentence
``may allow the Fagans' two daughters to move forward with their
lives and begin to reconnect, free of the burden of participating
in a highly charged and surely an emotionally draining criminal
trial that would have no doubt been surrounded and enveloped by the
ever-present media.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No doubt. The Fagan case splashed repeatedly across national
television shows last spring, a real-life drama with several strong
elements: the amazing amount of time Fagan managed to live under an
assumed name and various false guises in Florida; the fact that he
was ultimately caught; the unswerving loyalty of his daughters and
the long nightmare of his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurth did not speak on Friday, but in an article due to
appear in the July issue of Good Housekeeping magazine, she says:
``A lot of people have asked me how I feel. It's a question that
absolutely stumps me, because I feel many, many ways. If you felt
it, what I feel, this house would be in a shambles from the force
of it. It is so beyond `saddened' or any other word.''

TURKISH PREMIER ASSEMBLES RULING COALITION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, who has headed
a caretaker government since elections last month, said Friday that
he had assembled a three-party coalition to govern Turkey for the
next five years.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition is based on an alliance between two parties that
have traditionally been bitter rivals. Their street battles in the
1970s cost more than 5,000 lives and led to such chaos that many
Turks welcomed the military coup of 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit heads the Democratic Left Party, and his new partner in
power, Devlet Bahceli, heads the Nationalist Movement Party, which
for years embraced far-right politics and violence. It says it has
matured and embraced democratic principles.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their differences, both Ecevit and Bahceli are strong
Turkish nationalists. Both oppose any compromise with Kurdish
rebels, or with Greece over issues relating to Cyprus or the
Aegean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beseech God to put this government at the service of the
Turkish nation,'' Bahceli said at a news conference at which the
coalition agreement was announced.
</P>
<P>
   The junior partner in the new coalition is to be the
center-right Motherland Party, which is headed by former Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz. It will control the Finance Ministry, a
signal to financial markets and foreign lending institutions that
have confidence in Yilmaz.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats were encouraged to learn that Foreign Minister
Ismail Cem, whose diplomatic skills and pro-Western orientation are
widely respected, will remain in office. The coalition is subject
to a parliamentary vote expected next week, but since the three
parties composing it hold 351 of the 550 seats, the vote is
expected to be a formality.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether the two principal coalition
leaders, Ecevit and Bahceli, will be able to put aside the hatred
that separated their parties in the past. This month Ecevit's wife,
Rahsan, voiced the doubts that many members of her party have about
their new coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past they put pressure on adolescents and armed them,''
Mrs. Ecevit said. ``They told them, `Either you will be on our side
or you will die.' They sponsored gangs that took so many lives over
the years. Is it easy to forget that pain?''
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has been troubled by political instability, with five
governments in the last four years. Some politicians predicted that
the new coalition would not survive for its full term. ``I doubt
that this government will last two years, much less five,'' said
Recai Kutan, leader of the Islamic-oriented Virtue party.
``governments formed on the basis of contradictions do not survive
long.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ecevit, a poet and Sanskrit scholar who turned 74 on Friday, has
been a figure in Turkish politics for more than 40 years. He is
best known for ordering Turkish troops to land on the contested
island of Cyprus when he was prime minister in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   Although he shares the view of most Turkish leaders that Kurdish
fighters are no more than terrorists, Ecevit may play a crucial
role in the case of the imprisoned Kurdish guerrilla leader
Abdullah Ocalan.
</P>
<P>
   Ocalan's trial for treason is to begin on Monday. His conviction
is widely considered a foregone conclusion, and he will probably be
sentenced to hang. But Parliament must approve all death sentences,
and Ecevit, a lifelong foe of the death penalty, has said he will
do whatever he can to prevent an execution.
</P>
<P>
   In another indication that he is concerned about foreign
reaction to the Ocalan trial, Ecevit urged this week that the trial
be postponed until the military member of the three-judge security
court is replaced by a civilian. The European Court of Human Rights
has called Turkey's security courts illegitimate because of the
military judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ocalan's trial may be postponed by a reform of the security
courts,'' Ecevit said in a newspaper interview published on
Thursday. ``We are considering a constitutional amendment to
replace the military judge with a civilian one. This amendment will
be the first proposal the new government will present to
Parliament. All the other parties have pledged to support us.''

<P>
   Cities and states everywhere long to be the next Silicon
Someplace. Many have used tax money to set up business incubators
and promote their attractions to entrepreneurs; some even throw
subsidies and tax relief at technology companies to lure them to
set up shop, create jobs and join the local tax rolls.
</P>
<P>
   But as a piece of civic boosterism, the Prospect Street NYC
Discovery fund is a strange animal.
</P>
<P>
   It was created in 1995 by the city of New York to invest in
fledgling technology companies, using tax money and contributions
from several of the city's utilities. At the time, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani said the city expected the fund's activities to generate
4,000 new local jobs, foster a hot new business sector and maybe
even earn a decent return on the investment.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the fund's returns have indeed been decent,
though far from stellar. But the fund has sometimes strayed from
its other goals. Few new jobs have been created directly, and
several of the fund's investments have been in companies with a
tenuous connection to high technology and none at all to the city.
</P>
<P>
   Among the major beneficiaries of the fund's activities have been
the people who run it. Executives at Prospect Street Ventures, the
New York-based venture capital firm paid by the city to operate the
fund, have also been compensated in cash and stock option grants by
companies in which the fund has invested, for serving on their
boards of directors.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's initial capital of $30 million in equity _ $10
million of it from city coffers _ and $26 million in Small Business
Administration loans has since grown to $76 million, with $48.3
million invested in 11 companies and the rest in liquid investments
awaiting deployment.
</P>
<P>
   Prospect Street executives now sit on the boards of nine of
those companies, positioning them to reap windfalls if the
companies prove successful.
</P>
<P>
   It is common for major early investors in a start-up company to
get seats on the board, so they can keep a close watch on their
investments and help the company grow. Prospect Street, which also
invests for private-sector funds, routinely asks for such
representation when the Discovery fund invests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a hard-and-fast rule,'' said Stephen G. Hall, a
principal at Prospect Street. ``But getting a board seat is
typically a prerequisite.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Discovery fund's case, it is public money that the
managers are investing and risking, while they personally reap the
rewards of the board seats. ``We're aware of this arrangement,''
said Bernadette O'Leary, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic
Development Corp., which oversees the fund. ``It's very standard
for the industry and it's in keeping with our agreement.''
</P>
<P>
   John F. Barry, the managing partner of Prospect Street, is
himself on the boards of eight companies that have received money
from the Discovery fund, including two that reported the
compensation of their directors to the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Those documents show that Barry has personally received cash,
stock and stock options for his services _ for example, 18,750
shares of 24/7 Media, a New York-based Internet advertising company
whose stock has risen sharply since its initial public offering in
1998 and closed on Friday at $28.50.
</P>
<P>
   Hall said the compensation is justified because ``there needs to
be appropriate incentives to take on that liability'' of being a
director, and added that Barry holds such stock and options on
behalf of his firm, Prospect Street Ventures.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the executives work for the money. A new Internet
company can consist merely of a couple of sharp programmers with a
bright idea but no management experience. Experienced directors
like the Prospect Street executives often help shape business plans
and recruit crucial employees. (Prospect Street highlights on its
Web site the hands-on role of its executives in companies in which
it invests.)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That kind of work has helped the fund post a cumulative return
of 108 percent over four years _ not bad, though many
technology-stock mutual funds have gained far more during the same
period.
</P>
<P>
   City officials say the fund's activities have helped accelerate
the creation of Silicon Alley, a district in Manhattan extending
roughly from the Flatiron Building to the financial district where
Internet companies congregate. They say they are pleased with the
results, though they acknowledge that Silicon Alley grew mostly on
its own.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as if somebody in city hall said, `Hey, I know, let's
get a bunch of kids in their 20s with shoulder-length ponytails,
give them computers and see what happens,'' said Charles Millard,
the director of the city development agency, who is resigning to
become a managing director at Prudential Securities. ``They simply
try to help the market that has occurred on its own function more
powerfully.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's managers estimate that its investments have created
600 jobs so far.
</P>
<P>
   Prospect Street was selected from among four bidders to manage
the fund. Its mission was to find suitable New York City technology
companies for $1 million to $6 million investments. Almost
immediately, records of the fund's investments indicate, Prospect
Street began to stray from the target.
</P>
<P>
   Some $3 million went into Bondnet Trading Systems, a Connecticut
operator of an Internet securities trading service. Barry was named
chairman and chief executive of Bondnet, and Hall was named to the
board. Investing in a Connecticut technology company was
appropriate, Hall said, because most of its business was done in
New York. The company's assets were bought by the Bank of New York
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The fund also invested in All Service Computer Rental, an
Englewood, N.J., company that seems to fit none of the fund's
stated purposes: It is not in New York, has no direct ties to
Internet commerce and, having been in business since 1985, is not a
fledgling. ``The most important goal of the fund is to receive a
return,'' Hall said. ``It's our most profitable company.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund's very first investment was also of questionable
relevance, and has performed terribly. In July 1995, when the fund
was less than two months old, Prospect Street bought 1.09 million
shares of Skyline Multimedia Entertainment, which operates a
virtual-reality ride at the Empire State Building and an arcade
near Times Square, at $2.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Barry joined Skyline's board and by November 1996 had been
personally granted options to buy 10,000 shares of Skyline stock at
$3.50 to $5 a share.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, the company began work on a new virtual-reality
ride in Sydney, Australia, and sank nearly $1 million into film
footage for it; the project collapsed when a lease fell through.
Around the same time, the company made substantial loans to one of
its executives.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Discovery fund pumped in capital, $500,000 more in
1997 and a further $435,000 in 1998, while the stock was losing
nearly all its value; on Friday, it traded for 6.25 cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very common for a venture capital firm to continue
investing in a company that we think has potential,'' Hall said.
``We have some investments that are all-stars and some that are
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, the fund has also found successful Internet
companies in which to invest, including Multex, Miningco.com (since
renamed About.com) and 24/7 Media. Dean Margolis, chief executive
of Comet Systems, which has grown to employ 40 people in New York,
said Prospect Street chipped in $2.4 million of the company's $2.5
million in start-up capital.
</P>
<P>
   But of the 14 Manhattan technology companies that planned public
offerings in the second quarter of 1999, only one, Juno Online
Services, has received money from the Discovery fund. Juno went
public last Wednesday at $13 a share and closed on Friday at
$12.25.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really in the business of looking into the future,''
Barry said. ``Unfortunately, no one has given us a crystal ball.''

RUSSIA'S FINANCE MINISTER QUITS, AFTER 3 DAYS ON THE JOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's finance minister, who was recently elevated to
the post of first deputy prime minister for financial matters, quit
Friday night after only three days in his new job, the apparent
casualty of an extraordinary struggle between advisers seeking the
blessing of President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
   The resignation of Mikhail Zadornov was a clear blow to Russia's
new prime minister, Sergei Stepashin, who has staked much of his
reputation on his power to choose the top officials of his
two-week-old government.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov, an economist, had been elevated by Stepashin from
finance minister to first deputy, a post in which he was to oversee
macroeconomic issues and Russia's dealings with international
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In a television interview Friday night, Zadornov said he had
quit because Yeltsin had refused to combine his new job with his
old duties as finance minister. Stepashin seemed to confirm that
arrangement earlier this week, only to see Yeltsin reverse it and
appoint a new finance minister, Mikhail Kasyanov, Friday. ``To keep
doing our task, we need to have a single-minded bloc,'' Zadornov
said. ``My proposal on this didn't get support from the Kremlin.''
</P>
<P>
   But an underlying explanation widely accepted by political
experts here, though with no direct proof, is that Zadornov was
shoved out of the government by supporters of Boris Berezovsky, the
supposed multibillionaire businessman and political tactician.
</P>
<P>
   Berezovsky is said to be very close to Yeltsin's daughter and
senior adviser, Tatyana Dyachenko. Under indictment and written off
as a political has-been just a month ago, Berezovsky seems to have
staged a comeback and is now fighting for control of key posts in
Yeltsin's government.
</P>
<P>
   In that view, the losers Friday were the supporters of another
Yeltsin adviser who is bitterly opposed to Berezovsky, Anatoly
Chubais.
</P>
<P>
   Chubais, one of the original planners of Russia's transition to
capitalism, resigned from the government following last year's
economic collapse. But he has remained close to Yeltsin and, like
Berezovsky, has been battling to retake a share of his lost power.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov, 36, was an original member of Chubais' economic team
and enjoyed his backing as finance minister. Interfax, the Russian
news agency, suggested Friday night that the apparent new finance
minister, Kasyanov, has the support of Berezovsky.
</P>
<P>
   Were that to prove true, it would leave Stepashin in nominal
control of the government, but would place much of the real power _
control over most government finances _ in the hands of
Berezovsky's allies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The finance minister's post is among the most important in the
government because of Russia's delicate relations with western
lenders. Kasyanov is not inexperienced in fiscal affairs. He has
managed Russia's place in the London Club, the group of nations
that is owed debt by commercial entities of the former Soviet
Union.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he clearly was not Zadornov's choice as a successor.
Speaking on the NTV television network Friday night, Zadornov said
Kasyanov's duties are but a small part of the Finance Ministry's
portfolio, and that the critical job _ negotiating with the Russian
legislature and the International Monetary Fund on measures to
shore up Russia's shaky finances _ is ``not his field.''
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has frozen a recent decision to begin doling out a $4.45
billion loan to the Russian government until the political
situation becomes clearer. Zadornov said talks with leaders at the
fund on a new lending package are close to completion, and that it
will be discussed at a meeting of top government officials that
Stepashin has called for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov said he still plans to attend that session, and he
expressed concern that talks with international lenders will be
delayed by the latest change. ``We've been coming out of a very
difficult six months,'' he said. ``We're ready for the last step.
It's not all as difficult as the press has indicated it might be.
But it's a very important step for the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The larger question may be what happens now to Stepashin, who
also enjoys Chubais' backing. Another Berezovsky ally, Nikolai
Aksyonenko, is nominally first deputy prime minister for industrial
policy, but he has repeatedly insisted that his job includes the
government's entire fiscal portfolio, including the broad
macroeconomic duties that Zadornov has now given up.
</P>
<P>
   One leading American analyst of Russian politics, Thomas Graham
of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Friday
night that Berezovsky's hand was clearly reflected in Zadornov's
resignation. ``It's very much a struggle over who is going to be
the presidential candidate in the year 2000,'' he said, referring
to the candidate who will enjoy the government's backing. ``And
neither Berezovsky nor Chubais has a horse in this race.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, until recently an American diplomat in Moscow, said the
question may be whether Stepashin remains prime minister or whether
Aksyonenko eventually replaces him.
</P>
<P>
   Neither is well known, and neither has any proven campaign
skills. But merely being prime minister confers an advantage on any
candidate, because of the enhanced visibility in Russia and the
resources of the government are at his disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Stepashin already has been suggested as a potential candidate
backed by the Yeltsin team. But Yeltsin stirred much speculation
earlier this month when, in conversations with two legislators, he
said that Aksyonenko _ not Stepashin _ was his first choice as
prime minister. He later changed his mind and asked the parliament
to confirm Stepashin in the post.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday night, Russian legislators were writing Stepashin off
within minutes of Zadornov's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Grigory Yavlinsky, the head of the liberal Yabloko Party and a
likely presidential candidate himself, said Zadornov's departure
``indicates that Sergei Stepashin is not independent in forming the
government and that puppeteers continue to lead the government
personnel selection process.''
</P>
<P>
   The communist speaker of parliament's lower house, Gennadi
Zyuganov, told Interfax that the resignation means that
``everything depends on the sentiments of somebody hard to
identify, most likely on the sentiments of the presidential or
next-to-presidential team.
</P>
<P>
   ``When two bears mess about in the same pit, we get such a
result,'' he said.

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Stephen Fagan, the Massachusetts father who
absconded with his two daughters nearly 20 years ago and raised
them in Palm Beach-style prosperity until he was caught last year,
clinched a plea deal on Friday that lets him off with no jail time.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday afternoon, a Massachusetts Superior Court justice
approved the bargain: Fagan pleaded guilty to kidnapping and must
serve 2,000 hours of community service in a Florida hospital and
donate $100,000 to the New England Home for Little Wanderers, which
helps at-risk children, in his ex-wife's name. He also received a
suspended three-to-five-year sentence and five years of probation.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Fagan's guilty plea, to which his ex-wife agreed, he
exhibited no regret: ``I believed at the time it was the right
decision,'' he told reporters outside the courthouse, referring to
his 1979 decision to steal his daughters, then 5 and 2, from an
ex-wife he described as dangerously neglectful. ``I still believe
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Anyone hoping for the ultimate satisfying conclusion to the
Fagans' tale _ a moving reunion between the two daughters, now 25
and 22, and the mother they had long been told was dead _ would
have been deeply disappointed by day's end.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Barbara Kurth, now an immunologist at the University
of Virginia Medical School, did not see her daughters sitting far
across the large hall when she entered the courtroom, and appeared
never to make eye contact with them. She left immediately after the
judge's decision, and her relatives said that the daughters have
yet to respond to her overtures toward a reconnection.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, the daughters, Rachael and Lisa Martin, kept up the
solid wall of loving support for their father that they have
maintained since he was arrested and the case gained national
attention last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wish to thank our father for the many sacrifices he has
made on our behalf,'' they said in a statement to the court. ``For
the past two decades, he has forgone his identity, his profession,
and the comfort of family and friends for our well-being.''
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference, the daughters refused to discuss any plan
to reconcile with their mother, and said they had been thinking
only of their father. Asked whether they were condoning kidnapping,
Rachael Martin said: ``We're not here to judge the law or the
people who apply it. We're simply here to say we support our father
and love him very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurth and her relatives described the daughters' reaction as
typical for kidnapped children who bond tightly with the abductor
who becomes their only anchor in the world. And though prosecutors
said that Dr. Kurth had agreed to the plea bargain, there was no
joy in the Kurth camp on Friday, in contrast to the celebratory
dinner-cum-photo-op that Fagan held with his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only victory here would have been for my daughters to have
known and loved me for the past 20 years,'' Dr. Kurth said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the case offered no easy out to either side. A lengthy,
media-ridden trial could have harmed the daughters, prosecutors
said; and yet Fagan was accused of serious crimes: two counts of
kidnapping and one of contempt of court, potentially enough to net
him more than 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he claimed that he had feared for the girls'
safety with his wife, and his lawyer accused her of getting into an
accident with them while driving drunk.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no perfect sentences that can be imposed,'' Judge
Peter Lauriat said in a statement. At best, he said, the sentence
``may allow the Fagans' two daughters to move forward with their
lives and begin to reconnect, free of the burden of participating
in a highly charged and surely an emotionally draining criminal
trial that would have no doubt been surrounded and enveloped by the
ever-present media.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No doubt. The Fagan case splashed repeatedly across national
television shows last spring, a real-life drama with several strong
elements: the amazing amount of time Fagan managed to live under an
assumed name and various false guises in Florida; the fact that he
was ultimately caught; the unswerving loyalty of his daughters and
the long nightmare of his ex-wife.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Kurth did not speak on Friday, but in an article due to
appear in the July issue of Good Housekeeping magazine, she says:
``A lot of people have asked me how I feel. It's a question that
absolutely stumps me, because I feel many, many ways. If you felt
it, what I feel, this house would be in a shambles from the force
of it. It is so beyond `saddened' or any other word.''

SAN ANTONIO GUARD AVERY JOHNSON EARNS RESPECT IN SPURS' TITLE
DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ He was the guy nobody wanted. Even the team that
currently signs his checks gave up on him _ twice.
</P>
<P>
   In Avery Johnson's first seven NBA seasons, he played for five
organizations. That includes three separate stints with his current
employers, the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   A lesser man might have given up basketball and moved on to
another profession. But Johnson, a self-made basketball player,
doesn't question why his NBA journey was paved with so many broken
dreams now that he is the point man _ and even at 6-foot-2 a
pivotal player _ for the Spurs' NBA title run, which continues
today with Game 1 of the Western Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think those situations happened for a reason,'' said
Johnson, the Spurs' starting point guard and a devout Christian.
``I needed those situations to happen, mainly to make me a better
man rather than a better basketball player.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson has been a catalyst for a Spurs team that has advanced
to the Western Conference finals for the second time in the past
five years. His 15.1 points per game in the playoffs is second on
the team to Tim Duncan, and Johnson's steady outside shooting has
helped a Spurs attack that rides the inside play of Duncan and
David Robinson. He is also dishing out 7.5 assists per game and
committing just 2.7 turnovers per contest.
</P>
<P>
   Since signing with Seattle as a free-agent rookie in 1988,
Johnson has played for Denver, San Antonio, Houston, San Antonio,
Golden State and San Antonio again. Moving his wife and two
children across the country came with the territory, if Johnson
wanted to realize his dream.
</P>
<P>
   During Johnson's rookie season with Seattle, then-Mavericks
point guard Derek Harper who now plays for the Lakers, served as a
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the guy that used to come out on the court early before
the games and work out and tell me what I had to do to improve in
this league,'' Johnson said. ``I spent time with him off the court
when he was in Dallas, and throughout the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``So he's always been one of my role models with his toughness
and his professionalism. Guys like that who've been instrumental in
my success, I really want to make them proud of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Consider Harper proud, although he wasn't too thrilled that
Johnson and the Spurs eliminated the Lakers on Sunday to cap a
four-game sweep in the Western Conference semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. is one of those guys who's been forced to pay some
dues,'' Harper said. ``He went down and worked his way back up.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you get an opportunity to play, you find confidence in
yourself and you continue to grow, and I think that's all he's done
as a player. He's gotten an opportunity, and he's taken advantage
of it and proved that he belongs in the league.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson parlayed his patience into a three-year, $9 million
contract, which expires after next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role for this team is, number one, to get assists,''
Johnson said. ``If I can't get assists, then I need to break the
defense down. And when I'm wide open, make shots, and just be a
leader.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt I've always been a mentally tough player, but one
guy can't do it. I just try to fulfill my role with this team.''
</P>
<P>
   This season, his 11th, Johnson averaged 9.7 points and 7.4
assists. But he has stepped up in the playoffs, where both the
Minnesota Timberwolves and Lakers doubled down on the post and
baited Johnson to beat them with his quirky left-handed jump shot.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson promptly obliged, averaging a team-high 19.5 points and
6.3 assists and shooting 59.3 percent from the field in four games
against Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Harper has admired what his 34-year old protege has
accomplished.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to take your hat off to a guy like Avery, because he
worked his way up,'' Harper said. ``I think everyone in the league
not only likes him, but respects him, because he had to start from
scratch, and he's still here.
</P>
<P>
   ``People double off of him and make him beat them, yet Avery
finds a way to be successful on the court night in and night out.
He's very, very solid.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't try telling that to Portland point guard Damon Stoudamire,
who went against all NBA protocol by saying the Spurs will never
win an NBA title with Johnson as their starting playmaker. In the
final two San Antonio-Portland meetings during the regular season,
Johnson outscored Stoudamire, 42-20, and the Spurs won both games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he makes their team go,'' said Lakers guard Derek
Fisher, who played Johnson in the Western Conference semifinals.
``People have been asking about Tim Duncan and David Robinson, but
Avery is the key to their success.''

GORE DISCUSSES HIS RELIGIOUSNESS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER STEINFELS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forty-five minutes is really not much time to explore the
religious convictions of a man who wants to be the leader of the
world's most powerful nation _ and who is also as publicly reserved
as Vice President Al Gore. But the seven religion reporters who met
with Gore Friday at the White House did their best.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a follow-up to the vice president's proposal,
spelled out in a speech last Monday at a Salvation Army center in
Atlanta, for a ``new partnership'' between government and
``faith-based organizations'' that would give those groups more
opportunities to receive federal money for social programs.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore, like Republican advocates of the concept, insists on
safe-guarding the separation of church of state, his speech
contained some dramatic phrases, observations that stretched far
beyond his immediate policy proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``National leaders have been trapped in a dead-end debate'' on
church-state questions, Gore said, faced with a false choice
between ``hollow secularism or right-wing religion.'' He said he
regretted ``the allergy to faith that is such a curious factor in
much of modern society.'' And he pledged, ``If you elect me
president, the voices of faith-based organizations will be integral
to the policies set forth in my administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Friday's conversation at the White House touched on technical
and constitutional issues, but also stretched well into Gore's
personal faith as well as his views on religion and modernity.
</P>
<P>
   Gore acknowledged the enormous power of a modern science-based
civilization but added that it had stripped away an appreciation
for ``many of the most important meanings that are found only in
the whole.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no great blinding insight from moi,'' Gore said with a
laugh, but many other people ``have noticed this strong
intellectual strain that at times has difficulty in disguising
contempt for belief in God.'' He said it ``became a belief system
in itself with a kind of seeming arrogance toward alternative views
based on faith.''
</P>
<P>
   That view ``peaked some time ago,'' Gore said, although he noted
that the bias against religion still lingered.
</P>
<P>
   The journalists did not stop with this historical analysis, but
asked how Gore's Christian faith worked itself out in his daily
life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faith is the center of my life,'' he replied. ``I don't wear
it on my sleeve, but I'm happy to respond to your question by
affirming my faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said that when he returned from his Army service in Vietnam
he went to divinity school for about a year ``to intensively
explore the questions I had which seemed then and seem now to be
the most important questions about what's the purpose of life,
what's our relationship to the Creator, what's our spiritual
obligation to one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't find all the answers that I thought I might,'' he
said, ``but I found better questions, and I found a process for
living out better answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the purpose of life is to glorify God. I turn to my
faith as the bedrock of my approach to any important question in my
life.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore's father was a Southern Baptist, his mother a member of the
Church of Christ, and the family alternated the churches it
attended. Gore attended an Episcopal school; his wife, Tipper, was
an Episcopalian, although she switched to his Baptist congregation
after their marriage at the Episcopal National Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   What one sensed in the White House conversation was a
Christianity that is ethical and intellectual but not especially
doctrinal. Gore's passing references were to the virtues of
compassion and kindness, and to an impressive array of thinkers _
the American political moralist Reinhold Niebuhr, the Jesuit
paleontologist Pierre Teilhard de Chardin, the phenomenologist
Edmund Husserl, the existentialist Maurice Merleau-Ponty _ whose
writings bore more on the very possibility of religious belief and
morality in an age of science and power politics than on specific
Christian doctrines, especially of the sort that divide
denominations.
</P>
<P>
   (To hear the name ``Merleau-Ponty'' trip off the tongue of a
major American politician is surely extraordinary. Whether it is a
qualification to be president is an entirely different matter.)
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Gore showed his evangelical roots with a
confident exegesis of Bible texts that he said had helped him
understand events like the killings last month in Littleton, Colo.,
and the consequences of violent images in the mass media.
</P>
<P>
   And when a reporter asked whether in times of trial he was more
apt to turn to the religious part of his brain than the rational,
he was quick to deny, in a manner that might please Pope John Paul
II, that the two should be considered so separate.
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth noting what has been frequently noted before _ that
the private Gore, unlike the public image, was animated,
intellectually serious but not solemn, and more than occasionally
spontaneous? Indeed, he could not have been more spontaneous than
when asked whether he was trying to recapture religion from
conservatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' the vice president shot back. ``I'm just trying to be
who I am.''

WOMAN SAYS BABIES WERE SMUGGLED INTO U.S. WITH FALSE DOCUMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A Mexican woman who worked with a lawyer accused
of smuggling babies from Mexico has admitted that the infants were
sent to the United States under false documents, but insisted that
the Mexican mothers gave them up for adoption voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Margarita Soto de Smith, a 28-year-old resident of the Mexican
border- crossing town of Agua Prieta, was arrested by Mexican
federal police in Agua Prieta on October 27, 1998. In her
testimony, which was recorded on videotape, Mrs. Smith told how the
attorney, Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, found struggling mothers
willing to part with their newborns and then used false documents
to rush the babies through the normally tedious process of
clearance for adoption in the Mexican courts.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes, a dual citizen of Mexico and the United States, was
arrested on Wednesday night at his home in Douglas, Ariz., just
across the border from Agua Prieta. He is charged with conspiring
to violate U.S. immigration laws and with mail and wire fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto testified that she received about $40 a week from
Reyes to take babies into her home in Agua Prieta and care for them
while they were waiting to be taken across the border, said a
Mexican federal agent with knowledge of the case. Police were led
to Mrs. Soto in part by complaints from her neighbors, who noticed
that she always had three or four baby seats in the back of her car
and wondered where the infants came from. Mrs. Soto did not have
any license to handle adoptions or care for children.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning, Mrs. Soto reluctantly admitted that she also
acted as what is known in Mexico as a ``name-lender' _ that is, she
allowed Reyes to put her name on at least three babies' birth
certificates as the mother. Mrs. Soto refused to say whether she
was paid for posing as the babies' mother.
</P>
<P>
   Based on what they learned from Mrs. Soto and other witnesses,
police believe that Reyes instructed the mothers to give false
names right after their babies were born, when hospital officials
came to gather information for birth certificates.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto acknowledged that she had taken at least six babies
across the border at Douglas using documents, many of them false,
supplied by Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Police found one six-week-old baby girl in Mrs. Soto's care at
the time of her arrest. The child was sent by police to a homeless
children's shelter run by the federal government in Agua Prieta.
Mrs. Soto was jailed and, in November, she was indicted on a
federal charge of child-trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Soto insisted that the young Mexican women who turned over
their newborns to Reyes did so out of need. In many cases, she
said, they were not married and had no way to support themselves or
their babies. Some had not even told their families that they were
pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   In many cases they apparently heard of Reyes by word of mouth.
He was known as a lawyer who could help them offer their babies for
adoption quickly and easily, with no questions asked.
</P>
<P>
   New York prosecutors said that Reyes and his partners in Long
Island, N.Y., Arlene Reingold and Arlene Lieberman, received as
much as $22,000 from parents for each adoption. But it does not
appear that much, if any, of this money was paid to the birth
mothers or associates of Reyes like Mrs. Soto.
</P>
<P>
   In most cases Reyes paid for the mother's hospital expenses and
other medical costs. But so far there is no sign that the mothers
received large payments directly for the children. Police found no
evidence that Mrs. Soto had grown rich from her work with Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   According to accounts in El Imparcial, a daily newspaper in the
Mexican state of Sonora, in November the birth mother of the baby
girl found in Mrs. Soto's care traveled across Mexico from her home
in the Mexican state of Veracruz to see her child and make sure she
was being cared for. But the mother, a 17-year-old teenager who
gave her name only as Aracely, said she had no wish to take her
baby back. She said she had been abandoned by the baby's father and
could not keep the child in her parents' home.
</P>
<P>
   Reyes had attracted the suspicion of Mexican police since 1997,
because of the unusually large number of adoptions he steered
through the courts in Agua Prieta. In 1997 and 1998 alone, Reyes
presented papers for 16 adoptions.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto Garcia Guerrero, the Mexican attorney general's
representative in Sonora, where Agua Prieta is located, said Friday
that a warrant for Reyes' arrest had been issued after Mrs. Soto
was detained last year. Reyes had apparently not returned to Mexico
since then, and was considered a fugitive from justice.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Mexican investigators had found irregularities in 17
adoption cases Reyes moved through the Mexican courts. He said his
agents had been sharing information with American law enforcement
officials in an effort to track down Reyes.
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said Friday that he had asked the Mexican Foreign
Relations Ministry to seek Reyes' extradition to Mexico to stand
trial here.

SERENA WILLIAMS TAKEN OUT OF FRENCH OPEN BY FERNANDEZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ She had no control of her shots during her match and no
control of herself after it ended. Serena Williams exited the
center court at Roland Garros Friday to the tune of Gallic boos,
not sympathy, after throwing a tiny temper tantrum in response to
being upset by Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0.
</P>
<P>
   More of a farce than the force she had planned on being on the
red clay at her second French Open, Williams used her racquet to
apply a roundhouse punch to her wooden chair on the changeover
after Fernandez used her racquet in a more conventional manner and
thumped her out of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The chair and racquet survived, but the crowd condemned her fit
of pique, a tempest the 17-year-old Williams described as just
another personal double fault on a day littered with them.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no excuse for the way I played today, really,'' said
the 10th-seeded Williams, who made 26 of her 42 unforced errors in
the opening set and unraveled completely in the third set, in which
she won just 10 points. Near the dismal end, Williams pumped out a
double fault, her sixth, to trail, 5-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should have been taken off the court and immediately asked
to leave the facilities, never to return again,'' said Williams,
who was positioned to meet her older sister, the fifth-seeded
Venus, in the semifinals. ``In all actuality, I had planned on
doing very well here, even taking the title. I never even dreamed
in my wildest nightmares that I would have went out in the third
round.''
</P>
<P>
   But out she went, a victim of her own errors and the insistent,
penetrating ground strokes launched by the 37th-ranked Fernandez,
who at 27 appears to be enjoying a renaissance two years after
undergoing wrist surgery that had her mulling retirement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had my best results on clay, always played well here;
I have good memories here,'' said Fernandez, who reached the final
in 1993 and next plays the defending champion, Arantxa Sanchez
Vicario.
</P>
<P>
   Although Fernandez had never played Williams before, her morning
warm-up partner, Martina Hingis, had predicted that Williams would
lose Friday and provided Fernandez with a slew of insider
information on the teen-ager's on-court vulnerabilities. Fernandez
exploited them all, particularly Williams' footwork.
</P>
<P>
   Besides keeping her shots deep, a strategy that prevented
Williams from attacking with her typical fist-raised fervor,
Fernandez directed her ground strokes to the corners, a tactic that
kept Williams on the run, scuttling around the backcourt like a
gerbil trapped on an exercise wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``She seems to change direction a lot better on the hard courts
than she does on the clay, but she's a very dangerous player, and
this is definitely the best win I've had all year,'' said
Fernandez, who described the Williams sisters as the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're here already, but they're the future of our game,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But on this present day, Williams played and behaved like a
novice. ``I was out of control,'' she acknowledged. ``In practice,
I was making my shots, but in the match, they were all going out or
going into the net. If my thing is not working, I'm going to have
to learn how to do something in order to make it work. My clay days
are over for this year.''
</P>
<P>
   So are the clay days of seventh-seeded Tim Henman of Britain, a
Sampras-esque serve-and-volley strategist who found himself in the
position of being able to lay claim to the No. 1 ranking if he did
the improbable and won this title.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Henman did the wrong sort of improbable, squandered a
two-sets-to-none lead and was ousted, 4-6, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, 6-4, by
97th-ranked Alberto Berasategui, a Spaniard who discovered his
Roland Garros comfort zone in 1994 as the runner-up to Sergi
Bruguera in the first all-Spanish final here.
</P>
<P>
   Henman's countryman, 12th-seeded Greg Rusedski, has said there
is a greater chance of extraterrestrials touching down in Britain
than of his winning a French Open. But Friday he got halfway there,
the first British player to do so in 22 years, with a 6-2, 7-6
(9-7), 6-2 defeat of the Italian Davide Sanguinetti.
</P>
<P>
   The resurgent Andre Agassi, seeded 13th, throttled the man who
beat him here three years ago, Chris Woodruff of Knoxville, Tenn.,
6-4, 6-4, 6-3. Agassi thus earned the highest-profile Round of 16
assignment, a date with the defending champion, Carlos Moya.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good opportunity for me to step up my level of play and
play my best tennis in the bigger situations,'' said Agassi, the
lone American man left in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I could be a punching bag for five sets against
anybody,'' he said about handling Moya's topspin, ``but if I'm
hitting my shots and controlling the points, I'll make five sets a
concern for him.''
</P>
<P>
   The highest-seeded man left, No. 3 Patrick Rafter of Australia,
downed the Frenchman Nicolas Escude, 7-5, 6-0, 2-6, 6-4, to remain
on track to grab this title and the No. 1 ranking. Rafter, a
two-time U.S. Open champion, reached the semifinals here in 1997
and saw no reason he couldn't do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing out of my mind in '97; this year I sort of feel
like I deserve to be there and I'm sort of controlled a lot more,''
he said. ``I've done the hard work and it's turned around and it
happens to be on clay.''

SAN FRANCISCO AGAIN DEBATES OVER BATHHOUSES 
</HEADLINE>

 By EVELYN NIEVES   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ AIDS closed the bathhouses here when the city
tried and failed. It was 15 years ago, when the epidemic was raging
and bathhouses, as bastions of anonymous, unsafe sex, were
considered major contributors to the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The bathhouses sued the city to remain open, but their
reputation as a breeding ground for AIDS scared their customers off
and put them out of business anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in a city still in an official state of health emergency
after 26,000 reported cases of AIDS and 17,800 deaths, a movement
is growing to allow the reopening of bathhouses where men can meet
and have sex in private cubicles.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's current policy on public sex, adopted in 1997 in
an effort to prevent the spread of AIDS, is believed to be the only
one of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In the clubs that have sprung up to replace the bathhouses, sex
is allowed as long as it is public _ that is, as long as it is
performed in a place where monitors can determine whether partners
are using condoms, where safe sex rules are posted and where safe
sex information and products are provided. About a dozen such
businesses are operating, some of which have glass-walled rooms.
</P>
<P>
   The current movement, which has prompted a furious debate here,
is spearheaded by a group of gay men who say that while promoting
unmonitored anonymous sex sounds foolhardy, what they are really
promoting is safe sex: bathhouses could provide a safe-sex
alternative for those who do not want to perform in front of an
audience in a sex club and who may resort now to picking up
strangers and engaging in unsafe sex in cars or bathroom stalls.
</P>
<P>
   In a way, this argument over closed-door versus open-door public
sex is an only-in-San Francisco debate. But at its crux are the
same questions that many cities are asking: can the spread of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS, best be prevented by banning sex in
places like bathhouses? Or by allowing it? And if it is allowed,
should it be monitored? And how should it be monitored?
</P>
<P>
   Because there are no conclusive scientific studies on whether
bathhouses and sex clubs help spread or curb HIV, cities have been
left to guess how best to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
   In New York City, where health officials estimate that there are
10 to 15 bathhouses, activities deemed unsafe by the state health
code, including oral and anal sex, are prohibited. Only mutual
masturbation is allowed. Yet, many gay men contend that oral and
anal sex are routine behind closed doors in many bathhouses, as
well as in gay theaters and in the back rooms of gay bars.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, where about a dozen bathhouses and sex clubs for
gay men operate, officials allow men to have sex in places like
bathhouses provided that they supply safe sex information and
condoms.
</P>
<P>
   But here in the gay capital of the nation, opponents of the
bathhouse proposal maintain that as a city that has suffered
profoundly from the AIDS epidemic, San Francisco must act with
extreme caution.
</P>
<P>
   While new cases of AIDS have dropped dramatically in recent
years, from a high of 2,760 in 1992 to a low of 600 last year,
these are still dangerous times for gay men here and elsewhere, the
opponents say.
</P>
<P>
   With AIDS receding from the headlines and drug cocktails turning
the disease from one that nearly everyone dies from to one that
many learn to live with, health officials fear that a false sense
of security is setting in. Recent anecdotal surveys show that more
and more gay men, especially young men who have not seen the
devastation wrought by AIDS, are practicing unprotected sex.
</P>
<P>
   Because San Francisco is a mecca for gay men, attracting many
weekend and holiday visitors, what becomes the cultural norm of
sexual behavior here could affect behavior elsewhere, the officials
say. They contend that providing a place where men may engage in
anonymous, unmonitored sex sends the wrong message and is
counterproductive to public health.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Katz, the San Francisco health director, said that
while there was no proof that bathhouse sex would lead to more HIV
infections, ``common sense strongly argues that more unsafe sex
will occur in clubs that have closed rooms and no monitoring than
in clubs that have monitors, insist that all patrons have safe sex
and ask those who are having unsafe sex to leave immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But bathhouse proponents argue that the opposition is not just
about preventing AIDS. Behind the refusal to allow closed-door sex
in bathhouses, they say, is a bigoted attitude that stereotypes gay
men as libertines who cannot be trusted to engage in safe sex
without being policed.
</P>
<P>
   The proponents contend that the safe sex message in sex clubs
will not be lost just because men can close a door before they
become intimate. In fact, they say, bathhouses, which historically
have been places where gay men socialize as well as have sex, are
conducive to safe, responsible sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a gay man with AIDS, and I do not want to bring back gay
bathhouses in San Francisco like they were run in the '70s,'' said
Michael Petrelis, an outspoken proponent of allowing men privacy in
public-sex venues. Rather, he said, he is proposing that the city
model its bathhouses on those in Berkeley and San Jose, which
provide condoms, safe sex education and testing for sexually
transmitted diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley's one bathhouse, the Steamworks, has been open since
the 1970s, before AIDS was known. Berkeley health officials say the
bathhouse employs a health educator and provides safe sex
information to its patrons
</P>
<P>
   ``We've taken the tack some time ago that you can't regulate
behavior, but you can regulate businesses,'' said Leroy Blea, the
Berkeley HIV-AIDS program director.
</P>
<P>
   But he added: ``It's a dangerous thing to point to Berkeley and
say, `Oh, they have it there, why can't we have it here?' If the
Steamworks had tried to open up today, I'm guessing it would have a
very hard time. Our effort is in harm reduction.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco's public sex regulations were adopted in 1997 in
response to concern about unsafe sex taking place in sex clubs. The
regulations, said Katz, are based on a 1984 court decision that
allowed the bathhouses here to remain open as long as they mandated
safe sex, and also by guidelines recommended in 1991 by a coalition
of AIDS groups and operators of sex businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that very few people have talked about is,
what does it mean to change the policy?'' Katz said. Implicit in
the belief that the policy should change, he said, is a belief that
HIV is no longer the threat it was.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, proponents of the bathhouses have begun a
petition drive to put the issue to the voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have no privacy in sex clubs,'' said Steven Filandrinos,
one of the petitioners. ``It's group sex. Imagine trying to ask
someone their HIV status in a dark, crowded room. It's very
difficult. And people working in prevention say that dignity and
self-respect provided by a private room lead to greater
discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ron Stall, an associate professor at the Center for AIDS
Prevention, which is affiliated with the University of California
at San Francisco, said the center's surveys found that men did not
ask each other questions about their HIV status. ``These are not
situations where men talk _ period,'' he said. ``That's a
disingenuous argument.''
</P>
<P>
   Stall says he believes the current debate in San Francisco
obscures the underlying issue of public health versus private
freedoms.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what this debate is about,'' he said. ``What counts
more: the need to reduce HIV transmission to the lowest possible
level, or the need for a community to express itself sexually in
the fullest possible way? This is a place where reasonable people
who really do care about gay men's health can disagree in profound
ways.''

 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MAY 30)  
 (af)  
 By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Poring over records at the Bankers Trust Corp. in early 1994,
New York state auditors discovered something strange: Millions of
dollars in unclaimed customer funds had disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   For two years, the auditors' repeated requests for an
explanation were ignored. But they pressed ahead, and what they
found left them aghast. The bank, one of the nation's largest, was
using the money to inflate its sagging profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were moving it back and forth between so many other parts
of the bank that they lost track of the money,'' said one auditor,
who spoke only on condition that his name was not revealed. ``I'd
never seen anything on this scale before.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust, an investment and commercial bank that is the
nation's eighth-largest, finally faced the music two months ago. It
pleaded guilty in March to criminal charges of illegally diverting
$19.1 million in cash and other assets that the law requires to be
turned over to states.
</P>
<P>
   But a closer look at the scheme reveals that it goes well beyond
the transgressions the bank owned up to.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust said it uncovered the fraud in 1996 and quickly
alerted federal authorities. In fact, several senior executives
learned that the state auditors were asking questions two years
before that. And it was pressure from senior executives, federal
prosecutors said, that spawned the fraud in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the extent of the diversion is much greater than has
been publicly disclosed, according to individuals investigating the
bank. New York state alone has identified more than $41 million
owed to it _ more than twice as much as the bank has acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
   And while the bank says its difficulties with unclaimed funds
ended in 1996, at least two other states, Georgia and Illinois, are
currently examining whether it has shortchanged them since then. An
official in Georgia said Bankers Trust had turned over only $663.63
in unclaimed funds between 1996 and 1998, including a check for
just $9.08 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   That is so far below the minimum $500,000 that an institution of
Bankers Trust's size would ordinarily turn over, he said, that the
state has initiated an audit to discover why.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust declined to comment on most aspects of the fraud,
citing a continuing federal investigation that is looking at the
roles of former bank executives in the diversion of funds. A
spokesman said the company was unaware of audits by other states
but would cooperate fully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bankers Trust has worked diligently to cooperate with
regulators and law enforcement authorities,'' said the spokesman,
William McBride. ``We have strengthened controls to help prevent
the recurrence of these problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust has agreed as part of a settlement with federal
and New York state authorities to pay $63.5 million in fines and to
return the $19.1 million it acknowledged diverting. But it is not
the first bank to run into trouble over unclaimed customer funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Bank of America Corp. agreed to pay $187.5
million to settle California charges that it had mishandled
hundreds of millions of dollars over more than 15 years.

   Bank of America, which was acquired last year by Nationsbank but
retained its name, declined to comment on whether it was currently
complying with laws governing unclaimed funds. But nine of the
country's other largest banks and trust companies, including
Bankers Trust, said they were.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expect the problems at Bankers Trust and Bank of
America to compel regulators to increase their scrutiny of the
handling of unclaimed customer funds. Unclaimed funds are bank
accounts left dormant for a few years; the money must be turned
over to states, which are then responsible for trying to find the
owners.
</P>
<P>
   While the Bankers Trust scheme rose to the unusual level of a
criminal fraud, huge sums of money owed to consumers, retirees and
large public and private institutions may be lying fallow in the
vaults of banks and other financial services firms, banking experts
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``There appears to be a lot of indifference to the issue of
unclaimed funds by banks and regulators,'' said Robert Landau, a
former Bankers Trust executive who is now a consultant and a
leading authority on unclaimed funds. ``But I think they'd be damn
fools to keep hiding their heads in the sand now that the problem
has come out.''
</P>
<P>
   There was nothing indifferent about the way a humble cast of New
York state auditors dug into the books at Bankers Trust. The abuses
they uncovered drew the Federal Reserve, the Federal Bureau of
Investigation and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan
into the investigation, and they continue to invite scrutiny of a
long-overlooked part of the banking business.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Kingdon enjoys all the trappings of wealth. He lives in
a handsome, $1.5 million waterfront home in Oceanport, N.J., with a
pool in the yard and a BMW and a Lexus in the driveway. He also
owns a castle in Ireland and two young thoroughbreds, Crafty Card
and Ring by Spring, that he races in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Like his horses, Kingdon, 48, once occupied the fast track. He
joined Bankers Trust in 1982 and became a managing director four
years later. In 1993, he was tapped by Eugene B. Shanks, then the
bank's president, to run a lucrative unit known as global assets,
which oversaw corporate trust accounts, administered pensions and
kept an eye on unclaimed funds. Known to acquaintances as B.J., he
reported directly to Shanks and also held a prized seat on the
bank's 12-member operating committee.
</P>
<P>
   Shanks and Charles S. Sanford, the bank's chief executive, had
reshaped Bankers Trust during the late 1980s and early 1990s into
one of Wall Street's most innovative shops. Once known as just
another stodgy corporate lender, Bankers Trust developed an
expertise in computer-driven trading and in the creation of
newfangled financial hybrids known as derivatives.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon's unit was a humdrum corner of this flashy institution,
but analysts estimated that it accounted for about 15 percent of
Bankers Trust's 1993 profit of $1.1 billion.

NO ROOMS FOR THE HELP ON TONY NANTUCKET 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JENNIFER BABSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NANTUCKET, Mass. _ They manicure million-dollar lawns, serve
tuna tartare, and dispense mountain bicycles adorned with wicker
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Without their services, wealthy part-time residents of this
island might find themselves toiling behind a hot stove or worse,
clipping the hedges.
</P>
<P>
   As the summer season officially begins this weekend, locals are
contending with a problem that threatens to undermine the
foundation of their booming seasonal economy.
</P>
<P>
   There's no place to put the help.
</P>
<P>
   Even some small cottages with views of dirt roads and scrub
brush are fetching $3,000 a week, while the most modest
three-bedroom home for sale here is listing for $332,500.
</P>
<P>
   In a place where homes once shunned by rich visitors now have
weekly waiting lists, few would prefer to rent to the estimated
3,000 college students and immigrants who flock to an island that
has morphed from a sleepy whaling village to a haute outpost _
teeming with corporate jets and more than 60,000 people at the
height of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now help-wanted signs are intertwined with handwritten ``Help Me
Find Housing'' flyers on the bulletin boards scattered along the
town's cobblestoned main boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Noah Learner, 25, who repairs and rents bikes at Young's Bicycle
Shop on Steamship Wharf, pays $420 a month to share an overheated
attic room with his brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's considered a deal; it's the best anybody has heard
of,'' Learner says. ``My girlfriend has been looking since
February, and she can't find anything.'' Another Young's employee,
Alison Trebby, 18, is fortunate that her family owns a house on the
island. ``I knew 14 people who lived in one house last summer,''
she says.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of affordable housing has also made it more difficult
for working- and middle-class Nantucket residents to remain
on-island, despite the intense demand for workers. The average
price of a single-family home on Nantucket jumped 27 percent in the
last quarter of 1998 compared to the year before _ from $673,000 to
$920,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young people, they are getting married and coming of age
and they are going out there and trying to buy something and
there's nothing left,'' said Edward Sanford, a real estate broker
with Island Properties. ``It's a gold-rush mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Town officials, however, haven't been able to win approval for a
handful of initiatives to build dormitories or other facilities.
Fierce community opposition erupted over one developer's recent
proposal to locate dorms in a residential neighborhood, while town
meeting voters wouldn't provide the two-thirds needed to approve a
plan that would have allowed the town to assume control of 27
properties with title or tax problems.
</P>
<P>
   Planners _ now in the midst of completing a ``comprehensive
plan'' aimed at providing some solutions to the island's
affordable-housing problem _ have turned to a consultant who helped
the pricey resort town of Aspen, Colo., cope with its own shortage.
Aspen acquired land and built units restricted to buyers and
renters of certain income levels; the town also now earmarks about
70 percent of new private housing for moderate income residents.
Some of the options Nantucket planners are considering:
establishing ``residents-only'' housing for year-rounders, and
requiring special building permits for the construction of communal
housing for seasonal workers.
</P>
<P>
   For Francis Papps, owner of Valley Trasportation, which has a
contract to operate the town's seasonal shuttle-bus service, the
housing drought means it's three weeks until the season is in full
swing and he's 14 drivers short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a tremendously hard time first of all finding
drivers,'' Papps said. ``One of the reasons we have such a hard
time is that it's so expensive for the drivers to live here.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, it cost Papps $16,500 to secure a house for three
months for his managers to live in. This summer, the same sized
house rents for $27,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to happen eventually if it keeps going this way
is you will have all the wealthy here and when they want to go to a
fancy dinner or get their car fixed, there won't be any services
because nobody can afford to live here,'' Papps predicts.
</P>
<P>
   A number of employers on the island _ desperate to retain
reliable help _ have either purchased or rented houses for their
employees. Many of those who cannot afford to do that _ smaller
retailers, for example _ are being forced to curtail their hours,
says Maia Gaillard, executive director of the Nantucket Island
Chamber of Commerce. Some firms, such as those in the high-paying
building trades, are actually flying workers in each day.
</P>
<P>
   Cate O'Connor, owner of The Atlantic Cafe on South Water Street,
says building housing for her employees was strictly a business
decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't do this, then I wouldn't be open seven days a
week, and if I'm not open seven days a week, I'm not a successful
business,'' O'Connor says. ``In return we get a loyal staff, and
they come back next year.''
</P>
<P>
   For workers, the price of island living _ if they are lucky _
often means living cheek-by-jowl with coworkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you find your own place to stay you can pick any job you
want,'' says Ged Morris, of Manchester, England, who delivers
tourists during the day for Terrapin Taxi and pizzas for a local
restaurant in the evenings. Morris's night job at Mid-Island Pizza
offers a key fringe benefit _ a shared room _ for which he
reimburses his employers $100 a week. It's a deal on an island
where sharing a room usually runs around $150 a week for each bed.
Actually, town officials do not really know how many houses are
crammed to the gills with workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gone underground,'' says Richard Ray, the town's health
inspector. ``Housing for the college kids, by the employers, is
spoken about in whispers.'' For his part, Ray says he will only
investigate written complaints of unsanitary living conditions.
Telephone tips, because of budgetary contraints, fall by the
wayside.
</P>
<P>
   Adds Ray: ``This is nothing more than the greed factor, which no
matter how you slice it, is one of the driving factors behind the
economy on Nantucket.''

 UNDATED: $1.1 billion.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1994, though, Bankers Trust's highfliers were grounded by
scandal. The bank, one of the most loosely managed on Wall Street,
came under fire from clients and regulators who accused it of
misleading customers about its risky derivative products. Tape
recordings, later made public in court hearings, captured the
bank's sales force snickering about the naivete of the clients.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout was brutal. In just a year, the bank's earnings
plummeted to $686 million; a federal investigation eventually
concluded that senior management had suppressed efforts by
compliance officers to rein in questionable practices.
</P>
<P>
   Before the government's investigation was completed, Shanks and
Sanford, both of whom declined to comment for this article,
retired. Frank N. Newman, a former Treasury Department official,
was appointed the new chief executive _ a switch engineered by the
New York Federal Reserve to help restore the bank's credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But while derivatives were making headlines, trouble was quietly
brewing in Kingdon's domain. It was also in 1994 that three New
York state auditors started asking questions about the bank's
unclaimed-funds accounts, setting off a chain of events that led to
Kingdon's resignation in early 1997 _ and the bank's guilty plea
two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few days of Kingdon's resignation, which Newman at the
time attributed to personal reasons, Bankers Trust said it would
add $20 million to its reserves to reconcile ``accounting
differences'' in the global assets unit.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors had a harsher term, however, for what went
on under Kingdon's watch. In court papers filed in March, they
declared that the bookkeeping irregularities were part of a
criminal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors said several executives in Kingdon's unit, whom
they declined to identify, treated unclaimed accounts like a vast
slush fund. And far from being a rogue operation to fill their own
pockets, the prosecutors said in a statement in March, the Bankers
Trust scheme was initiated because senior executives ``placed
severe pressure'' on underlings to enhance the bank's dismal
performance from 1994 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
   According to lawyers and Bankers Trust employees familiar with
the federal investigation, Kingdon, although not named in court
papers, orchestrated the fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Kingdon, who is the chief target of the federal investigation,
declined repeated requests for an interview. His lawyer, Stanley
Arkin, has not disputed Kingdon's involvement in the scheme, but
argues that his client's actions did not amount to a criminal
fraud. Laws governing unclaimed funds are murky, Arkin said, adding
that Kingdon would contest any charges filed against him.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in the United States attorney's office said that when
the bank's management first alerted federal investigators to the
scam, it played down the involvement of Bankers Trust employees.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Bankers Trust said it minimized its executives'
culpability at first because it did not realize the scope of the
fraud. What it has not said, however, is that state auditors were
pressing it for answers to questions about a possible conspiracy
two years before the bank notified federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors at the New York State Comptroller's office _ which
audits banks for unclaimed funds originally owned by New York
residents or institutions _ are known to be unusually dedicated,
yet loath to see their names in print. True to their reputation,
none of those involved in the Bankers Trust investigation would
comment for attribution.
</P>
<P>
   When the auditors noticed in 1994 that Bankers Trust's
unclaimed-funds accounts had dropped from $10.2 million in 1993 to
$3.9 million in 1994, they asked for records explaining the plunge.
But despite repeated requests, the documents were not forthcoming.
Because banks were ordinarily quick to assist them, the auditors
were bothered by the fact that Bankers Trust was not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bank initially wasn't very cooperative and indicated that
records couldn't be located,'' Comptroller H. Carl McCall said in
an interview. Bankers Trust's diversion of unclaimed funds ``is one
of the more egregious abuses my auditors have uncovered,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Again and again, for more than two years, the auditors were told
that the records had been transferred from New York to a warehouse
in Nashville. The audit moved ahead slowly, partly because the
auditors' resources were stretched thin but also because they
failed to use stronger measures available to them, like issuing
subpoenas or fining the bank, in the hope that it would cooperate.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, even as the state auditors were in the bank raising
questions about unclaimed funds, several Bankers Trust executives
were blatantly foraging through those same accounts to locate money
they could withhold from the state, according to allegations in an
unsuccessful civil lawsuit filed in 1996 by Let W. Lee, a managing
director who reported to Kingdon, against Bankers Trust in federal
court in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1995, Lee asked two of his employees, Harvey
Plante and Gerard Callaghan, to identify unclaimed funds that could
be kept on the bank's books, according to the lawsuit. The suit
said Lee and Callaghan directed Plante to set up a reserve account
for unclaimed funds _ the same account that federal prosecutors
would later label a slush fund.
</P>
<P>
   The suit said Kingdon and Paula C. Gabriele, head of Bankers
Trust's retirement services business, knew about the reserve
account. It also said Lee cleared all of his actions, which he
believed to be legal, with Bankers Trust's compliance officers.
(The bank's compliance officers notify senior management of routine
requests like Lee's only if they believe a problem has arisen,
according to a bank spokesman.)
</P>
<P>
   Lee's suit, which claimed that the bank libeled him in a
disclosure to federal authorities, was dismissed by an appeals
court in February, on technical grounds; Bankers Trust was never
called upon to respond to its allegations.
</P>
<P>
   In all, Bankers Trust said 13 employees involved in the
diversion of unclaimed funds resigned between 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Messrs. Kingdon and Plante, along with Kenneth Goglia, a former
managing director for financial controls who worked for Kingdon,
have all been formally notified that they are under investigation
by federal authorities, according to lawyers and Bankers Trust
employees involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Messrs. Goglia, Plante and Lee declined to comment.
Ms. Gabriele's lawyer said she was not a target of the
investigation and had left the bank on good terms. Callaghan, also
not a target and still employed by Bankers Trust, declined to
comment.

 UNDATED: to comment.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late in 1996, with their paper trail still incomplete, the
auditors decided to go over the heads of the Bankers Trust managers
with whom they were dealing and to complain to more senior
officials. (The auditors declined to identify any of the
individuals they spoke with at the bank.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, we were just going to call you,'' one of the auditors
paraphrased a Bankers Trust senior official as telling the audit
team in 1996. ``We realize we have a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   That position struck one of the auditors as odd, since he had
been examining the bank for more than two years. Bankers Trust
declined to comment on anything having to do with the auditors'
activities, including exactly who in the bank's upper ranks knew
about the questions the auditors were asking.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, however, a bank spokesman said Bankers Trust
had first heard about problems with unclaimed funds in an exit
interview with a departing employee in early 1996 _ more than two
years after the state auditors began pestering it for records.
</P>
<P>
   The bank said it was the exit interview that caused it to begin
an internal investigation of unclaimed funds and to alert federal
authorities to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the state auditors finally demanded access to Bankers
Trust's records. One of the auditors took advantage of a business
trip to Nashville to make a detour to the records center there.
This time, the bank cooperated _ and only then, the auditors said,
did they begin to understand the full dimensions of what was
happening.
</P>
<P>
   But while they were the first to ferret out the problems at
Bankers Trust, they were not the ones who brought the investigation
to a head.
</P>
<P>
   After plugging away in 1997 and 1998, the auditors were asked
last October by the FBI, the Manhattan United States Attorney's
office and the Federal Reserve to turn over thousands of pages of
documents. A month later, representatives of those agencies met
with the auditors and told them they were taking over the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Bankers Trust pleaded guilty to criminal charges of
diverting the funds. Because most companies and investors are
forbidden to do business with convicted felons, Bankers Trust's
admission could have put the bank out of business had it not
already agreed in November 1998 to be acquired by the German
banking giant Deutsche Bank AG.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Trust informed employees in an internal memo in March
that it was working closely with regulators to make sure there was
no recurrence of unclaimed-funds problems. But it is not clear that
those problems have actually ended.
</P>
<P>
   In Georgia, Larry Griggers, director of the state Department of
Revenue, said there were questions about the tiny sum in unclaimed
funds turned over by Bankers Trust between 1996 and 1998: ``We feel
that it definitely should be larger than that, and we've initiated
an audit.''
</P>
<P>
   The cupboards appear to have been bare even longer in Illinois.
Over 34 years, the Illinois Department of Financial Institutions
said, Bankers Trust has turned over just $2,400 in unclaimed funds.
The state said it had begun its own audit of Bankers Trust last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in Washington, including officials from the Fed and
the Comptroller of the Currency's office, say that outright theft
of unclaimed funds is rare, and not something that bank customers
should worry about. Some state regulators add that ignorance of the
law, rather than criminal intent, is often to blame.
</P>
<P>
   David Epstein, a Boston lawyer specializing in
abandoned-property law, said the federal and state governments had
already collected about $30 billion in unclaimed funds from banks
and other companies _ but that consumers and institutions had yet
to claim that money. States can make use of the funds once they
receive them, but they must turn over the money whenever a rightful
owner steps forward.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no one seems to know how much money remains uncollected
from banks. Landau, the banking consultant, said that while only a
small percentage of bonds held by 30 banks he surveyed in 1996 were
still unclaimed a year after they had matured, their value ``could
be billions.''
</P>
<P>
   Epstein, however, said unclaimed funds still held by banks
``don't approach the staggering amounts suggested by some.'' But,
he added, ``the amounts are quite large.''

A NEW POLITICAL DANCE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   YULEE, Fla. _ Behind closed doors on Sunday, Bill and Hillary
Clinton will be the featured speakers in one of their favorite
forums, a talkathon on globalization, social investment and the
``third way'' of governing that they have long promoted.
</P>
<P>
   But interestingly, it is Mrs. Clinton who will occupy center
stage for a longer period, speaking and fielding questions from
Democratic insiders and money people for an hour in the morning,
and then addressing the group jointly with her husband later.
</P>
<P>
   The schedule reflects the subtle shift of internal dynamics
emerging now that the end of Clinton's presidency is in sight and
Mrs. Clinton's race for the Senate from New York appears all but
certain. To be sure, he is still leader of the world's only
superpower. But in this, their 28th year as a couple and a
political team, she represents the future.
</P>
<P>
   This was evident a couple of weeks ago in one of their rare
public appearances together, when the Clintons went to Littleton,
Colo., to talk with families of those who had been killed in the
school massacre. Clinton and his entourage waited for half an hour
on the tarmac at the Denver airport while Mrs. Clinton flew in from
Arizona, where she had been promoting the treasures of the
Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   When Mrs. Clinton arrived, the crowd swelled around her; the
president hung back on the fringe. She led the way to their
helicopter, with him a few paces behind. When she extended her
hand, he literally had to skip to catch up with her.
</P>
<P>
   They have been completely secluded here at the White Oak
Plantation, a gated 7,500-acre animal preserve set two miles back
on a dirt road. They have had no visitors, are cooking dinners on
their own and reading. While Clinton has been playing golf, and
losing to the local 25-year-old pros, Mrs. Clinton has been working
the phones and strategizing on her Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Her candidacy, once a mind-bending fantasy, no longer seems a
question of if. It has moved on to the when and the how and the
political ramifications of such a precedent-shattering move.
</P>
<P>
   ``She really wants to do this,'' said a New York Democrat close
to the process, ``and she has her staff out looking at all these
logistical issues. They are coming back with a plan, and they are
going to be saying, `Is this doable? Is this doable?' It sounds
like she'd have to be talked out of it at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the state Democratic chairwoman, said Mrs. Clinton
called her the other day and talked about doing some upstate
travel. ``As you go around and talk to folks,'' Ms. Hope said Mrs.
Clinton told her, ``gather ideas and suggestions about where they
think I ought to go and what I should be doing.''' Officials are
searching for an upstate, centrally located home base from which
Mrs. Clinton could make day trips during the summer to meet people.
This is separate from the Clintons' search for a permanent
postpresidential residence in Westchester County.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's supporters are playing down the milestone aspects
of an incumbent first lady running for office and leaving her
husband home alone in the White House. What message does this send?
And will her striking out on her own reverse her favorability
ratings, which climbed when she curbed her independence and stood
by her man?
</P>
<P>
   One Democrat said that the trickier consideration was leaving
her official duties as first lady, not leaving her husband. While
another official close to Mrs. Clinton pointed out that the first
lady had few prescribed duties beyond presiding at state dinners,
conflicts will inevitably arise. State dinner in Washington or
Democratic dinner in Utica, N.Y.?
</P>
<P>
   The conflicts will not be just logistical but also political.
Although she and the president see eye to eye on virtually every
policy matter, what happens if, say, the Republicans'
transportation budget proposal, which eliminates $160 million in
federal mass transit aid for New York, reaches the president's desk
for his signature?
</P>
<P>
   The White House has stopped short of a veto threat. Presumably
the first lady would argue for a veto, but if this killed an
otherwise acceptable bill, the president could be portrayed as
jeopardizing the national interest for his wife's political career.
</P>
<P>
   Another consideration is security. Asked how Mrs. Clinton could
shuck the protective Secret Service shell that surrounds her, one
Democratic aide said the first lady did not perceive this as an
obstacle, and hoped the public would be sympathetic about it.
</P>
<P>
   It still provides an easy target for her critics, who are
already complaining that taxpayers have unfairly had to pay for her
New York trips, which are obviously political. She will almost
certainly form an exploratory committee to help her raise money to
pay her own way.
</P>

<P>
   Others are scrambling over how to manage the press corps _ not
just its ferocity but its size. On her New York visits, the
noncandidate has already been overwhelmed by the sheer quantity of
reporters, who come from across the state and around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that is the expanding size of a previously tight circle
of aides devoted to doing things as Mrs. Clinton wants them done.
``There are a lot of people talking to the press who aren't part of
the Hillary machine,'' said one Democrat who fits that description.
``It's a problem that she doesn't have the control over them that
she has over the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is puzzling over some of these questions herself,
but is also working on what she wants to say. She will get some
practice on Sunday, when she and the president meet with about 50
members of the Democratic Leadership Council, the centrist group
that helped Clinton tone down the liberal image of the Democratic
Party.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton is planning to talk about her notion of a ``civil
society,'' a longtime preoccupation that aides suggested could be
tailored to contrast with the behavior of New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, her likely opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the president is pitching in too. Although Clinton
has the war in Kosovo to worry about, he has been keeping a close
eye on the special election for a state Senate seat in Rockland
County, a swing district north of New York City that could prove a
bellwether for Mrs. Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton had taped a radio commercial for the Democratic
candidate, Kenneth Zebrowski, a county legislator, and the
president had written a letter to local communities on his behalf.
By 11:30 Tuesday night, it was clear that Zebrowski had lost the
hard-fought race, and Clinton, who had just arrived here for
vacation, called him on the phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is Bill, and I wanted to tell you how sorry I was that
things didn't work out,'' Zebrowski recalled the president saying.
``He was sort of somber,'' Zebrowski said, ``quieter than I might
have expected,'' perhaps reflecting on what could lie in store for
his wife, who did not come to the phone.

U.S. HUNTS FOR QUID PRO QUO IN MICROSOFT WITNESS' ACTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash.)  (rk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The Justice Department's chief trial lawyer
in the government's antitrust suit against Microsoft Corp. Friday
closely questioned a Microsoft witness about whether he had
benefited as a result of his decision to defend the software
publisher and to testify in its behalf.
</P>
<P>
   The questioning was one of a series of depositions taking place
in preparation for the resumption of the trial in Washington on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon Eubanks, a veteran software developer, who until recently
was chairman and chief executive of Symantec Corp., frequently
responded to the Justice Department lawyer, David Boies, by saying
that he did not recall the details of his communications with
Microsoft executives.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks, a pioneer in the personal computer industry, once
worked for Digital Research, a company that competed with Microsoft
in software products, notably operating systems and programming
languages. But he has long been a defender of the Redmond, Wash.,
software giant.
</P>
<P>
   He is now the chief executive of Oblix, a Mountain View, Calif.,
software company.
</P>
<P>
   The deposition, which took place Friday afternoon in a hotel
room here, began with Boies asking Eubanks what Bill Gates,
Microsoft's chairman, had said when Microsoft asked Eubanks to
serve as a rebuttal witness in the antitrust trial.
</P>
<P>
   Boies then referred to a February 1998 electronic mail exchange
between Eubanks and Brad Chase, a Microsoft marketing executive, in
which Chase asked Eubanks to write an opinion piece in defense of
Microsoft's role in the computer industry.
</P>
<P>
   In messages sent on Feb. 21, 1998, Eubanks said he would be glad
to write an op-ed piece supporting Microsoft, and he then asked
Chase if Microsoft would be willing to drop an anti-virus product
that competed with Symantec's product from a supplement Microsoft
was releasing for the Windows 95 operating system.
</P>
<P>
   Boies asked if there was a tie between Eubanks' willingness to
write a supportive op-ed piece and his decision to raise the
question of the inclusion of the competitor's product as part of
the Microsoft operating system.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand what you're asking, and the answer is absolutely
not,'' Eubanks said. He said that the two issues were ``disjoint''
and that he had consistently discussed the issue with Microsoft
executives because he felt strongly that it was wrong for
Microsoft, which has a de facto monopoly with its Windows family of
operating systems, to ``anoint one competitor's product in favor of
another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our customers routinely told me that supporting Microsoft was
extremely important,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the deposition, Boies had asked Eubanks if
Gates had asked him to testify to help with ``damage control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did he tell you that he wanted to help control the damage and
that he felt the case was lost?'' Boies asked.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks said he did not recall any such questions.
</P>
<P>
   During the deposition, Boies and Eubanks fenced over a quote in
a newspaper article in which Eubanks was reported to have
criticized Microsoft's business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Eubanks said he believed that he had been misquoted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember consistently telling our employees that our job was
to serve our customers and that to get involved in disputes with
Microsoft, Apple, Oracle or anyone else was not productive,''
Eubanks said.
</P>
<P>
   Boies' questioning was continuing Friday evening.

<P>
   GURPINAR, Turkey _ Twenty years ago, Ismail Bolukbasi opened a
restaurant in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, and it quickly
attracted a clientele as diverse as Kosovo itself was.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian intellectuals dined alongside Serbian police officers.
People whose forefathers were Turkish, as Bolukbasi's were, mixed
freely with Macedonians, Jews, Croats, Greeks, Slovenes and whoever
else found their way through his portals. Cognac was the social
lubricant of choice.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Bolukbasi is that faceless being called a refugee _ part
of the human flood that has surged out of Kosovo in recent weeks.
He has lost his home, his restaurant, many of his friends and
everything he worked to build.
</P>
<P>
   Now he finds himself responsible for an extended family of 23
people, ranging from small children to his 67-year-old mother. They
are jammed into a small apartment in a dreary cement colony here,
outside Istanbul.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his misfortunes, Bolukbasi knows that he is among the
lucky ones. He and most of his relatives have escaped the Balkan
inferno. Thanks to help from a Turkish friend, they have a place to
live and food to eat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life was beautiful in Kosovo until 1989,'' Bolukbasi
rhapsodized. ``I wouldn't trade a minute of that time with anyone
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1989 that Slobodan Milosevic, now the Yugoslav
president, began his climb to power with fiery promises to his
Serbian brethren in Kosovo. Soon afterward, Albanian-language
schools in Kosovo were closed, thousands of Kosovo Albanians were
dismissed from their jobs to be replaced with Serbs, and a spiral
of ethnic chauvinism was set in motion that led to the savagery of
the last two months.
</P>
<P>
   Bolukbasi, whose wife is of Albanian extraction, fled his home
at the end of March, not long after NATO began its bombing
campaign. He spent his last evening in Pristina with a band of
Serbian militiamen, who urged him to bomb the apartment of his
upstairs neighbor, an Albanian nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I couldn't do that, because if I bombed the
building my family would also die,'' he said. ``One of the thugs
reached into his shirt and pulled out a knife. He told me, `OK, if
you can't bomb the guy, just go up and cut his throat.'''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after escaping from that encounter, Bolukbasi and eight
relatives packed themselves into a car and set out on a trek that
took them first to Macedonia and ultimately to Turkey. He has vague
dreams of joining relatives in Germany, but he seems to lose
concentration when he considers the future. The past also brings
tears to his eyes, so he lives only in the present.
</P>
<P>
   As the oldest of five siblings, Bolukbasi, 45, must now assume
the role of patriarch. One member of his clan is a 20-year-old
woman whose mother, Bolukbasi's sister, was turned back as she
tried to flee Kosovo. The younger woman rarely speaks, and no one
in the crowded apartment has any idea of what has befallen her
immediate family.
</P>
<P>
   Tuade Bolukbasi, 35, landed in Turkey after a harrowing
month-long flight from Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The police came to our house with guns and told us we could
leave the building if we each paid 200 marks,'' Ms. Bolukbasi said,
naming a sum equivalent to about $130. ``Then they made the women
watch while they beat the men. They told us, `Look at how we can
beat Albanians. You wanted NATO, so now you have NATO. See if NATO
can help you.'''
</P>
<P>
   So far, only one member of the Bolukbasi clan has found work in
Turkey. He is a 16-year-old youth who packs groceries at a market.
The family is being sustained by his salary, help from their
Turkish patron and donations from municipal officials.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has deep historical ties to the Kosovo Albanians. In
fact, some Serbs have asserted that Ottoman Turks created the
region's ethnic problem centuries ago by capturing the region and
persuading some of its citizens to convert from Orthodox
Christianity to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   This history has given Turks a feeling of kinship with the
people fleeing Kosovo. Turkey has accepted thousands of them since
the crisis began in March. More than 5,000 are living at a camp at
Kirklareli in western Turkey, and the rest, like the Bolukbasi
family, have melted into the population.
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel of Turkey visited the Kirklareli camp
recently, distributed radios and other gifts, and told refugees,
``You will be back home in your land before winter comes.''
</P>
<P>
   That pledge sounds far-fetched to refugees like Bolukbasi.
``Even if I could go back, what would I go back to?'' he wondered.
``What would I do? How would I live with neighbors who killed
children?''
</P>
<P>
   After a lifetime of friendship with people whose ethnic identity
never seemed important, Bolukbasi now finds himself among those who
want to take revenge on those they perceive as their persecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like what NATO has done so far,'' he said solemnly. ``But
now I want them to start killing people. All Serbs are Milosevic
now. All of them are maniacs. Everything I knew can never be
again.''

<P>
   ROCKFORD, Ill. _ With no end to the bloodshed in Yugoslavia
after two months of NATO bombing, Marcia DeClerk, a 54-year-old
computer programmer who initially favored the airstrikes, started
to wonder if maybe the American troops should just come home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When things drag on,'' she said, ``you start to lose sight of
what you're there for.''
</P>
<P>
   But the indictment of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan
Milosevic, on war crimes charges by a U.N. tribunal has washed away
her doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to stop him,'' said Mrs. DeClerk, tending a flower
garden on a brilliant spring day in this Midwestern city of 150,000
people. ``You can't ignore the people dying, the homeless. It would
be wrong for us to look the other way.''
</P>
<P>
   In more than two dozen interviews conducted at barbershops and
bookstores, shopping malls and motorcycle dealerships since the
indictment of Milosevic, the people interviewed for the most part
expressed support for American military action in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``These horrible things we've been hearing _ they're true,''
said Duard Bennett, a 38-year-old engineer sitting astride a Harley
Davidson motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   This old factory town on the Rock River, encircled by corn and
bean fields, has traditionally been guided by a middle-of-the-road
political ethos. Conversations with people here several days ago,
before the indictment of Milosevic, revealed a growing restiveness
about the presence of American troops in Yugoslavia, and plenty of
second guessing about whether President Clinton had acted too
hastily. But the sampling of those interviewed today tended to
amplify quite another question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why weren't we there long ago?'' asked James Jackson, 59, who
works in the real estate business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been obvious that Milosevic has been guilty of war crimes
for a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson and many others called for the use of ground troops to
bring a quicker end to the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not quite enough and a little too late,'' said Brad Hyland,
42, an engineer, describing the American military strategy. ``We
need to commit to ground troops or we're not going to get the job
done.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many people remain opposed to American involvement
in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a European concern _ it's not our thing,'' said Spring
Thompson, 22, a clerk at a convenience store along U.S. Route 20.
``I feel terrible about the awful things that are happening to
those people. But it's just not for us to stick our noses into.''
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized the American entrance into Yugoslavia but said
there was little choice now but to fight to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, I think we're stuck there now,'' said Larry
Steltmann, 56, an executive for a gas-burner manufacturer here. ``I
don't think we utilized the diplomatic options effectively. We
didn't use Russia, which could have been helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people said they did not trust Clinton, expressing concern
that the president might be eager to secure a legacy that would
eclipse his impeachment. At the very least, said Steltmann, it is
difficult to have faith in a leader who has been untruthful with
the people before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody wonders if he's telling the truth,'' said Steltmann.
``Even most of his supporters will tell you they don't really trust
the guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dean Hamilton, a 76-year-old retired phone company worker,
faulted Clinton for being naive about military affairs and
underestimating the mettle of the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't announce right off that you're not going to use
ground troops,'' said Hamilton, as he stood outside the Cherryvale
shopping center. ``It puts you in a bad position to negotiate. Of
course, Clinton doesn't have the nerve to face the political
repercussions of sending ground troops.''
</P>
<P>
   But the president had a defender in Frank Livingston, a
37-year-old barber, who said it was quite a stretch to tarnish
Clinton's foreign policy because he had earlier tried to conceal an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite his private life, he makes sound judgments as a
president,'' said Livingston, who added that he was inclined to
favor American military involvement if the White House deemed it
necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent difficulty in stopping Milosevic has surprised many
people here.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard Hahn, a 46-year-old technician for an aerospace company,
said he initially shrugged off Milosevic as a pipsqueak despot who
would wilt under the thunderstorm of bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we'd go in, drop the bombs, and he'd quickly back
down,'' said Hahn. ``I think everybody thought this would be over
in 30 days.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dan Saalfeld, 19, who has peers entering the Army, the
American military action at first seemed to be a case of
unwarranted adventurism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, we really shouldn't be there,'' he said. ``It
wasn't our business.'' But Milosevic's indictment and the details
of the war crimes have provoked a change of heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to take a stand,'' said Saalfeld, who plans to enroll
at Boston University in the fall. ``People being killed simply
because they belong to an ethnic group, you just can't let that
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Larry Creamer, a 48-year-old manager for Federal Express, said
he could not fathom how anyone needed a tribunal to validate the
accounts of war crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``All you had to do was look on TV,'' said Creamer. ``America
should be ashamed of itself if we don't stop this brutality.''
</P>
<P>
   Phil Nelson, 46, a carpenter, said he had little hope that
Milosevic would ever be brought to trial.
</P>
<P>
   He also worried that the indictment could make Milosevic less
willing to negotiate. ``His back is against the wall,'' Nelson
said. ``He's got nothing to lose now.''
</P>
<P>
   Creamer's wife, Linda, a 48-year-old bookkeeper, expressed
concern about her 18-year-old son, and said she wished the United
States could take a break from acting as ``everybody's policeman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Isn't it time somebody else around the world stood up and rose
to the challenge?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Moore, a homemaker in her 30s, said she had agonized about
the nation's proper role in the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has become convinced that American ground troops should
be sent, even though it would almost surely mean some casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be the first time America lost lives in a fight
for freedom,'' she said. ``But that's what being an American is all
about.''

`PHOTO OF CENTURY' TO BE TAKEN JULY 4TH

   KILLEN, Ala. _ You can hardly blame Ashley Wallace for feeling a
little left out every year when her birthday rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Being born on the Fourth of July can have its drawbacks,
especially for children who have to schedule their birthday parties
so as not to compete with traditional celebrations on the holiday.
</P>
<P>
   This year will be different for Ms. Wallace.
</P>
<P>
   She will spend her birthday in Philadelphia, and her big present
will be taking part in the ``Photo of the Century.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wallace is one of 98 people nationwide selected to take part
in the photo. The participants share a common birth date and will
represent each year during the 20th century from 1900 to 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Every state will be represented.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wallace, who will represent 1988, will be 11 years old July
4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hasn't been bad to have a birthday on the Fourth of July,
but you can't have your birthday party on the same day,'' she said.
``Everybody is doing other things on the Fourth of July and don't
always have time to come to a birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't mind it this year. Being part of this is a really big
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic photograph, which will be taken in front of
Independence Hall, will mark the start of Philadelphia's millennium
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hosefros, chief photographer for The New York Times'
Washington bureau, will snap the official photo at 7:04 a.m. July
4. Like the people in the photo, Hosefros, who will be celebrating
his 52nd birthday, was born on July 4.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance of a still photo is that it is at once many
parts but at the same time, it is a whole and complete expression
of who we are,'' he told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Later in the day, participants in the photo will be guest
marshals for the city's Independence Day parade.
</P>
<P>
   More than 25,000 people submitted photographs, application forms
and essays in an effort to earn a place in the ``Photo of the
Century.'' Among the winners were descendants of signers of the
Declaration of Independence, a woman from Texas named Liberty Bell,
an actress, a mayor, a nun and a cowboy.

MCI TO ACQUIRE SECOND-LARGEST U.S. PAGER COMPANY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Miss.)  (lb) 
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After denying earlier this week that it was in talks to acquire
Skytel Communications Inc., MCI Worldcom announced an agreement
late Friday to buy Skytel, the United States' second-largest paging
company, for $1.3 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced after the stock market closed, will add
wireless paging services such as two-way messaging and wireless
data communications to the stable of local and long-distance
telephone services of MCI, the nation's second-largest
long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the agreement, holders of Skytel common stock
will receive 0.25 share of MCI Worldcom for each share of Skytel
stock. Based on MCI's closing stock price Friday of $86.375, the
deal values each share of Skytel stock at $21.59. Skytel closed
Friday at $20.3125.
</P>
<P>
   MCI and Skytel have worked together in the past, with MCI
providing long-distance services for Skytel and reselling its
paging services. Of Skytel's total 1.6 million customers, 10
percent have MCI accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition was approved by the boards of both companies,
and must now be approved by the Justice Department, the Federal
Communications Commission and Skytel shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not completely unexpected,'' Linda Varoli, an analyst
at Merger Insight, an institutional-research service in New York,
said of the acquisition. ``With all the consolidation in wireless
services, there has been some speculation about what MCI would do
to diversify from local and long distance into the wireless
market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid speculation that MCI Worldcom and Skytel were discussing a
combination, Skytel's shares rose 6.6 percent on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The rumors stemmed from an online business information service,
Company Sleuth, which reported that MCI Worldcom had registered the
domain name skytelworldcom.com.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom, however, denied talks and attributed the
speculation to the actions of an overzealous employee who had
registered the name to prevent others from doing so. In some
instances, domain-name squatters have registered names and later
charged companies hefty fees to acquire the names.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't have a deal then,'' said Scott Hamilton, Skytel vice
president for investor relations.

<P>
   With the boom in the use of wireless telephone services, the
paging business has come under intense pressure in recent years.
More than 73 million people in the United States now use wireless
phones, compared with about 56 million who use pagers.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to remain competitive with the growing popularity of
cellular phones, paging companies have sharply cut their prices and
as a result, few are profitable. But Skytel, bucking that trend,
had revenue of $500 million last year, a more than 20 percent
increase from 1997.
</P>
<P>
   During the last nine months, Skytel has held discussions with
several large telecommunications companies, before beginning talks
with MCI in March, Hamilton said. In April, Skytel announced that
it had hired the investment bank SBC Warburg Dillon Read to explore
strategic alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   In an era of telecommunications conglomerates, Skytel felt the
need to add some size to remain competitive and continue strong
growth, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Also in April, Skytel formed an alliance with other paging
companies to use inexpensive hand-held computers operated on
two-way wireless technology.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Skytel, which is based in Jackson, Miss.,
joined with Ebay Inc., the No. 1 online auctioneer, to introduce a
free service that notifies Ebay customers through their pagers,
cell phones and electronic organizers when they have made a winning
bid or when their items sell. The service will begin in July.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom agreed last month to buy a wireless cable
television company, CAI Wireless, for $482.8 million to offer voice
and data services directly to consumers.

<P>
   For his prescient efforts, the employee who registered the
Internet domain name before the deal is likely to receive few
plaudits, said Frank Walter, an MCI spokesman. While the employee
``probably feels pretty good about what he did,'' in fact, MCI
``will have tighter controls,'' which will prohibit similar
actions, Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   MCI Worldcom said it expects the deal to add to earnings
immediately. The deal is expected to close by the end of this year
or early next year, Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction will be accounted for as a pooling of interests.

DALE EARNHARDT JR. DEALS WITH INTIMIDATING EXPECTATIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _ The ``Countdown to E-Day'' is in its final
stages. Blastoff is set for tomorrow, when Dale Earnhardt Jr.,
impending heir to the NASCAR throne, makes his Winston Cup debut in
the Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely, if ever, has a debut race been so ballyhooed. Budweiser,
his sponsor, began the ``countdown'' before the season. He has been
the main topic for the media covering the race in the Charlotte
suburb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you guys have any questions you want me to ask Dale Jr.?''
Bobby Labonte said jokingly in his news conference after winning
the pole.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for the hype is obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Junior is the 24-year-old progeny of a certified legend _
seven-time Winston Cup champion Dale Earnhardt _ and the grandson
of NASCAR pioneer Ralph Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   He's making his debut in a points race _ he raced in an
exhibition in Japan at the end of last season _ down the road from
his hometown of Kannapolis, N.C., in front of a couple of hundred
thousand rabid spectators who love the family name.
</P>
<P>
   He has the bloodlines and the talent _ he won the Busch Grand
National title in 1998 in his first full season on the circuit _ to
challenge Jeff Gordon's four-year domination of the sport. That, no
doubt, would thrill the hardcore fans who resent the outsider for
knocking ``Little E's'' old man off the throne.
</P>
<P>
   But with the hype comes burdens, the kind felt while standing at
the free-throw line with the NBA championship at stake, lining up a
putt to win the Masters and walking to the plate with the bases
loaded and two outs in the seventh game of the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot of pressure on us, and we're just trying to
deliver,'' Earnhardt Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered during qualifying Wednesday. The new team didn't
have the safety net of a provisional spot if it didn't make it into
the field on his time, but Earnhardt Jr. made it a moot point when
he claimed the eighth spot with a hot lap of 184.407 mph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never been that nervous in my life,'' he said. ``It's a
big, big relief. You just don't understand. It's a big, big
relief.''
</P>
<P>
   His dad understands. He went through the same thing 25 years ago
when he also made his debut in the spring race at Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt remembers, and is trying to give Junior the
benefit of his experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a young one, but I think he's handling it pretty good,''
Earnhardt said of his son. ``He's handling things as they come. I
sit down and talk with him and see where his head is every once in
a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having fun with it, enjoying seeing him do what he's
doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that while Earnhardt Jr. is expected to be a chip
off the old engine block, he has more in common with Gordon than
his old man.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon was groomed to be a champion. He was BGN rookie of the
year in 1991, and won three Busch races and 11 poles in 1992. He
moved up to a full-time Cup ride in 1993 with the well-heeled
Hendrick Motorsports team.
</P>
<P>
   Earnhardt Jr. was also born with a silver spark plug in his
mouth. He has the backing of Dale Earnhardt Inc. His Busch car is
owned by his dad and is sponsored by ACDelco. His Cup car has a
major sponsor in Budweiser.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 29 when I came into Cup,'' Dale Earnhardt said. ``I had
already beat up and down the road in the sportsman division. I
spent my money until I was broke. I didn't have nothing. It's a
little different for him. Things are there for him, his team, his
sponsors, things like that. He always says he had to work for it.
He worked for it in the driving department and paying-attention
department, but he hasn't had to work for it and get it himself
like we did. Things change. That's what you want for your kids. You
want to be able to give them things they want and need.''
</P>
<P>
   So Dale Sr. has given his son the best equipment and personnel
that money can buy. But Junior has to provide an important
ingredient: the driving talent.
</P>
<P>
   Little E showed he has that by winning the Busch title, and
dropped a hint that he can carry it up to the Cup car by qualifying
as well as he did.
</P>
<P>
   That, more than the gene pool, is why the hype might be
justified.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't necessarily deserve total respect,'' Earnhardt Jr.
said, ``but we're here and we feel like we've got a right to do
well and we should be taken somewhat seriously.''

 _ SF CHRON  
 Malevolent New Computer Program Seen  &HT;     By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Computer security experts yesterday said they have uncovered a
Trojan Horse program disguised as spam that allows hackers to
purloin or destroy the files of its victims from anywhere on the
Internet.
<P>
   The BackDoor-G program arrives in e-mail as a screen saver or PC
game update that, when downloaded, exposes a user's PC to remote
Net connections. It is also virtually undetectable to users.
</P>
<P>
   ``This literally opens holes in the security of a PC. It can be
incredibly damaging,'' said Sal Viveros, a group marketing manager
at Network Associates, which discovered the program Wednesday. He
said it would be several days before the Santa Clara company could
accurately assess damage.
</P>
<P>
   The malicious code attack _ which uses ``remote administration
tools'' to puncture a computer system _ is similar to a Trojan
Horse program unleashed last year. That program, derisively called
Back Orifice after Microsoft's BackOffice software package, was
created by a group calling itself the Cult of the Dead Cow.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear, however, who is responsible for BackDoor-G, which
already has spawned a copycat program in France, called
``Armageddon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more people are connected and have access to
technology, we will see an increase in viruses and Trojan Horse
(applications),'' Viveros said. ``It's just a function of the
bravado hacker underculture of trying to see how far they can go
with their programs.''
</P>
<P>
   BackDoor-G is the third cyber- attack to bedevil computer users
in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of well-known viruses, Chernobyl and Melissa, have
infiltrated computers via e-mail messages, wiping out data and
paralyzing computer systems.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The more severe Chernobyl _ a ``space filler'' virus that
secretly fills space on computer disk drives _ invaded an estimated
240,000 PCs in South Korea alone on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Melissa, meanwhile, choked e-mail servers worldwide in March
with a deluge of e-mail messages, forcing some major businesses to
shut down their e-mail systems for days.
</P>
<P>
   Computer security researchers have several suggestions for
minimizing hacker and virus attacks.
</P>
<P>
   E-mail users should be especially careful when opening
attachments with ``.exe'' in the address, according to Carnegie
Mellon University's Computer Emergency Response Team.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Network Associates and other anti-virus software
companies offer free software patches over the Internet that can
detect and eradicate BackDoor-G and viruses. These patches are
updated whenever new malevolent programs are unleashed.

KRAFT EXPECTS TO GAIN FROM SPEEDY STADIUM DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bob Kraft told his fellow NFL owners this past week at a league
meeting that he plans to have his own space ``trip'' in 2001: a new
Patriots stadium in Foxborough.
</P>
<P>
   If Kraft can pull it off, it will be the fastest any stadium has
been built in the NFL since . . . 1970, when the present Foxboro
Stadium went up in one year. That stadium was built on the cheap,
with no frills.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft told his peers he wants to build a stadium his family and
friends would be proud of and that he can pull it off if he gets
the necessary approval from the Town of Foxborough and the
continued support of the local business community.
</P>
<P>
   Said one owner close to Kraft, ``His family has owned the
stadium for years and knows how to run the business. They own the
land. They can get it built a lot faster and for a lot less money
than if the city or state were involved. This is why it made sense
for him to get out of Connecticut when he did, because that wasn't
going to open until 2003. This way, if he gets it done in 2001,
he'll be operating for two years at a higher income than he would
have been waiting around for Connecticut to get finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Kraft reportedly told friends that he would take the best from
the four newest NFL stadiums _ Cleveland, Baltimore, Tampa, and
Carolina _ and incorporate these ideas into Foxboro.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft was given a big boost behind closed doors in an
owners-only meeting by Pittsburgh's Dan Rooney, who said, ``He has
done a tremendous service to the league by keeping the team in the
Boston area. He gave up a lot to do it, but it is very important to
all of us that he did.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Reversal of Fortunes I:
</P>
<P>
   When the Red Sox first announced plans for a new stadium in the
same Fenway Park area, two of the most vocal local critics were
Steve Mindich, owner of the Boston Phoenix, and Robert Sage, owner
of the Holiday Inn. Both emphasized how valuable their property in
the area is and maintained they would fight before giving it up for
the new Fenway Park.
</P>
<P>
   Mindich was even a guest on Channel 4's ``Sports Final'' last
Sunday night with Buddy LeRoux. This is the same show that brought
us Jersey Red. Can Jimmy Myers be far behind?
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, research has revealed that Mindich, Sage, and others
applied for tax abatements from the City of Boston since 1995,
though Mindich claims it was done by the trust that owns his
buildings _ of which he is a principal _ without his knowledge.
Yeah, sure.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine asking for a tax break one year because you believe the
city overvalued your land, then the next year shooting your mouth
off in public about how valuable your land is and vowing that you
will never give it up. How are they going to explain talking out of
both sides of their mouths when they face eminent domain
proceedings? Which time were they being honest?
</P>
<P>
   Reversal of Fortunes II:
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers for Donna Harris Lewis are expected to finish their
arguments in her malpractice lawsuit next week. Then the defense
lawyers for Dr. Gilbert Mudge and his associates go on the
offensive. What puzzled me was hearing this week from alleged
experts how much money the late Celtics captain Reggie Lewis would
have been worth had his basketball career continued. Well, how was
it going to continue if he was dead? We keep reading that he died
during a ``casual'' workout. If a ``casual'' workout was fatal, how
could he have survived training camp and the rigors of the NBA
schedule? And, given his heart problem, who would have insured
another contract? At any rate, there's no way the Celtics would
have given him a contract extension after the heart trouble
surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   Reversal of Fortunes III:
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tribute to Bill Russell at the FleetCenter was
heading for an all-time embarrassment until the Rev. J. Donald
Monan, S.J., former president of Boston College, used all his
muscle down the stretch to bail it out.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, when only 2,400 tickets had been sold after some
of the greatest publicity anyone could get, a meeting was convened
to call off the tribute and prevent a financial disaster. Enter Fr.
Monan, who had talked Russell into having the tribute as a
fund-raiser for the National Mentoring Partnership, which both are
involved in. Fr. Monan, who played a major role behind the scenes
in getting the FleetCenter built and in getting the business
community to join with the NFL and the Massachusetts Legislature to
keep the Patriots in Foxborough, personally made the calls to save
the Russell night.
</P>
<P>
   ``Father called me up and said it was really, really important
that I come through for him in this Russell thing,'' said one of
the top business leaders in Boston. ``I wasn't going to give
anything. I'm not a big Russell fan. But I gave it for Father. In
all the years I've known him, it's the first time he ever called
personally to ask me for the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no official word yet, early returns said about
8,000 people paid and almost another 2,500 were given free tickets.
Perhaps the biggest surprise was that 2,200 supposedly bought the
cheap seats on the day of the event. Those are the real sports fans
who wanted to salute Russell. The others were returning business
favors.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The way Ramon Martinez has been throwing, the Red Sox now expect
him to pitch for them before the All-Star Game, well ahead of
projections. His ailing arm is coming along faster than expected .
. . Message to Kraft: Get Chris Canty on the road. In case you
missed the latest, Canty, the Patriots' first-round draft choice of
two years ago who simply can't play, can't practice, either,
because he reportedly developed a ``rash'' from the dye in his
uniform. Really? How come no other players in Patriots history have
come down with the same ``rash''? Are they throwing away all their
uniforms? I don't think so. And if you believe the ``rash'' story,
you must have also believed Mo Money when he said it wasn't about
the money, that he'd play for $5 million, or the Texas Con Man,
Roger Clemens, when he said he wanted to play closer to home. Canty
was the personal pick of Bobby Grier. The coaches wanted to dump
him in the expansion draft. Grier protected him. He should be gone
in a hurry because he can't play and has shown through some of his
off-field antics that his social life is more important to him. The
team was hurt last year when Jimmy Hitchcock, a much better player,
was traded for no other reason than to try to force Canty into the
lineup. It's time for the Patriots to cut their losses with the guy
and move on . . . Did you catch the piece on Mo Money in ESPN
Magazine this week or hear all the talk about it on radio? Vaughn
says the Red Sox were the reason his father needed surgery for a
urinary infection because he got so upset when Mo was booed. Vaughn
added that he would never forgive the Red Sox. I never knew Mo went
to medical school, did you? Maybe when he retires, he'll want s to
come back as the Red Sox doctor. If boos caused people to get sick,
there wouldn't be enough quarterbacks left to field teams in the
NFL. And he calls the Boston fans ``stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you missed it, Eddie Andelman and Dale Arnold had a good
interview with Rick Pitino this week. The Celtics coach defended
the deal in which he sent Boston's first draft pick to Cleveland
for Vitaly Potapenko. ``There is no one available in this draft
where we would have picked that is as good as this kid,'' siad
Pitino. ``He is the hardest worker on our team and gave us a big
lift when we got him.'' Perhaps the most interesting part of the
interview was when Pitino said he would favor high school stars
going directly to the NBA rather than simply staying in college a
year or two honing their skills to get ready for the pros . . .
Brian Rose is a great story. Last year when he was having arm
trouble, he was told by the Red Sox that the injury might be a
figment of his imagination. Instead of letting words defeat him, he
rebuilt his arm, signed a contract for the minimum, and showed in
his last two outings for the Sox that he is a big league pitcher
with a large upside because he has guts and control . . . We told
you last week that the people who wanted to preserve Old Fenway
Park offered two suggestions for what the Sox could do while the
park was being renovated. The first suggestion was to take a season
off. The second was to inquire about Foxboro Stadium. Now comes the
suggestion that they play at Harvard. Or consider playing all of
their games on the road for a full season. Or rotating their games
between Pawtucket and Lowell. Are we having a month of full moons
around here? . . . If the Patriots get rid of Zefross Moss, the
highest-rated offensive lineman on the team last year, and Todd
Rucci, who started all season at guard, pray for Drew Bledsoe. John
Friesz might get to play sooner, and more, than he bargained for
when he signed as a backup.

   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Stephen Howard Fagan Friday pleaded guilty to
kidnapping his two toddler daughters 20 years ago from a mother he
said was alcoholic and neglectful in exchange for a suspended
prison sentence, five years probation, and a $100,000 donation to a
children's charity.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a family saga marked by decades of deception, Fagan
walked from Middlesex Superior Court to enjoy a celebration dinner
with the two grown daughters who have steadfastly supported him
despite learning last year that he lied to them, telling them their
mother was killed in a car accident and raising them under the
false names of Rachael and Lisa Martin.
</P>

   Friday was the first time the girls' mother, Barbara Kurth, has
been in the same room with her daughters since Fagan picked them up
for what was supposed to be a routine weekend visit in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at opposite sides of the courtroom, mother and daughters
did not speak to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Egbert told the court that his client
had responded to complaints from three North Adams neighbors who
telephoned Fagan 20 years ago to tell him that Kurth had left her
daughters, then 2 and 5, barely clothed in winter and fending for
themselves. Egbert told the court that Kurth had been stopped three
times for driving while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, whose attorneys said she suffered from a rare form of
narcolepsy and severe depression during her divorce, slowly shook
her head side to side as Egbert portrayed her as unfit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the dedication of Fagan's daughters that
weighed most heavily in the minds of Middlesex County prosecutors
who knew the sisters could not be presented to a jury as victims
unless they conceded to the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan created false identities for himself and the two girls,
and raised them in posh Palm Beach surroundings. As they have
before, the sisters publicly declared their faith in their father
Friday, telling Superior Court Judge Peter M. Lauriat that they
believe he acted as any responsible parent would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the court to know that if we could retroactively give
our father the consent needed to take the action he did 20 years
ago, we would do so without hesitation,'' said Lisa Martin, sharing
in a prepared statement with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, whose siblings said she has repeatedly tried to
contact her daughters in hopes of a reunion since Fagan's scheme
was uncovered last year, showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth declined to address the court, but submitted a written
statement saying in part: ``Some days I believe that Stephen fagan
would have been kinder to really have murdered me rather than
having done so only in the minds of my children. At least there
would have been no question as to his punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon press conference, the girls left open the
possibility they might some day speak with their mother, the woman
who named them Rachael and Wendy, and whose last photographs of
them showed two girls smiling at a family birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't acknowledge her Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's mother, clearly distraught, left her daughter's side
during the testimony, and family members later said she could not
bear the idea that Fagan, though convicted for parental kidnapping,
was allowed to walk free.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's brother, Peter, said his family was not in favor of the
plea bargain but was aware of the challenges prosecutors would have
had convincing a jury that Fagan, 57, deserved prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not our deal,'' said Peter Kurth. ``This was Stephen
Fagan's deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan was given two suspended sentences of 3-5 years at
MCI-Cedar Junction, and while on probation will be required to
perform 2,000 hours of community service with ailing veterans. He
will also donate $100,000 to the New England Home for Little
Wanderers in the name of Barbara Kurth, who chose the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Following his sentencing, Fagan issued a brief statement to
reporters, said he chose his parental duties over the letter of the
law when he abducted his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Massachusetts some 20 years ago with two infants, two
suitcases, and a paper bag full of diapers,'' Fagan said. ``I was
raised in a home where the best interests of the children always
came first, and that is still the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who was raised in Newton and met Barbara Kurth at a
Kenmore Square bar, was greeted in the courtroom by local friends
and family, including his current wife Harriet, who has helped
raise his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who has never apologized for his actions, declined to
answer questions about whether he feels any remorse or regret, and
said he could not predict whether his daughters will ever choose to
reunite with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lauriat acknowledged that this unique case offered no
happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tragic, difficult and wrenching case for
everyone who has been victimized by Mr. Fagan's unlwaful conduct.
However, there are no perfect sentences that can be imposed, no
sentences that will satisfy all concerned as an ideal
representation of justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley, who inherited the
case, said the daughters' belief that their father acted properly
was crucial to the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a one of a kind case,'' Coakley said. ``And we believe
that it is not likely to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``Perhaps more importantly, this sentence secures
a just result without subjecting the victims to the potential
trauma of trial.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many people Fagan confided in about the
abductions, but last year a relative allegedly told an attorney who
reported that Fagan was living under an assumed name in Palm Beach
to Massachusetts state police.
</P>
<P>
   A master of disguises, Fagan told friends and neighbors that he
was, among other things, a presidential advisor and a Harvard
graduate. But Friday Fagan acknowledged to the court that though he
graduated Suffolk Law School, he had not worked in 20 years. Those
who knew him in Palm Beach say he spent his days watching his
younger daughter, Rachael, win swimming competitions and
shepherding his eldest to a career in philanthropy, like her
stepmother's.
</P>
<P>
   The plea arrangement did not prevent any of those involved from
selling their stories to filmmakers or authors, though both sides
said Friday their primary concern was to remove the couple's
daughters from the media glare. Egbert declined comment about any
book or movie deal. Coakley said it was out of her control.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, now a university researcher in Virginia, has no other
children. In her statement to the court, she defended her search
for her daughters, saying that law enforcment officials 20 years
ago were ignorant to pleas that her former husband had abducted her
children and brushed it off as merely a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth urged family courts to develop a system for bringing
parental abducters to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that after having met and received hundreds of
letters and E-mails from parents across this country and the world
that I am one of the lucky ones to finally know where and how my
chidlren are today,'' Kurth wrote. ``I can only say at this point
that I will always love them.''

 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shortly after her mother's death, when she was barely
17, Freddie Mae Baxter left her home in rural South Carolina. She
settled in Harlem during the final months of the Depression and
found work cleaning rich people's houses and taking care of their
children.
</P>
<P>
   Black, female and uneducated, she was pretty much limited to
low-paying, unskilled work. But she shared her food and lodgings
with each of her seven brothers and sisters when they followed her
north in search of jobs and apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Baxter, who is 75, retired in 1988 after spending nearly 50
years as a domestic worker. A large, energetic woman with
gregariousness to spare, she lives by herself in a one-room
apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Now she is an author with one of the world's most famous
publishing houses.
</P>
<P>
   To an outsider, Miss Baxter's life might seem hopelessly
ordinary and even dreary _ certainly nothing that would catch the
attention of someone outside her circle. But she sees her life as
so eventful and colorful that, in her opinion, the details should
be broadcast far and wide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always just knew I had a story to tell,'' she said one
afternoon last week, in her memento-crammed apartment outfitted
with stylish 1940s furniture. ``I knew if I could tell my story _
and I don't mean write, I mean tell _ that mine would be a best
seller.''
</P>
<P>
   The memoirs of an elderly, unschooled domestic worker a best
seller? Her chances of hitting the jackpot on one of the Atlantic
City slot machines she loves to play seemed greater.
</P>
<P>
   But this month the impossible may be within her grasp. A
hardcover edition of her stories and opinions, titled ``The Seventh
Child: A Lucky Life,'' was released on May 4 by Alfred A. Knopf.
With an announced print run of 125,000, Knopf is touting ``The
Seventh Child'' as one of its biggest books of the year.
</P>
<P>
   While a print run of 125,000 would be impressive even for a
nonfiction work by a well-known author, for the memoir of an
ordinary life by an unknown, it is highly unusual. Equally
remarkable is the fact that Miss Baxter received an advance of
``more than $100,000,'' according to Joseph Spieler, her agent.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Knopf's confidence, the book is clearly a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a long shot,'' acknowledged Martin Asher, editor in chief
of Vintage Books, which bought the paperback rights at the same
time that Knopf acquired the hardcover rights.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 33,000 hardcover copies have been sold, Asher said,
adding that the paperback version is scheduled to come out next
year. ``What completely knocked us out is the voice, the warmth,
the humor of the person. To me it was saying: If you live right _
if you have luck and grace and humor _ you get better when you get
older.''
</P>
<P>
   And sometimes, like Miss Baxter, you get luckier.
</P>
<P>
   Her streak of luck in the publishing world began three years ago
aboard a Metro North train to Port Chester. An elderly former
employer of hers had been transferred to a nursing home there, and
Miss Baxter was on her way to pay a visit. Among the passengers was
a woman named Gloria Bley Miller, a semiretired writer who was a
friend of the employer. The two struck up a conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a great storyteller,'' recalled Ms. Miller, who is 78.
``It was like turning on a tap. I enjoyed the trip more than the
actual visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Several train rides later, Ms. Miller suggested that the two
women get together to tape Miss Baxter's thoughts. Eventually, the
meetings became a Friday afternoon ritual at Ms. Miller's Greenwich
Village apartment. Ms. Miller sat in the leather chair, and Miss
Baxter sat in the rocking chair, discussing everything from her
days picking cotton after school to her present-day aversion to
churchgoing.
</P>
<P>
   Though she never married or had children, she talked at length
of the dozens of children in her life _ her nieces, nephews and
godchildren, and the children she helped to raise as a care giver.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1997, after nearly a year of talk, Ms. Miller began
transcribing her notes on her manual typewriter. ``During typing,
the shape of the subjects became clear,'' she said. Instead of
creating a narrative, she divided the material into categories:
``Coming North,'' ``Brothers and Sisters'' and ``Keeping Up With
the Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The rhythm of her speech got into my head,'' Ms. Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   In the section called ``Money and Gambling,'' for instance, Miss
Baxter says of her occasional trips to Atlantic City: ``When I go
in there, something grabs me. I want to go right in and start
playing .... If you're lucky, you win. If you're not lucky, you
won't win. That's all. The point is that in your mind it's gonna be
your day. And one day it's gonna be your day.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending nearly a year arranging the material, Ms. Miller
began to pursue a publisher. Although she had been a professional
writer, because of her motley collection of works, which ranged
from stories for a '50s comic called Plastic Man to ``The Thousand
Recipe Chinese Cookbook,'' she did not know anyone in book
publishing who could help her. She did not even have an agent.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the project went nowhere. After sending the
manuscript to an array of agents and publishers, Ms. Miller had
received 30 rejections, including one from Knopf. Others were on
the way.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in May of 1998, Ms. Miller got lucky herself. Through an
acquaintance, she made contact with a woman whose husband worked in
publishing. He turned out to be Spieler, and the manuscript soon
reached his hands. A few weeks later, when he got around to reading
it, he was bowled over.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``At the seventh or eighth page, something happened,'' he said.
``Instead of just reading with my head, I was reading with my whole
viscera. I was totally floored by it, by what I thought was the
originality of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   He promptly sent the work to two friends, Asher at Vintage and
Robin Desser, a senior editor at Knopf. Both had similarly
enthusiastic responses. ``It was no holds barred,'' said Ms.
Desser, who quickly acquired the book, one of about 150 that Knopf
bought that year. ``There was something so honest about her
voice.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later, ``The Seventh Child'' was published. In it Miss
Baxter recounts memories from her life _ everything from her hurt
when her father deserted the family to recollections of listening
to Billie Holiday singing at the Apollo and of greeting Duke
Ellington as he strolled down 125th Street.
</P>
<P>
   Early reviews have ranged from respectful to enthusiastic.
Publishers Weekly described it as a ``plain-spoken narrative that
crackles with energy'' but added, ``The book's nonlinear structure
makes for occasionally bumpy reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Seventh Child'' was one of several books that received
prominent placement in Barnes &AMP; Noble stores over Mother's Day, in
exchange for a paid advertisement in the chain's newsletter. Sales
representatives for the book were supplied with audiotapes and
videotapes on which Miss Baxter talks about herself and her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If people pick it up, they'll love it,'' said Sheila O'Shea, a
publicist for Knopf. Miss Baxter, she added, is her own best
publicist. Ms. O'Shea's current task is to persuade television
producers deluged with pitches to consider the book and take time
to meet the author.
</P>
<P>
   Despite recent fame and new-found wealth _ Miss Baxter split her
advance with Ms. Miller _ the new Knopf author has barely changed a
thing about her life. She has made her first will, which includes
bequests to members of her large extended family. Other than that,
all she has done is buy a videocassette recorder so she can watch
the video made to promote her book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I change?'' she said.

COHEN, 4 NATO COUNTERPARTS DISCUSS POSSIBLE INVASION PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen met with four of
his NATO counterparts in Germany on Thursday in an unpublicized
meeting and discussed what it would take to mount a ground invasion
of Kosovo, U.S. and European officials said Friday. Cohen and the
defense ministers of Britain, France, Germany and Italy received a
preliminary assessment by NATO's commander, Gen. Wesley Clark, that
projected that a ground invasion would involve a force of as many
as 150,000 NATO troops, one NATO official said.
</P>
<P>
   They came to no consensus on whether ground troops were needed,
but Britain's defense minister, George Robertson, indicated his
country was prepared to contribute as many as 50,000 British
soldiers, the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other NATO members, including Germany and
Italy, have strongly opposed mounting a ground invasion to drive
Yugoslavia's army and paramilitary police from Kosovo if President
Slobodan Milosevic continues to refuse to withdraw his forces and
allow the province's ethnic Albanians to return to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   But Britain has pressed the Clinton administration and the other
allies to at least begin planning for the possibility of a ground
invasion, saying that time is running out to build up the necessary
forces before winter.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's secretary general, Javier Solana, last month ordered
Clark to draft preliminary assessments on what forces would be
involved. Those assessments have not yet been made public, and
officials have refused to discuss them in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen and his colleagues, representing the five most influential
NATO allies, met on the sidelines of a conference of European
defense ministers in Bonn. That conference focused on the subject
of integrating the European Union with its defense organization,
the Western European Union.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, confirmed the meeting took
place, but offered no explanation of why Cohen's trip was not
disclosed. Cohen flew to Germany on Thursday and returned to
Washington that night. He said it was a convenient gathering of
most of NATO's defense ministers for a review of NATO's strategy.
It was not clear why ministers from the other, smaller NATO
countries did not attend.
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Cohen and his counterparts agreed to support plans by
Clark to widen and intensify the airstrikes in Yugoslavia and to
move immediately to put into place a peacekeeping force of nearly
50,000 troops on Kosovo's border.
</P>
<P>
   ``They reviewed the whole situation,'' Bacon said. ``They came
out with an agreement that the air campaign is working.''
</P>
<P>
   That campaign continued Friday with yet another withering
barrage made possible by clear weather and the addition of still
more warplanes, including 18 American F-18s that took part in the
strikes for the first time from a base in Hungary, one of NATO's
three new members.
</P>
<P>
   NATO announced Friday afternoon that it had carried out 310
strike missions in the previous 24 hours; the day before there were
308. In the last two or three days alone, NATO and Pentagon
officials said, NATO has conducted more missions and struck more
targets with greater intensity than in the entire first week of the
war.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has focused its latest attacks on Yugoslavia's electrical
grids and its telephone service. Large parts of Serbia, the
country's dominant republic, remained without electricity and
water, including most of the capital, Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had planned on intensifying the air campaign,'' Cohen said
in an interview with reporters at the Pentagon Friday, in which his
trip to Germany did not come up. ``And that intensification is now
well under way.''
</P>
<P>
   Cohen said that after more than two months of bombing he was
``increasingly confident'' that NATO's campaign would prevail and
force Milosevic to relent. He said repeated strikes were taking a
toll on Yugoslavia's Serbian-led Army and paramilitary units.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each day that goes by more and more damage is being
inflicted,'' he said. ``I think we're reaching the point now where
you're going to start seeing a much different reaction on the part
of Serb forces.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He and other officials acknowledged that, however battered,
Yugoslavia's armed forces were still able to carry out operations
against the ethnic Albanian rebels fighting for independence in
Kosovo. They also continued to put up resistance to NATO's
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   An American A-10 narrowly missed being hit by a burst of
anti-aircraft artillery, Maj. Gen. Charles Wald, the director of
strategic planning on the Pentagon's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said
Friday. Only two allied aircraft have been shot down in the
conflict, along with a number of pilotless drones, but Wald said
that several have been hit by enemy fire.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the International Criminal Tribunal in The Hague,
Netherlands, indicted Milosevic and four aides on charges of war
crimes, Pentagon and administration officials expressed confidence
that the external and internal pressures on the Yugoslav government
were having an effect.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department on Friday stepped up the diplomatic
pressure by displaying photographs turned over to the tribunal's
investigators for use as evidence. The images taken from satellites
show villages before and after attacks by Yugoslav forces, and
include the locales mentioned in the tribunal's indictment. The
department's spokesman, James Rubin, said the photographs help to
corroborate evidence that the Serbs are making efforts to cover up
killings.
</P>
<P>
   Photographs taken of a mass grave at Poblek, near Glogovac,
illustrate one pattern. Yugoslav forces were believed to have later
exhumed the bodies there and reburied them in individual graves at
a cemetery near Sikatova, Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The second pattern corroborated by photos is the burning of
victims, also to conceal evidence, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, said in
an interview Friday that the Yugoslav unity that coalesced around
Milosevic early in the campaign had turned into ``a grim
foreboding,'' especially after the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Milosevic is a sinking ship,'' he said. ``If you were around
him in Belgrade, I'm not sure you'd hitch your star to a sinking
ship.''

PARENTAL ALERT ON CONCERT TICKETS IS SOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Michigan state Senate has passed a bill requiring music
promoters to print warnings on tickets for concerts by performers
whose music is considered inappropriate for minors. It is believed
to be the first such bill to pass a legislative chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which passed by a vote of 25-11 on Tuesday and must be
approved by the state House of Representatives before becoming law,
requires a warning on tickets and advertisements for concerts by
any musical act whose recordings have been given a parental-warning
sticker by the music industry.
</P>
<P>
   Such warnings alert parents to recordings with sexually explicit
or violent lyrics. Failure by a concert promoter or the owner of a
concert hall to do so would be a misdemeanor with a fine of as much
as $5,000.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the bill, including the Recording Industry
Association of America, note that the advisory stickers on compact
discs are voluntary and arbitrary.

pulse?

<P>
   A: No
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you check for blood pressure?

   &UR; CITY STREETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   I boarded a sardine-can subway train going from Lexington and
68th Street to 14th Street and couldn't even move my briefcase.
After Grand Central the car emptied, and I sat down and
instinctively checked my trouser pocket for my wallet. It was gone!
I felt fortunate because I only carry a few things _ money ($40),
garage ticket, etc. _ in it, but no credit cards or licenses. On
the way back, I stopped at a police station inside the 14th Street
station and related the incident to a desk officer who told me to
file a report or simply let it go _ my choice. I decided not to
waste the time. The officer seemed appreciative and wrote down the
number of Lost and Found, which he suggested I call later on. As I
was putting the paper in my jacket pocket, I felt my wallet. It was
intact, except for the $40. I went back to the desk officer with
the great news that the pickpocket had put the empty wallet back.
He said he had never heard of such a thing in 15 years on the force
and clearly didn't believe my story. I can't make up my mind if
returning the wallet was an act of kindness, professional courtesy
or sheer chutzpa.

   Bernard Raab and his wife, Judy, of Fort Lee, N.J., were
enjoying a brief New York vacation. Every morning, they left their
hotel and walked a few blocks up Broadway to breakfast in their
favorite cafe. A panhandler always stood in the same spot, next to
a supermarket. One morning, Mrs. Raab noticed a few pennies on the
sidewalk in front of the market, not more than a few feet from the
panhandler. She bent down to pick up the coins and muttered some
comment about it obviously being beneath the dignity of the
panhandler to stoop for pennies. He apparently made out what she
was saying, looked flustered but quickly recovered. ``I'm
conducting an experiment to see what type of person will bend to
pick up a few pennies,'' he announced with aplomb. ``You'd be

   After 43 years, I finally had a New York experience. I was
walking to Pennsylvania Station and stopped at a greengrocer to
surprise my wife with a bunch of flowers. As I was crossing Seventh
Avenue, a convertible pulled up next to me. The driver pointed to
his female companion, said he was losing an argument, and would I
consider selling him my flowers. I nodded, and when he asked how
much, I thought quickly and said $20. He pulled two 10's out of his
pocket and exchanged them for the flowers. I returned to the
greengrocer, bought another bunch for $10 and walked away $10
richer.

 EVIDENCE OF WAR CRIMES SOUGHT FROM REFUGEES AT FORT DIX 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Human rights investigators have begun interviewing Albanian
refugees from Kosovo at Fort Dix, N.J., making the Army
base-turned-refugee center into an important site in the efforts to
document evidence of war crimes against President Slobodan
Milosevic and other top Yugoslav officials.
</P>
<P>
   State Department investigators have been interviewing refugees
at the center since Sunday. They are gathering testimony about
specific atrocities, collecting the names of Yugoslavs accused of
carrying them out, and delivering lists of potential witnesses for
any future prosecution to the international war crimes tribunal in
The Hague, Netherlands, a State Department official said.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Amnesty International has been interviewing refugees
for its own report on the Serbian campaign to rid Kosovo of
Albanians, said Sean Crowley, a spokesman for the human rights
group.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, David W. Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador at large for
war crimes issues, visited Fort Dix, now the main location for
interviewing Kosovar refugees about their experiences at the hands
of Serbian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is also arranging formal overseas
interviews with Kosovar refugees, probably at locations near, but
not in, refugee camps in Macedonia, the State Department official
said. Scheffer made no statement at Fort Dix.
</P>
<P>
   The official said investigators were learning about previously
unknown human rights violations through the interviews at Fort Dix.
But the official would not specify their nature.
</P>
<P>
   At the military base that has become their temporary haven,
Kosovar refugees _ who crossed the world for safety, but appeared
to have given up on justice after all they had witnessed _ took
heart upon learning that Milosevic had been indicted this week for
crimes against humanity. The charges against him read like a
catalog of their nightmares: murder, persecution and forced
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think people all over the world will smile when they hear
the news: that the 21st century won't belong to Milosevic or people
like him,'' Azad Cubai, a 53-year-old miner from Pristina, said
through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Though many are far less optimistic than Cubai, noting that
Serbs indicted for war crimes in Bosnia years ago remain at large,
the mood at Fort Dix appeared brighter, as families and friends
gathered under the trees to discuss the significance of the
indictment.
</P>
<P>
   Rudi Rubik, a 23-year-old student from Jakova, said he thought
the Yugoslav president should have been called before the Hague
tribunal ``five or seven years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has done many war crimes, not only in Kosovo, but in
Croatia, Bosnia,'' Rubik said.
</P>
<P>
   Ramadan Sulejman, 44, agreed. ``Every day he's doing more and
more massacres,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sulejman's friend, Liman Fazliu, 39, said he did not put much
stock in the tribunal. Fazliu said he saw in his own living room a
Serbian policeman slash half his neighbor's face because the man
did not give money on demand. Fazliu said he harbored no illusions
about the Serbs' handing over Milosevic for trial. ``It's
important, but only as a gesture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cubai's wife, Jezida, 45, said that indicting Milosevic and a
handful of government and military officials was not enough.
``There's not only one Milosevic,'' she said. ``There are many of
them.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Cubais moved toward the Macedonian border, Serbian forces
rushed them down narrow paths along with thousands of other Kosovar
Albanians and Mrs. Cubai said they saw a mother drop her infant,
who was crushed by the stampede. They saw Serbian housewives, their
former neighbors, throw open their windows to shower them with
curses and spit on them as they were being forced from town, they
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubik said that not only the leaders and the laws, but also the
Serbian people had changed in the last decade, as the government
demonized and disenfranchised ethnic Albanians. It stripped them of
jobs and access to education, health care and other services.
</P>
<P>
   Rubik remembered one Serbian teacher who taught him the Serb
language when he was about 10. Her name was Vera, and he thought
she loved children. But as her son went into the army, ``she
couldn't be so nice to Albanians anymore,'' he said. ``Not even to
the children.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ James Tisch's Manhattan office is surprisingly
cramped, abounding with family photos and the detritus that comes
with a 23-year investment career. Two high shelves are crowded with
acrylic-encased tombstone ads memorializing stock and bond
offerings past.
</P>
<P>
   There's a bubble-gum machine, a shiny megaphone that Michael
Milken's junk bond department once sent to clients, and a can of
New Coke, which Tisch had thought might become a collectors' item.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you want to touch base?'' he asks puckishly, and then pulls
out an actual baseball base from behind his desk. Next, he
excitedly shows how a photograph of the Paradise and the Orpheum,
the first two supertankers he bought, appears exactly the same
upside down as it does right-side up, because of the reflection on
the water's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Is this lighthearted 46-year-old who, with his wire-rimmed
glasses and flyaway hair, could pass for a young Woody Allen really
the offspring of that incessantly pessimistic master investor,
Laurence A. Tisch?
</P>
<P>
   Well, yes _ son and successor both. In a momentous transition at
the Loews Corp.,, the $21 billion New York-based conglomerate
controlled by the Tisch family, James S. Tisch took the reins of
leadership from his father, now 76, and his uncle, Preston R.
Tisch, 72, becoming chief executive on Jan. 1. He was joined by his
older brother Andrew and his cousin Jonathan, who both oversee
Loews businesses, in a new office of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Some investors are hoping that this will be a time of transition
in how the company is run as well.
</P>
<P>
   The portfolio of businesses and investments that make up Loews,
one of the market's most storied long-term bets, has floundered
over the last couple of years, groaning under the weight of its
out-of-favor tobacco, insurance and oil industry holdings and
burdened by a relentlessly bearish investing stance.
</P>
<P>
   Loews stock, of which the senior Tisches hold 31 percent, has
lately lagged far behind the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   But if some people think that the ascent of a new generation of
Tisches might signal not just a lighter tone but also a shift to a
more bullish, mainstream investment stance, they are bound to be
disappointed. In an era of turn-on-a-dime management shifts,
continuity is Loews' hallmark.
</P>
<P>
   For five full years before taking the top office, James Tisch
was the company's president. And for several years all three
younger Tisches, each of whom has made a career at Loews, worked
together with their fathers on the management committee.
</P>
<P>
   In short, the younger crowd of Tisches at the Loews helm is
defiantly sticking to the craft their fathers honed so well,
pursuing an investment and business discipline that is deeply
focused on value, extremely long-term in its outlook and
unabashedly contrarian.
</P>
<P>
   James Tisch's high spirits may reflect the fact that, as his
generation takes control, some of Loews' beaten-down businesses and
investments may be starting to rebound.
</P>
<P>
   First-quarter earnings of $45.4 million, reported on May 5,
contrasted with a loss of $83.7 million in the comparable period a
year earlier. The CNA Financial Corp., Loews' 85 percent-owned
insurance company, seems to be making progress in cutting costs and
sharpening its strategy. Oil prices have rebounded 39.2 percent
this year, improving the prospects for Loews' energy holdings. And
the company has made an unexpectedly sudden killing in one of the
year's hottest stocks, Global Crossing Ltd.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the responsibility for Loews' current state goes to
James Tisch, who around the office is called Jimmy. The third of
Laurence Tisch's four sons, he was the one who inherited his
father's talent for investing in out-of-favor businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up in Scarsdale, N.Y., he spent two summers working in
Loews businesses: When he was 10, he helped the bellmen at the
Americana Hotel in Miami Beach, now the Sheraton Bal Harbour; and
while a student at Cornell University, he was a route salesman for
Lorillard tobacco. ``It was never said that I was to work at Loews,
but I always assumed it was something I would do,'' Tisch said.
``It was instinctive.''
</P>
<P>
   After he received a master's degree from the University of
Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business and completed a stint in
CNA's training program in Chicago, his father brought him back to
New York to work in the investment department at Loews.
</P>
<P>
   As the younger Tisch tells it, his father neglected to tell
Joseph Rosenberg, the longtime head of the department, about the
new trainee until the day before he arrived. And then, all the
elder Tisch said was: ``Do me a favor. Take an hour and teach him
the business.''
</P>
<P>
   The story says something about Laurence Tisch's freewheeling
style as well as Loews' enduring culture. Meetings and memos are
few, but there is constant personal interaction. ``With Larry, you
get your day in court for about five minutes, and then it's over;
no endless meetings,'' said Howard Stringer, whom Tisch made
president of CBS News, and later of the broadcast group, when Tisch
was the television company's chief executive. ``He's instinctive in
his decision-making process,'' added Stringer, now chairman and
chief executive of the Sony Corp. of America.
</P>
<P>
   With James Tisch, decisions may take a bit longer. Bernard
Hengesbaugh, chief executive of CNA, said: ``His approach is to
make sure he understands an issue before he takes it anywhere. He
invites lots of discussion, what I call loud reasoning.''
</P>
<P>
   But the most important lesson the son took from the father was
the value of patience in investing.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, James Tisch, then vice president at Loews, bought seven
supertankers for the scrap-value price of $42 million. But it
wasn't until shipping rates improved in 1986 that Tisch set the
ships under way. Loews sold a 51 percent interest in the tanker
operation for about $150 million in 1990; today, its 49 percent
stake is worth around $85 million, and Tisch believes the business
has good long-term prospects.
</P>
<P>
   Such wildly successful bottom-fishing became almost routine in
the 1980s and into the '90s, as James Tisch and Rosenberg managed
the company's investments. Among the company's most lucrative deals
was its acquisition in 1989 of what is now Diamond Offshore
Drilling, which Tisch built into one of the world's largest
offshore drilling companies.
</P>
<P>
   Loews also has done very well with its $120 million investment
in the Canary Wharf Group's giant office complex in London in 1995.
For that investment, Loews has received $120 million in cash and
retains a stake worth more than $600 million.
</P>
<P>
   The family's management methods haven't always been popular.
There were howls of protest over cost-cutting at CBS Inc. when
Laurence Tisch took over as chief executive in 1987. But owning
about one-fifth of the network was a bonanza for Loews:
Westinghouse bought CBS in 1995 for $5.4 billion; James Tisch says
Loews realized an after-tax return of 15 percent to 20 percent a
year, bettering the market's performance during the period.
</P>
<P>
   The two other Tisch scions at Loews share James Tisch's
long-term perspective, and much more. Growing up, their two
families lived near each other in Westchester and took vacations
together, often at Loews-owned hotels. ``Our parents taught us,
your first responsibility is to your family,'' said Andrew H.
Tisch, 49.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it's natural, then, that when asked why he was the one
who ultimately became chief executive _ and not Andrew or Jonathan
_ James Tisch became irritable. ``While I may be CEO, Jonathan,
Andrew and I operate collegially in any or all decisions that are
made,'' he snapped. ``This works because there's a bond that's been
built up not over the short term or even over a career, but over
entire lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Loews' conglomerate structure has allowed all three men ample
room to find something they can call their own _ and helped keep
them out of one another's way. ``We have very different skill
sets,'' said Jonathan M. Tisch, 45.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew added, ``I've always enjoyed running companies, Jimmy
likes the investing and Jon always loved the hotels.''
</P>
<P>
   All three started at Loews in earnest during their 20s. Andrew,
Laurence's oldest son, a graduate of Cornell's School of Hotel
Administration and Harvard Business School, began with stints at
Lorillard and Bulova, the watchmaker.
</P>
<P>
   He incurred the ire of anti-tobacco groups when, as chief
executive of Lorillard in 1994, he was among the industry leaders
who testified before a congressional subcommittee that there was no
conclusive evidence that cigarettes cause fatal disease. Today, he
is the chairman of Bulova and corporate liaison for the Lorillard
unit. He also oversees the Loews corporate office staff.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Tisch, a graduate of Tufts University, began his career
outside Loews, as a TV cameraman and producer at WBZ in Boston,
then an NBC affiliate. He joined Loews Hotels in 1980, becoming
president in 1986 and chief executive three years later.
</P>
<P>
   Like his cousin James, Jonathan brings a cornball sense of humor
to the job. A few years ago, as part of a Loews proposal aimed at
winning approval from Miami Beach officials for building a new
hotel, he videotaped himself, wearing a blond wig, skirt, high
heels and fake fingernails, interviewing residents about the need
for a new hotel. (It worked; the Loews Miami Beach Hotel opened in
December, part of an aggressive expansion program. Loews now has 15
luxury hotels and resorts, and four more in development).
</P>
<P>
   Outsiders say they are struck by how the family feeling
permeates the business. ``They don't do things autocratically,''
said Scott M. Black, president of Delphi Management, a money
management firm in Boston, who has known the family for years and
who has invested on and off in Loews stock. ``They sit down and
discuss things as a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul J. Fribourg, chief executive of the privately owned
Continental Grain Co. in Manhattan and a Loews director, added that
``there is open give-and-take'' among all five Tisches on the
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a fundamental love between them that transcends the
day-to-day business,'' Fribourg said. Among the younger set, he
added, ``there'll be a healthy challenging of each other, but never
tension or disagreement.''
</P>
<P>
   Fribourg said he has often observed the two elder Tisch brothers
watching their sons handle the discussion, content not to
intervene. Although they have stepped back from day-to-day
management, the co-founders remain in the picture as very active
co-chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   Laurence Tisch, for example, was the point man earlier this
month when John W. Meriwether, chairman of Long-Term Capital
Management, approached Loews, an early investor in the hedge fund,
about the possibility of Loews' investing more money. (No decision
has been made.)
</P>
<P>
   The co-chairmen's business bond goes back over half a century,
to 1946. That year, Laurence, just out of the Army, spotted a
classified ad for a small winter resort, Laurel-in-the-Pines, in
Lakewood, N.J., and convinced his family to buy it for $125,000,
forming Tisch Hotels Inc. The brothers have since built a
collection of disparate businesses, with $73.3 billion in assets at
the end of March. The Loews name came from the 1959 acquisition of
Loews Theaters, which the company sold in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   While Preston excelled at management, Laurence was the brother
with the nose for value investing. He has often been compared to
Warren E. Buffett, another famed investor who has assembled a
portfolio of large stakes in companies and who also has a giant
exposure to the property-and-casualty business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the comparison is a bit awkward: Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway, despite recent weakness, has risen 35.4 percent on an
annualized basis for the five years ended May 21. Loews has
returned an annualized 14.1 percent in that time, and suffered as
the stock fell from its 52-week high of $106.0625 in November to a
low of $69 on April 12. The stock closed on Friday at $81.3125,
well below its book value of $96 a share.
</P>
<P>
   That divergence was perhaps inevitable: although both Buffett
and the Tisches ostensibly share a value-oriented stance, the
similarities end there. Buffett invests in market leaders like
Coca-Cola, Gillette, and Disney, while Loews has preferred to buy
truly down-and-out businesses, including some that have suffered
most heavily over the last few years.
</P>
<P>
   Loews has still beaten the market in the long term. From 1960
through 1998, Loews stock delivered a 20 percent average annual
return, versus 12 percent for the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the last few years have been particularly trying, as the
company's major businesses have suffered. James Tisch is adamant
that Loews is mostly a victim of circumstance, that the cycles that
have pummeled the profits of both its energy and insurance holdings
have been unfortunately synchronized recently. And he says there is
precious little that can be done to shake investor perceptions
about the lawsuit-plagued tobacco business.
</P>
<P>
   But it's clear that the Tisches have compounded Loews' poor
performance by placing enormous bets, using index futures and
options, that stocks in general would fall.
</P>
<P>
   The slump has prompted complaints from analysts and investors.
Some investors are particularly critical of Loews' short position.
``I really don't think they should be gambling with the
shareholders' money,'' said one portfolio manager, who used to hold
Loews stock and spoke on the condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some analysts are put off by James Tisch's obvious
disdain for those whose views are not as long-term as his own. ``He
has a tendency to be pretty brusque,'' said Kevin Simpson, an
energy analyst at Merrill Lynch, who nevertheless said he admired
Tisch's achievements at Diamond Offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Patient as he is as an investor, Tisch has not sat idly as
problems festered. CNA, the insurer that contributed 29 percent to
Loews' 1998 net income (excluding Loews' investment losses), had
tried to beat down expenses since acquiring Continental Insurance
in 1995 amid a price war in the property-and-casualty business. As
results languished in 1997 and 1998, Tisch began calling for a
formal reorganization program.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, CNA announced a turnaround plan: discontinuing
unprofitable business lines, consolidating operations and laying
off 2,400 employees. And in February, Hengesbaugh, the chief
operating officer, was promoted to chief executive to carry out the
plan.
</P>
<P>
   CNA expects savings of more than $300 million a year starting in
2000, though Tisch concedes that criticism of the slow pace of
change at the insurer is ``not unjustified.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the problems at Lorillard _ 43 percent of Loews'
1998 net income (excluding investment losses) _ appear immune to
any short-term solution. Hopes were high last fall that the master
settlement agreement between the tobacco companies and 46 states
would bring an end to much of the litigation against the industry.
But new attacks, along with some big courtroom losses, have come in
recent months. At year-end, Lorillard was a defendant in 520 suits.
</P>
<P>
   Although there has been speculation lately that Loews will spin
off Lorillard, Tisch says that isn't an option. ``Spinoffs don't
work,'' he shrugged, saying they don't necessarily rid a company of
potential liability. How about a sale? ``People say you could sell
it, but to whom? It's a bucking bronco we're on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tisch says he does not regret that his father and uncle
bought Lorillard in 1968. Even in a declining market, Lorillard's
brands _ including Newport and Old Gold _ are gaining market share,
he noted. Last year, tobacco generated $352 million in net income
on $2.87 billion in revenue, down from $363.1 million on $2.4
billion in revenue in 1997, even including legal settlement costs
of $346.5 million and $122 million, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Over time, he said, the lawsuits will die down and the market
will accept settlement payments as a cost of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Tisch is doing some characteristically
Loews-style, contrarian investing: He's buying Loews stock. Loews
bought 2.4 million shares in 1998, and one person with knowledge of
the matter said it has bought 3.3 million shares so far this year _
a hefty 3 percent of the stock. Tisch has also bought some CNA
stock and has made sure that the insurer and Diamond Offshore are
buying their own shares.
</P>
<P>
   What remains a mystery to some _ given the company's historical
aversion to risky investments _ is why Loews has made such
high-stakes bets on a market decline. The company has lost $1.7
billion since 1997 on market futures and options. And the loss
would have been even greater if it hadn't been for the stock
market's bungee jump last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Loews eliminated about half of its short positions in the fall;
it meant to cover more, but the market shot up before it could do
so. As the market was falling last week, Loews declined to comment
on whether it was taking off more of its short position.
</P>
<P>
   Tisch argued that a value investor in companies can gauge value
in a market. ``The benchmarks you use to determine value are
ringing alarms,'' he said, referring to price-to-earnings multiples
and other value measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``We shouldn't have done it,'' he said of the company's
bets against the market. ``Our entire short enterprise has been an
example of poor investing.''
</P>
<P>
   The three co-presidents clearly have more work ahead.
Fortunately, they have also inherited their fathers' interest in
maintaining a sense of balance in their work lives. James Tisch
limits his workday to no more than 12 hours. He starts at 6:15
a.m., when his father-in-law, who has breakfasted with the family
for years, picks him up at his apartment on East 79th Street to
drive him to work, and is done by 6 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other Tisches, he does charitable work in his off
hours. He is the president of the UJA-Federation of New York, a
Jewish social services organization, and is on the boards of the
Mount Sinai-NYU Medical Center Health System and FEGS, a human
services agency based in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the stock price of Diamond Offshore, up 34.6 percent
since its low this year on March 1, the brightest spot in the Loews
portfolio has been the company's stake in Global Crossing, the Los
Angeles fiber optic company that is seeking to merge with U S West,
the Baby Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Hillel Weinberger, one of 15 Loews professionals who manage
portfolios of Loews and CNA, bought $20 million of Global Crossing
debt in a private placement in 1996. With the debt came warrants
that allowed the holder to buy shares of Global Crossing stock at a
specified price.
</P>
<P>
   Weinberger sold the debt and bought more warrants, eventually
giving CNA a 9.8 percent stake in Global Crossing _ now worth $1.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   What will Loews do next? It had $2.6 billion in excess cash at
year-end. ``The reason we haven't made many investments in the past
few years is we worry much more about our downside than our
upside,'' James Tisch said.
</P>
<P>
   Though Loews is looking at possible acquisitions, Tisch said,
the family feels no pressure to move _ and its track record of
wanton disregard for market conventions certainly confirms that
contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got asbestos-lined pockets,'' he said. ``We don't let
cash burn a hole in them.''

BLAZERS HAVE SOARED WITH UNLIKELY `MISFITS'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They do not have the top scorer or the best
defender. They don't have a Hall of Fame point guard, a dominant
big man, a Mailman or Tim Duncan. They don't have much veteran
leadership or playoff experience.
</P>
<P>
   But the Portland Trail Blazers are four victories from the NBA
Finals thanks to a unique recipe. Take young legs, loads of talent
and plenty of attitude, cram it into a happy suit _ like the giant
cockroach in ``Men In Black'' _ and watch it steam into the Western
Conference finals, which begin today when the Blazers visit San
Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's like, `The Blazers are misfits. They can't do
this. They can't do that,' '' Portland guard Damon Stoudamire said.
``But that's our calling card. The way everybody talks about us,
the way everybody thinks we can't get it done _ this is our way of
rubbing it in their face.''
</P>
<P>
   How long will it last? It depends on their heads, because
there's nothing wrong with the rest of them.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers have 10 former lottery picks on the roster,
including Stoudamire, guard Isaiah Rider, forwards Rasheed Wallace
and Brian Grant, and reserves Walt Williams, Greg Anthony, Jimmy
Jackson and Stacey Augmon.
</P>
<P>
   They have the league's best bench, they have a superb front
office in general manager Bob Whitsitt and his assistant, Mark
Warkentien, and they have the 1999 NBA Coach of the Year, Mike
Dunleavy.
</P>
<P>
   Together, the staff and players have prevented Portland's
notorious alter-ego _ the Trial Blazers, the Jail Blazers, the Bail
Raisers _ from taking harmony hostage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing about this group is we genuinely like each other,
and that's rare,'' Anthony said. ``It's a strange makeup. Lots of
our guys have been other places, but there's a real camaraderie.
That allows you to grow on the court and trust each other in tough
situations.''
</P>
<P>
   ALL THE RIGHT MOVES
</P>
<P>
   Astute personnel moves enabled Portland to avoid the down cycles
that claimed Boston, Detroit and Chicago when their championship
windows closed. Finalists in 1992, the Blazers are participating in
their league-high 17th-consecutive postseason.
</P>
<P>
   But in the NBA, being mediocre is worse than being bad, and the
Blazers spent most of the '90s in purgatory: too good for the
lottery, not good enough to survive the first round. They went
seven years without home-court advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The climb began in 1994, when owner Paul Allen hired Whitsitt to
design the renovation. Whitsitt had spent the previous eight
seasons building Seattle into a championship contender, and he
immediately deployed the same strategy in Portland: acquire as much
talent, and as many interchangeable parts, as the salary cap
allowed.
</P>
<P>
   If necessary, sacrifice need for talent, personality for
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite not drafting higher than 17th, Whitsitt began acquiring
talent. He signed Anthony, Grant and Jackson as free agents. He
traded for Augmon, Rider, Stoudamire, Wallace, Williams, Carlos
Rogers and Bonzi Wells.
</P>
<P>
   The happy locker room comes not from individual leaders but from
the collective predicament: They have no choice.
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt rescued Jackson from Golden State, his fourth team in
three years. He plucked Wallace from his referee-baiting days in
Washington and he snatched Augmon from Doug Collins' doghouse in
Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony had a reputation as a shoot-first point guard when
Whitsitt grabbed him off free agency. Rider was Rider when Whitsitt
scooped him out of Minnesota. In 1998, Whitsitt saved Stoudamire
and Williams from their expansion misery in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   If they falter again, if Whitsitt deems them unfit for his
experiment, they may not get another chance _ and certainly not for
a title contender. It's enforced harmony, but it's better than no
harmony at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about collecting the chips,'' Warkentien said. ``The
nature of the leadership is very aggressive. Bob and Mr. Allen
understand risk and reward. They prefer the aggressive move to the
safe one. Bob likes guys who need to win to save their careers.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitsitt's staff moves have been equally astute. In 1994, he
hired Warkentien, a superb talent evaluator who helped collect the
chips in Seattle. In October, Whitsitt promoted Warkentien to
assistant GM and spent $800,000 on highly-regarded assistant Tim
Grgurich.
</P>
<P>
   (Grgurich and Warkentien were assistants together under Jerry
Tarkantian at Nevada-Las Vegas. They recruited and developed the
legendary Runnin' Rebels teams of the early '90s _ teams that
included Anthony and Augmon.)
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy arrived in 1997, after five disappointing seasons in
Milwaukee. With his reputation at stake _ Whitsitt likes desperate
coaches, too _ Dunleavy has massaged the insolence, convincing the
Blazers that ego subversion is the fastest path to success. During
his Milwaukee experience, Dunleavy evidently kept one eye on
Chicago coach Phil Jackson, whose ego management became the
paradigm.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of what we do off the court, Dunleavy tries to be
professional on it,'' Anthony said. ``He hasn't let any external
factors affect what we do on the court. He's a lot like Tark. He
treats us like men. He allows us to be individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy's approach and Whitsitt's presence have not eradicated
the tumult. Anthony got into a shouting match with Jazz owner Larry
Miller during a regular-season game in Utah. Rider has argued with
Dunleavy about playing time. Stoudamire loathes sharing
fourth-quarter minutes with Anthony, and the mercurial Wallace
reportedly practiced in Timberland boots one day.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, Dunleavy has doused every flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys have everybody, their friends, their people,
chipping away at them when their minutes aren't big,'' Dunleavy
said. ``I've told them they have to be above it. We've had some
bumps, but so far they've been little bumps.''

WELTON FRUSTRATES GALAXY COACHES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ At the end of practice Wednesday, Los Angeles
Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid and assistant Ralph Perez pulled Welton
aside as the other players left the field.
</P>
<P>
   Schmid wouldn't reveal the content of that conversation, but it
was clear that he's not happy with his Brazilian striker, who
hasn't scored this season.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Welton was among the MLS leaders in points, notching
17 goals and 14 assists. Many of his goals, however, weren't the
result of dazzling finishes. They were more of the opportunistic
variety, a result of being in the right place at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   Welton's rhythm, flow and finishing was missing in action during
the Galaxy's 1-0 victory over New England last Saturday, forcing
Schmid to pull him from the game.
</P>
<P>
   And it appears Schmid may bench Welton again in favor of New
Zealand midfielder Simon Elliott when the Galaxy (5-5) visits
Columbus (6-3) this afternoon at 4:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had an injury earlier this year that may have set him back,
but he's healthy now,'' Schmid said of Welton. ``He's starting to
work harder at training but it seems his timing is off.''
</P>
<P>
   The other problem with Welton is understanding his body
language. Former Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano had problems with
him last season, especially when he disciplined the 24-year-old
from Rio de Janeiro.
</P>
<P>
   Welton may be going through the same pouting phase with Schmid,
but as long as he doesn't produce, he isn't going to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Ralph and I) have talked to him about what is it that will
motivate him,'' Schmid said. ``No player likes to sit on the bench
for motivation, but sometimes that becomes the motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   It may just be that Welton's lackluster play is the result of
the Galaxy trying to trade him. Schmid noted that other MLS teams
have expressed interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami has expressed (interest) in Welton,'' Schmid said. ``We
haven't had direct contact with Miami, but we have been looking at
ways to improve our team.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles may see a glimpse of its future when it enters the
new, 22,500-seat Columbus Crew Stadium -- the first soccer-only
venue in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Columbus is 2-0 in its new stadium, built primarily to
strengthen its season-ticket base and provide fans with a
European-type soccer environment.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy officials have hinted that if the team leaves the Rose
Bowl, they would build a new stadium. Schmid is hoping that the
excitement of playing in a hostile environment will motivate his
team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think our players will get pumped because it's a new
field,'' he said. ``I think it's going to be a good situation. If
we win, it makes it a big thing for us to beat a sound Columbus
team on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   A win would mark Los Angeles' second consecutive victory and
could be the first sign that the Galaxy is turning the corner. And
Mexican standout Carlos Hermosillo should be training with the team
late next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any win is nice at this point, but a good result would give
this team a great feeling going home for two games at the Rose
Bowl,'' Schmid said.

U.S. SOCCER MUST LOWER ITS SIGHTS TO SUCCEED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On television from Barcelona, Spain, this week, we
saw how good soccer can be. On television from Columbus, Ohio,
today, we'll see how good American soccer can be.
</P>
<P>
   The difference is as wide as the Atlantic Ocean _ give or take
an English Channel.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's game in Barcelona, matching Manchester United and
Bayern Munich for the European Champions Cup, featured one of
sports' all-time miracle finishes, in an atmosphere thick with the
kind of historical context that only the international sport can
produce.
</P>
<P>
   Manchester United trailed 1-0 after 90 minutes, was not merely
on the ropes but flat on the canvas, before a pair of substitutes
scored during the three minutes of injury time, giving the English
club a 2-1 victory and its third championship of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Even the riot police on the sidelines might have cracked a
smile, if they'd been free to turn around and watch. A London
headline writer called it ``The greatest 2 minutes in the history
of sport,'' and even a John Elway fan might concede that argument.
</P>
<P>
   On its most technical level the game was a lesson to the
American wise guys who miss the dramatic possibilities in a 1-0
game. If Man United had trailed 4-3 and scored precisely the same
tying and winning goals at exactly the same desperate juncture, it
would have merely been dramatic.
</P>
<P>
   As it happened, it was a case of utter frustration turning to
boundless joy _ or, as an English tabloid would describe it the
next day, ``football's equivalent of turning water into wine.'' A
French paper cited a still-higher power: ``God is English.''
</P>
<P>
   It was more than merely the biggest soccer match that will be
played in this non-World Cup year: It marked England's first
Champions League title since the nation's teams were banned for
five years following the 1985 hooligan riots in Brussels. It
stirred elder Man United fans' memories of the 1958 Munich air
crash that killed eight players. It evoked the best and worst of
the World War II emotions dredged up by any England-Germany
contest.
</P>
<P>
   Our isolationist American souls might find such emotions hard to
embrace, even ghastly. We've got the U.S. ``Miracle on Ice''
Olympic hockey victory over the hated Soviet Union, and otherwise
the notion that sports can represent something greater than
themselves is too much for us to grasp.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why we'll never enjoy soccer quite the way the rest of
the world does.
</P>
<P>
   So how good can soccer get in this country, as we view it from
the crossroads at the end of the 1990s, the third consecutive
decade of which it was to be the sport?
</P>
<P>
   It can get as good as tonight's game between Major League
Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy and Columbus Crew in the 22,500-seat
stadium that opened last weekend as the league's lone soccer-only
facility.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-two thousand might not sound like much, but if you've
attended a Galaxy home game, wracked by agoraphobia in a virtually
empty Rose Bowl, you know why the MLS needs more of the atmosphere
that cozy soccer-specific stadiums can provide.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the day is far off when 22,000 will turn out to be too
small, and it's more likely that day will never arrive. For
American soccer, smaller will be smarter, and the sooner it lowers
its sights the better.
</P>
<P>
   As far as the sport's popularity goes, the signals are decidedly
mixed these days.
</P>
<P>
   MLS is reporting a 12-percent rise in season-ticket sales but
only a half percent increase in overall attendance, leaving the
league in range of its third overall decline in as many
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   This was to be the league's breakout summer, too, without a
World Cup or Olympics to siphon off players or interest.
</P>
<P>
   But with the quality of play showing no sign of general
improvement ... with the MLS office stubbornly refusing to dump the
unpopular tiebreaking shootouts that have decided more than 40
percent of games... and with stadium-availability conflicts forcing
the league to stretch out a seven-month schedule over parts of all
four seasons ... even an optimist can find reason to fear for the
league's future.
</P>
<P>
   But on a positive note, officials of the Women's World Cup,
which will open three weeks from today in New Jersey's Giants
Stadium, are reporting that ticket sales continue to run ahead of
projections, with more than 42,000 purchased already for the July
10 final at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Can it be the sport of the '00s? (Wise guys, feel free to recast
that as ``the sport of the 0-0s.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a great decade,'' Women's World Cup president Marla
Messing said this week, citing the 1996 birth of the MLS, the
success of the 1994 World Cup in the United States and the rising
profile of the men's and women's national teams. ``But we still
have a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona, and the kind of excitement we saw this week, is an
unrealistic destination as U.S. soccer seeks its place in the
world. Columbus is the way to go.

REVISED RULES ADVANCE FOR AIR-CRASH COMPENSATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world's airlines moved a giant step closer on Friday to
providing better protection and compensation to victims of
international air accidents, with an agreement that would replace a
system in place since 1929 _ two years after Lindbergh made the
first solo nonstop trans-Atlantic flight.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Montreal, members of the International Civil Aviation
Organization developed new rules calling for unlimited liability
when a carrier is found at fault in case of death or injury to
passengers on international flights and allowing victims to claim
damages up to $135,000 regardless of whether the carrier is at
fault.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the new rules permit damage claims resulting from a
passenger death or injury to be filed in the country where the
victim lived and call upon the airlines to provide immediate
financial assistance to victims' relatives, deducted later from the
final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   When ratified, as expected, by at least 30 of the organization's
185 member states, the rules would probably be effective no later
than 2001, replacing the 70-year-old Warsaw Convention, which set a
limit of about $8,300 for death or injury.
</P>
<P>
   Long a matter of contention in the United States, the Warsaw
Convention has endured because airlines from poorer nations, their
governments, and airplane manufacturers from developed nations
blocked repeated attempts to change it.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, the Air Transport Association and the International
Air Transport Association teamed to develop a consensus among major
airlines to raise the limit.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese airlines were among the first to raise the limit, and
many other foreign carriers became concerned that by holding out
they might lose business.
</P>
<P>
   So not only did they lessen their resistance to the proposed
changes but by 1996 more than 50 had signed a statement of intent
to adopt them eventually. In 1997, 12 U.S. carriers voluntarily
waived the $75,000 liability limit, paving the way for Friday's
agreement.

ACCOUNTING FIRM IS NAMED IN MEDICARE FRAUD LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By KURT EICHENWALD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   KPMG Peat Marwick, the giant international accounting firm, was
accused in a federal whistle-blower lawsuit unsealed Friday of
aiding some hospitals in Florida in a scheme to defraud Medicare
through the use of bogus expense claims.
</P>
<P>
   The suit, filed under seal last year, was publicly disclosed by
court order after a discussion of its contentions on Thursday
during a criminal trial of hospital executives who the government
says participated in the scheme. Though such whistle-blower suits
are usually unsealed only after federal prosecutors decide whether
to join them, the relationship with the other case led to its
disclosure before the government had made such a decision.
</P>
<P>
   The suit is an outgrowth of the multiyear criminal investigation
of Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corp. Federal investigators have said in
court records that they believe Columbia engaged in a
corporate-wide scheme to defraud the government by misrepresenting
certain of its hospitals' expenses in order to receive
reimbursement from Medicare and other health programs.
</P>
<P>
   The whistle-blower suit unsealed Friday contends that KPMG Peat
Marwick played a prime role in that scheme, by assisting certain
Florida hospitals owned by Columbia in setting up secret reserves,
which were maintained in the event that government auditors
discovered the deception and demanded money back.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the workings of a complex, little-understood part
of modern hospitals known as the federal cost-reporting system,
under which the government has paid billions of dollars to
hospitals and other health care providers over the years, including
hundreds of millions of dollars in payments each year to
Columbia/HCA alone.
</P>
<P>
   Through the system, some costs associated with patient care are
reimbursed by programs like Medicare at different rates. But the
government contends in the suit that KPMG Peat Marwick aided
Columbia in intentionally misrepresenting costs to increase the
reimbursement rate or receive payment for costs that were not
eligible for reimbursement.
</P>
<P>
   George Ledwith, a spokesman for KPMG Peat Marwick, said the
accounting firm ``believes it acted appropriately and in a
professional manner regarding that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the government's critical evidence in the cost-reporting
cases comes from secret, second sets of cost reports and work
sheets maintained at the hospitals that contained significantly
lower expenses than those in reports submitted to the government.
In this case, those records were reviewed, and in some cases
compiled, by KPMG.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in 1993, auditors from KPMG found a discrepancy in
a cost report filed by a Columbia hospital, Kissimmee Memorial
Hospital in Kissimmee, Fla. The hospital had classified $81,000 of
interest expense as ``old capital'' _ meaning it involved a project
before 1990. In truth, as KPMG discovered, more than one-third of
the cost was for ``new capital,'' which is reimbursed at a lower
rate.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter obtained by The New York Times in 1997, KPMG did not
suggest correcting the number. The firm advised Kissimmee to
include the expenses in a reserve fund on the chance that Medicare
would select the hospital as one of the few that receive extensive
audits each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the reserve cost report,'' KPMG wrote of the expense, ``we
will reflect $33,054 as new capital costs as identified by the
hospital.''
</P>
<P>
   The Kissimmee hospital is one of the institutions cited in the
lawsuit as having been aided in an illegal scheme by KPMG. The
other hospitals include Southwest Florida Regional Medical Center
and Gulf Coast Hospital, both in Fort Myers, and Fawcett Memorial
Hospital in Port Charlotte. The criminal trial of four Columbia
executives now taking place in Tampa, Fla., involves cost-reporting
procedures from Fawcett.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was brought by John Schilling, who had worked on
reimbursement issues for Columbia/HCA, both as an employee from
1993 through 1995 and later as a consultant to the company. The
case was brought under the False Claims Act, which allows
whistle-blowers to file suit on behalf of the government. If
federal prosecutors choose not to join a given suit, the
whistle-blower, who stands to receive a large part of any judgment
or settlement, can still take the suit to trial.

FRANK GUNTHER, 91, DEVISER OF TWO-WAY RADIOS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., N.J.)  (lb) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Frank A. Gunther, a radio pioneer who helped create shortwave,
two-way and FM systems, died on Monday at Bon Securos Hospital in
Venice, Fla. He was 91 and lived in New York and Nokomis, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther often worked with the military, as well as with police
and fire departments, devising some of the first radio
communications devices. In 1932, for example, he built for the
police department in Bayonne, N.J., what is believed to be the
first two-way mobile police radio system.
</P>
<P>
   In 1928, Gunther also installed one of the first one-way radios
used on an aircraft, and in 1931 he took part in the first public
broadcast from an aircraft. A year later he installed the first
two-way radio system on an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther was born on February 3, 1908, in New York. He attended
Wagner College and Columbia University. In 1925, he joined REL
Radio Engineering Laboratories, based in New York, and helped
construct and operate an experimental station that was one of the
first shortwave broadcasting systems.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, Gunther, along with Edwin Armstrong, gave the first
public demonstration of frequency modulation, or FM transmission, a
signal far superior in clarity to AM or shortwave. The next year,
he designed and manufactured the early transmitter components for
FM radio, and from 1939 to 1942, he designed and built more than 25
FM stations nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, Gunther demonstrated the first FM mobile transmitter to
the U.S. military, and during World War II, in which he served as a
major in the Army Air Force, he began designing the first Loran
navigational systems for the U.S. Coast Guard.
</P>
<P>
   Gunther, who was also a commercial pilot, became president of
REL in 1960 and retired in 1982. Most recently, he worked as a
consultant with his son, Robert, president of Highpoint
Development, a developer of wireless communication towers, in New
York.
</P>
<P>
   He was a former president of the Radio Club of America, which
established the Frank A. Gunther Award in 1996. The award is given
annually to people who make major contributions to the advancement
of wireless military electronic communications systems. In 1992, he
was featured in a Public Broadcasting Service documentary, ``Empire
of the Air: The Men Who Made Radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Gunther's wife, Lillian Madden, died in 1997. In addition to his
son Robert of Shrewsbury, N.J., he is survived by a son Frank M.,
of New York; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and five
step-grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: AN AIRPORT LINK WITH POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Saturday, May 29:
</P>
<P>
   Although the trip from midtown Manhattan to Kennedy Airport by
car or taxi is supposed to average 61 minutes, savvy travelers set
aside as much as 90 minutes to compensate for congestion and other
unforeseen difficulties. There is not much the New York City
Council can do about road delays. But it can at least give harried
travelers a fail-safe alternative by endorsing AirTrain, the Port
Authority's proposed rail link to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Since the 1960s, community opposition, multibillion-dollar price
tags and other forces have derailed every effort to build a system
that would allow travelers to board a train in Manhattan and ride
directly to Kennedy or La Guardia _ a ``one-seat'' ride like those
in London, Paris and other major cities. Set against that standard,
AirTrain is a rather modest proposal. It would involve taking two
trains, thus creating a two-seat, 45-minute ride. Travelers would
take the Long Island Rail Road or one of several subway lines to
Jamaica, Queens, where they would switch to AirTrain for the ride
to Kennedy's terminals.
</P>
<P>
   In the near term, AirTrain would offer a reliable alternative to
the uncertainties of negotiating the Van Wyck Expressway and other
congested highways. But AirTrain's most attractive feature is its
convertibility. The 3.1-mile light-rail line between Jamaica and
Kennedy could easily become the final leg of a one-seat rail link
that could be up and running by 2010, provided the Metropolitan
Transportation Authority agrees to build the segment from Manhattan
to Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   By August, the MTA will choose between a Long Island Rail Road
line or a subway line to connect Manhattan to the AirTrain in
Jamaica. Under an agreement signed by Gov. George Pataki, Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, the Port Authority and the MTA last July,
AirTrain's light-rail line must be strong enough to support
whatever heavy-rail option the MTA selects. It must also have
compatible railroad gauges, electrical current and platforms. The
Council's hearings next Tuesday should be an ideal forum for
reviewing these issues.
</P>
<P>
   As the City Council reviews AirTrain, it should avoid being
sideswiped by special interests. For example, much of the funding
for AirTrain would come from passenger facility charges levied at
the airports. But the Air Transport Association, which represents
major airlines, generally opposes the use of revenue from the
passenger facility charge for train-to-the-plane projects and other
off-airport uses. The association's real fear is that the use of
such revenues in New York could set a precedent for other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Barring the discovery of a fatal flaw in the project or the
emergence of a better one, AirTrain should proceed. The City
Council's larger mission should be to ensure that AirTrain becomes
a down payment on the one-seat ride the New York region deserves.

EDITORIAL: TOWARD NURSING HOME REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 29:
</P>
<P>
   In California, a struggle is playing out over nursing home
reform. Embarrassed by hearings in Congress about needless deaths
in California nursing homes, and spurred by Kevin Shelley, the new
Democratic majority leader of the state Assembly, who started
looking at nursing homes when his mother had a stroke, the
legislature is now wrestling with the most comprehensive attempt to
improve care in a decade and a half.
</P>
<P>
   Other states should pay attention. The debate is about the most
basic problems in the field, and the forces in play in California
are the ones that shape the issue in the nation at large. The
state's population is aging. Nursing homes are big business. They
are also expensive, and about two-thirds of the residents in them,
their own assets exhausted, are paid for by tax dollars through
Medicaid. It is the aides at the bottom of the pay scale, averaging
only $7 an hour, who bathe, change, feed and attend to those
residents. The care given depends on the number of those aides,
their attitude and training.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 alone, according to an activist lawyer, more than 3,000
people died as a result of unacceptable care in California nursing
homes. A subsequent federal study of a sampling of those cases
found that in half, the charges might have been true. When the
Senate Special Committee on Aging aired the study in hearings this
spring, it stirred anger in California, and efforts at reform. The
state Legislature, virtually all of whose members get campaign
contributions from the nursing home industry, soon faced a
coalition of senior citizens' organizations led by the American
Association of Retired People, with 2.8 million members in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Shelley's bill would appropriate an additional $35 million in
state general funds for nursing homes, and direct that the money be
spent on wages, an increase of perhaps 15 percent for the nurses'
aides. It would also mandate additional training for them. It would
allow the state to send in a professional manager to shape up homes
that seem to threaten the welfare of their residents _ something
Michigan has begun to do. It would raise civil fines for causing
the death of a resident from a maximum of $25,000 to $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   A nursing home trade group, the California Association of Health
Facilities, opposes some of these provisions as violating its
members' rights to operate their own businesses. But with political
pressure building, and new criminal grand jury indictments this
week against a nursing home chain for severely neglecting its
residents in San Jose and Los Gatos, reform in California seems to
have an even chance of passage this year.

TWO WOMEN IN BABY-SELLING CASE WERE KNOWN BY AUTHORITIES FOR
DECADE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ariz., Fla.)   (See also: MEXICO-BABY-SELLING)  
(rk) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ State regulators knew as early as a decade
ago that two Long Island women were placing foreign-born children
with adoptive parents in New York, even though they lacked the
permits to do so.
</P>
<P>
   But the women appear to have hit upon an easy way of avoiding
trouble, according to government officials and court filings: Over
and over again, they simply went out of business, then reopened
under a new name.
</P>
<P>
   But the two women, who were charged on Thursday with smuggling
at least 17 Mexican infants into the United States with promises of
easy and legal adoptions, and selling them to unwitting adoptive
parents for up to $22,000, also may have benefited from lax
enforcement, officials suggested Friday.
</P>
<P>
   In May 1995, state regulators who had discovered that the women
were back in business again referred their findings to the attorney
general's office for civil prosecution. But they never heard back.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, after new complaints against the women,
Arlene Lieberman and Arlene Reingold, appeared in The New York
Post, state Attorney General Dennis Vacco's office finally began an
investigation, according to a spokesman for Eliot Spitzer, who
succeeded Vacco in January.
</P>
<P>
   And last fall, after Mexican authorities arrested a woman they
said was involved in a baby-trafficking ring along the Arizona
border with the Mexican state of Sonora, the Immigration and
Naturalization Service began its own inquiry into the activities of
a prominent border lawyer who was believed to be arranging the
children's entry into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the lawyer, Mario Manuel Reyes Burgueno, and the
two Suffolk County women were arrested and charged with conspiring
to violate various immigration laws and to commit mail and wire
fraud. They face maximum prison sentences of up to 10 years for
each child smuggled into the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Spitzer's office filed a civil lawsuit seeking to
permanently bar the women, their company and their husbands, who
escorted many of the babies from the border to New York, from the
adoption business.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lieberman and Ms. Reingold _ known to friends, clients and
law enforcement agents alike as ``the Arlenes'' _ first came to the
attention of the New York state Department of Social Services
sometime in 1989, according to an official at the department, since
renamed the Office of Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   According to a federal affidavit released on Thursday, the women
set up a nonprofit company, Stork International, ostensibly only to
provide information and counseling to would-be adoptive parents.
But the state official said reports began trickling in that Stork
International was doing much more _ placing children in exchange
for cash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We met with these people, and informed them that they could
not place out children and charge fees without a license,'' the
state social services department official said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he said, his office had received complaints about a
lawyer in Miami to whom the women had referred a number of couples,
who promised to obtain children for them from Central and South
America. The New York regulators contacted Florida officials, who
eventually suspended the lawyer's license.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1992, according to the court filings, Ms.
Lieberman and Ms. Reingold resigned from Stork and set up a new
company, Adoption Choice Inc. They were apparently a step ahead of
the state regulators. In 1993, the Department of Social Services
ordered Stork International to stop placing children, and referred
the matter to the Suffolk County district attorney's office. The
company agreed to a settlement, and later that year, the official
said, Stork was dissolved.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the official said, the Department of Social
Services learned about Adoption Choice. ``They came to us with an
application for an adoption license,'' the official said. ``While
we're looking at their application, we get information that they're
placing children.'' Agency workers found advertisements to that
effect in phone books and pennysavers.
</P>
<P>
   Another employee called Adoption Choice posing as a parent. In
early 1995, the official said, the department denied the company's
application. And on May 24, 1995, the department sent a letter to
the attorney general's office requesting civil enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I know,'' the official said Friday, ``they didn't
file any papers. We never heard anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The official said the attorney general's office may simply have
decided that enforcement action was unnecessary. ``What happened
around then was that Adoption Choice just went away,'' he said.
``Our primary concern as a state supervisory agency was to get them
to stop. They did.'' The attorney general's office may have made
the same calculation, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Spitzer, Paul W. Larrabee, said Friday he was
unable to determine why the office had not acted in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron Britvan, chairman of the adoption committee of the New
York state Bar Association, said state officials have generally
shown little interest in tough enforcement of adoption laws, or in
strengthening the laws themselves. ``They do not act,'' he said.
``They react. Something has to happen for them to become active.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Britvan, who is representing the adoptive parents of six of the
17 smuggled Mexican children, noted that it was not until March,
when Nassau police charged a Hungarian mother and an associate with
trying to sell her baby for $60,000, that ranking state legislators
in both houses proposed bills that would make the first such an
offense a felony instead of a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Few couples who are involved in illegal adoption schemes come
forward, often out of fear of prosecution or fear that they would
lose their children. And Friday, several of the parents who adopted
children with the help of Ms. Reingold and Ms. Lieberman declined
to discuss their experience.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacqueline Falick, a Brooklyn woman who last year complained
to the attorney general's office about her experience with Ms.
Reingold and Ms. Lieberman, agreed to an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Falick said she and her husband, Irwin, paid about $11,000
to the Long Island women, a Miami lawyer and others to obtain a
baby for adoption, but never received a child. ``I believed them,''
said Mrs. Falick, whose experience with the two women was the
subject of several articles last year in the New York Post. ``It's
very hard when you meet these two individuals to think you can't
believe them. It's just not obvious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you want something so bad,'' she said, ``you don't want
to see the bad angles, and you keep hoping it's going to turn good.
And these people kept me hoping and hanging on.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Robert Fred Mozley, professor emeritus of physics at Stanford
University and an expert on nuclear arms control, died last Monday
at Stanford Hospital. He was 82 and lived in Menlo Park, Calif.,
and Southport Island, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was complications from surgery, the university said.
</P>
<P>
   Mozley worked at the Stanford Linear Accelerator, where he did
research in high-energy physics on a particle-tracking device he
pioneered. The device, a streamer chamber, allows physicists to
study subatomic events.
</P>
<P>
   Mozley, who was born in Boston and graduated from Harvard
University in 1938, worked on radar technology at Sperry Gyroscope
Co. in World War II. He received a doctorate at the University of
California at Berkeley in 1950 and took part in the construction of
the world's first proton linear accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   After teaching and doing research at Princeton University, he
joined the Stanford faculty in 1953, became a full professor in
1962 and retired in 1987. As a member of the faculty senate, he was
among the first to sound the alarm over increasing academic
reliance on Pentagon grants and official efforts to designate
unclassified research as secret.
</P>
<P>
   In retirement he worked on arms-control issues and nuclear
nonproliferation as a staff physicist for the Federation of
American Scientists and contributed to several publications and a
book, ``Reversing the Arms Race.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the author of two books, ``Uranium Enrichment and Other
Technical Problems Relating to Nuclear Weapons Proliferation''
(Center for International Security and Arms Control, at Stanford,
1994) and ``Politics and Technology of Nuclear Proliferation''
(University of Washington, 1998).
</P>
<P>
   Mozley is survived by his wife, Anita Ventura Mozley; his son,
Peter, of Socorro, N.M.; a sister, Dorothy Mozley of Orange City,
Calif.; and two grandchildren.

   Sara Holmes Boutelle, an architectural historian who
rediscovered Julia Morgan, one of the first female architects to

in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 90.
</P>
<P>
   Until Ms. Boutelle published ``Julia Morgan, Architect'' (1988),
little was known about Morgan (1872-1957) beyond the fact that she
had designed William Randolph Hearst's spectacular California
castle, San Simeon.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle's biography, which traced Morgan's career from the
turn of the century to the late 1950s, revealed that she designed
nearly 800 buildings, a legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright,
her contemporary. Her accomplishment was remarkable also at a time
when women were rarely able to enter the profession.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Searing, a professor of art at Smith College who knew Ms.
Boutelle, said her revelations about Julia Morgan were
``indispensable because before that she was virtually unknown to
all but a handful of architectural historians.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sara Boutelle was not a feminist by today's standards and not
strident at all,'' said Ms. Searing, ``but she put the spotlight on
women in architecture, especially on Julia Morgan.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle, who taught art and architecture at the Brearley
School in New York, became fascinated with Morgan when she visited
San Simeon in 1972 and learned that its architect was a woman she
had never heard of. When Ms. Boutelle retired from Brearley the
next year, she moved to Northern California and began to study the
building.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and
destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death. She
began reconstructing Morgan's designs from the scattered records of
former clients. In 1988 Ms. Boutelle finally published her 271-page
biography, an oversize book with photographs and drawings.
</P>
<P>
   Among the buildings designed by Morgan that Ms. Boutelle was
able to document were the Hearst estate, Wyntoon, in Northern
California; the Asilomar YWCA conference center in Monterey,
Calif.; and, in Berkeley, Calif., the Women's City Club, St. John's
Presbyterian Church and the Hearst Memorial Gymnasium.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle found that Morgan also designed schools, theaters,
churches, stores, hospitals, houses, apartments, a bowling alley,
billiard rooms, a zoo, a pet cemetery and a hay barn. She said
Morgan had ``a special knack'' for swimming pools, using color,
light and shape to create ``sumptuous designs that flaunted a
hedonism startling for so modest an architect.''
</P>
<P>
   Reviews were favorable. Writing in The New York Times Book
Review, Paul Goldberger said the book covered Morgan's career
``with sympathy and intelligence.'' Diana Ketcham, writing for The
Nation, called it ``an exemplary work.''
</P>
<P>
   Publication of the Morgan biography, which won the California
Book Award Silver Medal in 1989, led Ms. Boutelle to embark on a
new career as a lecturer and preservationist of historic
architecture. For these activities, she was made an honorary member
of the American Institute of Architects in 1991, the highest award
the organization gives to someone who is not an architect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle was educated at Mount Holyoke College, the Sorbonne
and Hamburg University.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Boutelle is survived by three sons, Christopher, of Los
Angeles, William, of West Chesterfield, Mass., and Jonathan of
Santa Cruz; a sister, Mary Holmes of Santa Cruz, and six
grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: RESETTLEMENT ON THE YANGTZE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Saturday, May 29:
</P>
<P>
   There are new signs that China's top leaders are facing up to
the destructive reality of the Three Gorges Dam. This month Prime
Minister Zhu Rongji made a highly publicized speech about the
difficulty of resettling 1.3 million people whose towns and
farmlands will be inundated by the dam's 400-mile-long reservoir.
The project is plagued with engineering and cost problems, but
resettlement issues have been the most difficult to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the project have argued that resettlement on this
scale is impossible. Not only are flooded communities destroyed,
but cities and towns that are forced to absorb the migrants would
face economic and social upheaval. More than 150,000 people have
already been uprooted, but many remain jobless and landless. An
additional 550,000 have to be moved over the next four years alone.
Chinese officials have long said that the people and factories
would simply be moved up the surrounding hillsides above the
Yangtze River. Zhu now seems to admit that is unrealistic. Instead
he proposes to send the displaced to other regions.
</P>
<P>
   But resettlement of large numbers of people far from their
native homes has been disastrous in the past. Many eventually
drifted back to their home regions. Others lived for years as
impoverished refugees. The only solution is to reduce the size of
the dam, or better yet, abandon it altogether.

ED PETERSON, 78, INVENTOR OF VEHICLE ALARM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Idaho, Wash.)  (mk) 
 By NICK RAVO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ed Peterson, an automotive service and parts supplier who
invented an alarm system that beeps a warning when trucks and other
heavy machinery are backing up, died on Wednesday at his home in
Boise, Idaho. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was prostate cancer, his son, Mark, said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson and his brother Carl founded Peterson Rebuild and
Exchange Co., an auto parts supplier that is now known as Preco
Inc. and specializes in the manufacture and sale of electronics and
semiconductor equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Much of their business initially consisted of servicing and
replacing engines at construction sites in remote areas of the
Northwest. In the early 1960s, while visiting several dam sites, Ed
Peterson noticed accidents in which workers were killed or injured
by heavy equipment backing up on them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flagmen weren't working,'' Mark Peterson said. ``So my
father got together with some electronics engineers and developed
the alarm.''
</P>
<P>
   Peterson sold the first reverse warning system to Morrison
Knudsen, the engineering company based in Boise, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first to do it, and he patented it, although some
others were working on systems at the same time that had bells,''
Mark Peterson said.
</P>
<P>
   The company now sells about 1 million alarms, called the
Bac-A-Larm, annually and is the world's largest supplier of the
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Peterson tinkered with other products, like
collapsible luggage carriers, home security alarms and automotive
electrical devices.
</P>
<P>
   His only other patented product that had worldwide success like
the Bac-A-Larm was the Cordminder, a retractable telephone cord on
a ball that attaches to the receiver. Millions have been sold over
the years, his son said.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson was born on April 7, 1921, in Staten Island, N.Y., and
grew up mostly in Brockton, Mass. He served in the Army Air Corps
in World War II, piloting bombers over Europe and earning the Air
Medal and the Distinguished Flying Cross.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son and his brother, Peterson is survived by
two daughters, Ingrid Peterson of Seattle and Kristina Peterson of
Boise, and two granddaughters.

   South Africa: Man Accused of Threatening to Kill Mbeki
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old man was arrested and accused of threatening to
kill Deputy President Thabo Mbeki, who is expected to take over
from President Nelson Mandela when he retires after next week's
elections. A police spokesman said the arrested man had made five
telephone calls in a week to Mbeki's home and to a Cape Town office
of the governing African National Party. The spokesman said he
could not give any more details without ``jeopardizing'' the
investigation.

   South Africa: Botha Appeals Sentence
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for former President P.W. Botha called his sentence for
refusing to testify before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission
``shockingly inappropriate'' as they began his appeal before the
Cape Town High Court. Botha, 83, was convicted of contempt last
year and sentenced to pay about $1,600 or spend a year in jail.

   Makhaya Ntini, the first black African player on the national

the courtroom booed as the sentence was translated into Xhosa and
followed Ntini out singing and dancing when he was freed pending
appeal. His conviction is a setback for cricket, which is trying to
get black Africans, who comprise 77 percent of the population, to
play the game.

GEORGE PERAZICH, 94, WHO LED RELIEF CAMPAIGN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill.)  (lb) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   George Nikolas Perazich, a retired engineer and industrial
economist who directed the United Nations' relief efforts in
Yugoslavia after World War II, died on Wednesday at the Hospice of
Washington. He was 94 and lived in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In a career spanning nearly 50 years in the United States and
abroad, Perazich served as a consultant on a wide variety of
subjects, like urban renewal, the applications of nuclear power and
the development of ocean resources.
</P>
<P>
   Perazich was born in Montenegro and attended the Yugoslav naval
academy before coming to the United States in 1927.
</P>
<P>
   He graduated in engineering from the University of California at
Berkeley in 1931 and then worked at Berkeley as an economic
research assistant, concentrating on statistics. In 1935 he joined
the Works Progress Administration as an economist and engineer,
also working for the National Bureau of Economic Research.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency in 1944 and until
1947 served as director of industrial rehabilitation in Yugoslavia.
He then taught at the University of Chicago and researched
industrial uses of energy and the economic viability of atomic
power generation.
</P>
<P>
   In later years he was a consultant for the National Science
Foundation, the World Bank and several governments, including those
of Algeria, Mexico and New Zealand. Until the late 1970s he was a
partner and an associate of an economic consulting firm in
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Perazich is survived by his wife of 66 years, Amelia; two sons,
John and Michael, both of Washington, and three grandchildren.

EDITORIAL: AT THE HIVE'S ENTRANCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On April 28, the postmaster called. A package for me had come
from Claxton, Ga. _ 4 pounds of bees in a wooden crate.
</P>
<P>
   Late that afternoon, at home, I removed from the crate a small
cage just large enough to hold the queen bee and a few attendants.
I set the queen-cage in a wooden box called a deep super, the base
of a new hive. Then I shook the rest of the bees into the hive and
drove them down into the super with a few puffs of smoke. A wooden
feeder went on top, filled with sugar-water, and then the cover.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the shadbush has bloomed and so have the elderberry
and the crab apple. The leaves on the trees have nearly all
emerged, except for the honey locust, which is always late. I'm
late too, still digging garden beds in a patch of soil near the new
hive, which sits beside the hive I started last year.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a day I take a seat nearby and watch the bees. To
the old hive, workers come steadily, profusely, their legs clubbed
with pollen. That hive contains comb the bees built last summer,
ready now to be filled with eggs, pollen, nectar and honey.
</P>
<P>
   But when the new bees settled into their hive in late April, all
they found was 10 framed sheets of plastic, each embossed with a
honeycomb pattern. The workers had to release their foreign queen
from her cage by eating through a candy plug blocking the entrance,
a delay that would give them time to adopt her. Some workers began
building honeycomb for a bee nursery and larder. Others made
foraging flights and repeated trips through the hive to the feeder
above them.
</P>
<P>
   One warm afternoon recently, I opened the new hive. A little
smoke, and the bees scurried down into the frames. The queen-cage
was empty. From the middle of the hive I lifted a frame covered
with fresh comb, and in the uncapped cells saw eggs and coiled
larvae. The queen was laying steadily.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the brood cells, where pupae awaited their final
transformation into workers, had been capped, turning the wax a
soft, rich yellow. In the corners, comb was filled with honey,
capped in pure white. There were four such frames, and wax cells
were already being raised across a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   The abruptness of spring, its riotous biological opportunism, is
always surprising. One day there is bare earth, and the next day
the asparagus is 4 feet tall. But there is no surprise quite like
that of new comb, new brood, in a new hive. Every form replicates
itself in this season _ every leaf coming true to ancient pattern _
but that replication is nowhere as pure as it is in a hive. The
comb is perfect geometry, a field of hexagons raised with
unimaginable cunning, and the hive is perfect prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   The scent of new beeswax drifts downwind to where I sit. Bees
plummet onto the entrance board, overweighted with pollen,
overburdened with spring.

<P>
   Donald Sur, a composer and musicologist, died on Monday at Beth
Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. He was 64.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, his family said.
</P>
<P>
   Sur's best-known work was ``The Slavery Documents,'' an oratorio
commissioned by the Canata Singers of Cambridge, Mass. The work,
which was given its premiere at Symphony Hall in Boston in 1990,
incorporated spirituals and folk songs as well as excerpts from the
Bible and other writings.
</P>
<P>
   Sur was born in Honolulu and moved to Los Angeles after World
War II. He later earned graduate degrees at Princeton and Harvard
and studied composition with Rogers Sessions and Earl Kim. After
moving to the Boston area about 30 years ago, he taught at Harvard,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Tufts, Wellesley and
Boston University.
</P>
<P>
   His compositions also include ``New Yorker Sketches,'' ``Catena
III,'' ``Kumdori Tansaeng,'' a work for violin, chorus and
orchestra, and Berceuse for Violin and Piano, which had its
premiere at the Library of Congress in February.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by a son, Matthew, of Boston; two half-brothers,
John Kim of Honolulu and Laurence Kim of New York, and his mother,
B.D. Sur of Somerville, Mass.

PACERS TUNE UP IN A KNICKS-FREE ZONE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The standing ovation began as soon as Reggie
Miller emerged from the tunnel, swaying his arms from side to side
like wheat blowing in a Midwest field. It grew as the team members
sprawled on the floor and stretched their ankles toward their
opposite knees.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at Market Square Arena roared during layup drills.
They sang along with a rap number that rhymed the various
basketball skills of Miller, Rik Smits, Mark Jackson and Pacer
after Pacer down the bench.
</P>
<P>
   The coach had his own number, of course. It had a country beat,
lyrics about a home-grown hero and an oft-repeated chorus that
everyone seemed to know: ``Larry Bird,'' shouted more than 12,316
people as they clapped their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The 5 p.m. scrimmage hadn't even started. But this is what they
call happy hour here in the heart of basketball country. For the
record, the Gold squad of backups beat the Blue squad of starters
by the score of 116-111. The exhibition was part rust remover, part
fan appreciation, as the Pacers got ready to play the Knicks in the
Eastern Conference finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in situations where we had eight or nine days off
and it's hard to get geared back up for the game,'' Bird said. ``We
wanted to make it as real as possible so the guys would be moving
out there. Believe me, it's hard to restart after you've been off a
long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird was worried that his team might be flat after registering
seven straight playoff victories over Milwaukee and Philadelphia,
followed by a week off. The coach had seen it happen to the Boston
Celtics in the 1981 playoffs. They eliminated Chicago in the
conference semifinals and had to wait 11 days for the finals. They
lost their first game against the Philadelphia 76ers and ended up
going seven games before finally winning the series.
</P>
<P>
   So the mascot, the Pacer dance team and two referees from the
Continental Basketball Association were brought in to give both
players and fans a lift.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the tip-off that the Pacers, a veteran team,
have adopted their coach's legendary competitiveness. Bird has
matched up his first and second teams before. During the
pre-season, the starters needed a last-second basket from Smits to
defeat the second unit.
</P>
<P>
   Before the scrimmage Friday, Jalen Rose, the Pacers' voluble
bench scorer, mixed caution with his trash talk, saying, ``I don't
think anyone wants to see us beat on each other.''
</P>
<P>
   But they did, to the delight of Bob and Sarah Johnson and their
boys, who were seeing the Pacers up close for the first time and in
style. The Johnsons arrived at Market Square Arena when the doors
opened at 3:30 p.m. to secure courtside seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole place is a Knicks-free zone,'' said Bob Johnson,
who wore a jersey with Smits' number on it. On the weekend of the
Indianapolis 500, there was neither a blue and orange jersey nor a
New York accent to be found in the arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We aren't even worried about them,'' 14-year-old Tim Johnson
said. ``They are lucky to have even gotten this far.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers and Knicks will tip off here Sunday at 5:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   After the slow-motion first half that Bird had feared, the Gold
and Blue squads mixed it up in the second half. With the score
tied, 89-89, for the final period, the Pacers' second team, behind
point guard Travis Best, opened up a lead. Best made six straight
baskets in the period and finished with 23 points and 14 assists.
That was good news for the Pacers, because Best has struggled with
foul trouble and has averaged only 3.1 points a game in the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Best may have outplayed Jackson (eight points and 11 assists),
but it was Jackson, a New York-born point guard and former Knick,
who scored with the crowd by talking the hardwood game like a true
Hoosier. When the final buzzer sounded and another standing ovation
commenced, Jackson took a microphone and quieted the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``You got to see free, for no money, the two best teams in
basketball play here tonight,'' he said. ``We've been going all
around the country. We had tour stops in Milwaukee and
Philadelphia. Those crowds got crazy. It would bother another team,
but not us. It would really help if you step it up a notch, because
that's what we plan on doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Then he made a prediction that until now he has avoided uttering
to members of the news media. Jackson reminded the crowd that next
year, the Pacers will move to a new home, Conseco Fieldhouse. ``And
we're going to open it up with a championship banner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was the perfect toast to end the happiest of hours in
Indiana. &QL;

   NEWARK, N.J. _ A Jersey City podiatrist apparently hanged
herself on Thursday in her Pennsylvania jail cell minutes before
she was to be returned to New Jersey to face questioning about her
sister-in-law, whose decomposing body was found this month stuffed
in a picnic cooler.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Elaine Witterschein, 48, was found hanging from shredded and
knotted bed linens in her 9-by-9-foot, single-person cell in the
Luzerne County Prison in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., at about 10:35 a.m.
Thursday. Her death was first reported Friday in The Star-Ledger of
Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witterschein was arrested on May 21 after leaving a
substance-abuse clinic in Wilkes-Barre, where she had been
sentenced as part of a conviction on May 12 for passing bad checks
in Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   On May 17, Dr. Witterschein's roommate, Stanley Eldridge,
dragged a large cooler with wheels on one end out of the storage
area next to the basement apartment they shared in a four-story
brownstone in downtown Jersey City.
</P>
<P>
   When a friend of his opened the cooler and found the body, they
called the police. Inside the cooler was a black plastic garment
bag and inside the bag was the 100-pound body of the podiatrist's
sister-in-law, Mary Ann Witterschein, fully clothed with her hands
handcuffed behind her.
</P>
<P>
   Terrence Hull, the first assistant Hudson County prosecutor,
said the woman had died of a blow to the head and asphyxiation. He
said a pathologist estimated that she had been dead for six months.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Witterschein's death was ruled a suicide by the Luzerne
County coroner, according to Detective Capt. Michael Dessoye, an
investigator with the district attorney's office there. He said
that Dr. Witterschein had not been deemed a suicide threat.
</P>
<P>
   She had last been seen by jail officials at 10 a.m. Thursday,
when they stopped by her cell to tell her to get dressed for her
scheduled extradition hearing later in the day in the County Court
of Common Pleas.
</P>
<P>
   A note was found in the cell, but Dessoye would not disclose its
contents. However, Hull, whose office is investigating the apparent
murder of Dr. Witterschein's sister-in-law, said that it shed no
light on the murder case.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no admission in the note, which did not state
anything about the homicide,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ann Witterschein, the sister-in-law, was the widow of
Edward Witterschein, a retired Jersey City policeman who died last
year. Hull said that investigators were looking into the
possibility that someone during the last few months had been
fraudulently cashing the monthly checks that she had been receiving
as part of her husband's pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
   According to Jersey City investigators, both Edward and Mary Ann
Witterschein had alcohol-abuse problems over the years, and about
five years ago state child-welfare agencies removed their two
children from the home because of those problems.

CAN A PEAKING HOUSTON HANDLE A STREAKING MILLER?
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PURCHASE, N.Y. _ Sometimes it's as if the slithering Reggie
Miller is leading his pursuer through a car chase scene as he
weaves through the traffic on the court.
</P>
<P>
   Almost inevitably, a bus, in the form of Dale Davis or Antonio
Davis, appears in the frame as Miller bolts into the clear. The
opponent brakes, Miller springs open and knocks down a 3-pointer.
</P>
<P>
   Allan Houston knows how the story ends. Over the years, he has
been on the other side of the mean screens Davis and Davis have set
for the zigzagging Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Houston has himself mentally prepared for the rugged path before
him in the Knicks' Eastern Conference finals with the Indiana
Pacers, which begins on Sunday. And maybe, just to turn the tables
on Miller, Houston can run him ragged with his own aggressive
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't wait,'' Houston said after the Knicks practiced Friday
at SUNY-Purchase. ``This is what it's all about. No matter who it
is, whether it's Reggie or someone else, this is where you are. And
this is the challenge you face, the challenge you welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   The same Houston who once shied away from contact this season,
and was often timid in his drives to the basket and reluctant to
fight through picks on defense, is revealing a thick coat of
confidence these days. There is a bring-it-on hitch in the step of
a player itching to challenge Miller, the Pacer most capable of
deflating the high the Knicks are on these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Allan's confidence level is at an extreme point,''
said Don Chaney, an assistant coach for the Knicks. ``It's great
because the timing is right. Allan knows if he puts the ball on the
floor, there's a good chance he'll get hit. But instead of being
hit, he's worried about finishing the play. And I honestly don't
know if he had that mentality earlier in the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's connected to his defense, too. Once again, if
you try to avoid the pick, in the process, you're a step away from
your guy. Now, it's to the point where Allan doesn't mind following
someone like Reggie and getting hit once in a while. He runs into
them a lot. He may not always get the call, but if a guy sets an
illegal screen, and you hit it, you might catch a break. If you
slow up and hit it, you're not going to get those calls at all.
Allan is more aware of that now.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's playoff series with the Pacers was a primer for
Houston in learning the dangers associated with the cat-and-mouse
game Miller likes to play. For the most part, it was a forgettable
stretch for Houston, who seemed mentally frayed by Miller's
movements by each game's end. Miller averaged 24.6 points a game in
that second-round series, while Houston averaged 19, including a
fruitless 33-point effort as the Knicks were eliminated in Game 5.
By then, Miller had done his damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as much a mental challenge as it is a physical one not to
get so worn out mentally from having to do so much work defensively
that you give in on a possession,'' coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
``You might have guarded him well the whole game and at a crucial
point _ and maybe it's fatigue, maybe you're getting bumped _ you
want to give in. That's when he's going to catch it and get the big
shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In the regular season, whether it was because of Miller's poor
shooting or Houston's fearless defense, Houston showed he was
capable of tracking his adversary. Miller shot 36 percent and
averaged 12 points a game in three games against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   But the playoffs are Miller's stage. And this has been when the
bus appears, the pursuer brakes and Miller pops into the clear. The
perfect getaway. It's the kind of dramatic finish Houston wants to
put an end to.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what's going to happen,'' Houston said. ``You just
try to get around the screens the best way you can. It didn't wear
on me when we played them before this year. People are making a big
deal out of it. But that's the way they are, and that's the way
they play. What we have to do is make them react to us. I'm sure
they aren't being bombarded with questions like, `How are you going
to stop Allan?' My thing is, we have to make them play defense,
too. Bottom line is, you have to get out and get the job done.'' &QL;

LAWMAKERS HOPE `LOCKBOX' IS KEY TO POLITICAL GAINS  
 WHOM TO BLAME FOR CHINESE ESPIONAGE?  
 MAKING THE CASE FOR TERM LIMITS  
 SOUTHERN CHILDREN STILL HURT BY POVERTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., La., S.C., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By CARL HULSE and SEAN LOUGHLIN   
 NYT Regional Newspapers   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ House members are patting themselves on the back,
boasting that they have taken a giant step toward protecting Social
Security. A Republican bill that keeps the retirement trust fund in
a so-called lockbox, tucked away from spendthrift lawmakers, sailed
through on a 416-12 vote.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact is, lawmakers routinely violate their own limits on
spending and their own pledges to leave the Social Security surplus
alone. All they have to do is declare an emergency and then nothing
is off limits. That's just what happened with the $15 billion
package lawmakers recently approved to pay for the war in Kosovo
and a host of pet projects. Much of that package was paid for by
dipping into the Social Security reserves.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that little inconsistency didn't stop lawmakers from
proclaiming that they had saved Social Security via the ``lockbox''
vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this effort, we are working to ensure that not one dime
of America's Social Security tax dollars are spent on big-spending
programs,'' said Rep, John Linder, R-Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Cox Wait, president of the non-partisan Committee for a
Responsible Federal Budget, applauded Congress for vowing to
safeguard the Social Security surplus, but she was a bit skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be more form than substance,'' she said, noting that
lawmakers didn't have to pass any new bill to safeguard the Social
Security reserves. They could just curtail their spending. By doing
so, they would help to pay down the federal debt, which Wait
described as the most fiscally responsible thing lawmakers could
do.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA CLIPPERS
</P>
<P>
   The China spying documented in the new congressional report
dated to the Carter era, but Republicans seem intent on heaping
most of the blame on the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, the Texas governor and presidential hopeful
whose father occupied the White House as vice president or
president for 12 of the 20 odd years of spying, was tough on
President Clinton. Congressional Republicans piled on as well,
saying the White House was slow to respond when it learned of the
pilfering of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., gathered 75 signatures on a letter
calling for the resignation of National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger, saying he misled Congress about the security lapse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our most sensitive nuclear and military technology has been
stolen by the communist Chinese and no one in this administration
is being held responsible,'' complained Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, sought to emphasize how the spying covered
``the past several administrations,'' as Sen. John Breaux, D-La.,
put it. Even some Republicans shared that view.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's enough blame to go around on a bipartisan fashion,''
said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa.
</P>
<P>
   LIMITED SUCCESS?
</P>
<P>
   Promising a kinder, gentler approach to term limits, a group of
10 House members who have vowed not to make a career in Congress
are banding together to highlight the advantages of term
restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the new Citizen Legislator Caucus hopes to
show how term-limited members are more responsible with tax dollars
than veteran lawmakers interested in extending their careers. The
group also hopes to counter U.S. Term Limits, a private
organization that has harshly criticized lawmakers for their
half-hearted support of limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are here to help members, not to bash members who don't
limit their own terms,'' said Rep. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., a freshman
who intends to leave the House after three terms and serves as
chairman of the caucus.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, he has helped to organize a foundation that will
raise money to promote the idea of term limits.
</P>
<P>
   SOUTHERN SHAME
</P>
<P>
   Despite reduced infant mortality and improved education,
Southern children still lag the nation in several key measures,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
   The report by the Children's Defense Fund found that poverty
remains a big hurdle for children in the South, and it called on
Congress and the president to spend more money on the health and
education of America's youth.
</P>
<P>
   Southern states continue to have large concentrations of poor
children. The report included a list that ranked states by
percentage of children in poverty, from lowest to highest.
Louisiana came in 49th, Mississippi 48th, Arkansas 46th, Alabama
44th, South Carolina 39th and Florida 37th. North Carolina rated
the best of the South at 30th.
</P>
<P>
   The worst state was New Mexico, while the state with the lowest
percentage of children in poverty was New Hampshire.

TWO COMMUTERS SUE OVER STATE'S REPEAL OF TAX 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.J., Conn.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN SULLIVAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two men claiming that changes in New York City's
commuter tax illegally discriminate against residents of other
states filed a lawsuit Friday to eliminate the tax.
</P>
<P>
   The men, both out-of-state commuters, claim that the new law,
which taxes commuters from New Jersey and Connecticut but not those
from suburbs in New York, is unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they know it is unconstitutional,'' said Richard Swanson,
one of the men filing the lawsuit. ``The one thing they can't do is
repeal it for New York state residents and leave it in place for
non-New York state residents.''
</P>
<P>
   Swanson, a partner in a Manhattan law firm, Thelan Reid &AMP;
Priest, lives in New Jersey. The other plaintiff, Thomas Igoe Jr.,
is also a partner in the firm and lives in Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The two men filed suit after Gov. George Pataki signed a law on
Thursday that repeals the city's commuter tax for suburban
commuters within the state. The tax, which has been in place for a
generation, is 0.45 percent of earned income for most people. Taxes
paid by all commuters generate as much as $360 million for the city
each year.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. John Rowland of
Connecticut have sent a joint letter to Pataki urging him to veto
the selective repeal and instead repeal the taxes for all
commuters. Whitman recently said that New Jersey would sue to stop
the revised tax, and has directed the attorney general to do so.
</P>
<P>
   City political leaders have condemned the repeal as an attempt
to curry favor with suburban voters, and have said it will be a
severe blow to the city. But supporters of the measure have held it
to be a valid attempt to ease the tax burden on commuters,
particularly at a time when the city will have a substantial budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said Friday that he would prefer that New York keep the
tax for all commuters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I got sick, the city would send an ambulance; if I had a
fire, the city would send a fire truck,'' he said. ``I have no
problem paying for my fair share of New York services.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, which was filed in state Supreme Court in
Manhattan, asks the court to declare the new law unconstitutional.
The plaintiffs are not seeking money. They are asking for costs and
legal fees incurred by their law firm, but Swanson said the firm
would argue the case free if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Swanson said that the Supreme Court has repeatedly found that
states cannot levy discriminatory taxes against residents of other
states.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Constitution is intended to prohibit one state from
discriminating against another in taxes,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court has often taken a dim view of states' attempts
to levy taxes that they do not apply to their own residents. In
1975, the court ruled that New Hampshire could not subject
out-of-state residents to a commuter tax when New Hampshire
residents paid no income tax.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a narrow decision in 1997, the court struck down a
40-year-old Maine property-tax law that granted tax-exempt status
to charities but denied it to those ``operated principally for the
benefit of persons who are not residents of Maine.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year the court ruled that New York state unconstitutionally
discriminated against out-of-state taxpayers by denying them the
right to deduct alimony payments from their New York income tax _ a
deduction available to New York state residents.
</P>
<P>
   Writing for the majority in the case, Lunding vs. New York Tax
Appeals Tribunal, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said that the court's
decisions had established a rule of ``substantial equality of
treatment'' for residents and nonresidents. She said the states
must provide ``substantial justification'' for any differences in
treatment.

METS FALL TO DIAMONDBACKS; AGBAYANI'S POWER DOESN'T MAKE UP FOR HIS
DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Benny Agbayani belted a homer off Omar Daal for the
only run the New York Mets managed to score against the Arizona
Diamondbacks Friday night. Agbayani failed to corral a mammoth fly
ball to center field, which helped the Diamondbacks score their
only two runs against the Mets. Is there any way Agbayani can tote
his trusty bat to center field for luck?
</P>
<P>
   Because Andy Fox went deep off Agbayani's glove and because
Agbayani was the only Met to go deep or to do much of anything off
Daal, the Diamondbacks edged New York, 2-1, at Shea Stadium. The
Diamondbacks continued to prove that they are a real threat for at
least a wild-card berth, while the Mets continued to play sometimes
inspiring and sometimes exasperating baseball.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd chanting, ``Ben-ny, Ben-ny,'' and runners on
first and second and one out in the ninth inning, Agbayani had an
opportunity to leave even more of an imprint on the game. Agbayani
grounded to third baseman Matt Williams, who got the force play at
second. Jay Bell's throw skidded past first, but Mike Piazza
tripped halfway down the line as he tried to score and had to
retreat to third.
</P>
<P>
   After Gregg Olson walked Matt Franco to load the bases, he fell
behind 3-0 on Luis Lopez. But Olson rebounded to pump three
straight strikes by Lopez to secure the dramatic victory for
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Daal dominated the Mets with his off-speed pitches before
leaving the game after seven innings with tightness in his left
shoulder. Daal gave up Agbayani's homer in the seventh, but he
stifled the Mets on no hits in four at-bats with runners in scoring
position. Rick Reed pitched a commendable game in allowing two
earned runs in seven innings, but he lost and still has only one
victory since May 4.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Agbayani's best position might be designated hitter,
manager Bobby Valentine has to squeeze him into the lineup because
of his hot bat. Basically, Valentine puts Agbayani in the outfield
and hopes a fly ball is not hit to him at a critical juncture.
Friday night, one was, and now the 2-year-old Diamondbacks (28-21)
actually have a better record than the Mets (27-21).
</P>
<P>
   Fox's booming fly ball in the second inning kept drifting, and
Agbayani, who was playing center field, immediately seemed to be in
trouble. He started late on the ball, then turned to his left and
finally lunged for the ball near the warning track. But the ball
nicked off his glove for a triple that scored the only two runs
Arizona would need.
</P>
<P>
   On the mound, Reed stared at the dirt. The pitcher knew he had a
problem once Fox hammered a pitch 400 feet, but he also knew that
he had helped create the mess by walking Steve Finley and by
allowing a two-out single to Kelly Stinnett, who entered the game
with a .141 average on 11 hits in 78 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Reed might have sneaked into the dugout unscathed if
Brian McRae was in center field. While Fox drilled the ball to the
track, it was in the air long enough for a competent center fielder
to catch it.
</P>
<P>
   A pivotal confrontation occurred in the sixth inning, but it
might as well have been the ninth. It was Daal against Piazza with
the potential tying runs on first and second base. Piazza did not
turn a disappointing night into an exciting evening as his
one-handed swing produced a fly ball to left. Alfonzo then flied
out as Daal kept the 2-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets had runners in scoring position against Daal in the
first and second innings, and they failed to score both times.
Agbayani finally solved Daal in the seventh, but only after he had
helped Arizona already. &QL;

LONG BEACH ST. BEATS MISSISSIPPI
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GORDON VERRELL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLLEGE STATION, Texas _ Something special, something clutch,
that's what it'll take to win, Long Beach State coach Dave Snow was
saying just before the start of the NCAA baseball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about knowing the script.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the Dirtbags got a series of clutch performances in
their regional opener at Texas A&AMP;M against Mississippi and won in
10 innings, 4-3.
</P>
<P>
   Pinch hitter Scott Redfox singled home the winning run with one
out in the bottom of the 10th, sending the Dirtbags into the
winner's bracket of the four-team, double-elimination tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Today at noon they'll meet powerhouse Texas A&AMP;M, a 6-0
first-round winner Friday night over Monmouth University.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a little life, we good a little confidence,'' said
Snow, who's been slow all season to endorse this Dirtbag club, just
the other day going as far to say, ``We haven't done anything to
suggest we can win a regional.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to need that confidence, too,'' Snow added,
alluding to the matchup with the host Aggies (47-14), the
top-seeded team here and one of the eight nationally seeded clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss (33-28), which will take on Monmouth (26-23) this
morning in an elimination game, out-hit the Dirtbags, 12-8. But the
Rebels stranded a dozen base runners, nine of them in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the most frustrating thing,'' said Ole Miss coach Pat
Harrison, ``not getting key hits. We didn't get the hits when we
needed them, they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Gallo, Darren Merrill and Jeremy Ward combined to restrict
Ole Miss to just two hits in 16 at-bats with runners on second or
third base.
</P>
<P>
   The Dirtbags (34-23) were held in check by Ole Miss right-hander
Jeff McAvoy, who went the distance, and actually pitched better
following a one-hour rain delay in the middle of the sixth inning,
retiring 10 batters in a row at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helped settle me down,'' McAvoy explained. ``I was rushing
things the first five innings.''
</P>
<P>
   Third baseman Greg Dobbs got to McAvoy quickly, slamming his
eighth home run with two outs in the first inning.
</P>
<P>
   Ole Miss right fielder Michael Rosamond hit a solo homer in the
second off of Gallo, just the fifth home run he's given up this
season but the fourth in his last four games.
</P>
<P>
   Rosamond's homer snapped a string of 18 scoreless innings by the
Rebels, who are appearing in only their second regional in 22
years. The Rebels followed the homer with a double by catcher Carl
Lafferty and successive singles by Jude Voltz and Justin Huisman to
take a 2-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers tied the score in the third on a leadoff double by
second baseman Curt Lee, who was starting for only the second time
in 16 games, a sacrifice bunt by A.J. LaBarbera, who started at
shortstop in place of injured Bobby Crosby, and an infield out by
Terrmel Sledge.
</P>
<P>
   They went ahead, 3-2, in the fifth on a two-out double by
Sledge, then a triple down the right field line by Mike Hota.
</P>
<P>
   Gallo pitched the first six innings, but didn't return following
the lengthy rain delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd thrown 97 pitches at that point,'' Snow explained, ``and
he was having trouble with a blister, and it got worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rebels tied the score, 3-3, in the seventh against Merrill
when LaBarbera let Brad Henderson's one-out grounder roll through
his legs for an error, enabling Robert Shelton to score from third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kind of rolled the dice there,'' said Snow, who played his
infield in. ``I had the feeling this game wasn't going to be
decided with a big inning.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow got what he wanted, a ground ball, just not the result he
was looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ``A.J. did OK,'' Snow said of his backup shortstop. ``He made
the plays ... when he was playing back.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 10th, Abel Orozco led off with a single, Lee sacrificed
and Redfox pinch hit for LaBarbera.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in the dugout, waiting for a shot to get in there,''
said Redfox. ``(McAvoy) was pitching just about everybody away, so
that was what I was looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Redfox got it, driving a line single to right-center, easily
scoring pinch runner Michael Luera with the winning run.
</P>
<P>
   DIRTBAGS NOTES: Right-hander Jeff Leuenberger (5-2), who has a
string of 15 consecutive scoreless innings, will start today
against A&AMP;M ace left-hander Casey Fossum (10-5). ... Crosby's left
toe, fractured a week ago, got worse following Thursday's workout
and he's now doubtful for the tournament. ... Catcher Bryan Kennedy
snapped an 0 for 12 skid with an eighth-inning single. ... Jaeme
Leal returned to first base after being restricted to DH duty the
previous 10 games because of a sore hamstring.

TEXAS SCHOOL BILL TALKS RUN LATE INTO NIGHT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ While the two key negotiators on the $3.8
billion plan for funding public schools said they made ``good
progress on all fronts'' toward reaching an accord, no deal had
been struck by late Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some concepts,'' said Republican Sen. Teel Bivins of
Amarillo. But he would not specify what concepts he and state Rep.
Paul Sadler, D-Henderson, finally agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether both sides had given a little bit, Bivins replied:
``Well, one side gave a helluva lot.''
</P>
<P>
   If House conferees were willing, Bivins planned to schedule the
first public meeting of the conference committee early Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Friday, House Democrats drew a line in the sand Friday
on school finance, refusing to give up even $1 for education
programs for the sake of more tax breaks and threatening to block
passage of any plan that does.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators remained deadlocked over how to
settle major differences between the two chambers' proposed funding
of public schools contained in Senate Bill 4, despite phone calls
from and meetings with Gov. George W. Bush and Lt. Gov. Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Bivins &UR;  &LR; has refused to call a public meeting of the
conference committee, opting instead to carry on in secret all
negotiations about how to re-allocate the largest school funding
bill in history.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins and most Senate conferees have refused to specify even
what options are being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are totally opposed to taking money away from education
programs ... in order to fund additional tax cuts,'' said Rep.
Kevin Bailey, D-Houston. ``We have passed already in this session
significant tax cuts. ... The benefit to most Texans of those tax
cuts is very minuscule. However, the benefit to children with these
education programs is very significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Bailey is chairman of the liberal Legislative Study Group, one
of three House caucuses that said Friday they would not budge on
their educational spending plan. That $3.8 billion proposal would
give all teachers a $3,000 across-the-board raise, increase the
state's per-pupil funding and provide the basis for about $1
billion in local property tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins, the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, had
proposed carving $250 million out of a $300 million plan the House
developed to create full-day kindergarten, pre-kindergarten, Head
Start and ninth-grade dropout prevention programs. The Senate
proposed using that $250 million to increase the overall tax cuts
granted this session to close to the $2.6 billion mark that Bush
set last year during his re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said Education Commissioner Mike Moses had told senators
that the entire $300 million could not be spent on the new programs
in the next two-year budget period anyway because they are new and
could not be operating by Sept. 1, when the fiscal year starts.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted Rep. Rene Oliveira, D-Brownsville and head of the
House Mexican American Caucus, to respond: ``I've never met a
school district that couldn't spend all the money it was given.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason to take $1 away,'' said Rep. Sylvester
Turner, D-Houston. ``So from our vantage point this is a silly
discussion to be having at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are in Texas. We're not in Iowa, we're right here in
Austin. We're going back to Houston, to the valley. We're going
back to San Antonio. We're going back to Beaumont. We're not going
to New Hampshire And the kids that we're fighting for are right
here in Texas.''
</P>
<P>
   His comment was a jab at Bush, who is scheduled to head to Iowa
and New Hampshire, the first states to hold presidential nominating
contests, in mid-June.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor says that, well, if we don't finish up our
business, he may call a special session,'' Turner added. ``Well,
governor, bring it on.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the choice is between fighting for our kids and their
education, and fighting for the tax breaks to business, that's a
fight well-taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler, chairman of the House Public Education Committee, had
said earlier Friday that he countered Bivins' suggestion with one
shifting money between two different funding formulas, but he was
vague about the exact proposal. Negotiators spent a good part of
the day reviewing analyses of how that would affect districts.
</P>
<P>
   Perry said the Senate is committed to maintaining the balance it
believes it achieved in its finance proposal and wants to make
certain that any compromise treats all areas of the state and all
types of school districts the same.
</P>
<P>
   He chafed at the suggestion that the Senate was taking money
away from school children. Public education, Perry said, got 75
percent of the new money in the state budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a rather substantial commitment to the children in the
state of Texas,'' he said. ``Any hard number that `We've got to
have this amount of tax cut' is secondary to having those public
schools and those children's issues addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins had said earlier this week that if the Legislature could
not complete its work by noon Friday there would not be time to do
so before session's end on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both chambers acknowledged Friday that while they
still hoped to reach a compromise, time was getting short.

MALE GUARD WINS DAMAGES IN SEXUAL HARASSMENT SUIT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HACKENSACK, N.J. _ A jury awarded a male state prison guard
$3.75 million in damages on Friday after he charged that prison
supervisors had failed to protect him from sexual harassment by a
female guard whose advances he had rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The guard who filed the lawsuit, Robert Lockley, 39, a
corrections officer at the Mid-State Correctional Facility in
Wrightstown since 1985, was awarded $750,000 for emotional distress
and $3 million in punitive damages, said one of his lawyers, Daniel
Fleming.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a rare case,'' Fleming said. ``It's extremely rare for
a man to claim sexual harassment by women, and it's even rarer for
a man to win such a case. And to do that they have to overcome a
generation of thinking that men can't be sexually harassed.''
</P>
<P>
   A Burlington County jury of three men and three women granted
the award in state Superior Court in Mount Holly before Judge Jan
Schlesinger. Lockley sued the Department of Corrections and its
commissioner at the time, William Fauver, in October 1994. Fauver
was not found personally liable in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rita Malley, a spokeswoman for the state attorney general's
office, which defended the Corrections Department, said Friday that
the state was considering its options, which include a request for
a new trial and a request that the award be reduced or thrown out.
``We respect the jury's decision, but we disagree with it,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, according to Linda Wong, one of Lockley's lawyers, a
female corrections officer, Ronda Turner, began following Lockley,
complimenting him on his looks and his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Lockley, who lives in Burlington County with his wife and two
children, tried to rebuff the officer politely, Ms. Wong said, but
the advances became more aggressive. ``She started following him
around everywhere he went, physically touching him,'' Ms. Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the unwelcome advances turned to vicious verbal
assaults, Ms. Wong said. ``When he started turning her down, it
became a source of embarrassment for her, so she started ridiculing
him'' in public, Ms. Wong said. At times, she added, the taunts,
which often involved vulgarities, were heard by some of the 600
inmates at the prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Wong said that after Lockley's verbal complaints were
ignored by supervisors, he filed an internal discrimination
complaint in July 1993, and in September the warden, Robert Barker,
asked Fauver to approve a transfer for Officer Turner, but the
request was denied. She was later brought up on administrative
charges, which were dismissed after a hearing in May 1994, Ms. Wong
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being reassigned briefly, Officer Turner was never
disciplined, Ms. Wong said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Turner could not be reached through telephone calls to the
prison, her lawyer or the Corrections Department. Mary Ellen
Bolton, the chief of staff for Commissioner John Terhune, referred
inquiries to the attorney general's office.

HESS EXCLUDED FAMILY FROM FUTURE OWNERSHIP OF JETS
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The will of the late Jets owner Leon Hess never
explains why he did not wish his family to assume control of the
team, but he outlined the exclusion of his beneficiaries from any
roles under a new owner.
</P>
<P>
   Hess barred the sale ``of any interest, directly or indirectly,
to members of my family, as it is my intent that my interests in
the Jets be disposed of unaffected by any desire of family members
to participate in the club's future ownership.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess signed the will on March 26, six weeks before he died May 7
at the age of 85. The will was filed Friday in Surrogate Court in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In an indication of his determination to prevent family
involvement, Hess said, ``I do not want anyone interested in my
estate to question or in any way challenge the negotiations toward
the sale or the structure of or parties to the sale.''
</P>
<P>
   The will states that if any of Hess' beneficiaries or their
descendants challenge the team's sale, their bequests will be cut
by 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some NFL officials and fellow owners have said that Hess did not
want to burden his heirs with a decision over whether to sell or
retain the team, which a mandate to sell the team would avoid.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Jets announced that the team would be sold, with
the negotiations to be handled by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. The
investment firm helped the NFL sell the expansion Cleveland Browns
last September for $530 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Jets are expected to sell for at least $500 million because
of the attractiveness of an NFL team in the nation's largest
market, and the league's television contracts.
</P>
<P>
   According to the will, Steve Gutman, the Jets' president, will
earn a small percentage of the sale price. He will receive 0.25
percent of the first $100 million of the sale price, 0.5 percent of
the next $100 million and 1 percent of any sum above $200 million.
At $500 million, Gutman would receive $3.75 million.
</P>
<P>
   The will does not offer suggestions to Goldman, Sachs about how
to structure the sale or about any buyers Hess preferred for the
team.
</P>
<P>
   Hess said he anticipated that selling the Jets would raise
enough money to pay most of the estate's debts, expenses and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   If the proceeds fall short, Hess offered three categories of
stocks and assets to sell, the last one being shares in the Amerada
Hess Corp., which he founded and which he ran until 1995. His son,
John, is now the chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Hess directed the executors of his estate to ``maximize the
value received and minimize the tax cost'' from the Jets' sale.
</P>
<P>
   The five executors include John Hess, Nicholas F. Brady, the
former Treasury secretary, and Thomas Kean, the former governor of
New Jersey, who are board members of Amerada Hess. John Hess will
receive $8.25 million as an executor, and Brady and Kean will
receive $1.5 million each. &QL;

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Stephen Howard Fagan Friday pleaded guilty to
kidnapping his two toddler daughters 20 years ago from a mother he
said was alcoholic and neglectful in exchange for a suspended
prison sentence, five years probation, and a $100,000 donation to a
children's charity.
</P>
<P>
   Ending a family saga marked by decades of deception, Fagan
walked from Middlesex Superior Court to enjoy a celebration dinner
with the two grown daughters who have steadfastly supported him
despite learning last year that he lied to them, telling them their
mother was killed in a car accident and raising them under the
false names of Rachael and Lisa Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Friday was the first time the girls' mother, Barbara Kurth, has
been in the same room with her daughters since Fagan picked them up
for what was supposed to be a routine weekend visit in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Seated at opposite sides of the courtroom, mother and daughters
did not speak to each other.
</P>
<P>
   Defense attorney Richard Egbert told the court that his client
had responded to complaints from three North Adams neighbors who
telephoned Fagan 20 years ago to tell him that Kurth had left her
daughters, then 2 and 5, barely clothed in winter and fending for
themselves. Egbert told the court that Kurth had been stopped three
times for driving while drunk.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, whose attorneys said she suffered from a rare form of
narcolepsy and severe depression during her divorce, slowly shook
her head side to side as Egbert portrayed her as unfit.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, it was the dedication of Fagan's daughters that
weighed most heavily in the minds of Middlesex County prosecutors
who knew the sisters could not be presented to a jury as victims
unless they conceded to the roles.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan created false identities for himself and the two girls,
and raised them in posh Palm Beach surroundings. As they have
before, the sisters publicly declared their faith in their father
Friday, telling Superior Court Judge Peter M. Lauriat that they
believe he acted as any responsible parent would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the court to know that if we could retroactively give
our father the consent needed to take the action he did 20 years
ago, we would do so without hesitation,'' said Lisa Martin, sharing
in a prepared statement with her sister.
</P>
<P>
   Their mother, whose siblings said she has repeatedly tried to
contact her daughters in hopes of a reunion since Fagan's scheme
was uncovered last year, showed little emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth declined to address the court, but submitted a written
statement saying in part: ``Some days I believe that Stephen fagan
would have been kinder to really have murdered me rather than
having done so only in the minds of my children. At least there
would have been no question as to his punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   At the afternoon press conference, the girls left open the
possibility they might some day speak with their mother, the woman
who named them Rachael and Wendy, and whose last photographs of
them showed two girls smiling at a family birthday party.
</P>
<P>
   But they didn't acknowledge her Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's mother, clearly distraught, left her daughter's side
during the testimony, and family members later said she could not
bear the idea that Fagan, though convicted for parental kidnapping,
was allowed to walk free.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth's brother, Peter, said his family was not in favor of the
plea bargain but was aware of the challenges prosecutors would have
had convincing a jury that Fagan, 57, deserved prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not our deal,'' said Peter Kurth. ``This was Stephen
Fagan's deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan was given two suspended sentences of 3-5 years at
MCI-Cedar Junction, and while on probation will be required to
perform 2,000 hours of community service with ailing veterans. He
will also donate $100,000 to the New England Home for Little
Wanderers in the name of Barbara Kurth, who chose the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Following his sentencing, Fagan issued a brief statement to
reporters, said he chose his parental duties over the letter of the
law when he abducted his children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I left Massachusetts some 20 years ago with two infants, two
suitcases, and a paper bag full of diapers,'' Fagan said. ``I was
raised in a home where the best interests of the children always
came first, and that is still the case.''
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who was raised in Newton and met Barbara Kurth at a
Kenmore Square bar, was greeted in the courtroom by local friends
and family, including his current wife Harriet, who has helped
raise his daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Fagan, who has never apologized for his actions, declined to
answer questions about whether he feels any remorse or regret, and
said he could not predict whether his daughters will ever choose to
reunite with their mother.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lauriat acknowledged that this unique case offered no
happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a tragic, difficult and wrenching case for
everyone who has been victimized by Mr. Fagan's unlwaful conduct.
However, there are no perfect sentences that can be imposed, no
sentences that will satisfy all concerned as an ideal
representation of justice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Middlesex District Attorney Martha Coakley, who inherited the
case, said the daughters' belief that their father acted properly
was crucial to the plea agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a one of a kind case,'' Coakley said. ``And we believe
that it is not likely to happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   She continued, ``Perhaps more importantly, this sentence secures
a just result without subjecting the victims to the potential
trauma of trial.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear how many people Fagan confided in about the
abductions, but last year a relative allegedly told an attorney who
reported that Fagan was living under an assumed name in Palm Beach
to Massachusetts state police.
</P>
<P>
   A master of disguises, Fagan told friends and neighbors that he
was, among other things, a presidential advisor and a Harvard
graduate. But Friday Fagan acknowledged to the court that though he
graduated Suffolk Law School, he had not worked in 20 years. Those
who knew him in Palm Beach say he spent his days watching his
younger daughter, Rachael, win swimming competitions and
shepherding his eldest to a career in philanthropy, like her
stepmother's.
</P>
<P>
   The plea arrangement did not prevent any of those involved from
selling their stories to filmmakers or authors, though both sides
said Friday their primary concern was to remove the couple's
daughters from the media glare. Egbert declined comment about any
book or movie deal. Coakley said it was out of her control.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth, now a university researcher in Virginia, has no other
children. In her statement to the court, she defended her search
for her daughters, saying that law enforcment officials 20 years
ago were ignorant to pleas that her former husband had abducted her
children and brushed it off as merely a domestic dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Kurth urged family courts to develop a system for bringing
parental abducters to justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will tell you that after having met and received hundreds of
letters and E-mails from parents across this country and the world
that I am one of the lucky ones to finally know where and how my
chidlren are today,'' Kurth wrote. ``I can only say at this point
that I will always love them.''

FROM MONTENEGRO TO THE NBA, RADOJEVIC HAS HIGH HOPES
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Kan., Ohio)  (rk) 
 By JUDY BATTISTA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is just one more month left in Aleksandar Radojevic's
hurried odyssey to the NBA _ a month filled with tryouts in one
city after another, with four-hour training sessions and with
thousands of calories in protein shakes.
</P>
<P>
   And the pace of the final push is wearing on the gangly
22-year-old who did not start playing basketball in his native
Montenegro until he was 16, and who did not take the sport
seriously until he sprouted to nearly 7 feet by 19.
</P>
<P>
   Now, when the 7-foot-3-inch Radojevic lopes into a room,
shoulders hunched , he looks weary. This week alone, Radojevic,
with just two years of junior college experience to his credit, has
worked out in front of officials of the Knicks and Nets, and there
are at least seven more auditions to go, including one this weekend
for the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   But the effort, Radojevic said, is more than worth it, for there
is much within his grasp and much to at last put behind him.
Radojevic's skills are rated so highly that he is expected to be
selected in the first round of the NBA draft June 30, and he may
well become the highest-drafted Yugoslav player. And with the
riches that will come, Radojevic will be able to pluck his family
from a part of the world that is once again convulsed by war.
</P>
<P>
   ``His skill level is off the charts,'' said Leo Papile, the
director of scouting for the Boston Celtics. Papile, figuring it to
be a thin year for big men, said Radojevic, who weighs 244 pounds,
could be one of the first two centers taken. ``He has a high
basketball IQ. He can move all the way up to the top half-dozen. He
is no secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, his availability in the draft is a surprise, to Radojevic
as much as anyone. As one of the nation's top junior college
prospects after averaging 15.4 points and blocking 153 shots last
season at Barton County Community College in Kansas, Radojevic had
signed a letter of intent to play for Ohio State next season.
</P>
<P>
   But on May 11, the NCAA ruled that because Radojevic received
$13,000 for playing a total of 19 minutes for a Yugoslav club team
two years ago, he was ineligible to play at Ohio State.
</P>
<P>
   While speculation had swirled even before the ruling that
Radojevic's draft status was climbing so high he would forgo the
rest of his college eligibility, Radojevic says he was disappointed
by the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was eligible for Ohio State, I wouldn't have entered the
draft,'' said Radojevic, who added that he had wanted to polish his
talents and play for Jim O'Brien, the Ohio State coach. ``In your
life,'' he said, ``you've got your goal. You don't jump from one
step to the last step.''

<P>
   Radojevic has taken many steps very quickly over the last
several years. He did not give up his first passion, water polo,
until he was 16 and stood 6-5. And while the Balkans have long
produced outstanding basketball players _ Vlade Divac, Drazen
Petrovic and Toni Kukoc _ Radojevic didn't take his prospects
seriously until he grew another five inches by the time he was 19.
</P>
<P>
   By then, Semi Pajovic, a family friend and a former Yugoslav
national team player who helps other Yugoslavs find places to play
in the United States, had sized up Radojevic's potential. For
someone who had begun playing the game so late, Radojevic displayed
natural gifts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one tall, big kid,'' said Pajovic, who lives on Long
Island and is the host for Radojevic while he prepares for the
draft. ``He's unbelievably agile.''
</P>
<P>
   And as he advanced, coming to play for a club team, Radojevic
managed to avoid being drafted into the military. Montenegro is a
republic of Yugoslavia, and Pajovic suspects a sympathetic
basketball coach helped Radojevic stay out of the Yugoslav army
until he could go to the United States. The decision to leave, in
the end, was simple.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of war in the Balkans, Montenegro's
economy is a shambles. Radojevic's late father was a security
guard, and his mother worked in the fields. Together, they earned
about $2,400 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic, who was 20 when he left Montenegro, spoke no English,
making junior college his only option. Barton County, one of the
nation's premier junior college teams, already had a Yugoslav
player who had transferred from Connecticut. That player, Predrag
Materic, introduced Steve Forbes, then Barton's coach, to Pajovic.
Pajovic told Forbes he wanted to bring a 7-3 player over. Forbes
offered Radojevic a scholarship without even having met him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He comes walking into this airport in Kansas and says, `Hello,
how are you?' and that's all he could say,'' Forbes recalled. ``We
drive to Burger King, and he just pointed to chicken sandwiches and
orange juice. You could talk to him and he could understand it, but
there was no way he could talk to you.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just a tall, tall skinny kid with a great demeanor.
We're having a barbecue and he's out in the backyard chasing my
son, who's probably 2, playing cowboys and Indians. I have a
picture of him holding my son straight up in the air, and my son is
dunking on a 10-foot hoop and Alek is standing flat-footed.''
</P>
<P>
   Former St. John's coach Fran Fraschilla was one of the first
coaches to see Radojevic in the United States when the center
briefly stayed with Pajovic before leaving for Kansas. Now,
Fraschilla predicts he will be taken around 15th, and that it will
take a few years of strength training before he makes an impact on
the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was amazed that a kid that big and that young had such a
good skill level,'' Fraschilla said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the war in the Balkans, Radojevic has not gone home
since coming to the United States, and he stayed in Kansas even
when his father died last season. When the NCAA ruled him
ineligible, the draft was the only viable option because a return
home would have surely meant being conscripted into the army and
perhaps being sent to fight in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would probably be the first on the front to be shot,'' he
said, alluding to his height. ``Going there would be jeopardizing
everything I built here. I'm focusing on something I'm going to be
doing for the next 15 years.''
</P>
<P>
   The war has left his small hometown on the Adriatic, Herceg
Novi, intact, but Radojevic, who learned his now-flawless English
from classes and television, worries that the scene of the conflict
could shift at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   He tries his best to block out reports of bombings, and their
attendant misery. As long as his mother keeps assuring him that his
family is fine, he said, he will continue to focus on basketball.
But as soon as he can after the draft, he will move his mother, his
twin brother and sister here.
</P>
<P>
   Where Radojevic will be drafted is still a question. Jeff Bower,
the Charlotte Hornets' scouting director, is less certain than
Papile of the Celtics. He said Radojevic is still something of an
unknown because he has faced only junior college competition, which
infrequently features anyone over 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   Radojevic, for his part, does not like to discuss his own
talent, saying he will let the scouts decide. There are seven
tryouts and a pre-draft camp in Chicago before this last, hectic
chapter in his journey ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never thought it would be this close,'' he said of his shot
at the NBA. ``My friends told me, `You're tall, you have to bend
over to take your money.'''
