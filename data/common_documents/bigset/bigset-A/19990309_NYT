D COLUMN: A SHIFT IN POWER FOR J. WALTER THOMPSON
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif. Texas)  (nk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charlotte Beers, often called the most powerful woman
in advertising, is for the third time becoming a top leader at a
giant agency.
</P>
<P>
   Effective immediately, Ms. Beers is joining the J. Walter
Thompson Co. in New York as chairwoman. Chris Jones, Thompson's
chairman since January 1998, is relinquishing those duties in an
unusual shifting and sharing of power; he continues as chief
executive, a post he has held since January 1997, in charge of
agency management.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm giving up part of my title,'' Jones, 43, said in an
interview Monday morning at the Thompson headquarters in midtown
Manhattan, ``but titles are not as important as what each of us is
going to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers, 63, who joined Jones for the interview, said, ``The
person with the best idea in the room is the leader.'' She
described her duties as focusing on ``the vitality of brands'' sold
by clients, acquisitions, new business and ``long-term strategic
development, which in the advertising business is next year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And the linchpin of that is talent, talent, talent, talent,
talent,'' Ms. Beers said, tapping on a table for emphasis. ``We
must find the best people in the business; nothing happens without
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers emphatically dismissed a description of her new job as
being a nonexecutive chairwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many serious responsibilities,'' she said, adding that
she and Jones would have ``a natural fellowship.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And it particularly ticks me off that people talk about the
partnership as a `client hand-holding exercise,' '' Ms. Beers said,
referring to articles in newspapers and trade publications
depicting her as the schmooze queen of Madison Avenue, wooing chief
executives responsible for ad spending decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't think of anything more disdainful of our clients, as
if they needed hand-holding,'' she added. ``And nothing offends me
more than to say I specialize in client dinners.''
</P>
<P>
   In keeping with her reputation as a steel magnolia, Ms. Beers, a
charming, tenacious Texan, delivered those remarks softly, with a
smile.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers' high profile in the industry is exemplified by her
appearance on the cover of Fortune magazine and items in society
and gossip columns that chronicle her hobnobbing with friends like
style doyenne Martha Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   In her two previous stints as a chairwoman, at Euro RSCG Tatham
in Chicago and Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide in New York, Ms. Beers
made significant contributions, helping those agencies manage
accounts and clients, as well as helping to attract new business
and talented employees.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers is hoping to repeat those feats at Thompson, the
world's No. 5 agency, with 246 offices in 81 countries. Thompson's
billings are estimated at $7.6 billion from blue-chip advertisers
like Ford Motor, Philip Morris and Unilever.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thompson has endured a roller coaster ride during Jones'
tenure, suffering losses of big accounts like Eastman Kodak, Dell
Computer and Sprint, that have been partly offset by recent gains
from the Bermuda Department of Tourism, Kimberly-Clark and Merrill
Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, the San Francisco office of Thompson U.S.A.
landed the account of the Pacific Gas and Electric Co. in San
Francisco, a unit of the PG&AMP;E Corp., with estimated billings of $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got plenty to do,'' Jones said of himself and Ms. Beers,
``but the collaboration will be easy to do because we have a shared
passion, a shared vocabulary, a shared belief in building brands.''
The Thompson philosophy is known as ``Total branding,'' while
Ogilvy's is ``Brand stewardship.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson also shares a parent with Ogilvy, the No. 6 agency,
with billings estimated at $7.4 billion; both are owned by WPP
Group P.L.C., which assisted in Ms. Beers' switch between sibling
shops.
</P>
<P>
   Her arrival at Thompson is indicative of the efforts by the
largest agencies to avoid losing ground as competition intensifies.
Thompson has been eagerly seeking an experienced senior executive
to bolster its management capabilities in the crucial North
American market.
</P>
<P>
   Trade publications reported that the search had been spurred, or
even directed, by Martin Sorrell, chief executive at WPP in London,
who was described as eager to improve Thompson's results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chris initiated the idea and the decision, and Martin
supported it,'' Ms. Beers said, calling Sorrell ``a very productive
handmaiden'' in arranging her arrival. To take the Thompson job,
Ms. Beers will sever her remaining ties to Ogilvy, where she has
been chairwoman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers was considered instrumental in reviving Ogilvy, which
before her arrival had suffered severe setbacks in the early 1990s
that were far more serious than any now plaguing Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came to Ogilvy, I said, `This job cannot be done,' ''
Ms. Beers recalled. ``I was brought in there as a change agent.
It's quite night and day from this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers joined Ogilvy as chairwoman and chief executive in
April 1992. Two years later, she helped land the IBM account, with
billings estimated at $500 million, in what was then the largest
account consolidation in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said my first job was to remove the `beleaguered' in
front of Ogilvy &AMP; Mather,'' Ms. Beers said, laughing. She
relinquished the chief executive's duties to Shelly Lazarus in
September 1996 and the chairwoman's duties to Ms. Lazarus in April
1997, when she became chairwoman emeritus.
</P>
<P>
   Before joining Ogilvy, Ms. Beers worked at Euro RSCG Tatham,
part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, from
1979 to 1992. She served as chief operating officer (1979-82),
chief executive (1982-92) and chairwoman (1986-90).
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beers expects a similarly long stay in her new job _ ``I
doubt it will be less than five years,'' she said. Unlike her
stints at the other two giant agencies, which she joined from the
outside, Ms. Beers' move to Thompson represents a homecoming. Her
first job in advertising _ ``all my basic training,'' as she put it
_ was at the Chicago office of Thompson U.S.A. from 1969 to 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ogilvy brought in Charlotte,'' Jones said, smiling,
``they brought in someone originally from Thompson.''
</P>
<P>
   At Thompson, she rose to senior vice president and client
services director, but no further. In interviews in the 1980s,
former co-workers said her career had stalled because Thompson was
loath to have women in top posts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's wonderful a woman gets to do all these things''
today, Ms. Beers said. ``I'll probably have four more jobs just to
prove that.''

MARGIELA ON SCREEN  
 FROM SHOES TO SKIRTS  
 W&AMP;LT FOR ASIA ONLY 
</HEADLINE>

 By CONSTANCE C.R. WHITE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

   Margiela on Screen
</P>
<P>
   PARIS _ The creativity of Martin Margiela will not be on the
runways in Paris, where the fall women's shows are under way.
Instead, Margiela is showing his line by appointment.
</P>
<P>
   Both Margiela and Kostas Murkudis, a designer who once worked
for Helmut Lang, invoked an ``at the movies'' setting to present
their clothes. A visitor to the drafty Margiela atelier was led
into a white room with eight creaking red-velvet theater seats.
Once the guest was settled with popcorn and soda, the projectionist
_ really, a less romantic VCR operator _ got down to work, showing
a 10-minute video of Margiela's designs. The clothes were also
available for viewing on a fit model or on the hanger.
</P>
<P>
   Margiela has only a few cards to play for the season, but he has
dealt a superb hand. For starters, there's the duvet coat, made in
Italy by a manufacturer of bed linens. It continues the designer's
experiments of the past year, cutting clothes that lie flat. This
coat is a square with two detachable sleeves and a large sheltering
collar. You can wear the coat, which will sell for about $1,000, as
is. Or you can buy one of three shells, which can be worn alone in
mild weather or as coverings over the duvet. A clear shell of PVC
is the hippest choice, one of brown wool is more traditional, and a
denim shell offers a casual street look.
</P>
<P>
   Margiela has chosen to make his big end-of-the-century statement
with jewelry rather than clothing. He is selling an unclosed
necklace with two sharp nails at either end. The nails are for
sticking into each side of the cork from your first bottle of
Champagne in the year 2000. Cheers!
</P>
<P>
   From Shoes to Skirts
</P>
<P>
   ``Do the shoes make it too couture?'' Patrick Cox asked Annabel
Tollman, as both looked a model named Bracha up and down.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Tollman, an editor of Wallpaper magazine and the stylist for
Cox's first Paris show, which is to be held Tuesday, stared at the
model. Cox stared harder. After a few minutes, they reached a
decision that the crystal-covered mules did not make the black
sweater and diamante black tea-length skirt look too sickly sweet.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, the Canadian shoe designer, who is based in England, wants
to become as well known for clothes as he is for footwear. ``It's
been three years now that I've been doing clothes, and I'm now
proud enough to put them on the runway in Paris,'' he said. ``That
I do clothes in England is a very well known fact, but people who
are going to come to this show don't even come to England.''
</P>
<P>
   Cox hopes to show next in New York, where he has a store on
Madison Avenue. If Americans are familiar with Cox's clothes, it is
most likely because of his casual Wannabee collection, named for
his Wannabee shoes _ gawky loafers with thick soles and wide toes.
Wannabee will now be sold only in Japan, as Cox attempts to build a
name in clothes with more elegance. Like satin tea skirts.
</P>
<P>
   W&AMP;LT for Asia Only
</P>
<P>
   Walter van Beirendonck, the Belgian designer whose W&AMP;LT
collection melded streetwise flair with computer-game iconography,
is restructuring his business.
</P>
<P>
   His women's collection has been suspended, although as van
Beirendonck _ a bear of a man with a bald pate, bushy beard and
gigantic rings on almost every finger _ pointed out, many of his
designs for men are in fact unisex.
</P>
<P>
   Van Beirendonk, who was in Paris this week viewing friends'
shows rather than staging his own, said W&AMP;LT (the letters stand for
Wild and Lethal Trash) will now be sold only in Asia. Relinquishing
his role as designer, van Beirendonck will serve as a consultant.
Bloomingdale's and Charivari were among the American stores that
carried the line. Most of his efforts will now go into his own
signature collection, which he designs in Antwerp, where he
recently opened a boutique. The W&AMP;LT label had become so demanding,
he said, that he had stopped producing a top line.

LONG ISLAND LAND TAXES ARE CALLED BIASED
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINEOLA, N.Y. _ The Justice Department says Nassau County's
method of assessing property taxes discriminates against black and
Hispanic homeowners, causing them to pay disproportionately high
taxes, according to government documents.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Zachary W. Carter, in a letter to top Nassau
officials, threatened a government lawsuit unless the county
voluntarily takes steps to end ``the discriminatory assessments,''
and consents to a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate but related action, a New York state Supreme Court
judge refused Monday to dismiss a suit about discriminatory
assessments filed against Nassau County by the New York Civil
Liberties Union on behalf of six black homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Sanford M. Cohen, chief of civil rights litigation in the U.S.
Attorney's office, said the homeowners' suit would not affect the
government's actions against the county. He added that he was
hopeful that Nassau would voluntarily resolve the tax issue. ``If
not, we are authorized to sue,'' he said. Cohen said the county had
been aware for years that its assessment system was discriminatory,
yet had made no effort to change it.
</P>
<P>
   In Nassau, homes are assessed based on 1938 construction costs,
while the land they are built on is assessed according to 1964
property values. Because property values have appreciated faster in
wealthier, predominantly white areas than in poorer, more heavily
minority areas, homes that may have cost the same when they were
built decades ago and are currently assessed at the same rate could
have widely varying prices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Hezekiah Brown, a labor negotiator who says his
home in a predominantly African-American neighborhood in Hempstead
is worth around $200,000, pays a little over $8,000 a year in
property taxes. He said a house similar to his in nearby Garden
City was worth more than $400,000, but the owners also paid $8,000
a year in taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Carter said a Justice Department study compared the assessed and
market values of more than 11,000 residential properties in Nassau
from August 1995 through July 1996 with Census Bureau figures. The
study showed that the average assessment in predominantly minority
areas was 27 percent higher than the total average assessment rate
of all property in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a result, owners of residential property in minority
communities have for years borne a disproportionate share of the
cost of governmental services that are funded by real property
taxes,'' Carter said in his letter, dated March 2. Carter's letter
and the Justice Department's findings were first reported Monday by
Newsday.
</P>
<P>
   Nassau County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta defended the county's
property tax system as fair and as one that had been upheld by the
courts. He had no immediate comment on Monday's court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 study by the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee estimated
that a reassessment would cost at least $40 million. Gulotta said
such a step ``may be harmful and costly to our taxpayers,
regardless of race or national origin.''
</P>
<P>
   Gulotta noted that the county recently enacted a year-round
grievance system enabling property owners to appeal their
assessments.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the appeals have been so successful, they have cost the
county more than $100 million in tax refunds, which it has had to
borrow. In the view of some critics, this expense indicates that
the old assessment system should be revised to help solve the
county's fiscal crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The county's $2.3 billion budget has become so structurally
imbalanced that Standard &AMP; Poor's recently lowered the county's
credit rating to A-minus and placed its bonds on a credit watch. It
is facing a $160 million deficit for 1998 and a projected $125
million deficit for 1999, despite the generally robust health of
Long Island's economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, a revision of its assessment procedures would not help
the county's finances, said Richard J. Marino, a director at
Standard &AMP; Poor's. ``It might shift the burden around among the
taxpayers, but the financial outcome would be the same,'' he said.

LYCOS BOARD MEMBER QUITS TO PROTEST DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pressing his campaign to block the proposed deal between Lycos
Inc. and USA Networks Inc., David Wetherell, who controls the
largest block of Lycos stock, has resigned from the Lycos board.
Wetherell is the chairman of CMGI Inc., a technology investment
fund that owns 18.5 percent of Lycos.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Lycos, the Internet search service, agreed to a
complex transaction in which it would gain control of the Home
Shopping Network and Ticketmaster units of USA Networks, the media
and electronic-commerce company, which is based in New York. It
would also acquire Ticketmaster Online Citysearch, a public company
mostly owned by USA. In return, USA would gain control of 61.5
percent of Lycos' shares.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell voted in favor of the proposal when it came before the
Lycos board. But he started to voice doubts as Lycos shares fell
sharply; they have now lost more than a third of their value since
the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Wetherell said Monday: ``After further
consideration, it is my opinion that the terms of the USA/Lycos
transaction are inadequate for Lycos shareholders. As such, I am
resigning from the Lycos board in order to be free to explore the
best options available to Lycos shareholders, including the
possibility of Lycos remaining independent.''
</P>
<P>
   William White, the president of CMGI's Internet unit, declined
to say whether Wetherell had proposed any alternative transactions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is to get the maximum return for Lycos shareholders
including CMGI,'' White said in an interview Monday evening.
``There is no specific proposal we can talk about.'' He said that
CMGI did not object to a combination of Lycos with Home Shopping
Network and Ticketmaster, but its position was that Lycos
shareholders should own a larger share of the combined company.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell met with Barry Diller, the chairman of USA, shortly
after the deal was announced. And he has had frequent conversations
with Robert Davis, the chief executive of Lycos, White said.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers said Wetherell's opposition was a blow to the
proposal but hardly a fatal one. Many shareholders who did not like
the deal have already sold their holdings to lock in their profits,
they said, and thus much of the stock is already in the hands of
investors who want to own the combined company. Lycos shareholders
are to vote on the deal in three or four months.
</P>
<P>
   Executives of Lycos and USA did not respond to phone messages
left at their offices Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has roots in the direct mail and software industries and
has evolved into one of the savviest investors in Internet
companies.

CAN'T GET ENOUGH VITALE AUDIO? TRY ESPN.COM
</HEADLINE>

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ESPN.com knew exactly what it was doing when it picked today's
scheduled chat with college basketball analyst Dick Vitale as the
site's first audio chat.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious.
</P>
<P>
   When someone is screaming ``Diaper dan-dees!'' or ``Eeet's
Mee-sha-gan, baybee! (It's Michigan, baby!),'' the translation gets
lost as transcribed text. You have to have ``sound'', and Vitale _
like it or not, baybee _ is all about audio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Text doesn't reflect sarcasm and jokes,'' said Ted Bishop,
ESPN.com's interact department manager. ``With Dick, we have
someone who talks with so much enthusiasm that you want to be able
to capture it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Vitale's chat is scheduled for 3:30 p.m. today. ESPN.com users
can log on to the site's chat section and post questions as usual.
If all goes as planned, users will be able to see Vitale's
responses on screen and hear him answer selected questions.
</P>
<P>
   Multimedia chat has been tried before. ABCNEWS.com conducted a
video chat with television anchor Peter Jennings two years ago.
America Online had a video chat session with Koko the gorilla last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said he doesn't believe the online video technology,
which tends to be choppy, is advanced enough for entertaining video
chat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm all for entertainment for the user, and I'm not sure (if
video) adds a lot,'' Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   The Vitale audio chat will be watched carefully to see if other
audio chats can be produced, Bishop said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this gets to be such a production, we'll need to take that
into consideration; at the same time, you want to get the
(traffic),'' Bishop said. ``I'll doubt that you 'll see this become
the standard.''
</P>
<P>
   FOR THOSE WHO PLAN AHEAD ...: Fans of the National Finals Rodeo
better hold off awhile if they're planning to conceive a baby.
</P>
<P>
   Using its handy due-date function, the Baby Center
(www.babycenter.com/conflicts) can calculate what major sporting
events can be missed for parents-to-be. For example, if a couple
plans to conceive this week, they face the chance of missing the
NFR, which is scheduled Dec. 3-12 in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The site lists 3,000 sporting events that could be missed as the
result of a conception within a particular time frame. Also listed
are handy directions to the hospital from your favorite sporting
event.
</P>
<P>
   The due-date calculator includes a disclaimer, stating only 5
percent of births occur on the due date.
</P>
<P>
   AUDIO CHECK: Good news for March Madness fans confined to their
office cubicles: Broadcast.com is providing live audio coverage of
every NCAA men's and women's basketball tournament game.
Broadcast.com apparently believes it has the demographics for this.
In a news release, the Dallas multimedia company pointed out that

ALLIED WASTE BUYS BFI IN MEGADEAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. _ Allied Waste Industries Inc., a Scottsdale
garbage company whose Harley-riding executives have been on a
non-stop buying spree, bagged its biggest deal yet Monday when it
announced a $9 billion acquisition of larger rival Browning-Ferris
Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, which will be based in Scottsdale, will be
the second-largest waste-management firm in the country and will
probably steal the crown as Arizona's largest public company from
Avnet Inc. Allied Waste and BFI together have sales of about $6.6
billion; Avnet's sales totaled $5.9 billion last fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Waste also will become Arizona's fourth ``Fortune'' 500
company, ranking in the top half of the annual list.
Browning-Ferris on its own was No. 273 on the 1998 list.
</P>
<P>
   The blockbuster deal, heavily rumored last summer, was cinched
early Monday in New York after a weekend of negotiations and board
meetings, Allied Waste Chief Executive Officer Tom Van Weelden
said. Allied Waste initiated the talks five weeks ago, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Waste will pay $45 a share in cash for each share of BFI
stock, or $7.3 billion, plus assume $1.8 billion in debt, valuing
the deal at approximately $9.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   That dwarfs the proposed buyout of America West Airlines, which
had a price tag of about $1 billion, and ranks as one of the
largest transactions in Arizona business history.
</P>
<P>
   Starwood Hotel's $14.6 billion purchase of ITT Sheraton last
year was bigger, but the company was managed out of New York and
soon moved its headquarters there. Excluding that deal, the only
thing close to Allied Waste's deal was Eli Lilly's $4 billion
purchase of PCS Health Systems Inc. in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   BFI's stock rose $4.50 on the news, to $38.88. Allied Waste's
stock, which fell $5 a share Friday, rose $1.94, to $16.94.
</P>
<P>
   Van Weelden called the pairing ``an almost perfect marriage,''
noting that the two companies only overlap in 20 to 25 markets
across North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you find is a very complementary mix and not an
anti-competitive mix,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In markets where there is overlap, Van Weelden said the company
will have to sell operations due to antitrust concerns. Analysts
cite Chicago, Atlanta and Southern California as among the areas
likely to see divestitures.
</P>
<P>
   There is virtually no overlap in Arizona, as BFI's only
operation is a landfill in La Paz County.
</P>
<P>
   BFI's familiar blue trucks used to pick up garbage in the state
but those operations were bought last year by USA Waste, which then
turned around and acquired Waste Management. The combined company,
which took the Waste Management name, is No. 1 in the industry with
about $12 billion in sales last year.
</P>
<P>
   Allied Waste also likely will sell some of BFI's non-solid-waste
businesses. Altogether, the sales and divestitures are expected to
raise $900 million next year, which will be used to pay down Allied
Waste's hefty debt load from the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like the transaction, which must be approved by the
U.S. Justice Department and other regulators, as well as BFI
shareholders. They say Allied Waste is a young, nimble, efficient
company with a good track record of getting the most out of
companies it acquires.
</P>
<P>
   BFI, in contrast, has a bigger bureaucracy and has struggled to
cut costs in recent years to stay competitive. At the same time, it
has a well-known name and nationwide network.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allied is acquiring a poorly managed, underperforming company
with good market positions and strong assets,'' Cotton Swindell of
BT Alex Brown Inc. said in a report Monday.
</P>
<P>
   He maintained his buy rating on Allied Waste's stock.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Oline, a vice president with Duff &AMP; Phelps Credit Rating in
Chicago, said there's much to be gained in a merger of two garbage
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The larger Allied Waste will instantly have more landfills. That
means drivers won't have to truck garbage as far as in the past in
certain markets, saving lots of money.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you want to do is have your trucks on the street picking
up the garbage, not driving around,'' Oline said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Weelden puts it this way: ``This is truly a business where
two and two make five.''
</P>
<P>
   Oline said Allied Waste's bigger debt load is a concern, as the
company already was more leveraged than the average company in the
industry. But he notes that BFI's debt level was relatively light,
and that Allied Waste can use its substantial cash flow as well as
asset sales to reduce the acquisition debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has some flexibility to pay it down,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Weelden and Allied Waste's other top executives will run the
combined company. There will be job losses, most significantly in
BFI's home base of Houston since the headquarters are going away,
but Van Weelden wouldn't provide any estimates.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a transaction that will take over a year after it
closes to transfer all of the moves across from one company to
another,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Weelden did say it's not a given that all the BFI office
jobs retained will be based in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phoenix is not the cheapest job market in the country,'' he
said, adding that Houston has a lower cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was unanimously approved by each company's board
of directors, is expected to close in the fall. &QL;

EDITORIAL: BILLY JACK GAITHER'S LIFE AND DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in and editorial on Tuesday, March 9:
</P>
<P>
   Only 40 miles from the freedom and anonymity of Birmingham,
Ala., Billy Jack Gaither chose to stay in Sylacauga, population
13,000 souls, none of them openly gay. He worked in a nearby
factory and lived at home with his parents, caring for them. In his
bedroom, Gaither hung a picture of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable in
``Gone With the Wind'' _ the classic image for Southerners of life
lost that might have been. In the living room, where he never
troubled his devoutly Baptist parents with the truth about his
homosexuality, he hung renderings of Jesus and the Ten
Commandments. One of them seems especially his: ``Do Unto Others as
You Would Have Them Do Unto You.`
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work. Three weeks ago Billy Jack Gaither was beaten to
death with an ax handle and burned like rubbish on a pile of old
tires. The sheriff's office says two men have confessed to doing it
because they knew that Gaither was gay. One has suggested he
propositioned them.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. Maybe not. The adult response to an unwanted
invitation is ``No, thanks.'' Or just ``No.'' But there are other
lessons to take from Billy Jack Gaither's selfless life and
monstrous death. He apparently kept the core of himself from his
family and straight friends and co-workers because he thought it
would offend them. That has always been the code of the South. But
secrets confer guilt on those who keep them _ they make bigots
think those people have cause for shame, and shame lures bigots to
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Governments need to say _ because citizens need to know _ that
it is illegal to discriminate against people just because of who
they are. The state of Alabama should include sexual orientation in
its hate-crime law. It is the right thing to do.

WASTE GIANTS THRIVE IN SLOW-GROWTH INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RUSS WILES  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Thomas Van Weelden, the head of Allied Waste
Industries Inc., once told a joke about why it's hard to retain
upwardly mobile managers in the solid-waste business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of guys come in, spend six months learning everything
there is to know about the garbage business, then want to know
what's next,'' said Van Weelden, the company's president, chairman
and chief executive officer. ``There is nothing next. You just go
back out and get more garbage collected.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with the Internet and other revolutionary businesses,
there's nothing exciting about solid waste. The industry is about
as basic as they come, and investors have turned their attention
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Waste-management stocks rose just 8.7 percent on average last
year, compared with 26.7 percent for the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index. They also had been lagging in 1999 before Monday's
announcement that Allied Waste would purchase rival Browning Ferris
Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a mature business,'' said Stewart Scharf, a stock analyst
for Standard &AMP; Poor's. The garbage industry in recent years has
been marked by low volume growth and weak pricing, he said, with
profit margins squeezed by increasingly stringent government
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Internal growth has averaged less than 5 percent a year, added
David Cohen, an analyst for Value Line in New York. He terms the
industry's overall prospects as ``lackluster.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Allied Waste and a few other firms have thrived, partly by
using their size and managerial skills to acquire and integrate
smaller operations. The Scottsdale company completed 14 purchases
in 1998's fourth quarter alone. Small, private operators haul
roughly 30 percent of the nation's trash, and these companies are
finding it increasingly difficult to compete against the giants.
</P>
<P>
   Acquisitions enable a surviving company to eliminate certain
trash-hauling routes, mothball trucks, reduce administrative staffs
and realize other ``synergies,'' said Linda Bolton Weiser, who
manages the Alliance Global Environment Fund in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Privatizations also present opportunities for well-positioned
firms such as Allied Waste. Municipalities collect and dump roughly
one-third of the nation's trash, yet many cities and counties would
rather turn these tasks over to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Bolton Weiser is optimistic about investing in solid-waste
stocks. She said pricing for garbage-collection services has
started to increase, partly because few landfills are being built
and partly because a recent wave of mergers has reduced competition
among big players.
</P>
<P>
   Other blockbuster deals in recent months have included Waste
Management's merger with USA Waste Services and Safety-Kleen's
combination with Laidlaw Environmental. The Waste Management-USA
Waste deal, which closed in July, has resulted in noticeable
cost-cutting, Bolton Weiser said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen cites Allied Waste and Waste Management as two firms that
have been able to boost their profit margins over the past five
years thanks to efficiencies that result from acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   As a further lure, the solid-waste business is relatively immune
to economic cycles _ a factor that may make the stocks attractive
among recession-wary investors.
</P>
<P>
   In today's low-inflation environment, Bolton Weiser said,
``There are few industries with a positive pricing trend, but this
is one of them.'' &QL;

 By MICKEY HERSKOWITZ  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
JOLTIN' Joe has left and gone away.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A wave of Joe DiMaggio obituaries had been prepared months ago,
after his surgery for lung cancer, when he rallied from one crisis
after another. He had been given the last rites two or three times.
When he awoke from a coma, his first words were to tell his doctor
to quit releasing bulletins to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Those tales of his death were premature. But he slipped away
early Monday, at 84, with the dignity and privacy that were so much
a part of his persona. Contrary to the words of the poet Dylan
Thomas, he did go ``gentle into that good night.'' He had defied
time and death longer than anyone expected, and we had been well
warned. Still, the news saddened us. It was a loss not only to
baseball but to an America that once was and will never be again.
</P>
<P>
   He was the last custodian of the tradition the New York Yankees
created in the 1920s, the Babe Ruth era. When he retired after the
1951 World Series, he said simply, ``I'm not Joe DiMaggio
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew what he meant, but he could not have been more
wrong. No one in sports, and maybe anywhere, was more consistent,
more certain of who he was, more faithful to his legend or his
fans.
</P>
<P>
   I once collaborated with DiMaggio on a photo layout for a sports
magazine. He picked his five favorite New York restaurants, and the
headline read: ``A Great Night at the Plate After a Great Day at
the Plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Few athletes of this century had more great days than the Yankee
Clipper, whose 56-game hitting streak in 1941 electrified the
country and remains the Mona Lisa of vintage baseball records.
</P>
<P>
   I remember meeting Joe DiMaggio in the parking garage of the
Shamrock Hilton Hotel, after a baseball dinner, many years after
his heroic career had ended. A friend turned to introduce him to a
group of us and discovered that Joe had slipped behind a pillar,
hoping he would not be noticed.
</P>
<P>
   Then he walked over, ducking his head and grinning, as if to
acknowledge we had caught him fair and square. He shook hands and
made polite small talk until the cars came.
</P>
<P>
   On another night, he was in Houston for an old-timers game at
the Astrodome, and a young artist recruited me to ask if Joe would
autograph a portrait she had sketched from a photograph. He did not
consider it an imposition. I regretted not getting his signature
for myself.
</P>
<P>
   These are thin memories, but I cling to them because I never saw
Joe DiMaggio play, except on the black-and-white film clips that
showed him at bat, striding into a pitch, the stance always wide,
or catching a fly ball over his shoulder. In my imagination, he is
always tall and lean and full of grace, which means I saw him play,
nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The closest I came to knowing DiMaggio was in co-authoring a
book with Mickey Mantle, who played one season with Joe, succeeded
him in center field and knew him very little.
</P>
<P>
   Mantle called him ``the best all-around player in history. My
locker was next to his, but I thought it would be out of line for
me to speak to him first. As a result, we hardly spoke the entire
season. I should have asked Joe to help me in some way. I think he
would have liked that, and we might have become friends.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mick admired him greatly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing not to like about Joe,'' he said. ``He
wouldn't let just anybody get close to him, and after a certain
time in my career, I understood that.''
</P>
<P>
   Mantle could not picture strangers coming up to Joe D., as they
did to Mick, draping an arm around his shoulder and spilling beer
in his lap. Mantle, who lived faster and harder, died of cancer in
1994, at 63.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio could be distant and austere, but he was a man of
honor, unforgiving of conduct he regarded as crude, cheap or below
the belt.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1947 World Series, Jackie Robinson of the Dodgers went
out of the baseline to throw a rolling block into the Yankees'
shortstop, Phil Rizzuto, who was turning a double play. There was
some booing, and then the inning was over. Later in the game,
DiMaggio ran out a routine ground ball, and Robinson, who was
playing first base and not very experienced at it, had his foot
planted on the bag. It was almost an invitation to a spiking, but
Joe swerved as he crossed the bag and avoided him.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, a New York writer asked Joe why he hadn't
retaliated after what Jackie had done to Rizzuto. DiMaggio
considered the question for a moment and said, ``I thought about it
running down to first base. Then it occurred to me that Phil's an
Italian, I'm an Italian, and Robinson is black. I didn't want
anyone to think it was (racial). If Jackie was an Italian, I guess
I would have spiked him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need to recite Joe's numbers. His greatness was
established long ago. But his class can't be reduced to math. When
Chuck Dressen was a Yankees coach, he once protested an umpire's
call by flinging towels out of the dugout. Joe was at his side
instantly. ``Go out and pick up that stuff now,'' he ordered. ``On
this ballclub, when we don't like decisions, we don't throw things.
We hit home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   In his later years, DiMaggio was more open and accessible. Like
a lot of men when they pass 60, Joe began to enjoy some of the
attention he had avoided for so many years. He decided it was a
nice thing to walk into a restaurant and have the customers give
you a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The fans always understood there was not going to be another era
like his, when he led the Yankees to the World Series 10 times,
winning on nine occasions. There isn't going to be another Joe
DiMaggio. In that sense, he hasn't gone away after all.

THEATER REVIEW: A KILLER JUST LOADED WITH CHARM 
</HEADLINE>
 (Eds.: Production notes at end of review.) 
(nk) 
 By BEN BRANTLEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``I'm a pretty little fellow,'' sings Matthew
Broderick, alone on the stage of the Lyceum Theater, and at that
moment, he certainly is. His eyes shut, his voice sweet and liquid,
the open-faced Broderick has never looked or sounded so much the
choirboy, as he croons a phrase from the dusty sentimental favorite
``Mighty Lak' a Rose.''
</P>
<P>
   Maternal instincts should be running riot in the audience. But
since Broderick's character has just committed, and obviously
relished, a brutal murder, responses are a tad more complicated.
Yes, he's a coldblooded killer, and yes, he's a pretty little
fellow of inexhaustible charm. One doesn't rule out the other, and
Broderick, in a beautifully balanced performance, gets to have it
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   So, for that matter, does this utterly disarming revival of the
1935 melodrama ``Night Must Fall,'' which opened Monday night under
John Tillinger's direction.
</P>
<P>
   The Welsh-born playwright Emlyn Williams translated a lifelong
obsession with grisly murder cases and a more recent one with a
charismatic drifter he had befriended into this tale of a
psychopathic hotel bellboy and the women who love him. It was, by
the standards of the day, strong meat. ``As one chap to another,
don't you think it's just the teensiest, weensiest bit unpleasant
here and there?'' teased Noel Coward in a letter to Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the very point of ``Night Must Fall,'' in which
Williams starred both in London (where it was a hit) and New York
(where it wasn't), was that the unspeakably unpleasant can become
compelling spectator sport. In the age of the posthumous stardom of
JonBenet Ramsey, it's hard to argue that things have changed.
</P>
<P>
   Yet with its conspicuously well-made dramatic architecture and
groaning lines like ``Come away, my darling'' and ``You can't stay
in this house tonight!,'' Williams' potboiler would seem to invite
only campy revivals. That's why the greatest thrill of this new
incarnation, even counting that moment in the second act when the
whole audience screams, is in seeing how a mothball-scented
property can be turned anew into agile and seductive theater.
</P>
<P>
   With a little script tweaking, a subliminally surreal visual
presentation and a stylish cast that understands the difference
between a wink and a grimace, this production from Tony Randall's
National Actors Theater works engagingly on two levels. It starts
off as a spooky fun house, with the obligatory creaks and shrieks.
But as it continues, it makes respectful breathing space for
Williams' considerations of the magnetic appeal of the lurid and of
the idea that extraordinary evil can take the most ordinary forms.
</P>
<P>
   The show isn't perfect: It doesn't quite bring off its principal
climaxes, and it overexaggerates some of its comic servant
business. But it's a surprisingly delicate and compelling treatment
of the sort of material usually delivered as ghoulish parody.
</P>
<P>
   The tone is established with an interpolated prologue in which
thunder claps, a scream resounds, a shadowy figure is perceived
through a window and voila, you have the basic alphabet of a
specific suspense genre, the kind on which Hollywood once thrived.
The designer James Noone's representation of a comfortable sitting
room in a woodland house in Essex, England, is correspondingly
executed entirely in black and white, as are the period costumes by
Jess Goldstein. (Note for Broadway trend spotters: the same palette
is found in Trevor Nunn's current production of ``Not About
Nightingales.'') And spine-tingling music (by David Van Tieghem)
underlines ominous revelations.
</P>
<P>
   The implicit message is that you have entered a passe world in
which even unsavory subjects were presented with comparative
innocence, in terms as simple as black and white. Our relation to
that world would seem to be roughly that of the characters onstage
to ``East Lynne,'' the famously stilted 19th-century novel that is
being read aloud to an elderly woman when the play begins.
</P>
<P>
   That woman is the hypochondriacal Mrs. Bramson (Judy Parfitt),
who might as well have ``victim'' stamped on her forehead. She is
peevish, rudely dictatorial to her servants and restless young
companion, Olivia (J. Smith-Cameron), and rolling in cash she
insists on keeping at home. Enter, smiling, young Dan ( Broderick),
a chipper Irish lad (Welsh in the original) who has impregnated
Mrs. Bramson's maid, Dora (Seana Kofoed), and been summoned to
account for himself.
</P>
<P>
   He does; he stays. His arrival happens to coincide with the news
that a woman has disappeared from the hotel where he works. And
what is in that mysteriously sealed hatbox he brings with him?
</P>
<P>
   You can probably imagine what follows, down to the moment where
Mrs. Bramson finds herself all alone in her big, dark house. But in
between Broderick, Ms. Parfitt and Ms. Smith-Cameron enact an
uneasy dance of attraction and repulsion that occurs less in clear
black and white than in gray zones.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was partly sending up the fascination with sensational
acts of violence, that mix of prurience and displaced guilt that is
here amusingly embodied by the reactions of Olivia's patient,
ineffectual suitor, nicely played by Michael Countryman, and Mrs.
Bramson's cook, Patricia Kilgarriff. But Williams was also
seriously acknowledging the lure of the amoral, reflected in
Olivia's increasing attraction to a man she believes to be a
murderer.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith-Cameron has the toughest role, a sort of eroticized
Nancy Drew part, but she plays it with a canny directness, lightly
flavored with an acerbic artificiality. Ms. Parfitt, who played a
similar role in the film ``Dolores Claiborne,'' is wonderful,
bringing an unseemly glimmer of sensuality to her disagreeable
imaginary invalid's relationship with Dan. And when she sinks into
rabid fear, Ms. Parfitt conveys it so harrowingly that you start to
feel tainted for having rooted for her demise.
</P>
<P>
   Broderick's terrifically smart, fully engaged portrait of a
sociopath may unnerve audiences much as Robert Montgomery,
traditionally known as a suave romantic lead, did in the same role
in the 1937 movie. There has always been a feral cunning and
confidence in Broderick's stage and screen portrayals of precocious
boys and boyish men.
</P>
<P>
   Here, he wears that cockiness as the gleaming shell on a murky,
swirling interior. This boy can be as smooth as Astaire, but when
the shell cracks, what you see is not a cold executioner but a
thwarted, egocentric child, and it helps explain Olivia's
continuing protection of a deranged murderer.
</P>
<P>
   What Williams was asking, in his deceptively jocular way, was
that we own up to the part of us that will always be drawn to
darkness. The all too charming Broderick makes it unsettlingly easy
for us to do so.

UCLA'S FARNHAM IS MORE THAN JUST A `RUDY'
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA walk-on Sean Farnham likes ``Rudy,'' the
movie about a Notre Dame student who fulfills his dream by playing
football for the Irish. Farnham owns a copy of the film and he
watched it over Christmas break.
</P>
<P>
   However, he does not like Rudy, the comparison. In fact, he
hates it. He's seen Rudy and he's no Rudy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed his ability to persist in situations far more
challenging than I've seen at UCLA,'' said Farnham, a junior
forward. ``But he played for one play his senior year _ that's the
only time he suited up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear (the comparison) a lot and it frustrates me. In the
movie, the whole team tells the coach they won't suit up unless
Rudy plays. That didn't happen here. No one had to ask coach (Steve
Lavin) to let me play. Comparing me to Rudy makes it seem like I
don't deserve to be out there, like it's charity or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnham, a native of Clayton, Calif., was a recruited walk-on in
1996 _ meaning the Bruins suspected he could contribute but weren't
impressed enough to offer a scholarship. He played sparingly for
two years but has scurried up the depth chart this season with
solid play and high spirits. That's where his story and Rudy's tale
diverge: Farnham has earned his minutes, and without injured center
Dan Gadzuric, the Bruins need him: they're 6-0 in games he's
started.
</P>
<P>
   A 6-foot-5 power forward, Farnham specializes in passing,
setting screens, defense and rebounding. He runs the floor well and
he's UCLA's most fundamentally sound player. Unlike his more gifted
teammates, Farnham does not attempt what he cannot accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   He'd have been perfect for Gene Hackman's team in ``Hoosiers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a throw-back player,'' Bruins coach Steve Lavin said.
``He plays the game the way it was played in the 1950s and '60s. He
understands his strengths and weaknesses and plays within himself.
He doesn't do anything outside his capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Farnham is smaller but more talented than Bob Myers, the former
walk-on who played sparingly from 1994-97. Farnham started every
game for his final 2{ years at Concord De La Salle High, which
produced the Barry brothers, Jon and Brent, but is better known as
a football powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   His watershed game came in the 1996 state playoffs against
Crenshaw, when Lavin, an assistant at the time, watched him score
22 points and grab seven rebounds. The next day, ex-UCLA coach Jim
Harrick called. It didn't take much for Farnham to shun the Big Sky
scholarship offers _ he planned to sign with Montana _ and join the
Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   Because of personnel shortages, UCLA gave Farnham a scholarship
for two years. But last summer, when Lavin secured his second big
recruiting class and the roster expanded, Farnham's conditional
free ride was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was tough to swallow,'' he said. ``It made me question
whether there would be an opportunity for me here. It would have
been easy to sulk with all those freshmen coming in.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Farnham spent the summer lifting weights and jumping
rope. He reported for practice 15 pounds heavier and a step
quicker. He started the Arizona game, figuring that was his 15
minutes, then returned to the end of the bench. When he played 11
enthusiastic minutes in the lethargic loss at Cal, Lavin annointed
him a starter. He stayed in the lineup for five games.
</P>
<P>
   With 146 minutes and 30 points this season, Farnham has tripled
and doubled his career totals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's living a dream,'' said UCLA sophomore Todd Ramasar,
Farnham's closest friend. ``He's always been excitable, but he's
even more excited now.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he was recognized in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at a Costco and the checkout guy asked, `Are you Sean
Farnham? Well, good job,' '' Farnham said with a grin. ``I thought,
`Wow, the guy recognized me.' Then two older people tapped me on
the shoulder and said, `We're season-ticket holders and we love the
way you play.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember my freshman year, and everybody recognized Toby
(Bailey) and Charles (O'Bannon). Now they're starting to notice
that Sean Farnham plays for UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   And Rudy doesn't.

<P>
   PHOENIX _ I have seen him on the TV screen a thousand times: the
same clip they always show, Joe DiMaggio in grainy black and white
cruising in broad stride from deep center into shallow right,
cutting off the parallax of a baseball with his outstretched glove.
</P>
<P>
   What is so riveting about that bit of film is what is so
riveting about DiMaggio. Like the mathematically prescribed arc of
the batted ball, he seemed to move as a force of physics. DiMaggio
and the ball might as well have been the paths of two mesons
colliding in a cloud chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Others might gallop, or rumble or lumber in the field. Babe Ruth
had his famous mincing trot. But DiMaggio moved as effortlessly and
surely as a cat, showing neither effort, nor calculation nor the
constraining weight of human flesh.
</P>
<P>
   He was just as smooth at the plate. With his wide stance and the
controlled torsion of his swing, he stood after hitting the ball
with his straight left leg and beaky nose pointed in tandem to the
place the ball was headed, and his right leg bent behind him and
the bat wrapped around his back. It was a perfect swing he
possessed, and as effortless as his fielding, his base-running and
his rare but toothy smile.
</P>
<P>
   But while he was certainly one of the handful of greatest
players of all times _ in 1969, on the centennial of professional
baseball, a poll of sportswriters named DiMaggio the greatest ever
_ there were other ballplayers with swings nearly as sweet and
other outfielders who amazed the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   What made DiMaggio important, not just on the ball field, but
for the rest of his long life, 47 years after he retired from the
game, was that he carried himself, on and off the field, with such
dignity and grace that he transcended the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to imagine now, when nearly all professional
athletes seem to be spoiled crybabies, grabbing for money, looking
to build up their personal statistics and yelling ``throw me the
damn ball,'' but DiMaggio always acted as an adult.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that he couldn't be emotional. There are two or three
episodes recorded where he showed his feelings. Once when Dodger
outfielder Al Gionfriddo caught what should have been a DiMaggio
home run in the 1947 World Series, DiMaggio kicked the dirt in
front of second base in disgust.
</P>
<P>
   More profoundly, he could be seen barely containing his tears at
the funeral of his second wife, Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   But what made those moments seem mythically important was that
he didn't cheapen them by supplying too many of them.
</P>
<P>
   He was as under control as a Greek or Roman epic hero, and
always true to himself. And, as a Hector or Aeneas, he spoke to
something in each of us, some person we would wish we could be.
</P>
<P>
   Each of us finds in ourselves some shortcoming, a moment we
blurted out what should have remained unsaid, a time we acted
selfishly when we should have given in, a time we were lazy at just
the moment some extra exertion would have brought us success.
</P>
<P>
   We always want to think those are exceptions, that our real
selves are found in the noble gestures we are capable of at our
peak moments.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us are fragmented personalities bagged in a single
skin.
</P>
<P>
   But DiMaggio always seemed to be of a piece. On or off the
field, his life was equally as dignified. He managed, by choice or
genes, to be a unified personality, and thus seemed to transcend
the vicissitudes of human frailty.
</P>
<P>
   Even his baseball career is marked by its consistency.
</P>
<P>
   He joined the Yankees two years after Babe Ruth retired, and his
last season was also Mickey Mantle's first, so he spanned the
middle period of the Yankees' incredible four-decade dominance of
major league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   During his 13 years, the Yankees won 10 pennants and nine World
Series titles. He was named league MVP three times _ a feat never
surpassed _ compiled a career batting average of .325, won two
batting titles and topped 100 RBIs nine times.
</P>
<P>
   He won the home run title twice and logged in 361 dingers for
his career, matched to only 369 strikeouts, a ratio unheard of
among sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   His greatest record is also the most difficult measure of
consistent play. He hit successfully in 56 consecutive games, from
May 15 through July 16, 1941. No one else among the 15,000 men who
have played major league baseball even comes close: Second place is
12 games behind.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody recalls that after that hitless 57th game,
DiMaggio went on another tear of 16 games, making 72 games out of
73 with at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   And not everybody recalls that DiMaggio had an earlier streak of
61 consecutive games with a hit, in 1933, when he played for the
Seals.
</P>
<P>
   It is that kind of consistency as a player that made DiMaggio
special.
</P>
<P>
   During the 56-game streak, he batted .408, scored 56 runs and
drove in another 55, accounting for an average of just under two
runs per game. The Yankees won 41 of those games.
</P>
<P>
   But these are merely statistics, and as Jimmy Breslin once said,
``Baseball isn't statistics, it's Joe DiMaggio rounding second
base.''
</P>
<P>
   Or playing center field.
</P>
<P>
   As Yankee teammate Phil Rizzuto once said, ``He'd just be there.
You'd turn your head as a screeching line drive would be headed
toward the alley between left and center and you knew, you just
knew from years of experience, that it was going to the wall. By
the time your head turned all the way around to follow, Joe would
be there, just waiting for it, like you'd wait for a bus. I don't
know how he got there, but he was there.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio wasn't perfect; he had faults. He sometimes seemed
surly to teammates and sportswriters, although it was just as
likely that he was exhibiting painful shyness. Both his marriages
ended in divorce for the same reason: DiMaggio's old-fashioned view
of women and their role. It is hard to imagine him expecting Monroe
to stay home and saute the pork chops, but that was, indeed, his
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   But, no matter how out of date his expectations were, they were
consistent. His insistence on his public dignity came from the same
Old World view of life.
</P>
<P>
   It must have taken that secure view of the world to allow him to
shill for the Bowery Savings Bank and Mr. Coffee and never seem
goofy. He dripped elegance and always had: In 1940 he was named one
of the 10 best-dressed men in America.
</P>
<P>
   Many words have been used to describe DiMaggio. He has been
called elegant, and he was. It was said he had class, and he did,
although the word was most often mouthed by those who recognized
they didn't have it. And he has been called graceful.
</P>
<P>
   For me, it is this last that most accurately hits the mark. Joe
DiMaggio was touched by grace, that ineffable quality that descends
upon a select few, like a bit of divinity, and makes them burn just
a little more intensely and move with just a certain bit of
detachment from the world, as though they were in it but not of it.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix lawyer Curtis Beckman remembers seeing DiMaggio play in
Phoenix in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   Team owner Del Webb made a deal with New York Giants owner
Horace Stoneham to trade spring training sites. They played at the
old stadium on Central and Mohave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a 9-year-old boy and had started to like baseball, but
hadn't chosen a team to root for,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   It was DiMaggio's last year and there were so many people at the
spring training games that they put a rope up in center field so
that the excess crowd could sit in the far outfield grass and the
game could be played inside the rope.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember making my mind up about which team I was going to
be a fan of,'' Beckman recalls. ``I became a Yankee fan when Joe
DiMaggio was playing center field in front of me and glided across
the grass to catch a fly ball hit from Al Rosen. I could see the
No. 5 on his back. He became my hero then.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen in my life.'' &QL;

RANGERS DEFEAT MAPLE LEAFS, 3-2 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOE LAPOINTE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Playing against a top team that attacks with speed
and style, the Rangers could have been overwhelmed last night at
Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   They stood almost flat-footed in the early minutes while Toronto
zipped around them and scored twice within a minute to take a
two-goal lead.
</P>
<P>
   Last season's Rangers _ and even the Rangers of early this
season _ might have meekly allowed their undefeated streak to end
at that point.
</P>
<P>
   Not so for this team, not now. New York scored once late in the
first period to keep it close, once in the third to tie it and once
in overtime with 13.7 seconds remaining for a 3-2 victory that
ended with fans cheering as loudly as they have in two seasons as
players swarmed in celebration under flashing spotlights.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring the last two goals was Petr Nedved, who played with a
bloody cut stitched over his left eye and the big letter ``A'' of
the alternate captain stitched over his heart.
</P>
<P>
   Nedved wore the letter for the first time as a Ranger because
Ulf Samuelsson (concussion) was the latest player to leave the
lineup with a serious injury.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers also announced late in the game that Wayne Gretzky
will have a cortisone shot in the next 48 hours and will be
re-examined about a week after the injection.
</P>
<P>
   Minus Gretzky, the Rangers have turned to Nedved. His goals were
set up by Brian Leetch, the captain, who also set up the first one
by Kevin Stevens.
</P>
<P>
   Although many in the Ranger locker room praised Nedved, it was
Nedved who praised Leetch for sparking the Rangers to a six-game
undefeated streak, the last three of them victories.
</P>
<P>
   In raising their record to .500, the Rangers also tied the
Boston Bruins for the eighth and final playoff berth in the Eastern
Conference.
</P>
<P>
   With 18 games to play, the Rangers have 64 points.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers have played one more game than both the Bruins and
the Florida Panthers, who have 63 points.
</P>
<P>
   The tie extended the Rangers' undefeated streak to six games,
4-0-2. They are 7-2-2 in their last 11, their best stretch of the
season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feel great,'' Nedved said, referring to the playoff
position in the final stretch of the regular season. ``We have to
keep winning. It's a lot more fun. Before, we were afraid to make a
mistake. Now, the guys feel a lot looser.''
</P>
<P>
   They also seem more calm and less inclined to weaken under
adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Leetch said: ``You don't feel as tired or sore when you're
winning. It's all in front of us.'' He also praised Mike Richter,
who stopped 24 of 26 shots,
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike saves you,'' Leetch said. ``Instead of being down 3 or 4
to nothing, you stay within striking distance.''
</P>
<P>
   Leetch played 30 minutes 35 seconds and he put five shots on
goalie Glenn Healy.
</P>
<P>
   He frequently joined the attack and did not get discouraged when
his turnover in the first period accidentally set up Toronto's
first goal by Mike Johnson at 12:29. Toronto's Derek King scored 44
seconds later, but Stevens brought the Rangers back to 2-1 at 14:41
of the first period.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers gradually took control of the game by driving hard
to the net and controlling the puck in the Toronto zone.
</P>
<P>
   They finished with 35 shots on goal, the last of them on the
power play in overtime after Toronto's Lonny Bohonos was sent off
for boarding at 3:10 of the extra session.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Toronto Coach Pat Quinn yelled at the referee,
Paul Devorski, and threw a towel on the ice.
</P>
<P>
   On the Rangers' side, Coach John Muckler was in a better mood.
``It's like a snowball rolling down a hill,'' he said.``It's
getting getting bigger and bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Maple Leafs, who missed the playoffs last season, are one of
the best teams in the Eastern Conference this season and one of the
most entertaining in the National Hockey League.
</P>
<P>
   They came into the game with a league-best 201 goals-scored and
they added two in a 44-second span of the first period to lead,
2-0.
</P>
<P>
   Play leveled out in the scoreless second period and the Rangers
still trailed by just a goal as the third period began.

TROJANS COME CLEAN, BID WAS A SURPRISE
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Not everyone was so sure after all that USC would
receive a bid to the National Invitation Tournament. Sophomore
guard Jeff Trepagnier was among those willing to admit he was
stunned when the Trojans (15-12) received a bid to play Wyoming
(17-9) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really surprised,'' Trepagnier said. ``Cal had lost and
that meant we dropped to seventh place in the Pac-10, so I was kind
of doubtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Now that the shock is over, Trepagnier is confident the Trojans
can actually win the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``We figure we can go pretty far in this tournament,'' he said.
``We all want to go to New York, so we'll play extra hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier isn't the only Trojan with high hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play the way we're capable of playing, I know we can win
the whole thing,'' freshman forward David Bluthenthal added.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tough loss:The first postseason men's basketball appearance
for Pepperdine in five years might be dampened by the loss of one
of the Waves' key players.
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore forward Kelvin Gibbs, an honorable mention All-West
Coast Conference selection, has a swollen knee and is doubtful for
the Waves' first-round game Wednesday at Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't look like (Gibbs) will play,'' head coach Lorenzo
Romar said. ``He can barely walk.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs has an infection in the knee. He was healthy in the WCC
Tournament two weeks ago when he was the Waves' top scorer and
rebounder, averaging 16.5 points and 9.5 rebounds in two games.
</P>
<P>
   Marc McDowell, Pepperdine's standout sixth man, probably moves
into the starting lineup if Gibbs can't play.
</P>
<P>
   Even with Gibbs hobbling, Romar said he was ``ecstatic'' when he
found out the Waves had been invited to the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``In three years, we've made it to the NIT,'' he said, referring
to the Waves' 6-21 record in 1996-97. ``We've come further than a
lot of people have in three years.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Time change: Wednesday's USC game against Wyoming has been
changed to 6:08 p.m. (PST), instead of 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   __ Lobbying effort: USC is working on NIT officials to let the
Trojans host a second-round game if they defeat Wyoming.
</P>
<P>
   But it's unlikely considering their next opponent will be Oregon
or Georgia Tech. USC averaged 3,801 per game this year, while
Oregon averaged 8,158.

L.A. IN MIDDLE OF ROAD IN AGGRESSIVE DRIVING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH SULLIVAN and YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Gridlocked roads upset and frustrate but don't
necessarily lead to rage _ which is why Los Angeles ranked just
15th out of 37 urban areas for deaths caused by aggressive driving,
according to a study.
</P>
<P>
   The report found that deaths due to aggressive driving occurred
most often in spread-out, car-bound areas _ first among them San
Bernardino and Riverside counties _ where roads are gridlocked, but
not always.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sprawling, suburban-style communities like those we live
in have the highest rates, because people have to drive everywhere
and feel trapped behind the wheel,'' said Gloria Ohland, Southern
California project director for the Surface Transportation Policy
Project, a nonprofit think tank that released the study Monday.
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the list is the San Bernardino-Riverside area,
with 13.4 deaths per 100,000 people, or 178 deaths in 1996.
Tampa-St. Petersburg, Fla., took second, followed by Phoenix,
Ariz.; Orlando, Fla.; and Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles ranked 15th, with 728 aggressive driving deaths _
the largest overall number _ but that equaled just six deaths per
100,000 residents.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the best metropolitan area was Boston, despite its
reputation for bad drivers. It had only 2.1 aggressive driving
deaths per 100,000 people, according to the Los Angeles-based
group, backed by 200 environmental groups including several Sierra
Club chapters.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles' results surprised some, among them Granada Hills
resident Mona Galindo, who nearly was killed when an aggressive
driver ran a red light in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I would say, you see it in some form or another,''
said Galindo, 27, as she pumped gas at a Los Angeles service
station near her job. ``There are people cutting in and out of
lanes, people turning in front of you, running yellow lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles still ranked higher than other densely populated
cities such as Chicago, Boston and New York, &UR;  &LR; according to the
study, which is based on analysis of federal and state statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Faul, director of communications for the American
Automobile Association Foundation for Traffic Safety, said the
study's conclusions do not square with other studies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the exact opposite of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration study last year, that found the Northeast to
be the highest in unsafe driving behaviors,'' Faul said.
</P>
<P>
   The Surface Transportation Policy Project study did not examine
road rage, in which motorists react violently to others. Instead,
the study focused on aggressive or dangerous driving practices that
result in fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Those include speeding over 80 mph, tail-gating, failing to
yield, weaving in and out of traffic, passing on the right, making
unsafe lane changes and running stop signs and red lights. The
study estimates 56 percent of highway deaths in 1996 involved
aggressive driving.
</P>
<P>
   It took a close call to cure Galindo of her penchant for
aggressive driving, she said. Recently she was waiting at stoplight
but was glancing down and did not realize the light had turned
green. She was about to pull forward when a driver ran the opposing
red light.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to drive more aggressively, but now it's just too
dangerous,'' said Galindo, a workers' compensation claims
assistant. ``Now I get up early to go to work so I'm not in a rush.
I try to stay at the speed limit, I watch everybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution for aggressive driving is not to build more roads,
the study said. The 17 states with the highest aggressive driving
death rates, it pointed out, have more than twice the lane miles
per person than states with lower death rates.
</P>
<P>
   And areas with lower congestion have higher death rates, the
study found. That might be because congestion reduces speed _ a key
element in fatal collisions.
</P>
<P>
   But Faul took issue with that explanation as well, saying
congestion might reduce speed, but not collisions and injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Ohland agreed, saying the study was unable to measure aggressive
driving crashes because there are no federal statistics on that
issue available.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there were, we think L.A. would show up higher,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   While previous examinations of aggressive driving have focused
on changing drivers' behavior, Ohland said this was the first to
identify factors in the driving environment that contribute to the
problem. Long commutes increase the length of exposure to crashes
and pump up stress that leads to reckless driving, she suggested.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, the study suggests, is not improving highways, but
reducing their use. So the answer, Ohland said, is building
mixed-use communities where work, home, schools and shops are close
enough for a short drive _ or a walk or bike ride.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really believe that we need to plan communities so as to
reduce the need to drive,'' she said.

CAN DETROIT KEEP UCLA IN FIRST GEAR?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The UCLA Bruins can't seem to escape Miami. A year
ago, they repelled the Hurricanes in the final seconds of a
first-round NCAA Tournament game. Three months ago, UCLA lost a
fairly significant football game to the Hurricanes. And this week,
the Bruins play Miami again in the tournament's first round.
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost.
</P>
<P>
   The opponent will be Detroit when the teams collide Thursday in
the RCA Dome in Indianapolis, but the pace and style, the tenacity
and tempo, will remind UCLA of last year's opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very similar to Miami,'' UCLA coach Steve Lavin said.
</P>
<P>
   Except for this: Detroit's better.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins needed four free throws in the final 25 seconds to
banish the Hurricanes. If they aren't careful this week _ i.e.: if
they don't correct the mistakes from their 17-point loss at Arizona
_ they'll become the 17th No. 5 seed to lose in the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it'll be one of the more exciting games to watch,''
UCLA guard Baron Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   The Titans (24-5) aren't frantically reviewing videotape,
reconfiguring their strategy or studying the blueprint to beat UCLA
in March. They !ital!are the blueprint _ just like Princeton and
Miami.
</P>
<P>
   They play in first gear, with smothering defense and a patient
offense that will force UCLA to defend for 25-30 seconds per
possession. They will not take bad shots and they will not get
lulled into the speedy tempo UCLA adores. In recent years, that
combination has been a shock to UCLA's postseason system.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the Titans, who received an automatic berth as
champion of the Midwestern Collegiate Conference, have made no
attempt to disguise their strategy.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA is a West Coast team that likes to get out and run,''
Detroit forward Bacari Alexander said. ``We'll see if we can slow
them down.''
</P>
<P>
   They have the ingredients and experience to do it. The Titans
defeated Gonzaga in December and played Iowa to a one-point game in
Iowa City. They have two seniors and two juniors in the starting
lineup. They are tall, with 6-foot-11 center Walter Craft, and
tough. They have a future pro in senior guard Jermaine Jackson.
They have tournament experience, bouncing St. John's in the first
round last year, and are not happy just to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   They expect to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played well against all kinds of style,'' said Detroit's
sixth-year coach, Perry Watson, an assistant at Michigan during the
Fab Five years. ``We've got confidence in ourselves . . . and we've
been playing well.''
</P>
<P>
   To survive, UCLA must earn every point it scores. Just as Miami
coach Leonard Hamilton emphasized straightjacket defense, so does
Watson. The Titans ranked among the nation's leaders all season,
holding opponents to 64 points and 37 percent shooting. During
Detroit's current seven-game winning streak, opponents are shooting
34.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If the Bruins execute their offense as poorly as they did
Saturday at Arizona, they'll be home Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The word is out that Detroit is a solid team, but when a
smaller school plays a bigger school, the smaller school always has
something to prove,'' Titans guard Rashad Phillips said. ``They're
offensive minded and we're defensive minded. Something will have to
give.''

PETROFF TO HANDLE PAPERWORK
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There's been a shakeup on the USC football
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant head coach Larry Petroff will no longer coach the
tight ends and will only handle administrative matters. Petroff
will not be considered an on-field coach, and USC coach Paul
Hackett said he intends to hire another assistant to coach tight
ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I'm going to do,'' Hackett said Monday. ``I
haven't ruled out Larry coaching for the spring, but I'm going to
look at my options. I'm going to interview and bring in a number of
different guys. In the fall, we'll definitely have a (new)
tight-ends coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett already contacted Brian Schottenheimer, the son of
former Kansas City Chiefs coach Marty Schottenheimer about the
opening. But Brian Schottenheimer recently accepted a job as
wide-receivers coach with Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   A seemingly natural candidate would be former California
offensive coordinator Doug Cosbie, a former Dallas Cowboys tight
end who played under Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``He would be a candidate for this job,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   However, according to sources, it's unlikely Cosbie will be
offered the position.
</P>
<P>
   No other changes are expected on the USC coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   __ Positions change: Sophomore tight end Lonnie Ford has moved
to outside linebacker, the first of several possible position
changes for next season.
</P>
<P>
   Ford, who played defensive end in high school, decided to make
the switch after thinking about the move during the season.
</P>
<P>
   His decision hardly leaves USC thin at tight end. The Trojans
have junior Antoine Harris, redshirt freshman Scott Huber and true
freshmen Chad Cook and Jacob Rogers at the position.
</P>
<P>
   In another change, quarterback John Fox has moved to outside
linebacker. This is another switch for Fox, who decided last August
to play tight end. That experiment did not last, however, and Fox
eventually moved back to quarterback near the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Welch out: Offensive tackle Matt Welch has undergone surgery
on both shoulders and will miss spring practice, though he has
hopes of returning in the fall. Welch hurt his shoulders during the
season.
</P>
<P>
   Running back Malaefou MacKenzie, recovering from knee surgery,
will be limited in his action during spring practices. Also
questionable for the spring is wide receiver Stanley Guyness, who
tore knee ligaments near the end of the season.
</P>
<P>
   __ Faster offers: If USC changes one thing during recruiting
this year, it will be to offer scholarships faster. This past year,
only Hackett had the authority to offer scholarships, but the coach
said he will now allow other coaches to offer them.
</P>
<P>
   __ Spring-practice dates: The Trojans will open spring practice
March 26 and concludes April 23. There will be a scrimmage, open to
the public, on April 10 at Howard Jones Field.

YOUNG'S HIP INJURY PLAGUES BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ UCLA freshman Ray Young sleeps on his stomach, so
he has not suffered insomnia in recent days. When he sleeps any
other way, however, Young feels the pain of his hip pointer, a
bruised bone on the right side of his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   He suffered the injury on a hard fall in the Arizona State game
last week and hasn't played much since: 27 seconds, to be exact.
How the injury responds to treatment will help determine UCLA's
fate in its first-round game against Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to the doctor and got some medication, but it's still
sore,'' said Young, a reserve guard. ``Any type of bending is
painful. Hopefully, I'll be able to play. It's feeling better.''
</P>
<P>
   Young is a valuable commodity in UCLA's post-Dan Gadzuric state,
with the emphasis on speed and pressure defense. Young averages
five points and 16 minutes per game. He is a superb athlete and
solid perimeter defender. And for coach Steve Lavin, he means two
fresh legs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just what he brings to the floor,'' Lavin said.
``When we put him in the game JaRon (Rush), Earl (Watson) and Baron
(Davis) are allowed to get some rest. That way, they're more
effective when they're playing. There's been a ripple effect with
Ray's injury in our ability to sustain high levels of energy. The
guys are getting tired.''
</P>
<P>
   __ The numbers don't lie: Looking for two stats to track during
the Detroit game? Try rebounding and assists.
</P>
<P>
   Some of UCLA's most impressive victories (Oklahoma State,
Louisville, Syracuse) have come when it has outrebounded opponents.
Yet against the best teams (Stanford, Kentucky, Arizona, Maryland),
the Bruins lost the battle on the boards, and the game.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, assists correlate to high shooting percentage. Two
weeks ago, UCLA had 24 assists against Washington State and shot
53.1 percent. Against Syracuse the Bruins had 19 assists and shot
57.8 percent. However, when they don't move the ball, the Bruins
don't shoot well. Saturday, they had eight assists and shot 38
percent at Arizona in one of their worst offensive performances of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all right there, assists and rebounding,'' Lavin said,
displaying a laminated card with the evidence in big, bold type.
</P>
<P>
   __ Odds and ends: Guard Baron Davis, hobbling with a sprained
middle toe on his right foot, will play with a stabilizing metal
plate in his shoe.
</P>
<P>
   Center Jerome Moiso said his tendinitis-plagued feet are feeling
better than they have in weeks, thanks to the sports cream
recommended to him by a friend. ``It feels so good,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the last four games, UCLA has shot 66.3 percent from the foul
line _ improving its overall free throw percentage to 59.9.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's tipoff is approximately 7:10 p.m. If the Bruins win,
they'll play a second-round game Saturday at about 4:10 p.m.

DODGERS CAMP RUES PASSING OF DIMAGGIO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. _ Dodgers manager Davey Johnson met Joe
DiMaggio one winter during a ``hot stove league'' tour, sometimes
sharing a table with the Yankees legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife got to know him, too, and they would discuss how to
grow tomatoes,'' Johnson said. ``My wife got his autograph. (She)
didn't know who he was except for the coffee commercials.''
</P>
<P>
   That got a chuckle out of the dozen or so people around Johnson
on Monday, but the mood was certainly somber.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, as did the rest of the Dodgers, got word of DiMaggio's
death during their bus ride from Dodgertown to Fort Lauderdale
Stadium for their game against the Baltimore Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a baseball hero, the whole industry feels a
loss,'' Dodgers general manager Kevin Malone said. ``You think more
about him because he lived so close to here.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's death hit baseball's iron man, Cal Ripken Jr.,
particularly hard. DiMaggio, 84, died after a long illness that
included a bout with lung cancer. Ripken's father, Cal Sr., is
battling lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a bond between the younger Ripken and DiMaggio.
When Ripken broke Lou Gehrig's record for most consecutive games
played, it was DiMaggio who represented baseball, and the Yankees,
that night at Camden Yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel fortunate and lucky that at certain times I had the
opportunity to talk baseball with him,'' Ripken said. ``It was a
great honor. I really appreciate the way he spent time with me. I
wish I could have seen him play.''
</P>
<P>
   Although DiMaggio's loss will be felt throughout baseball,
expect New York to grieve much more. When Mickey Mantle died, fans
flocked to Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers catcher Todd Hundley played across the Triboro Bridge in
Queens with the Mets during his New York days, yet he understands
what the next few days in New York will be like.
</P>
<P>
   ``He owned New York,'' Hundley said. ``This is devastation. I'm
sure it's going to be a painful night in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers assistant to the general manager Bill Geivett, who
joined the Yankees in 1991 as a scout and minor-league instructor,
said the ``Yankee Clipper'' had an aura about him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a mythical figure, even when he was alive,'' Geivett
said. ``You didn't even get into the ex-player thing. It transcends
that. He was one of the best, if not the best, at the time he was
playing, and he seems to have gotten better.''

   LOS ANGELES _ She figures her father's fighting spirit will be
somewhere in the press conference room at Parker Center police
headquarters today _ tapping cops and reporters on the shoulder,
and asking them what the hell's taken so long in finding the guys
who murdered him more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks my father's resting in peace, they didn't
know him,'' Carol Steindler-Ferris said Friday from her home in
suburban Northridge. ``Dad was a feisty Damon Runyon character. He
won't rest until these guys are caught.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe _ just maybe _ that might finally be soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 22 years today since famed fight manager Howie
Steindler _ who served as the inspiration for the character
portrayed by Burgess Meredith in the ``Rocky'' movies, which were
filmed at Steindler's legendary Main Street Gym _ was found beaten
to death in the back seat of his 1976 Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   It was parked on the shoulder of the Ventura Freeway in suburban
Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Police Department robbery-homicide detectives are holding a
press conference today to announce that new information has
surfaced in the investigation, and a $25,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of Steindler's killers has
been reactivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got strong suspicions and some clues we're digging into
more, but we haven't come up with anything concrete yet,'' said
Detective Mike Mejia, who is handling the case now.
</P>
<P>
   The former investigating detective on the case _ Detective
Marvin Engquist, who retired from LAPD 10 years ago, and is now
campus police chief at Cerritos College _ said Saturday that he has
talked with Mejia, and thinks the detective is on the right track
to finally solving the 22-year-old murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had ID's on some people I thought could have been
responsible, guys who did bump-and-run type crimes,'' Engquist
said. ``I think that's what they're investigating now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody out there has to know who did it, and maybe the
reward money will help spur some memories 22 years later,'' added
Engquist, who was a personal friend of Steindler and had gone to
the Main Street Gym earlier on the day of the slaying to visit with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Engquist was investigating his 72-year-old
friend's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a witness, a young gal on her way home from the market,
who saw Howie around 8 p.m. standing outside his Cadillac ...
arguing with two guys,'' Engquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pointing to the back of his car, like it had been hit.
Pretty soon, she sees them tussling, and one of the guys shoving
Howie into the back seat of the Cadillac and taking off, followed
by the other guy in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``She copied down the license plate number, but unfortunately it
was the license plate of Howie's Cadillac, not the other car,''
Engquist said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Steindler's Cadillac was found parked on the
shoulder of the Ventura Freeway with his body in the back seat. He
had been brutally beaten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of speculation at the time that the slaying
might have been a mob hit and related to the boxing game somehow,
but Engquist discounts it, sticking with a bump-and-run robbery
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, boxing's a bad industry with a lot of characters in it _
characters many people would prefer to call suspects or
criminals,'' he said. ``Were some of them capable of murdering
Howie? Hell, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the injuries sustained by Howie always made me question
the theory it was a hit,'' Engquist said. ``He wasn't shot or
stabbed. He was beaten, and his wallet and jewelry were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howie was by then carrying around an oxygen tank to breathe
and was in pretty frail health. I just think his body couldn't take
the beating, whereas a younger, more healthy guy would have been
able to survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steindler's daughters, Carol and Bobbie Beatty of Oxnard in
neighboring Ventura County, never agreed with Engquist, but after
22 years of waiting for their father's killers to be caught, Carol
said, they are now more interested in finding some closure than
learning why he was slain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that living 22 years with no closure is
emotionally very tough,'' Carol said, gathering pictures of her dad
that she will bring to the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just scared nothing will materialize from this, and that
we'll be let down again,'' she said. ``I know Dad's not resting
until they're caught, and neither are we.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Carol who kept the Steindler fight name alive after his
death _ driving from her former home in upscale Westlake Village
west of Los Angeles to rub shoulders with the Runyonesque
characters and world-class fighters training and hanging out at the
famous gym at 3rd and Main streets downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go from a life of being Little League team mom, president
of the PTA and bake sale chairman in Westlake Village to driving
downtown to Main Street to watch guys spit on the floor of the
gym,'' Carol said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not what you would call a streetwise person then, so it
was a real cultural shock. But I would never let Dad's gym close
because I knew he would never want it closed.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was his life, filled with colorful characters who were
often broke and knew my father was a soft touch because he had such
a big heart.''
</P>
<P>
   She laughs, recalling one of the gym's colorful characters who
would stop by every day with old girlie magazines he found in trash
cans.
</P>
<P>
   ``He used to give them to my father, and Dad would give him a
few dollars for them, even though he never wanted them,'' Carol
said. ``He knew the old guy was broke and living on the streets
down there.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I took over, he did the same thing with me, so I gave him
a couple of bucks every day, just like Dad did. One day, though, he
shows up with these two beautiful pots with lovely flowers in them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says they're for me for being so kind to him. I was so
touched. A few minutes later, I'm walking over to the bank to make
a deposit, and I see the bank guard huffing and puffing, all red
faced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him what happened. He said he had been chasing some
guy who had just stolen the flower pots from the bank lobby, but he
didn't catch him. I just kept my mouth shut and walked into the
bank.''
</P>
<P>
   A slice of Runyonesque life from the old Main Street Gym that
was finally torn down in the mid-'80s because it could not meet
city earthquake standards. The site is now a parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no fight gyms like the old Main Street Gym, and
there are no Howie Steindlers anymore,'' his daughter said, packing
up the last of her father's pictures to bring to a murder press
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves to finally be able to rest in peace. We all do.''

 By BILL SULLIVAN  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The guys from Tallahassee insist they are not afraid of the big,
bad dudes from Duke. This unlikely turn of events rose from the
ashes of an 0-10 start, after all, and at some point, miracles
simply become part of the package.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ready or not, the Rattlers of Florida A&AMP;M are heading to
Charlotte. When the smoke cleared Sunday night, they were part of
the NCAA Tournament field of 64, even though they: (a) crash the
bracket with a 12-18 record, (b) have only nine players, (c) had to
beat Howard in a play-in game just to make the Mid-Eastern Athletic
Conference tournament field and (d) have a Ratings Percentage Index
of 269.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean the 15th team in NCAA history to make the
field with a losing record (the previous entries are a collective
0-14, by the way) has no plan for Friday's first-round game against
the nation's No. 1-ranked club. Coach Mickey Clayton already has
pondered the matchup, in fact, coming to at least one inescapable
conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know we can't go into a game with Duke and get off to a
slow start and have just three points after 11 minutes or
something,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken, it would seem, like a man who has seen his team in
action and recognizes its considerable limitations. If you are
desperately seeking that Upset Special of the Week, then, perhaps
you would be better off seeking it elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But where? Most of the other Cinderella candidates among the
chosen 64 also appear to have flat feet and a five o'clock shadow.
There may be another Valparaiso out there somewhere _ Valpo itself,
unfortunately, looks like first-round dead meat against Maryland _
but no one is going out of his way to thumb his nose at Goliath
just yet.
</P>
<P>
   Winthrop? Not likely. Even at 21-7, the NCAA first-timer looks
like no match for No. 1 Auburn in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Texas-San Antonio? Not against a Connecticut team that seems to
be regaining its early-season form.
</P>
<P>
   Mount St. Mary's? Let's hope venerable coach Jim Phelan enjoyed
win No. 800, because No. 801 isn't coming against Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   All of this is to be expected, of course. Nary a 16th seed has
won a first-round game against a No. 1 since the field was expanded
to 64, though the occasional No. 2 or 3 has been known to exit,
red-faced, after one not-so-shining moment.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, though, the potential gems may be found a
little higher in the seedings. A year ago, only one of the four No.
1s (North Carolina) reached the Final Four, and there may be some
troublemakers lurking out there this time as well.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five to watch:
</P>
<P>
   Kentucky: OK, so this is no big secret, but the defending
national champion is seeded just third in the Midwest. The Wildcats
broke out of a late-season slump to run the table in the
Southeastern Conference tournament, and it's never wise to write
off the old king until the great scorekeeper makes it official.
</P>
<P>
   Tubby Smith's team has a shot. After No. 14 New Mexico State, UK
gets up-and-down Kansas in a second-rounder that could leave
Jayhawks coach Roy Williams in tears again.
</P>
<P>
   That most likely sets up another meeting with Utah, with the
'Cats prevailing again in a rematch of last year's title game. It
also would leave the Michigan State-Arizona survivor as the final
obstacle to a fourth consecutive Final Four appearance.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas: Nolan Richardson's team came on late, upsetting Auburn
and Kentucky and making it to the SEC final before losing to UK.
</P>
<P>
   The Razorbacks, No. 4 in the West, open with Siena before facing
the UAB-Iowa winner. They would be underHogs against UConn in a
potential West semifinal, certainly, but their aggressive defense
and up-tempo style could cause problems for the Huskies.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzaga: The lads from Spokane are the No. 10 seed in the West,
but John Stockton's old school has a chance to rain on a parade or
two before calling it a season.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulldogs' first-round matchup is with Minnesota, which
staggered into the Dance after a first-round loss in the Big Ten
tournament. If that one goes well, Gonzaga would likely face No. 2
seed Stanford, a team that has struggled to live up to the
glittering legacy of last year's Final Four run.
</P>
<P>
   Opening play in fan-friendly Seattle won't hurt the Bulldogs,
either.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona: Lute Olson tends to be boom or bust in the Tournament.
His young team could go either way, but the draw could be
favorable.
</P>
<P>
   The No. 4-seeded Wildcats open Midwest play against Oklahoma, a
team that nearly didn't make the cut. The Rhode Island-UNC
Charlotte winner is up next, and each of those expended valuable
energy in conference tournaments in order to qualify.
</P>
<P>
   Win two, and a likely regional semifinal against Michigan State
could get interesting, offering a matchup between gifted guards
Jason Terry and Mateen Cleaves.
</P>
<P>
   George Washington: Tom Penders, the erstwhile Mr. March, is
blessed once again with a first-round matchup ripe with
possibilities _ Bob Knight and his stumbling Indiana Hoosiers, the
No. 6 seed in the South.
</P>
<P>
   The Colonials, the No. 11 seed, are led by 5-4 Shawnta Rogers,
who has flourished in Penders' free-lance system. Indiana's lack of
inside strength plays into GW's hands, and a second-round game with
St. John's _ coached by Penders' predecessor, Mike Jarvis _ could
be one of the Tournament's more interesting matchups.
</P>
<P>
   Five to avoid:
</P>
<P>
   Stanford: Got to love smart kids who can play. Got to wonder
about the way they've played for too much of this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinal, No. 2 in the West, lost just six times but
struggled often. That final-game loss to Oregon State not only cost
Mike Montgomery's team a No. 1 seed but also helped bring
Connecticut to the region. The Huskies dominated Stanford in their
last two meetings, but the Cardinal may not last long enough to see
if the third time is the charm.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State: A No. 4 seed in the South, the Buckeyes' turnaround
from last year's 8-22 record is admirable, but questions linger.
OSU could get caught looking ahead to UCLA in a first-round match
with No. 13 Murray State.
</P>
<P>
   Kansas: An uncharacteristic No. 6 seed in the Midwest, the
Jayhawks just aren't up to snuff, even if they did regroup
sufficiently to win the Big 12 tournament. First-round opponent
Evansville can shoot, and KU is nothing special guarding the
perimeter. Even if Round One goes well, a game against Kentucky
isn't likely to be a pleasant experience.
</P>
<P>
   Utah: The Utes' unexpected 27-4 season may have merited a No. 2
seed, but Rick Majerus' team had to go to the Midwest to claim it.
Utah can win a few, but the annual loss to Kentucky awaits in the
Sweet 16.
</P>
<P>
   Iowa: The Hawkeyes, playing out the string for deposed coach Tom
Davis, are a No. 5 seed in the West. If they get past
Alabama-Birmingham in the first round, Arkansas should send them
packing in the second.

DAUGHTER DISPLAYS SPIRIT OF SLAIN DAD, SEEKS CLOSURE

   LOS ANGELES _ She figures her father's fighting spirit will be
somewhere in the press conference room at Parker Center police
headquarters today _ tapping cops and reporters on the shoulder,
and asking them what the hell's taken so long in finding the guys
who murdered him more than two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``If anyone thinks my father's resting in peace, they didn't
know him,'' Carol Steindler-Ferris said Friday from her home in
suburban Northridge. ``Dad was a feisty Damon Runyon character. He
won't rest until these guys are caught.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe _ just maybe _ that might finally be soon.
</P>
<P>
   It's been 22 years today since famed fight manager Howie
Steindler _ who served as the inspiration for the character
portrayed by Burgess Meredith in the ``Rocky'' movies, which were
filmed at Steindler's legendary Main Street Gym _ was found beaten
to death in the back seat of his 1976 Cadillac.
</P>
<P>
   It was parked on the shoulder of the Ventura Freeway in suburban
Studio City.
</P>
<P>
   Police Department robbery-homicide detectives are holding a
press conference today to announce that new information has
surfaced in the investigation, and a $25,000 reward for information
leading to the arrest and conviction of Steindler's killers has
been reactivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got strong suspicions and some clues we're digging into
more, but we haven't come up with anything concrete yet,'' said
Detective Mike Mejia, who is handling the case now.
</P>
<P>
   The former investigating detective on the case _ Detective
Marvin Engquist, who retired from LAPD 10 years ago, and is now
campus police chief at Cerritos College _ said Saturday that he has
talked with Mejia, and thinks the detective is on the right track
to finally solving the 22-year-old murder mystery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always had ID's on some people I thought could have been
responsible, guys who did bump-and-run type crimes,'' Engquist
said. ``I think that's what they're investigating now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody out there has to know who did it, and maybe the
reward money will help spur some memories 22 years later,'' added
Engquist, who was a personal friend of Steindler and had gone to
the Main Street Gym earlier on the day of the slaying to visit with
him.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Engquist was investigating his 72-year-old
friend's death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a witness, a young gal on her way home from the market,
who saw Howie around 8 p.m. standing outside his Cadillac ...
arguing with two guys,'' Engquist said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pointing to the back of his car, like it had been hit.
Pretty soon, she sees them tussling, and one of the guys shoving
Howie into the back seat of the Cadillac and taking off, followed
by the other guy in his car.
</P>
<P>
   ``She copied down the license plate number, but unfortunately it
was the license plate of Howie's Cadillac, not the other car,''
Engquist said.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, Steindler's Cadillac was found parked on the
shoulder of the Ventura Freeway with his body in the back seat. He
had been brutally beaten.
</P>
<P>
   There was a lot of speculation at the time that the slaying
might have been a mob hit and related to the boxing game somehow,
but Engquist discounts it, sticking with a bump-and-run robbery
theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure, boxing's a bad industry with a lot of characters in it _
characters many people would prefer to call suspects or
criminals,'' he said. ``Were some of them capable of murdering
Howie? Hell, yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the injuries sustained by Howie always made me question
the theory it was a hit,'' Engquist said. ``He wasn't shot or
stabbed. He was beaten, and his wallet and jewelry were stolen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Howie was by then carrying around an oxygen tank to breathe
and was in pretty frail health. I just think his body couldn't take
the beating, whereas a younger, more healthy guy would have been
able to survive it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steindler's daughters, Carol and Bobbie Beatty of Oxnard in
neighboring Ventura County, never agreed with Engquist, but after
22 years of waiting for their father's killers to be caught, Carol
said, they are now more interested in finding some closure than
learning why he was slain.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't realize that living 22 years with no closure is
emotionally very tough,'' Carol said, gathering pictures of her dad
that she will bring to the press conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just scared nothing will materialize from this, and that
we'll be let down again,'' she said. ``I know Dad's not resting
until they're caught, and neither are we.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Carol who kept the Steindler fight name alive after his
death _ driving from her former home in upscale Westlake Village
west of Los Angeles to rub shoulders with the Runyonesque
characters and world-class fighters training and hanging out at the
famous gym at 3rd and Main streets downtown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd go from a life of being Little League team mom, president
of the PTA and bake sale chairman in Westlake Village to driving
downtown to Main Street to watch guys spit on the floor of the
gym,'' Carol said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not what you would call a streetwise person then, so it

conference.

   ``He deserves to finally be able to rest in peace. We all do.''

 MILAN, Italy: his own.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stefano Gabbana and Domenico Dolce are also constantly on the
move _ nothing old-clothesy about their collection. The design team
sent out a dazzling montage of daisy-appliqued stilettos, tie-dyed
fur in electric cocktail lounge hues, winking hologram skirts in
``Fantasia'' blues and yellows, and cowhide jackets and buffalo
fleece pants recalling the delicious days of spaghetti westerns and
Sergio Leone.
</P>
<P>
   And so are Jil Sander and Miuccia Prada, who put their
individual spin on minimalism, with Ms. Prada doing in her Miu Miu
line what she had failed to do in her main collection earlier:
charming her audience with opal satin dresses with chiffon hems,
trousers with rib-knitted cuffs spreading out over the shoes like
pureed peas, and hilarious duck boots with heels and fat tongues _
nothing like L.L. Bean's at all.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Prada based the collection on a passage from a Tim Burton
short story about Stick Boy and Match Girl, whose gist is that each
thinks the other is hot. ``I think young guys are so charming,''
she explained. ``I like the way young people are different and so
sweet with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   That came through, as young men and women trooped out in
sweaters and hooded jerseys in woodsy greens, pumpkins and browns.
Bootleg trousers were tied at the ankles with cords so they spread
over the tops of shoes _ a new look. There were drizzles of
folkloric ruffles, fanny packs integrated into wool coats and many
coming-and-going clothes (which, for those not yet in the know, are
clothes with the front in one fabric and the back in another).
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when a Rifat Ozbek show signaled something new.
Ozbek still has his camp followers, but his current asymmetrical
hemlines, fuzzy coats, leggings and silver-glazed chiffon merely
endorse what's already out there. As for the idea of giving utility
clothes futuristic glamour, that might have been all right if his
message hadn't been delivered to the soggy timpani of the ``Star
Wars'' theme.
</P>
<P>
   Other collections rounding out the week were those by Marni and
Victor Alfaro, who competently ticked off the season's trends _
boiled wool skirts, minimalist separates with a crust of beaded
trim, high heels, forest hues _ but without bravura. Marni went
chaotically rustic, with charming variations on the Arts and Crafts
theme, including boiled wool blanket skirts, folkloric prints and
ruffles and quilted wraps of the bed jacket genre. The clothes had
a sweet, literate mayhem, as if Red Riding Hood had gone skipping
over to Grandma's and found frumpy old Virginia Woolf instead.
</P>
<P>
   But to the high points of the week. What Ms. Prada has in common
with Ms. Versace and Karl Lagerfeld for Fendi _ and, for that
matter, Tom Ford, whose Gucci show was a Xanadu of inspired flash _
is a restlessness with what's old and familiar. Collectively, they
have the attention span of a gnat, which isn't so bad in a business
where at least half the audience seems perpetually to be looking up
at the ceiling as if to say, ``Next.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Ms. Sander, whose clothes can sometimes seem caught in a
cerebral straitjacket, comes down from her ivory tower to push
fashion forward _ and play with periwinkle coats blocked out in a
grid of seams, asymmetrically pleated skirts in copper papery satin
silk, spongy new synthetics and an interlocking chain of seams that
resemble a genetic code, but is, in fact, just candy for the
ravenous eye.
</P>
<P>
   The Fendi show held nothing arty or serious. In fact, the
pressing question as the guests took their seats was whether
Carlyne Cerf's Jack Russell terrier, Jack, should have a Fendi fur
of his own. Ms. Cerf, a Marie Claire editor, had outfitted him with
an Hermes collar and leash; and on rainy days in Milan, Jack wore a
Burberry town coat. But she looked doubtful when Andre Leon Talley
of Vogue suggested a Fendi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, he might eat it,'' Ms. Cerf said.
</P>
<P>
   Talley laughed. ``But so what?''
</P>
<P>
   That remark would probably thrill Lagerfeld, Fendi's designer.
After all, he had taken out the linings in most of his coats,
except some in silver sable, so what more could a dog do to a look
that was, in effect, destroyed? Lagerfeld showed furs _ mink,
squirrel, summer ermine _ sheared so close to the skin, and then
dyed in sorbet hues of lemon, melon, pistachio, coffee and palest
blue, that they looked as indefinably glamorous as a woman running
out in the rain in a silk wrapper to fetch her paper. ``The idea
was to treat fur no different than fabric,'' Lagerfeld explained.
``Treat it like nothing, and it looks modern.''
</P>
<P>
   Lagerfeld has been in this deconstructivist territory before,
but rarely with more confidence. The results were beautiful. There
was Stella Tennant swooping out in a patchwork coat of sheared
mink. Mimsy-looking bed jackets with belled sleeves snuggled over
knit separates. Some coats were covered in a gauze cobweb, while a
birch-colored coat in sheared squirrel was trimmed at its raw edges
in gauzy filigree. The show was a testament to Lagerfeld's
far-flung brilliance, as well as to the Fendi workrooms, and
devotees of the ``baguette'' handbag can look forward to new
versions _ in beaded patchwork, sheared mink and a perfectly corny
fisherman knit.

ARE CLIPPERS DESPERATE TO DEAL?

By RANDY HILL  
 c.1999 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ What do you give the team that has everything
going wrong?
</P>
<P>
   You give it a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA's trading deadline arrives Thursday, and the vultures
are on the runway. They are prepared to circle the carcass of the
league's only winless team, hoping desperate straits can propel the
0-15 Clippers into a not-so-smooth move.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always the case when you're struggling,'' said Elgin
Baylor, the team's vice president of basketball operations. ``They
feel there is going to be a fire sale.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year Coach Chris Ford, who has been one of the
organization's minds inquiring about potential talent upgrades,
doesn't believe in trading just because the ashes are getting deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to just give things away,'' said Ford, who
offered a few ideas Monday in a three-way phone chat with Baylor
and Clippers owner Donald T. Sterling. ``We can't add problems. We
have to make decisions for the future. If there's something on the
table that will help us, we'll go out and do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford also feels better after talking with the man who pays his
salary.
</P>
<P>
   ``I voiced some opinions,'' Ford said of his gab session with
Sterling and Baylor. ``He (Sterling) agreed with some of the things
I said.''
</P>
<P>
   According to team sources, it's agreed that second-year power
forward Maurice Taylor and rookie center Michael Olowokandi will be
staying put. But a few Clippers are in the final year of their
contracts, and could be considered functional role players for
teams involved in the playoff chase. Those with the most value
figure to be forwards Lamond Murray, Lorenzen Wright and Rodney
Rogers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been around this league enough to know that quite a few
deals are talked about,'' Ford said, ``but very few happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Baylor seconded that motion, but did admit the Clippers have put
an offer on someone else's table and are waiting for a response.
</P>
<P>
   __ Losing games and patience: Now ... about that streak.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers haven't won since defeating Sacramento in last
year's season finale. Tonight, they will be visited by the Lakers,
who have won seven in a row, and wouldn't mind tagging their
crosstown cousins with a franchise-tying 16th consecutive setback.
</P>
<P>
   A league-tying 17th consecutive defeat could come Wednesday at
the Forum. Sacramento arrives at the Sports Arena on Thursday,
hoping the Clippers will grab the league record and keep it to
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my job to continue to try finding ways to make things
work,'' Ford said of dealing with the extended losing skid. ``I
certainly think the frustration has grown.''
</P>
<P>
   That goes double for Ford, who believes it's time for the
players to be accountable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see the response from them that is needed for us to
win,'' he said. ``There's not enough self-sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   But there isn't much second-guessing on Ford's part.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it would be a challenge,'' Ford said of coaching the
Clippers. ``But that's what you live for as a coach - to help make
the situation better. I didn't come here to go through the motions,
for the sun.''
</P>
<P>
   __ `Kandi' almost dandy: Tonight's game will be Olowokandi's
fifth on the injured list, a visit that requires a five-game
minimum. He practiced with the team Monday at Carson and his
left-ankle sprain should have sufficiently healed for him to play
at the Forum on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Ford said he plans to start Sherman Douglas, Charles Smith,
Tyrone Nesby, Maurice Taylor and Wright tonight vs. the Lakers.
Their combined salary is less than the $7 million (minus the
pro-rated lockout loss) backup forward Elden Campbell is being paid
by the Lakers this season.

 Charter school accountability critical 
(ANALYSIS) (Third of a three-part series) 
 (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KELLY PEARCE  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The strength of Arizona's charter school law is also its
weakness.
</P>
<P>
   While state lawmakers gave charters freedom to mold fresh, new
programs, they did little to ensure those programs meet minimum
standards imposed on traditional public schools.
</P>
<P>
   But after four years of experience with charters and because the
stakes have been raised _ 30,000 children now attend publicly
funded, privately run schools _ some are lining up to propose new
restrictions on the freedom.
</P>
<P>
   What charter school history has shown is that even a top charter
school can stumble because the operator has to wear two hats, that
of educator and business person. Sometimes, an operator offers fine
academics but goes under because of financial mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
   No one is calling for dumping the schools altogether. Even
critics say charter schools fill a need and that the law needs to
be tweaked, not scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will always be children who aren't best served by the
traditional system,'' said Sen. Mary Hartley, D-northwest Phoenix,
who has harshly criticized the lack of charter school
accountability. ``I view them as the shining hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's a sampling of what lawmakers want to do:
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask prospective charter operators to submit a business plan.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stop doling out upfront funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a clearinghouse of charter school information so
parents can make informed decisions about where to send their
children. The best information now available comes from the
Goldwater Institute's Web site _ www.cmbe.org _ and report cards
published by the Arizona Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prevent school districts with financial woes from sponsoring
charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   _ Strengthen accounting practices of charters and provide ways
for sponsors to withhold the money of those out of compliance.
</P>
<P>
   _ Make districts liable for the schools they charter.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers might also bar districts from chartering outside their
boundaries and cut the length of a charter from 15 years to three
or five. Both measures face an uphill battle.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpened oversight
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say lawmakers should do even more.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, they could sharpen oversight of the charters.
</P>
<P>
   Now, oversight is split between school districts, the Board of
Education, and the state Board for Charter Schools.
</P>
<P>
   No one public body checks up to see if the charters are
accurately reporting how many students are showing up for class, if
the charters are on solid financial ground, or if they are
improving student performance.
</P>
<P>
   Some sponsors keep an eye on these matters, but they aren't
forced to do so by law. And most of them don't have enough staff
members to do a thorough job.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, observers of charter schools say, Department of
Education staff members should be assigned to visit each school
each year, check up on record-keeping, observe classes and meet
with parents.
</P>
<P>
   The department should also determine if schools are meeting the
goals they set, observers say.
</P>
<P>
   State educators tried to do that in 1996. Education Department
employees reported that they found charter schools violating
health, safety and civil rights laws and deviating from their
stated missions. But top department officials later said those
findings were unofficial.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona could look to Colorado, where yearly evaluations are
mandatory. Or Massachusetts, home to an expansive charter law with
stronger accountability.
</P>
<P>
   In Massachusetts, charter schools must report on their
operations each August. Then state education officials and citizens
visit each school to check up on it.
</P>
<P>
   Keeping an eye on charter schools doesn't destroy their
independence, critics and advocates both say, even if the schools
are forced to reveal information about their operations, or even
detailed business plans.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some observers think first-time charter operators
should have to be trained and made to refresh their skills by
attending periodic seminars.
</P>
<P>
   They also say that charter operators who falter financially
should have to seek out bank loans and grants just like other
small-business owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``The state can't come in and artificially prop up schools,''
said Jaime Molera, Gov. Jane Hull's executive assistant for
education.
</P>
<P>
   But the state does do that, to some extent.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools in Arizona may defray start-up costs by applying
for up to $100,000 from a $1 million state stimulus fund each year
for two straight years.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that tempts some operators to play fast and loose
with their operating funds. It allegedly happened at the defunct
Citizen 2000. In the end, the founder was charged with misusing
$179,000 in public money.
</P>
<P>
   When the charter school law was passed five years ago, advocates
of the new schools asserted they would create strikingly successful
programs that could then be implanted in traditional public
schools. But no system is in place to allow that to happen.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to letting outside people in to make sure things are
in good shape inside charter schools, the schools should have ways
of showing off the good things they are doing, observers say. For
instance, charter educators could write papers about their
programs, invite district officials for visits and hold statewide
public education conferences each year.
</P>
<P>
   Charter history
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools were envisioned as a catalyst for change, and
they have been.
</P>
<P>
   But it's been a slow change.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, superintendents considered charters an an
inferior &UR; step-sibling that wouldn't survive. Then, students began
leaving their neighborhood district schools. And charter schools
continued to mushroom across the state. Today, there are 270
charter schools with 30,000 students and district officials in
traditional public schools _ which teach 750,000 students _
realized they had to respond to the charters.
</P>
<P>
   They did. They advertised, set up programs for younger kids and
opened magnet schools and other specialized schools.
</P>
<P>
   As more students go to charters, districts will be forced to
change to compete.
</P>
<P>
   The future will mean more schools and more competition,
especially from for-profit companies that can build schools
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   There will be more neighborhood-type charter schools, especially
if districts are unsuccessful in lobbying for construction money.
</P>
<P>
   Alternatives in the school districts will abound, including a
slew of specialized programs in the arts, sciences and other
popular areas. Eventually, all schools will be true schools of
choice. &QL;

U.S. FIRES NUCLEAR SCIENTIST SUSPECTED OF SPYING FOR CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Subs lede graf for rewriting) (wg) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Taiwan-born scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory was fired Monday for security breaches after the FBI
questioned him in connection with China's suspected theft of
American nuclear secrets, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   The scientist, Wen Ho Lee, was questioned for three days by the
FBI, starting last Friday, but ``stonewalled'' during the
questioning, Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, a computer scientist who had been working in the nuclear
weapons design area at Los Alamos, has not been charged with any
crime, but he has been identified by federal officials as the prime
suspect in the spying.
</P>
<P>
   China has denied any such theft took place. But administration
officials said China, working with stolen data, has made a leap in
developing nuclear weapons with much smaller warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The handling of the espionage matter brought sharp criticism
from Capitol Hill. Sen. Fred Thompson, an influential Republican,
representing Tennessee, attacked the Clinton administration Monday
for failing to notify Congress in late 1997 that China had stolen
nuclear secrets when the administration certified that Beijing was
no longer helping other nations build nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   That certification lifted a 12-year ban on the sale of American
nuclear technology to China, an action long sought by American
companies eager to bid on the estimated $60 billion Chinese market
for civilian nuclear plants.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The FBI began to question Lee on Friday in an attempt to
determine whether he had passed American secrets to the Chinese.
The questioning continued through late Sunday, but Lee failed to
fully cooperate, said Richardson, who dismissed Lee on Monday,
after receiving permission from the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials acknowledged last week that they did not have
enough to arrest Lee then, but hoped their questioning would lead
to a break. While he agreed to talk with investigators and nuclear
experts, his failure to fully cooperate has apparently still left
the investigators without enough evidence to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   But Richardson believed he had sufficient evidence to dismiss
Lee. He was dismissed for ``failure to properly notify Energy
Department and laboratory officials about contacts with people from
a sensitive country, specific instances of failing to properly
safeguard classified material, and apparently attempting to deceive
lab officials about security matters,'' Richardson said.
</P>
<P>
   Reached at their home in Los Alamos, N.M., on Monday afternoon,
Lee's wife, Sylvia, a former secretary at the lab, refused to give
his whereabouts or comment on the matter. Lee, who officials said
is in his late 50s and has been working at Los Alamos for more than
a decade, did not hire an attorney to represent him during his
interviews with the FBI, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee has been the prime suspect in a nearly three-year FBI
investigation, code-named ``Kindred Spirit,'' into Beijing's theft
of U.S. nuclear technology from Los Alamos, senior officials from
the bureau and the Energy Department said.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, China's nuclear weapons designs were a
generation behind those of the United States, largely because
Beijing had been unable to produce small warheads that could be
launched from a single missile at multiple targets.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-1990s, China had built and tested such small
bombs, a breakthrough officials say was accelerated by the Los
Alamos theft.
</P>
<P>
   The espionage is believed to have occurred in the 1980s,
officials said, but was not detected until 1995, when American
experts from Los Alamos analyzing Chinese nuclear test results
found similarities to America's most advanced miniature warhead,
the W-88.
</P>
<P>
   By February 1996, investigators from the Energy Department and
the FBI, searching travel records and other data at Los Alamos and
other U.S. weapons labs, had identified five possible suspects,
officials said. Lee quickly emerged as the prime suspect, officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators now believe that Lee gave the Chinese sensitive
nuclear detonation information during a 1988 seminar, senior
administration officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But after opening a formal criminal investigation in June 1996,
the FBI did not at first aggressively pursue the espionage case,
according to several senior U.S. officials familiar with the
matter.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the last several weeks, after prodding from Congress and
the Energy secretary, did government officials administer lie
detector tests to Lee. After a first test was administered in
December, the FBI, unsatisfied with those results, gave Lee a
second test in February, and on that test he was found to be
deceptive, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI decided to interview Lee last Friday after he failed the
polygraph, or lie detector test, in February, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In response to criticism over their handling of the case, FBI
officials say that Chinese spy activities are far more difficult to
investigate than the more traditional espionage operations of the
former Soviet Union. The Chinese often take advantage of scientific
exchanges and many other forms of informal contacts, gathering
sensitive information from such a wide range of sources that it is
often difficult to pinpoint exactly how American secrets leaked
out.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say they have concluded that Beijing is
continuing to steal secrets from the Government's major nuclear
weapons laboratories, which had been increasingly opened to foreign
visitors after the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, since the theft of the W-88 design information
apparently occurred so far in the past, the Justice Department at
first lacked the grounds to obtain a secret wiretap on the suspect,
making it difficult initially to build a strong criminal case,
according to U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Energy Department failed to move Lee out of his
sensitive position, or remove his security clearances, for more
than a year after FBI Director Louis J. Freeh told Energy officials
in September, 1997 that there was no longer any investigative
reason to keep him in place. In espionage cases, the FBI often
wants suspects left alone by their employers for fear of tipping
them off to their investigations. He was finally moved out of a
sensitive area several weeks ago, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's wife, Sylvia, quit her secretarial job at the lab sometime
in the last year or two, Energy Department officials said. FBI and
Energy Department officials said that Lee's wife's activities had
raised questions while she worked at Los Alamos.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1980s, she was invited to China to give an academic
paper on parallel processing _ even though she was only a secretary
at Los Alamos. Her husband, who was the true expert, accompanied
her, according to a U.S. official. In addition, Energy Department
officials said co-workers at Los Alamos questioned the fact that
she frequently ``inserted herself'' into gatherings at the lab with
visiting Chinese delegations.
</P>
<P>
   But FBI officials said that she was not a target of their
investigation. FBI officials have said it is possible that others
were involved in the theft of nuclear secrets from Los Alamos, but
they have not yet identified other suspects.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, in response to criticism of the lax security at Los
Alamos and other national weapons labs owned by the Department of
Energy, Richardson said Monday he is ordering that about 700 Energy
Department and laboratory employees be required to take periodic
polygraph examinations. The order does not cover all Energy and lab
employees with so-called ``Q'' security clearances giving them
access to nuclear secrets, Richardson said, but does cover those
who work in the most sensitive areas. Currently, only employees of
the CIA are required to submit to polygraph exams on a regular
basis.

JOE DIMAGGIO: YANKEE WHO RULED BASEBALL LIKE A KING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ As a measure of time's cruelty, an entire generation
of Americans has come of age after the last of his Mr. Coffee
commercials disappeared from TV in the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   How is Joe DiMaggio explained to them?
</P>
<P>
   Try this: He was American royalty.
</P>
<P>
   For a society that more than 200 years ago banished by
constitution the unearned nobility of European despots, DiMaggio
was the embodiment of true benevolent kingship.
</P>
<P>
   The most elegant of baseball players had two qualities that set
apart an individual from all others in a society required by law to
be classless, yet mandated by disposition to reward the individual
winner.
</P>
<P>
   By achievement, he was uniquely dominant; by personality, he was
utterly unknowable.
</P>
<P>
   Humans do not get more regal.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are so unused to the royal distance that the best we
do is political analogies.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he walked into that clubhouse,'' said Billy Martin, his
late Yankee teammate, ``it was like a president or senator walking
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he was the opposite of what we have come to know as the
modern politician. Beyond an uneasy, occasional willingness to
share a public smile and a ceremony, DiMaggio didn't want or need
the validation of undeserved adoration.
</P>
<P>
   It is the fashion of the American day to let everyone share in
one's thoughts, secrets, eccentricities and perversions. From O.J.
Simpson to Mary K. Letourneau to Monica Lewinsky, conventional
wisdom is that a life carefully laid open is a life bettered. This
may or may not be true. What I do know is that the book and movie
rights are almost always blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   Six-decade celebrity that he was, DiMaggio never let anyone in
on himself. Seems to have worked out pretty well, for him and us.
Public tours of the castle are always fun, but kings lose a little
something when they become theme parks.
</P>
<P>
   In the volumes of copy that will follow DiMaggio's death Monday,
almost no one who is being honest will say they knew him. They knew
about him. They knew of him. But unlike most prominent figures in
contemporary sports, he locked his elbows and kept everyone out.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody much minded.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, this is normally bad news. But the job of king
is not an elective office. It is a cosmic appointment. Public
disclosure rules do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   Nor, apparently, did many laws of nature. For the last months of
his life, the joke was that he had more rebounds than Dennis
Rodman. DiMaggio had last rites administered what seemed like a
half-dozen times, yet kept popping up to rail against his obit in
the newspapers and on TV.
</P>
<P>
   He beat back death. What else can be required of a king?
</P>
<P>
   As was mentioned: Achievement. In his most notable contribution
to sports history, the 56-game hitting streak in 1941, DiMaggio
created a record that was the perfect definition of the man _
ceaseless, unwavering excellence. The fact that no one has come
closer than a dozen games to the DiMaggio streak is testament to
its unbreakability.
</P>
<P>
   Major league baseball is the hardest game, and DiMaggio set its
highest standard. After his baseball career ended, he moved through
the culture and the generations with the same precision that his
bat sliced the strike zone.
</P>
<P>
   The man stood in the gale of the world's most blustery city and
married the most glamorous movie star, yet left them mysteriously
while keeping all creases pressed. His bearing was commanding, his
appearance flawless and his requirement for respect politely
insistent.
</P>
<P>
   When he was asked to throw out the first pitch for a Yankee
World Series I was covering, I was surprised that my
celebrity-exhausted eyes would not leave his every move. The pull
he had on the baseball was nothing compared with the pull he had on
the imagination.
</P>
<P>
   In a time that has perfunctory respect, but little reverence,
for the icons of past generations _ soldiers, explorers,
scientists, educators _ the entertainer has become the center of
the culture. We put them in the White House, the Senate, governor's
mansions, the forefront of social causes and on the ads and
packages of nearly every consumer product, despite their having
little legitimate claim to the platform beyond notoriety.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was an entertainer too, but it was the least of his
graces. During the American century hailed for its egalitarianism,
he had power over our imaginations through what he did and the way
he did it, leading the unknowable life of the true noble.
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Joe has left and gone away, leaving no successors.

A-ROD, GUILLEN COMING TOGETHER AS DOUBLE-PLAY COMBO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PEORIA, Ariz. _ It was smooth, stylish, exactly what the
Mariners hope to see all year from their new infield tandem.
</P>
<P>
   Anaheim's Randy Velarde ripped a grounder toward the hole in the
fourth inning of Monday's 10-3 Mariners win. Alex Rodriguez dropped
to his knees, extended and speared it, whipping the ball to Carlos
Guillen at second, who hurdled Mo Vaughn and completed the double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Just a couple of outs in an exhibition game, but the play
exemplified what the M's have seen in early-morning infield drills
this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been getting ground balls early, getting used to each
other,'' infield coach Steve Smith said. ``It's nice being away
from everyone, and it's important they know each other on and off
the field so they get along when they're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen, who came over from Houston in the Randy Johnson trade
last July, is expected to be a marked improvement over Joey Cora,
who led American League second basemen with 20 errors last year.
The 23-year-old is the same age as Rodriguez, but the shortstop's
major league tenure has made him a mentor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tables turn,'' Rodriguez said. ``Joey taught me a lot of
things about playing in the middle of the infield, leadership and
different situations. Now it's my turn to show (Guillen) the way.
Even though I'm young, I have four years of experience and can help
him out a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said Rodriguez's work ethic is enough of an example for
Guillen, a rookie who already has shown comparable dedication.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see him and he's working every day, and I like to be like
him,'' Guillen said.
</P>
<P>
   There also have been mechanical adjustments for Guillen, who was
developed as a shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   When starting a double play, the shortstop has an easier flip
than the second baseman because he throws across his body, not off
to the side. Guillen has learned to deliver the ball underhanded,
instead of pushing it as a quarterback would a shovel pass. Smith
said Guillen also is learning to take the ``little, tiny steps'' of
a second baseman instead of the longer strides of a shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Then, of course, there's the process of learning Rodriguez _ and
vice versa. Becoming comfortable with a new double play partner
sometimes takes just a few weeks, Rodriguez said. Sometimes it
never happens. So far, he and Guillen seem more like the former.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't played enough to be comfortable yet,'' Rodriguez
said, ``but I can see us getting comfortable pretty quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   MARINER NOTES: How does a pitching prospect win over manager Lou
Piniella? By throwing strikes. No young pitcher has impressed
Piniella as much as right-hander Brett Hinchliffe, who threw two
scoreless innings Monday and minimized his pitches by finding the
strike zone. Piniella said Hinchliffe is putting himself on track
to start an exhibition game.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mac Suzuki, meanwhile, allowed three runs and walked three in
one inning. He was hit hard by a Korean team in a ``B'' game last
week, but this performance was more discouraging.
</P>
<P>
   ``He got hit a little bit the other day, but he threw strikes,
and I like that,'' Piniella said. ``Today, with a 6-0 lead, he came
in and walked the first two hitters and all of a sudden he's in hot
water for no reason at all.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Jay Buhner saw his first exhibition action Monday, going
3-for-5 with two doubles and four RBIs. Buhner will rest Tuesday,
then make his debut in left field Wednesday on a program prescribed
by team trainers as he continues to recover from elbow surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner will not accompany the team on the trek to Tucson to play
the Colorado Rockies on Thursday. ``We're having trouble filling
that bus for Tucson,'' Piniella said.
</P>
<P>
   -- Reliever Bobby Ayala threw his second scoreless inning this
spring, prompting fans to stand and cheer as he trotted down the
right-field line on his way back to the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   -- Mariners minor leaguers have reported to camp, but
18-year-old phenom Cha Sueng Baek remains in South Korea with visa
problems.

 S.F. DOCTORS TO BEGIN TEST OF NEW AIDS VACCINE  &HT;     By DAVID PERLMAN 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ AIDS specialists in San Francisco are ready to
begin testing the effectiveness of an AIDS vaccine that is already
undergoing clinical trials in Thailand and many other American
cities, they announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint project of the University of California and the San
Francisco Department of Public Health, the doctors are recruiting
300 volunteers who are free of infection by HIV, the AIDS virus,
but who are at risk of contracting the disease because of sexual
exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The genetically engineered vaccine, called AIDSVAX, is made by
VaxGen, a biotechnology firm based in Brisbane, Calif., whose
scientists began developing it more than 15 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Directors of the study in San Francisco are Dr. Susan
Buchbinder, chief of AIDS research at the Health Department, and
Dr. James Kahn of the University of California at San Francisco
Positive Health Program at San Francisco General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers for the study will be divided into two groups in what
is known as a double-blind trial. One group will receive seven
injections of the vaccine over 30 months, while the second group
receives a placebo _ the same number of injections but containing
no active material. Neither the volunteers nor the researchers will
know who got the vaccine until the trial is over and the results
are tabulated.
</P>
<P>
   Several other AIDS vaccines are either under development or
undergoing earlier stages of testing, but at this point no one
knows whether any vaccine can prevent infection by the virus.
</P>
<P>
   The final answer may not come for years, scientists agree. ``It
will take a sustained and probably lengthy effort to develop a
vaccine that stops HIV,'' said Dr. Mitch Katz, director of the San
Francisco Health Department.
</P>
<P>
   Although preliminary trials of the AIDSVAX vaccine have shown
that it is safe, a critical complicating issue in the current
trials is the need for the volunteers to refrain from unsafe sexual
behavior because the vaccine's effectiveness is still completely
unknown, according to Buchbinder and Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence all the volunteers will undergo intensive
counseling before and during the trial period, while the blood
samples are taken and other tests are conducted.
</P>
<P>
   Like other vaccines being developed, the one being tested in San
Francisco is also being tried in more than 35 other American
cities, and the goal is to test 5,000 people. In Thailand, similar
trials have begun among intravenous drug users at methadone
clinics, a company official said.

 CIRCUMSTANCES PROVED GREATNESS OF NATIVE SON  &HT;     By KEN GARCIA 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   San Francisco lost the biggest star it ever produced Monday, a
high school dropout who combined a rare athletic talent with an
elusive quality called dignity to climb to mythical heights.
</P>
<P>
   That Joe DiMaggio began his ascent playing on the fields of
Funston Playground is as much a part of local lore as his
appearances at another long-gone San Francisco institution, Seals
Stadium. The fact that the city has not produced another athlete or
ball yard of similar status in more than 60 years does not speak
well for the Yankee Clipper's home, but it does remind us that
impossible feats can happen anywhere _ even in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But one thing that neither the city nor DiMaggio ever lost was
their singular style, an almost quiet acceptance of certain
God-given gifts. For San Francisco, it was its magical, unending
beauty. For DiMaggio, it was his graceful, fluid movement.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio proved that fame often grows when you don't pursue it,
a lesson that future generations of athletes and film stars would
do well to learn.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the legend of Joe DiMaggio will never go away in large
part because of the way he handled his celebrity. The word
``class,'' rightly enough, is little used in sports these days, but
it applied to DiMaggio as much as any of the hyperbolic adjectives
used to describe his feats on the diamond.
</P>
<P>
   And class in San Francisco has always been more about good
manners than noble birthrights. DiMaggio was at heart a Pabst Blue
Ribbon guy living a champagne cocktail life. Even at the height of
his fame, he spent the offseason living away from the media glare
in New York, biding his time at his family's restaurant at
Fisherman's Wharf or hanging out at Reno Barsocchini's place on
Post Street. Many writers came calling, but none was chosen.
</P>
<P>
   It no doubt helped during his celebrated career that DiMaggio
was just a local kid from a modest working family in San Francisco
and that he never lost sight of it. His humble background seemed to
capture the spirit of an era when heroes walked quietly, almost
dismissive of their own achievements.
</P>
<P>
   About as flashy as DiMaggio ever got was the lighted neon sign
of his likeness that hung outside the restaurant his brother Tom
ran. DiMaggio was often spotted about town, and would acknowledge
greetings politely, but kept to himself almost intensely. A
television special on his life last year all but suggested that it
was all part of DiMaggio's plan to protect and secure his public
image. If it's true, at least he had an image worth protecting.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity has a way of distorting values and images _ or have
you not heard of Dennis Rodman, John McEnroe and Albert Belle?
Selfishness and boorish self-promotion have become such a standard
for people we regard as stars that DiMaggio's behavior seems like a
quaint memory from our past.
</P>
<P>
   But he could not be more timely. Or necessary. And that makes
his passing all the more sad. San Francisco lost more than a
skillful native son _ it lost its greatest cultural ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   By the time DiMaggio was 18, he was already a star here, tearing
up the Pacific Coast League almost as if he were playing pickup
games in North Beach. In his rookie year, he hit safely in 61
straight games _ foreshadowing greatness with the Yankees that
would see him set one of the greatest records in sports _ 56
straight games with a hit _ in 1941.
</P>
<P>
   Those who wonder why San Francisco was such a hotbed of Yankee
fan support in the late '30s and early '40s need only to remember
that the team was filled with city ballplayers, including Frankie
Crosetti, Lefty Gomez and Tony Lazzeri, all stars in their own
right. In that regard, New York became San Francisco East, and the
papers and newsreels were filled with the exploits of the kids from
the West Coast sandlots.
</P>
<P>
   Yet DiMaggio became a king, whose legend was determined by a
life of greatness on the playing field and unerring self-effacement
off it. There may be a handful of American athletes who have
achieved as much fame, but none who ever handled the pressure
better, or with more style and grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that he had a manner that was the complete
antithesis of the behavior of current athletes,'' said longtime
Sports Illustrated writer Ron Fimrite, who first met DiMaggio as a
Chronicle columnist in 1966. ``He carried himself well, dressed
immaculately, and he was wise enough not to talk too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Fimrite, whose appreciation of DiMaggio will appear in Sports
Illustrated this week, pursued a longer profile piece with the
Clipper for more than a decade. DiMaggio never played ball, but
Fimrite says he was unfailingly polite to the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it was because he didn't have that much to say, but he
always managed to maintain that dignity because of some natural
self-restraint,'' Fimrite said. ``He was always good to the press,
even if you couldn't get that much out of him.''

   DiMaggio achieved more success in sports than probably any
athlete in this century, playing in 10 World Series in 13 seasons
and winning nine of them. The only other athlete who even came
close to that was USF's Bill Russell, who teamed with K.C. Jones on
the great Celtics teams of the '60s.
</P>
<P>
   But Russell left basketball an angry and bitter man, outspoken
in his views, while DiMaggio just kept to himself, carefully
guarding his privacy. History shows us which style is more
enduring.

   So now, we finally know where Joltin' Joe has gone. He's gone
home. A place that, at least in his values, he never really left.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN SALVADOR _ President Clinton arrived here Monday on a
mission of hope and support for the recovery efforts in the region
despite having little to offer in tangible benefits.
</P>
<P>
   The president began a four-day, four-country trip in Nicaragua,
one of the countries hardest hit by Hurricane Mitch, which
barrelled through the area in October. Nearly a week of torrential
rains caused flooding that uprooted families, killed 9,000 people,
and buried entire communities under mud.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, accompanied by Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman,
knelt at the spot where the imprint in dried mud of the body of a
small girl is all that remains of 2,000 victims who were covered by
a massive mudslide caused by the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``No picture can convey the feeling of seeing the outline of
that small child's body by her grave, and seeing her skeleton,''
Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit by the president is intended to soothe anxieties among
many Central American officials that the ongoing struggles to
rebuild may create serious economic and political instability. They
are worried that the slow process of rebuilding may frustrate
victims of Mitch, worsen poverty and threaten to destabilize the
region's fledgling democracies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many bruises that we have to heal, many unpleasant
memories to erase,'' Aleman said at a stop in the village of
Posoltega. ``But we trust in God, in our friends like you, and in
our work and sacrifices.''
</P>
<P>
   But many leaders also hope to have the administration's ear on
other issues important to them, such as immigration and stronger
economic ties.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, 3,000 Salvadorans and Guatemalans who illegally entered
the US after the hurricane but were granted a six-month exemption
from deportation became eligible for deportation. Immigrant
advocates and some members of Congress _ including Massachusetts
Rep. Joe Moakely _ tried to have the exemption extended, but
Clinton has refused.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have provided temporary immigration protection for Central
Americans in our country and I will seek a fair solution to all the
immigration issues this tragedy has heightened,'' Clinton said in a
speech to about 1,000 people north of the capital city of Managua.
</P>
<P>
   But Salvadoran President Armando Calderon Sol, who greeted
Clinton Monday night when the US delegation arrived in San
Salvador, said a flood of returning refugees ``would cause us
tragic problems in terms of stability.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at the presidential palace in San Salvador last
week, Calderon Sol warned that massive deportations would result in
``an explosion in Central America and in El Salvador,'' and said he
would ask for the same 18-month extension given to immigrants from
Nicaragua and Honduras, which were hit harder.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman said that although deportations were not
expected to begin immediately, the administration argued that the
nations have recovered sufficiently to resume accepting their
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's visit to the region was the first by an American
president since Lyndon Johnson visited Nicaragua and El Salvador in
1968.
</P>
<P>
   It underscored the political and economic changes that the
region has undergone since the turbulent years of the 1980s, when
nearly all of Central America was immersed in civil wars and Cold
War-era politics. All of the region's seven countries have
democratically-elected governments.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has already spent $305 million for Mitch
recovery in the region and the Clinton administration has been
trying unsuccessfully to get Congress to approve a $956 million
emergency aid package. The measure remained tangled in Capitol Hill
politics over domestic spending.
</P>
<P>
   During his visit Monday to Nicaragua, however, Clinton announced
an additional $120 million in aid, including to repair health
clinics and rebuild damaged schools, and find and remove civil-war
era land mines buried in Nicaragua and Honduras.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will announce similar packages at other stops in El
Salvador, Honduras, and Guatemala. But what some officials say they
want more than aid is enhanced trade agreements with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton introduced a proposal to Congress last week that would
increase trade under the Caribbean Basin Initiative. But leaders in
the region, including Calderon Sol, say they want market building
initiatives like the North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Candido Cruz, a 51-year-old auto mechanic in Mejicanos, a
northern suburb of San Salvador, said he appreciated the attention
from the American president, but hoped the visit would lead to a
brighter economic future for his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not everyday that we get a visitor like this,'' Cruz said
on Sunday afternoon. ``He'll see that we're trying to make our
lives better. But maybe he'll see that we can't make it alone.''

   Every winter, thousands of skiers seek the thrills of untouched
snow away from the beaten trails. But skiers go off of the marked
trails risk being buried by an avalanche. Many have taken to
carrying electronic transmitters that are supposed to summon help
should the worst occur. Recent studies suggest, however, that their
faith in the effectiveness of these beacons may be misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   Catastrophic avalanches that engulfed villages have hit the
headlines in recent weeks. But most avalanches are triggered by
their victims and most of those injured are skiers. In Switzerland,
for example, 95 percent of all deaths in avalanches were people who
were skiing off of the marked trails. According to Georges Krsi, of
the Swiss Federal Institute for Snow and Avalanche Research in
Davos, off-piste skiers normally wear beacons to help locate them
in the case of an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Each skier in a group sets their own beacon to transmit a signal
at 457 kilohertz. If an avalanche buries some members, the others
switch their units to receive mode, and then listen for the beeps
emitted by buried transmitters. The signals become stronger as the
rescuers get closer, and users are trained to search systematically
in a grid pattern.
</P>
<P>
   But an analysis of rescue attempts using this method in the
United States since 1977 suggests that this is not very effective.
The Colorado Avalanche Information Centre has found that
professional skiers such as ski guides took 18 minutes on average
to reach their buried companions, but only 59 percent of victims
were still alive when found.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary recreational skiers _ the vast majority of would-be
rescuers _ took an average of 32 minutes to reach the victims, and
found only 32 percent of them alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that a beacon is better than no beacon,''
says Blyth Wright of the Scottish Avalanche Information Service.
But the Americans concluded that ``further technical developments
of the transceiver are mandatory.'' This year several manufacturers
have put new beacons on the market, with small screens that display
the direction and distance of the signal they are receiving.
</P>
<P>
   The SLF has evaluated the new devices, and Krsi says they are
``a step in the right direction.'' But they are difficult even for
professionals to use, he says, and so do not yet offer clear
advantages over the old beacons.
</P>
<P>
   Currently the signals do not carry more than 50 meters.
Longer-range beacons are being proposed to track skiers and hikers.
Some parks in Canada are experimenting with giving hikers radio
transmitters of the type normally used to track caribou, and last
week in the Alps three stranded climbers were found by homing in on
the fading signal of their mobile phone. But Wright says that
rescue services are dubious of such devices because of the time
that can be wasted chasing beacons that have activated by
accident. &QL;

   Who needs computer mice or data gloves cluttering up our desks,
asks a team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.
Instead, they have created a ``sensory tabletop'' that keeps track
of your hand as you move it around. But rather than being limited
to two dimensions, the table can accurately detect the motion of
your hand in three dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   Physicist Neil Gershenfeld wants computer users to enjoy their
technology built into attractive furniture. ``So instead of it
being your job to find the mouse, it's the table's job to reach out
and find you,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Gershenfeld developed the new system with the help of his former
student Josh Smith. Electrodes build into the surface of the table
induce tiny currents of the order of nanoamps in your hand. Your
hand, in turn, induces detectable currents in the coils embedded in
the table top.
</P>
<P>
   From the distribution of current in coils across the table,
mathematical algorithms calculate where your hand must be in 3-D
space to create such currents. In this way, the technology could be
used to control 3-D special effects or computer-aided design
software.
</P>
<P>
   The technique mirrors one used by geophysicists, who face a
similar problem _ but the other way up. By sending electric or
acoustic pulses into the ground, they can then measure the pulses
that return and attempt to use these to describe the matter beneath
the surface. But it's no easy task. ``Supercomputers grind away for
weeks on these problems,'' Gershenfeld says.
</P>
<P>
   But the MIT researchers have refined their algorithms so the
table sensor works on low-cost computers. Their next step is to
develop the system so that the sensor table can generate a 3-D
computer image of the hand above it. &QL;

<P>
   Substances that make brain cells grow might lead to treatments
for baldness, say dermatologists in Germany. They expect their
bizarre discovery could also open up new avenues for keeping
unwanted body hair at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that growth factors previously
thought to be important for the development of brain cells are also
important for the growth of hair follicles,'' says Ralf Paus, who
carried out the work while at Humbolt University in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Paus and his colleagues had previously shown that a growth
factor in the brain called neurotrophin-3 triggers the formation of
hair follicles in embryonic mice. When mammals are born, however,
the follicles shrink and regress, which is why a baby's hair often
falls out a few weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
   In the next ``resting'' phase of the cycle, the shrunken
follicle hangs onto the original hair shaft until a new hair pushes
it out of the way. Finally, after a short burst of growth, when new
hairs take over, the follicle shrivels and resumes its resting
phase once again. In mice, the cycle lasts a matter of weeks. In
humans, it can take two to six years.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments with shaved mice, Paus' team has shown that just
before the shriveling phase, hair follicles are awash with two
growth factors: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). And the two genes which make the proteins
are abnormally active at the same time. This suggested that the
chemicals actually trigger the shrinking of follicles.
</P>
<P>
   To confirm this, the researchers engineered mice to churn out
too much BDNF. As expected, their hair fell out earlier than usual.
Conversely, hair took longer than normal to fall out in
``knockout'' mice that could not make either protein.
</P>
<P>
   The same series of experiments, published in FASEB Journal (vol.
13, p. 395), reveal that the two substances work by binding to a
receptor called tyrosine kinase B. If humans have a similar system,
then drugs that block the receptor could prevent hair loss.
Alternatively, drugs that mimic the brain proteins and bind to the
receptor might help people shed unwanted hair.
</P>
<P>
   Paus says such drugs have already been developed as potential
treatments for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease
and multiple sclerosis. ``It's not too farfetched to propose using
them for hair disorders, particularly if you can apply them
topically in lotions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is too early to say whether the mouse results are
relevant to humans, adds Paus, who is now at the University
Hospital in Hamburg. One difference, he points out, is that mouse
hair grows in synchronized waves, whereas each human hair has its
own individual growth cycle, so overall hair growth is much more
erratic than in mice.
</P>
<P>
   George Cotsarelis, director of the hair and scalp clinic at the
University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia, agrees

possible. ``These new findings might be more useful for getting rid
of hair than restoring it,'' he adds. &QL;

   Substances that make brain cells grow might lead to treatments
for baldness, say dermatologists in Germany. They expect their
bizarre discovery could also open up new avenues for keeping
unwanted body hair at bay.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that growth factors previously
thought to be important for the development of brain cells are also
important for the growth of hair follicles,'' says Ralf Paus, who
carried out the work while at Humbolt University in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Paus and his colleagues had previously shown that a growth
factor in the brain called neurotrophin-3 triggers the formation of
hair follicles in embryonic mice. When mammals are born, however,
the follicles shrink and regress, which is why a baby's hair often
falls out a few weeks after birth.
</P>
<P>
   In the next ``resting'' phase of the cycle, the shrunken
follicle hangs onto the original hair shaft until a new hair pushes
it out of the way. Finally, after a short burst of growth, when new
hairs take over, the follicle shrivels and resumes its resting
phase once again. In mice, the cycle lasts a matter of weeks. In
humans, it can take two to six years.
</P>
<P>
   In experiments with shaved mice, Paus' team has shown that just
before the shriveling phase, hair follicles are awash with two
growth factors: brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and
neurotrophin-4 (NT-4). And the two genes which make the proteins
are abnormally active at the same time. This suggested that the
chemicals actually trigger the shrinking of follicles.
</P>
<P>
   To confirm this, the researchers engineered mice to churn out
too much BDNF. As expected, their hair fell out earlier than usual.
Conversely, hair took longer than normal to fall out in
``knockout'' mice that could not make either protein.
</P>
<P>
   The same series of experiments, published in FASEB Journal (vol.
13, p. 395), reveal that the two substances work by binding to a
receptor called tyrosine kinase B. If humans have a similar system,
then drugs that block the receptor could prevent hair loss.
Alternatively, drugs that mimic the brain proteins and bind to the
receptor might help people shed unwanted hair.
</P>
<P>
   Paus says such drugs have already been developed as potential
treatments for neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease
and multiple sclerosis. ``It's not too farfetched to propose using
them for hair disorders, particularly if you can apply them
topically in lotions,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   However, it is too early to say whether the mouse results are
relevant to humans, adds Paus, who is now at the University
Hospital in Hamburg. One difference, he points out, is that mouse
hair grows in synchronized waves, whereas each human hair has its
own individual growth cycle, so overall hair growth is much more
erratic than in mice.
</P>
<P>
   George Cotsarelis, director of the hair and scalp clinic at the
University of Pennsylvania Medical Center in Philadelphia, agrees
that if the results hold true for humans, new treatments might be
possible. ``These new findings might be more useful for getting rid
of hair than restoring it,'' he adds. &QL;

MILITARY AIRCRAFT DESIGNERS COULD LEARN A LOT FROM NATURE'S SILENT

   Owls are the original stealth aircraft, dropping silently,
talons at the ready, onto their prey. That's why engineers working
with military and defense agencies will be all ears later this
month during a meeting of the European Acoustics Association to be
held at the Technical University of Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Lilley, an acoustics expert at the University of
Southampton, will describe how the trailing edge of owl feathers
helps to stifle the sound of the bird's flight. This could give
designers tips for reducing noise in future stealth aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   The prey of owls _ rats, mice and voles _ often has excellent
hearing, so they can't afford to fly as noisily as other birds.
``The owl has to be able to fly silently to have a good dinner,''
says Lilley, who also works at NASA's Langley Research Center in
Hampton, Va.
</P>
<P>
   To do this, the owl has evolved feathers that are different from
those of other birds. ``The flight feathers of most birds have a
fairly sharp, clean edge,'' says Gerry Carr, a biomechanist at the
University of Victoria in British Columbia, Canada. ``But the
leading edges of the flight feathers of an owl coupled with the
outer third of the hand section of the wing's trailing edges are
characterized by soft, feathery `fringes' which have the effect of
muffling the flow of air as it passes over the wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how these fringes reduce noise was unclear, so Lilley used
computer simulations to work out what they did. ``The devices at
the trailing edge are acting like some sort of pressure release,''
he said. ``The various gaps in the trailing edge allow pressure
relief, and as a result, the noise generation of the turbulent flow
decreases.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's plausible that the owl will yield secrets engineers can
use,'' says Jeremy Rayner, a bird flight expert at the University
of Bristol. He notes that engineers have already used birdlike
designs to improve the efficiency and reduce the noise of
helicopter blades. &QL;

 &HT;    County wants to uproot lone Deem City dweller
 &HT;    By Dan Moffett
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ A 3-foot, yellow rat snake is loose in
the bathroom of Clifton Lirette's ramshackle trailer. But, at this
particular moment last week, he finds more entertaining the 6-foot
yuppie businessman who has come looking for monster cheeseburgers.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes he sees all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Hamburger customers have become an endangered species.
</P>
<P>
   Here at the doorstep of what hunters know as the Terrytown
reserve and most everyone else knows as no place, Lirette attracts
visitors by his presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I meet all kinds of people here just because I'm here,'' he
says, acknowledging the paradox with a toothless smile.
</P>
<P>
   Few men are so defined by location as this sun-worn 67-year-old.
When Lirette first settled here 20 years ago, a sign across U.S. 27
read: ``Deem City, Pop. 2.'' Then a fire destroyed the convenience
store and service station and, for practical purposes, Deem City
ceased to be.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Lirette remained at his remote outpost at the edge of the
Everglades in southwestern Palm Beach County, 100 yards from the
Broward line.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is no-man's land,'' he says, ``but I love it because I
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-mile stretch of two-lane highway south of South Bay once
was known as Bloody 27 for its many horrific accidents. Lirette
says he is in danger of becoming the road's last casualty.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, the state widened the road to four lanes, and
claimed the hamburger stand Lirette ran from an old panel truck.
Clif's Superburgers died.
</P>
<P>
   Now the county wants Lirette to move himself off the land. He
bought his three-quarter acre lot 12 years ago for $45,000, but it
is zoned for agriculture use, not residential. Today the
dilapidated 60-foot trailer and two sheds Lirette calls home are a
code inspector's nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't live there,'' said Terry Verner, the county's
director of code enforcement. ``He doesn't have an approved
structure to live in. We're assuming he's not living there.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lirette most certainly is. Though mammoth Florida Power &AMP;
Light towers are above him, he must run a gas-powered generator 18
hours a day to pump his water and run his freezer. A friend stops
by to haul away his garbage. Sanitation facilities tend to be
rather primitive.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody dropped off a pit bull-collie mix Lirette named Butch.
Somebody else dropped off a rooster. A spaniel-Labrador female came
by a few weeks back, and now Butch is the father of four puppies.
Everyone puts up with each other, snakes included.
</P>
<P>
   Lirette spends most days on the couch or at his desk in the
10-by-15-foot shed. Cans of Jack Mackerel, Beefaroni and sardines
line the shelf, the pantry of a man who lives on a $700 Social
Security check each month.
</P>
<P>
   A proven routine makes life manageable here. During the week
Lirette enjoys Busch beer then moves up in class to Corona or
Heineken for the weekend. Each morning he drives 14 miles south to
the nearest civilization _ a Winn Dixie on the outskirts of Weston
_ and buys Doral cigarettes, the morning newspaper, gas for the
generator and fresh food for the day. He alternates his trips in
either an '86 Audi or an '85 Dodge pickup.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be sure to have two cars,'' he says. ``That way if
one breaks, you're not stranded.''
</P>
<P>
   Born with polio, Lirette's right hand is crippled, and he has
suffered five strokes in three years. Blood thinners and beta
blockers are chased with the Coronas now. He has two telephones to
summon help if he needs it.
</P>
<P>
   A former New Orleans tugboat pilot, Lirette came to the
Everglades in the mid-1970s to haul barges and liked it so much he
stayed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This area used to be booming,'' he said. ``I could sit here
and watch dozens of snakes cross the road all at once. I used to
share my hamburger stand with the snakes. Possum, coon, even
bobcats _ they were all over here. Now you just don't see as
many.''
</P>
<P>
   When the burger business was peaking and he was selling 400
Superburgers at $3 apiece each day, he would entertain customers
with a collection of a dozen snakes. One of them was a python he
got in a trade for a native bull snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to turn them all loose when the new highway came,'' he
said. ``I think the python will be happy though, wherever he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Clifton Lirette's future is nebulous, too. For the last six
years, Verner and his inspectors have been citing him for
violations and urging him to move elsewhere. He has fought them at
each turn.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, they were horrified when they drove by and saw 14
trailer homes there. Lirette was selling them for a friend, at
between $1,000 and $1,500 each, and pocketing a commission. All but
two are gone now, but those are torn apart, unlivable and
considered eyesores by the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't make any real money,'' he says, ``but $100 is still
$100.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Slutsky, a Fort Lauderdale attorney who specializes in
probate work, was moved to assist Lirette in his battle with the
county after making a will for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a guy who's not on welfare, who's hurting no one and
is just trying to live his life,'' Slutsky said. ``What are they
going to do to him anyway? He owns the property.''
</P>
<P>
   Verner says the county has showed restraint in its dealings with
Lirette, but unless he cleans up his lot and conforms to code, a
legal showdown is unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sorry for Clif,'' Verner said. ``He's a good guy, and I
like him. He reminds me of a picture of one of those old cowboys
who needs to drink a beer to hold his jeans up. But he can't be
doing some of the things he's been trying to do there.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the county agreed to let Lirette put up a
mobile produce stand, so long as it did not cover more than 150
square feet and had sanitary facilities. He believes it impossible
to turn a profit with an operation that small.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I have the right to make a living on my property,'' he
says, ``and they don't want me to.''
</P>
<P>
   Carole Wallace Post, a Palm Beach Gardens attorney, represented
Lirette on a pro-bono basis two years ago. She said several social
service agencies offered to help him move elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refused that. He told them he was happy and content living
where he was. He doesn't want charity. But he's in tough situation
because that's such a strange parcel of land he's got.''
</P>
<P>
   Lirette maintains he has performed a public service just by
being there when needed. For a time, his was the only telephone
within a dozen miles.
</P>
<P>
   Late one night eight years ago, three children, none of them
older than 7 and all of them dripping wet and screaming, ran up to
his hamburger stand.
</P>
<P>
   They had been returning from a fishing trip in the Terrytown
wildlife area behind him when their father drove the family pickup
into the canal. Lirette called 911 and, with the help of some
hunters, put the man on his picnic table until an ambulance came.
</P>
<P>
   A month later, the family returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The man healed up all right,'' Lirette said. ``They all had
dinner here.''
</P>
<P>
   Truckers still honk their horns at Lirette's place when they
drive by. Last week, Demetrius Washington, 30, a consultant with a
South Florida health care company, pulled in searching for
hamburgers.
</P>
<P>
   When he was a college student at Florida Memorial in Miami, he
would make regular trips to his home in Arcadia. He said he stopped
at Clif's Superburgers every time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry he's not selling those burgers anymore,'' Washington
said. ``Trust me. They were big, and they were nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Lirette thanked Washington for dropping by, then headed into the
bathroom to chase out that rat snake.
</P>
<P>
   ``Believe it or not,'' he said, ``I have a reputation out
here.''

 &HT;    The littlest duckling: Sometimes being the youngest isn't all
it's quacked up to be
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ I call it the ``duckling syndrome.'' There's the
mother duck at the front of the line and all the little ducklings
waddling behind her, the youngest one at the end.
</P>
<P>
   I'm the littlest duckling in my family, the baby. I have spent
my life following after older siblings and trying not to ruffle any
feathers.
</P>
<P>
   A lot has been written about birth order and how it affects
children. I've read much of it and don't remember most of it. I do
know the oldest child often is the high-achieving, angst-ridden,
overly responsible one. The middle child's existence typically is a
lifelong scream for attention. And the youngest many times is
spoiled, laid back, easygoing and the happiest of the bunch. You
see, by the time the last child comes along, the parents have
foregone all their high-falutin' parenting skills, relaxed, and
just allowed that baby to develop as he or she was meant to.
</P>
<P>
   Those stereotypes may hold some truth, but there are certain
burdens the youngest child must bear.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment we are born, someone is telling us what to do,
how to do it, and when to do it. Much of it doesn't come from the
parents, either. It's the siblings. Whether it's brothers or
sisters, they're there. And they resent you for popping into their
world uninvited. They resent their parents making them sit on the
couch and hold you while pictures are taken for the baby book.
</P>
<P>
   They resent all the grown-ups making such a fuss over you just
because you can burp and wiggle. They resent that you are
permanently attached to their mother for the first six months of
your life.
</P>
<P>
   So, they get even . . . in little, deceptive, hidden ways. They
stand at your bassinet and watch you cry instead of going to get
mother. They pull the bottle out of your mouth on the way to the
back yard. They get inches away from your face on your second day
of life and tell you, ``I'm the boss of you and don't ever forget
it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a lot for the youngest to overcome. We follow behind our
parents and siblings in the grocery store, at the zoo, in the park,
down the church aisle. There's always someone in front of us
leading the way.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine, the youngest of four sisters, is a grown woman
and has a daughter of her own. Yet she tells me of being on a trip
with a group of co-workers when they decided to go to a mall.
Everyone scattered and she found herself alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stood there in that mall like I was 12 years old, waiting
for someone to come and tell me where to go. I will always be 12
years old in my mind!'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Our parents treat us differently, too. We're their ``last
chance'' to get things right. We must be the perfect ones. Whatever
mistakes our older siblings made, we must not. Sometimes we're able
to pull this off, superficially. If nothing else, youngest children
learn early how to evaluate their environment.
</P>
<P>
   While older sister and brother are rebelling against mom and
dad, we sit in the background, observe and make mental notes. Where
our siblings confront, we cajole. We're not stupid, you know.
</P>
<P>
   Parents also spend more time protecting the youngest. They keep
older siblings from bullying us when we're children, and they keep
distressing news from us when we're adults. To this day, my mother
will tell my older sister all the details of a medical problem, but
when I ask her, she'll say, ``I'm fine. Everything's OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do the opinions or advice of the youngest get taken
seriously. Often we're the background noise in family discussions.
We are forever given the pat-on-the-head, aren't-you-cute,
go-off-and-play treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The duckling syndrome. Sometimes the view from the end of the
line isn't all that pretty.

 &HT;    A vivid, different generation
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ The first question eighth-graders ask when I
tell them we're going to see a movie: ``Is it in color?'' Lord help
me if I say no. There's always a Johnny or a Susie who, in the
infinite wisdom of any 13-year-old, proclaims: ``Geez! Life was
so-ooo boring in the `olden days.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Life happened just the same in black and white as it does
today in living color,'' is my standard comment, but they just
don't get it. A few nod politely, and one or two let out a
know-it-all snort of disbelief. Frustrating, but it comes with the
age, I remind myself. Youthful egocentricity endows them with the
firm conviction that whatever it is they're experiencing at any
given moment, puppy love or test anxiety, is a first and unique to
their generation. And as for the ``good old days,'' forget it.
Anything that happened before ``Baywatch'' reruns and Korn is
antediluvian.
</P>
<P>
   It's kind of like they've all bought into the ``Pleasantville''
hoax. That's the movie that depicts the '50s (my generation) as a
sepia blur of nonpersons living repressed lives in a picket-fenced
Stepford town where emotions, like bosoms, are confined by
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   What the writer of this monochromatic aberration of history
(``Pleasantville'') doesn't seem to understand (probably because he
was only 2 when the decade ended) is that his imaginings of life in
the '50s are just as stereotypical as the folks he wrote into his
sanitized little town. In Pleasantville, everyone sleeps alone, no
one is ever caught in the act of spontaneous anything, and lust is
simply a four-letter word in the dictionary that comes between
Lusitania and Lutheran.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the way it was. Sure, our emotions (as well as
our chests) were confined, but not by any pretense of piety.
Rather, we were guided by what we'd been taught was appropriate. We
knew better than to make a public display of ourselves, and we
cherished our privacy. Certainly, we'd never heard of anyone
messing up big time, confessing it on television, and then selling
the book rights for seven figures. Our parents would have killed
us.
</P>
<P>
   Folks of my generation bought into the notion of doing what was
expected of us (most of the time) because no one had told us we
were entitled to ``find'' ourselves or do our ``own thing.'' It was
our naive belief that assuming responsibility for ourselves meant
not letting down those who were counting on us.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us obeyed the rules laid out by our parents and schools,
but we definitely were not, as the movie suggests, zombies
shuffling through our teen years. We had a ball. Best of all, we
never had to make adult decisions while we were still kids.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us suppressed our teen-age libidos because that's what
we were expected to do. If we hadn't, and if we'd been caught, it
would have been instant mortification with our peers and suicide
with our parents. Funny, but I don't remember that any of us felt
shortchanged because we were expected to stomp on our instincts. We
felt curious, and we felt disadvantaged, but we were kids. As far
as we knew, that's how we were supposed to feel. Besides, we knew
it gave us something to look forward to when we were grownups.
</P>
<P>
   Our '50s clothes would probably look a little funny by today's
standards, but back then, we were the coolest. The girls wore their
skirts long and the boys wore their hair short. No morality
statement _ it was just the style. Could we help it if we came
along during saddle oxfords and crinolines instead of navel rings
and purple hair? Just try to imagine how ``with it'' the current
baggy pants fad is going to look 40 years from now.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to youthful belief, life in the '50s happened in vivid
color. Whether it was better than now or worse, I can't say. It was
just different. But I suspect it was also a heck of a lot easier.

 &HT;    Fast-good-cheap work an unlikely trifecta
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automotive trade journals often contain articles concerning auto
repair issues that should be read by the public but are not because
they appear in publications normally read only by automotive
people.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I read an article that sums up much of what I have
been trying to impart for the past 4 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Mitch Schneider, an automotive writer for more than
15 years, agreed that the consumer and the automotive industry must
come to some meeting of the minds. His article, ``Cognitive
Dissonance,'' appears in the January issue of MotorAge Magazine.
(http://www.motorage.com; click on Schneider's World)
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the comments I hear are from disgruntled car
owners who have been the victims of less-than-pleasant auto repair
experiences. With few exceptions, the circumstances surrounding
these situations are the result of two distinct categories of auto
repair shoppers: those who are honestly trying to take care of
their vehicles and those who avoid servicing their cars until
something breaks or quits running.
</P>
<P>
   While it's easy to understand how people who neglect their
vehicles' needs end up on the losing end of repair encounters, it
would seem that the maintenance-minded group should have little to
fear. Not so. Although these two groups may appear to have
different philosophies, between them is a common thread: They want
quality repair, they don't want it to cost much and they want it
done yesterday, in short, as Schneider puts it, ``good, cheap and
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Is good, cheap and fast too much to ask for?
</P>
<P>
   Discount auto service commercials promise consumers everything
from same-day complete brake jobs to oil changes at bargain prices,
while mailboxes are stuffed with auto repair and service coupons.
This tangled web of ``great deals'' captures many.
</P>
<P>
   The ``drive it till it drops'' shoppers expect low-cost repairs
to apply to everything that could conceivably be wrong. They are
outraged that the two-digit advertised brake job is going to cost
them several hundred dollars because the shop has to replace
destroyed parts, or that an oil change is not going to fix the
knock in their engine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the victims of their own procrastination and
unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The service-minded victims get their oil changed regularly at
whatever ``quickie lube'' place is cheapest or most convenient.
They go for the ``free'' brake inspections and use coupons for
other maintenance or service needs. Should the vehicle develop an
unadvertised problem, they let their fingers do the walking until
they find a shop that will give them the least-expensive phone
quote for repairs. Preferably, this is a shop that has a complete
computer printout of anything and everything else wrong with the
vehicle so the mechanic can fix it fast (as long as its not too
expensive) and they can pick it up on the way home from work.
</P>
<P>
   They are caught in an illusionary web of finding quality and
expediency at rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   As Schneider writes: ``Fast. Good. Cheap. Pick any two. ... If
you want high-quality work and you want it done yesterday, we can
deliver without missing a beat. But in order for us to accomplish
an impossible assignment like that, we'll have to put two
technicians on the job. Will it be fast? Yes. Will it be good? You
bet! Will it be cheap? Uh, I don't think so.''

 &HT;    Ford's takeover of Volvo likely to benefit both
 &HT;    By Linda Sharp
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This past Monday, Volvo cars officially became part of Ford
Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   There may be some longtime Volvo die-hards who see the corporate
marriage as a potential contamination of the Volvo heritage. My
guess is that nothing could be further from the truth.
</P>
<P>
   If Ford's track record with Jaguar and Aston Martin is any
indicator _ and there is no reason to think it is not _ Ford will
be more like a benevolent uncle than Big Brother.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the industry now say that in spite of Ford's position of
ownership with the two British brands, both are more British than
ever. More importantly, each has a much higher quality rating than
in any time in either's storied history. I think the impending
marriage of Volvo and Ford is a more natural match than the
arrangements with Jaguar or Aston Martin.
</P>
<P>
   Even those with the most casual automotive interest know that
Volvo's claim to fame is its expertise in safety.
</P>
<P>
   Volvo was the first to introduce seat belts as standard
equipment, and that was just the first in a long line of safety
innovations that have long been the benchmark of the brand.
</P>
<P>
   Ford also seems to be taking a leading role in producing cars
with outstanding safety ratings. At least five of its passenger
vehicles _ Ford Crown Victoria, Ford Taurus, Ford Windstar, Mercury
Sable and Mercury Grand Marquis _ all have received the federal
government's five-star safety rating in crash tests.
</P>
<P>
   Sharing of knowledge with a company such as Volvo seems a
natural progression on the path of safety innovations for Ford.
</P>
<P>
   An infusion of corporate capital by Ford is certainly welcomed
by Volvo cars, but Ford potentially stands as much to gain. Volvo
is currently offering leading technology in the area of all-weather
traction control systems.
</P>
<P>
   This system uses a viscous drive with locking rear differential
and anti-lock brake-controlled traction for the front wheels.
</P>
<P>
   The Stability Traction Control is standard on the Volvo S80
luxury sedan, and buyers can add an optional Dynamic Stability
Control System, which utilizes a yaw sensor to help eliminate
lateral loss of traction, or spin. Volvo's DSTC is the only system
in the industry that provides a duplicate system, so that if one
fails there is a backup.
</P>
<P>
   The buyout might mean an all-wheel-drive Taurus or Sable or
installation of Volvo interior safety components such as side air
curtains or proactive head restraints on Ford product lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Volvo/Ford wedding is one to which I think corporate
marriage counselors would quickly give their blessing.

 &HT;    HEALTH BRIEFS: New drugs `godsend' for arthritis sufferers
 &HT;    (EDS: This is a compilation of health stories which moved to the
wires this week.)
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Two days after trying Enbrel injections for her
rheumatoid arthritis, Melody Ray felt so good she wanted to tell
all her friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised it worked so fast,'' said Ray, a 51-year-old
homemaker who has tried several remedies the past 17 years. ``The
swelling in my joints is much less, and I can actually make a fist
and feel my fingers. I know I still have the disease, but it's so
much better.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray is among the thousands of arthritis patients nationwide
being prescribed Enbrel and two other new medicines for their
condition that control pain and swelling with fewer side effects,
such as stomach and kidney distress.
</P>
<P>
   The development of these drugs, Enbrel, Arava and Celebrex, is
considered as significant as the discovery of cortisone in the late
1940s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some patients say it's a godsend,'' said Dr. W. Hayes Wilson,
Atlanta's Piedmont Hospital chief of rheumatology. ``It's the first
medicines that they could take in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Enbrel and Arava are aimed specifically at rheumatoid arthritis,
which differs from the more common osteoarthritis, the result of
wear and tear on joints that occurs as people age. Rheumatoid
arthritis can strike early in adolescence, turning into a
debilitating condition of fatigue, painful swollen joints and
difficulty with the simplest of tasks. The exact cause of
rheumatoid arthritis remains elusive. About 2 million Americans
suffer RA; 60 percent of them are women.
</P>
<P>
   But some arthritis sufferers are finding they cannot afford some
of the drugs they've waited so long to try. For example, one shot
of Enbrel costs $125. At twice weekly doses, that's $13,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Ray says her health insurance company agreed to pay for the
prescription, which arrives by mail. But Ben Starr of Columbia,
Mo., says the ``exorbitant'' Enbrel is out of reach to thousands of
retired middle-class people who are not covered by private
insurance, and whose Medicare benefits don't pay for prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first two weeks I enjoyed great relief, but cut back to
one shot per week with less satisfactory results because of the
cost,'' Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrex, the third drug, relieves pain without causing
gastrointestinal turmoil. People needing daily nonsteroidal
anti-inflammatory drugs for arthritis or other chronic pain can
suffer stomach ulcers and internal bleeding from these drugs. It
has been a major flaw of such drugs, estimated to cause 107,000
hospitalizations yearly, and resulting in 16,500 deaths.
</P>
<P>
   An easier way to fill an empty place in a child's heart
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It's natural for developing infants to have a small
opening in their heart while in the womb and as newborns.
</P>
<P>
   The hole is between the two main arteries _ aorta and pulmonary
artery _ that carry blood out of the heart to body and lungs. The
opening is within its own small blood vessel. In utero, as the
placenta oxygenates the fetus' blood, this opening is diverting
blood from the lungs, which are not used until delivery. The first
gulp of air jolts a newborn's lungs into functioning, and that's
when the vital circulating loop of blood from heart to lungs
begins.
</P>
<P>
   The hole is considered harmless because it typically closes in
the first few days after birth. But it often doesn't in premature
babies. Though considered rare in the overall statistics of live
births, it is, in fact, a common congenital problem for infants
born with heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   Annually, about 32,000 babies born in the United States have
heart problems, and of those, about 10 percent to 12 percent will
have the open vessel condition, called PDA for short, requiring
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are very few babies born with it, but if it's in your
family, it's a 100 percent statistic,'' says Dr. Zahid Amin of the
Medical College of Georgia, one of five sites in the country
plugging these holes with the new device, called the Amplatz
occluder. About 25 babies will receive the device at the sites as
the first phase of study required for federal government approval;
it's already been inserted successfully in about 300 babies in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hole in these babies' hearts may be 4 millimeters in
diameter, smaller than a dime,'' Amin said. ``For a small baby,
that is a very significant opening. It is a huge pressure
difference on one side of their heart and it shunts blood to the
lungs.''
</P>
<P>
   Left untreated, the defect can lead to pulmonary hypertension,
thickness of the heart and endocarditis, a possibly fatal infection
of the heart lining requiring weeks of hospitalization and massive
antibiotics. The baby also doesn't gain weight because it spends
excessive calories pumping its own blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest interest is to save small babies from pain,'' Amin
said. ``And this (procedure) saves them from a lot of pain.''

 &HT;    Fast-good-cheap work an unlikely trifecta
 &HT;    By Nora Carter
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Automotive trade journals often contain articles concerning auto
repair issues that should be read by the public but are not because
they appear in publications normally read only by automotive
people.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I read an article that sums up much of what I have
been trying to impart for the past 4 1/2 years.
</P>
<P>
   The author, Mitch Schneider, an automotive writer for more than
15 years, agreed that the consumer and the automotive industry must
come to some meeting of the minds. His article, ``Cognitive
Dissonance,'' appears in the January issue of MotorAge Magazine.
(http://www.motorage.com; click on Schneider's World)
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the comments I hear are from disgruntled car
owners who have been the victims of less-than-pleasant auto repair
experiences. With few exceptions, the circumstances surrounding
these situations are the result of two distinct categories of auto
repair shoppers: those who are honestly trying to take care of
their vehicles and those who avoid servicing their cars until
something breaks or quits running.
</P>
<P>
   While it's easy to understand how people who neglect their
vehicles' needs end up on the losing end of repair encounters, it
would seem that the maintenance-minded group should have little to
fear. Not so. Although these two groups may appear to have
different philosophies, between them is a common thread: They want
quality repair, they don't want it to cost much and they want it
done yesterday, in short, as Schneider puts it, ``good, cheap and
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Is good, cheap and fast too much to ask for?
</P>
<P>
   Discount auto service commercials promise consumers everything
from same-day complete brake jobs to oil changes at bargain prices,
while mailboxes are stuffed with auto repair and service coupons.
This tangled web of ``great deals'' captures many.
</P>
<P>
   The ``drive it till it drops'' shoppers expect low-cost repairs
to apply to everything that could conceivably be wrong. They are
outraged that the two-digit advertised brake job is going to cost
them several hundred dollars because the shop has to replace
destroyed parts, or that an oil change is not going to fix the
knock in their engine.
</P>
<P>
   They are the victims of their own procrastination and
unrealistic expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The service-minded victims get their oil changed regularly at
whatever ``quickie lube'' place is cheapest or most convenient.
They go for the ``free'' brake inspections and use coupons for
other maintenance or service needs. Should the vehicle develop an
unadvertised problem, they let their fingers do the walking until
they find a shop that will give them the least-expensive phone
quote for repairs. Preferably, this is a shop that has a complete
computer printout of anything and everything else wrong with the
vehicle so the mechanic can fix it fast (as long as its not too
expensive) and they can pick it up on the way home from work.
</P>
<P>
   They are caught in an illusionary web of finding quality and
expediency at rock-bottom prices.
</P>
<P>
   As Schneider writes: ``Fast. Good. Cheap. Pick any two. ... If
you want high-quality work and you want it done yesterday, we can
deliver without missing a beat. But in order for us to accomplish
an impossible assignment like that, we'll have to put two
technicians on the job. Will it be fast? Yes. Will it be good? You
bet! Will it be cheap? Uh, I don't think so.''

 &HT;    Funds with low fees give biggest returns
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Here's a startling statistic: The Vanguard Group of
mutual funds netted more than $2 billion a week in new investments
last year.
</P>
<P>
   When you think about money moving that fast, you expect the
subject to be federal government spending, not private investing.
</P>
<P>
   It indicates a lot of Americans have acted on one of the basic
lessons of successful investing: Lower costs mean better returns.
</P>
<P>
   A number of studies have strongly suggested the mutual funds
that give investors the best returns are those with the lowest
fees. I tested that assertion against the latest data available in
the Morningstar database. The short-form answer: As of Jan. 31,
it's still true.
</P>
<P>
   I looked at returns of funds that invest in U.S. stocks. I
tossed out funds closed to new investment, that are sold only to
big, institutional investors or otherwise unavailable to the
public. That left 3,186 funds, certainly a significant sample.
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying table summarizes the results. If you had put
your money into one of the cheapest funds, your annual rate of
return would have been 17.9 percent _ 2.6 percentage points better
than the average for all of those domestic equity funds. If you're
a long-term investor, that's a big enough spread to be worth your
attention.
</P>
<P>
   The table also reaffirms the hypothesis with the most up-to-date
data: If you pay more for your mutual fund, you must expect lower
returns. Note the Morningstar data include both major costs for
mutual funds _ the annual expenses and any sales fee, or load.
</P>
<P>
   I am not saying all investment expenses are outrageous, or even
a bad thing. You are hiring a specialist to manage your money, and
you certainly should expect to pay for the service.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, how much are you are willing to pay?
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it's not hard to do some comparison shopping. You can
find basic data in the prospectus for any mutual fund.
</P>
<P>
   The Securities and Exchange Commission requires each fund
manager to tell you, in the prospectus, the total cost of a
hypothetical investment in the fund. The example is how much you
would pay for a $1,000 investment, assuming a 5 percent return each
year and holding periods of one, three, five and 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Fidelity's Growth and Income Fund _ one of the
largest in the United States _ would cost you $22 over three years
and $38 over five years. The rest of the data is on page 6 of the
prospectus.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Vanguard's huge Index 500 fund would cost $6 over
three years and $11 over five years. The numbers include both loads
and annual expenses.
</P>
<P>
   I would not want to suggest cost is the only consideration when
you pick a mutual fund. You might think of cost as a tie-breaker,
once you have narrowed your selections.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the very low-cost funds among the 3,186 in my study are
index funds. An index fund tries to mimic the performance of a
given index, such as the S&AMP;P 500. If the index goes up, so does the
value of the fund. But it's the same thing on the way down.
</P>
<P>
   Index funds have been tremendously popular in the past few
years, as the market has continued its climb. Vanguard's Index 500
fund _ the second largest mutual fund in the world _ grew by 46
percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   But index funds are not universally popular. A lot of investors
want to find a more actively managed fund, in hopes it will do
better than the indexes. Their thought: Why be average?
</P>
<P>
   Other investors want to get into particular areas of the market.
Some want to stick with the stocks of blue chip companies, for
example, or with funds known for a growth or value approach. Others
want to get even more selective, investing in foreign stocks or in
sector funds, such as technology or health care.
</P>
<P>
   The first step in picking mutual funds is making some general
decisions about your aims. How big a rate of return are you looking
for? How much risk are you willing to take? How can you balance
those two aspirations?
</P>
<P>
   Conservative investors might look to a balanced fund, which
invests in both stocks and bonds. The most aggressive investors
might seek out funds that invest in small-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   After those general considerations are settled, you can get to
the details. Those include such things as who the manager is, how
well he or she has done in the past, the fund's volatility as the
market goes up and down, and _ here it is _ the cost of investing
in the fund.
</P>
<P>
   For those details, a good place to start is the rankings
published by Morningstar or Value Line. Major libraries will have
their reports.
</P>
<P>
   When you are studying costs, here are some things to think
about:
</P>
<P>
   _ Loads are mostly sales fees. Two of the five largest mutual
funds in the country have loads of 5.75 percent and are sold only
through stockbrokers and other advisers.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing wrong with paying a commission. Many investors
want the advice that goes with it. For those people, the question
is: How much is that advice worth? Maybe it's 5.75 percent; maybe
it's more like 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't think you need the advice, it clearly pays to stick
with no-load or low-load funds.
</P>
<P>
   _ Not all loads are the same. Some mutual fund groups offer you
choices. You can pay a front-end load, or skip the load but pay
higher annual expenses, or lean toward a back-end load, which is
imposed when you sell the shares.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to hold the shares for more than four or five years,
it will probably be cheaper to pay a front-end load and avoid funds
with high annual expenses. Conversely, if you don't expect to hold
the shares more than a few years, you may be better off dodging the
loads and accepting the annual expenses.

 &HT;    Science/Health: New CAT scan gives quick pictures
 &HT;    By Kevin Lamb
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Douglas and Patricia Toler weren't looking
forward to taking their 10-month-old grandson to the hospital for a
CAT scan last week.
</P>
<P>
   He would need to be sedated so he could hold still for 10
minutes, they figured. ``We didn't like that idea with the medical
problems he had,'' Patricia said. Besides, they knew the drugs
would make him groggy and grouchy for another 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   So they were delighted to arrive at Children's Medical Center
and find out it had a new high-speed CAT scan machine that could
take the necessary pictures in only two minutes. For that long,
Patricia could distract little Brando Holland from the discomfort
of being strapped down by blowing soap bubbles in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of needing more than an hour to administer the
sedatives, position Brando for the scanner, shoot the images and
wait for him to wake up sufficiently, the whole procedure took less
than 10 minutes. The scanning itself took two minutes instead of
10.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful surprise,'' Douglas Toler said.
</P>
<P>
   CMC spent about $1 million for the machine that will cut CAT
scanning by half to four-fifths the time conventional scanners
take. Besides decreasing the drugs and increasing the comfort for
fidgety children, the Aquilion scanner installed Wednesday will
enable the radiation department to streamline its schedule and
sooner accommodate people without emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was such new technology, we actually waited for it,''
said Dr. Elizabeth Ey, the medical director of radiology, who began
looking for a new scanner a year ago. Only two hospitals previously
had the Aquilion, in Iowa City, Iowa, and Japan, but Ey said
Toshiba plans to install 40 more by July.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes such a significant difference in a children's
hospital because they don't have the attention span that adults
do,'' said administrative director Mary Beth Vaughn of radiology
and cardiology. ``They can't stay still as long.''
</P>
<P>
   If fewer patients need sedation, Vaughn said nurses will have
more time for actual scanning, ``although we'll probably need to
buy more bubbles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brando needed the scan to evaluate a shunt that had been put in
his head after his premature birth to draw fluid from his brain.
Even with the new scanner, Ey said a lot of 10-month-olds won't be
mellow enough to go without sedation.
</P>
<P>
   CAT scans, or computerized axial tomography, capture better
images of soft tissues than X-rays and also can provide more of a
three-dimensional look by stacking a number of two-dimensional
images. Brando needed 13 such ``slices,'' and a teen-ager would
need about 15 slightly thicker ones. The new scanner will take
thinner slices than previous models to help examine premature
babies.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly half of the monthly 400 to 450 CAT scans at Children's
are of patients' heads, where Ey said the superior soft-tissue
detail creates the biggest advantage. CAT scans are also valuable
for trauma cases ``because they're very sensitive to acute
bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), Ey said CAT
scans are cheaper and faster with better bone detail, but less
revealing of soft-tissue detail. Another frequent use for CAT scans
is in contrast studies, in which dye is injected through the
patient's blood stream to help doctors better see blood vessels or
certain tumors, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We won't have to use as much contrast dye with this scanner,''
Vaughn said.
</P>
<P>
   As 16-year-old Stacie Lake followed Brando on the scanner table,
Vaughn said she always hates to see kids go through sinus scans
because they have to stay in such awkward positions. Stacie had
sinus polyps blocking all of her right nostril and 90 percent of
her left.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have fallen asleep,'' she said after the procedure
lasted less than 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really excited about this,'' Vaughn said. ``Probably
more excited than normal people should be. But this will make
everybody's lives so much easier.

 &HT;    Unified title or not, no fight like Ali-Frazier
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was a classic moment of give-and-take in what many
consider the greatest single sporting event of this half-century.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Frazier _ head down, body low, bobbing and weaving
incessantly _ bore in on Muhammad Ali with a remorseless body
attack that was climaxed by searing hooks to the ribs.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Ali fired a series of jabs, landed some stinging
right hands and then shouted at his stumpy nemesis: ``Fray-sha,
don't you know, I am God?''
</P>
<P>
   ``God, you're in the wrong place tonight,'' Frazier shot back.
</P>
<P>
   And what names Frazier could have written down that glorious
Madison Square Garden night 28 years ago. It was the first of three
Ali-Frazier fights and Frank Sinatra leaned on the ring apron
shooting photographs for Life magazine. Actor Burt Lancaster was
doing the broadcast. Edward Kennedy, Burt Bacharach and astronaut
Alan Shepard were in the $150 ringside seats. So was Diana Ross,
who was allowed in Ali's post-fight dressing room. Outside,
meanwhile, 76-year-old former champ Jack Dempsey knocked out two
thugs who tried to mug him.
</P>
<P>
   As for that sellout crowd of more than 20,000, they showed up
with orange and green and pink velvet hot pants, alligator shoes,
zebra-striped capes, mink stoles, black leather knickers, purple
fedoras and diamond-crowned walking sticks. It was, Sports
Illustrated noted, as if ``Manhattan listed toward Babylon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked down from the ring and it was a sea of glitter,''
said Eddie Futch, one of Frazier's trainers. ``I had never seen any
boxing event that had so many celebrities,''
</P>
<P>
   No one had seen a fight like this . . . nor have they since.
With each boxer receiving a then-unheard-of $2.5 million, this was
the richest financial backing ever given a sporting event. It would
usher in a new era of glamour, money and visibility _ 300 million
worldwide watched the TV broadcast _ not just to boxing, but sports
in general.
</P>
<P>
   America was swept up in the anticipation of what would happen
between Frazier and Ali _ both unbeaten, except for Ali's lone loss
to the U.S. government. That cost him 3 years of exile for refusing
military service during the Vietnam War and it left the fight
swirling prominently in the turbulent political currents of the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier and Ali did nothing to calm the waters. No hyphen-held
matchups in sports _ not Schmeling-Louis, Palmer-Nicklaus,
Borg-McEnroe, Sosa-McGwire _ are bound more fiercely in such
dramatic theater.
</P>
<P>
   And while Ali and Frazier fought three times, nothing tops that
first bout. It's been become the standard by which all other
heavyweight fights _ especially this Saturday's unification bout at
the Garden between champs Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis _ are
measured.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had NBA finals, Stanley Cup finals, All-Star games, but
there's nothing like a heavyweight title fight,'' said Madison
Square Gardens president Dave Checketts.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's long-anticipated match to unify the title for the
first time in seven years has all the earmarks of a classic
encounter. Experts are split on their predictions though most
expect a slugfest. That's helped make the fight only the fourth
Garden sellout in history. This time ringside seats went for
$1,500, yet I don't think you'll get more for your money than
Ali-Frazier offered.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Ali, the fight game was raised to high drama. A
classy, stylish boxer, he was an extrovert who thrived on media
attention. Frazier, on the other hand, was the fearsome puncher,
who was intensely private away from the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier grew up poor in Beaufort S.C., the son of a struggling
farmer and bootlegger. He migrated to Philadelphia and became a
real life Rocky, working in a slaughterhouse where he tenderized
sides of beef with that left hook. Eventually, he won the
heavyweight crown stripped from Ali
</P>
<P>
   To return to the ring, Ali enlisted Frazier's vocal support. But
soon after reinstatement, Ali _ whether simply selling wolf tickets
or blatantly violating all cannons of fairness and decency _ began
to humiliate Frazier. He called him a gorilla, then painted him as
an ignorant errand boy for White America, a shuffling, mumbling
Uncle Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier _ whose whole life had been defined by being poor and
black _ felt betrayed and could barely control his rage The
electricity of the confrontation crackled through the Garden crowd
on fight night and then _ with the opening bell _ Ali and Frazier
turned up the juice even more.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 rounds, Frazier had beaten Ali's handsome face lopsided
and won a unanimous decision. But Ali salvaged something greater _
he got respect. It came in the final round when Frazier dropped him
with a thunderous left hook. No one thought Ali would survive, but
instead he climbed to his feet and fought on, forever erasing
questions of his courage.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward both men went to the hospital. Ali got a brief exam,
but Frazier needed a month of checkups for exhaustion, high blood
pressure and kidney problems. Ali would needle him about that until
it almost seemed as if he'd won the first bout, just as he would
the last two.
</P>
<P>
   That was the magic of Ali and why he once said: ``When I'm gone,
boxing will be nothing. The fans with cigars and hats turned down
will be there, but no more housewives and little men in the street
and foreign presidents. It's going back to the fighter who comes to
town, smells a flower, visits a hospital, blows a horn and says
he's in shape. Old hat. I was the onliest boxer in history people
asked questions of like a senator.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, just before he left his training camp in the
Poconos, Lennox Lewis stressed to everyone that he was in shape. He
wore a white cap. It looked kind of old.

 &HT;    Park faces memories of AMS crash in Atlanta return
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was a year ago Saturday that Bob Park got the
telephone call from Dale Earnhardt.
</P>
<P>
   Park, a gear specialist for Dale Earnhardt Inc., was preparing
to drive to Atlanta for last year's Primestar 500 at Atlanta Motor
Speedway. His son, rookie driver Steve Park, was going to make his
eighth start on NASCAR's Winston Cup circuit.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Park and his wife, Dorothy, wouldn't be making the drive
from Charlotte, N.C. last March 6. Instead, Earnhardt was sending
his private jet. Only minutes earlier, Steve Park had been
air-lifted to Georgia Baptist Hospital after hitting the pit-road
wall head on in his No. 1 Chevrolet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was headed to the track the day it happened,'' Bob Park
recalled. ``It was a long plane ride, especially not knowing
exactly what had happened. We didn't know the extent of his
injuries, mentally or physically.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Park suffered a broken right leg, left collarbone and
right shoulder in the wreck, which occurred after something in the
right side of his car broke. As he exited turn 4 of the 1.54-mile
oval during a Friday practice session, Park's car veered into the
outside wall and then careened into the wall on the front
straightaway. His car cut across the infield grass and hit the
pit-road wall at nearly 140 mph. It took medics several minutes to
extricate Park, but, miraculously, he suffered no internal or head
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit the wall, I wanted to get out of the car to see
what was wrong, but I couldn't move,'' Park said. ``I looked down
and saw my leg and knew I wouldn't be jumping out of any car for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Park, 31, didn't return to racing until August and missed nearly
half of the 1998 season. He didn't finish higher than 11th in the
17 races after his return. He says he has put the accident in the
past, but it undoubtedly derailed what had been a very promising
start to his career.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Park returns to Atlanta for Sunday's Cracker Barrel
Old Country Store 500. It will be his second trip to AMS since the
severe crash _ he finished 17th in last year's season-finale in
Atlanta _ and Park says he has faced his bad memories much as he
did his wreck _ head on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went back to Atlanta in November and pretty much got rid of
any demons that were still there after the wreck,'' he said. ``You
don't totally forget that this is a track where you got hurt, but
once you are in the race car, you don't have a lot of time to dwell
on that type of stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly three years ago, Park was hand-picked by ``The
Intimidator'' to drive DEI's Busch car. Earnhardt made the
surprising choice after watching Park finish 11th in a Craftsman
Truck Series race in 1996 and again when he won the pole in a truck
event at Watkins Glen later that season.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1996, Earnhardt called Park's home in
Connecticut and left a message on his answering machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I checked, there were about 20 messages, so I'm buzzing
through them, taking down the important ones,'' Park said. ``In the
middle of all the messages, came the voice of some guy saying he
was Dale Earnhardt, and he was looking for a guy named Steve Park.
I just kind of laughed and continued on my way. I have a lot of
friends who like to play jokes, so I figured that it was just
somebody messing with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Park was hired to drive for Earnhardt, and he won
rookie of the year in the Busch Series in 1997. Last year, he
finished 41st and 31st at Daytona but failed to qualify at the
third race in Las Vegas. Park wrecked the next week at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is a high-speed sport, but sometimes the fastest thing
about racing isn't the car,'' he said. ``It's how fast you can go
from the top of the world to the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Park started this season where he left off last year _ near the
bottom. While some have questioned whether he lost his edge after
the accident, Park attributes the slow start to poor luck.
</P>
<P>
   In the 135th lap of the season-opening Daytona 500, Park got
knocked out of the race when teammates Dale Jarrett and Kenny Irwin
wrecked. He finished 34th.
</P>
<P>
   At Rockingham the next week, Park passed about 25 cars in the
first 100 laps. But when he pitted during lap 209, a yellow flag
came out while he was still on pit road, relegating him to a
26th-place finish.
</P>
<P>
   Park finished 16th in the Las Vegas 400, but he took that outing
with a grain of salt. With about 60 laps remaining in the 267-lap
event, Park was one of only a few drivers who could have finished
the race without making another pit stop.
</P>
<P>
   With only 32 laps remaining, however, NASCAR officials put out
the yellow flag when they spotted oil on the pavement. The leaders
were able to return to pit road for fuel and new tires.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into Atlanta, Park says his team is encouraged. He says
his accident at AMS last year has helped put things in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned not to take what I have now for granted and how
fleeting this whole thing can be,'' he said. ``I mean that as far
as career-wise, health-wise and life-wise. It may sound crazy, but
that wreck did more for my desire than anything could have.''

 &HT;    75 pounds lighter, she's ready for a new look
 &HT;    By Cara Anna
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ This is one of those times when math is
fun.
</P>
<P>
   From 211 pounds to 136. From size 18 to size 8.
</P>
<P>
   After trying and failing with numerous diets, Jodie Conrad moved
from New York to Wellington in 1996 and decided to make a few
``lifestyle changes.''
</P>
<P>
   She left a stressful job in retail management. She joined Weight
Watchers _ for the third time _ and started walking every day. In a
year and a half, she lost 75 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the mind-set _ you've got to be ready, even the weeks
when you lose nothing,'' said Conrad, 42 and the mother of two
boys.
</P>
<P>
   Now she works part time for Weight Watchers as a receptionist
and group leader, talking others through their diets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that I'm a leader, I've got to give the appearance of
it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   So the folks at Salon Margrit in Palm Beach took over. Conrad
describes herself as ``one of those people who goes from place to
place'' for hair care. Her salon visits consist of a cut and color,
nothing more. For makeup she wears blush, lip gloss and a concealer
with sunscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Jaye Bryant, a stylist at Salon Margrit, checked out Conrad's
coarse, dark-brown hair. There was too much of it, she said,
``distributed all over her head; you don't know where to look.''
Also, the color was too dark for her skin tone.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant added red and gold highlights in front but left the rest
alone. Stylist Michel Loeb trimmed and layered Conrad's hair for a
more controlled, professional look.
</P>
<P>
   Then they waxed the undersides of Conrad's eyebrows and the area
between the brows to open up the eye area more.
</P>
<P>
   On to makeup. ``I want to open the eyes. They're one of her
stronger features,'' said makeup artist Mary Ann Ceccarelli.
</P>
<P>
   She worked quickly, applying concealer, even on the eyelids, to
even out Conrad's skin tones. Then she added a light beige
eyeshadow, black eyeliner and mascara. She lined her lips in mauve
and filled them in with plum lipstick.
</P>
<P>
   Then, hustling to catch the last bit of sunlight for the
``after'' photo, the staff put Conrad in a black cardigan (on
backward for a better neckline), a silver necklace and clip-on
earrings.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very nice!'' she said. ``Obviously, I'm not going to have
the makeup as jazzed up, but the hair is easy. I would just blow it
dry and push it to the side.''

   PEDESTRIAN-DEATHS (San Francisco) _ The dramatic rise in
pedestrian deaths in San Francisco has prompted calls for public
hearings on how to make the streets safer. In the one-year period
ending June 30, 1998, 39 pedestrians were killed on city streets,
and another two were mowed down on local highways, according to the
San Francisco medical examiner's office. During the previous year,
23 pedestrians lost their lives in San Francisco. By RACHEL GORDON.

at the Golden Dragon restaurant, one of the worst massacres in San

   NEWBORNS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Besides the routine physicals and
vaccinations, Dr. Kevin Karpowicz dispenses a lot of parenting
advice. For a newborn, he believes nothing is better than a
parent's love and attention to ensure a good foundation for the
child's future. If that sounds like common sense, you're not too
far behind the last research in infant brain development, much of
which builds on age-old parenting techniques rather than expensive
toys or classes. By SYLVIA WOOD.

   UMBILICAL-CORDS (Albany, N.Y.) _ Sue Tighe wanted to donate her
newborn's umbilical cord blood for good use. ``Otherwise it just
goes down the drain, so why not bank it?'' she asked. Tighe, who
had her son in December, was talking about one of the newer
innovations in transplant science. Blood from a newborn's discarded
umbilical cord offers a dense concentration of stem cells _ the
same stuff found in bone marrow, the manufacturing center for

Depressing? Well, unless a figure stays basically the same through
childbirth, hormone replacement and just plain gravity _ and

clothing sizes creep up along with those extra pounds. By CYNTHIA

   BBA-DiMAGGIO-COOPERSTOWN (Cooperstown, N.Y.) _ The Hall of Fame
Gallery is a mausoleum of sorts, dedicated to the immortals of
baseball's past. It is a place in the National Baseball Hall of
Fame and Museum where talk is naturally muted, reserved for
reverential, hushed tones. On Monday, that quiet was amplified and

   BBA-DiMAGGIO-APPRECIATION (Albany, N.Y.) _ Where have you gone,
Joe DiMaggio? I don't have the connections to find out the answer.
All I have are my hopes and prayers. This is what I hope. This is
what I pray. That DiMaggio is in a place where he is forever young

   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ Everybody has a DiMaggio story,
even my dad, who used to play golf with Joe's brother Dom, a great
player for the Red Sox who always suffered by comparison with the
Yankee Clipper. They're talking about Joe on Cape Cod, in Iowa and
in Cuba. In New York, Mayor Giuliani is talking about naming the
West Side Highway after DiMaggio, probably because Giuliani wants
to put a new Yankee Stadium next to the highway. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany. N.Y.) _ I'll let you in on a little secret
about northern cities like Albany. The cops know about it, and so
does everybody else with any experience with the criminal justice
system. That secret is this: In cold weather, a certain percentage
of the residents of any local jail are people for whom doing time
constitutes a winter vacation. The rest of the year, they're on the
street. By DAN LYNCH.

   TELEPHONE-BIRTHDAY (Danville, Calif.) _ Wednesday is the
anniversary of the world's first phone call. Lines have been busy
ever since. On March 10, 1876, in the course of an experiment in
the extremely new field of telephony, Alexander Graham Bell
successfully transmitted a one-sentence message to his partner Tom

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States,
gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a
curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of
the president's affection _ the artifacts that may testify to Bill
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them
are gone.
 &HT;    Whither the gifts _ the hatpin, ``Leaves of Grass,'' the Black
Dog T-shirt _ and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made
for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by
which presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and
the public imagination?
 &HT;    ``It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,''
admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with
the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy
assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel
investigations that followed.
 &HT;    The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings
against the president, but eventually, Tilley said, ``we would
assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a
piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly
interesting investigation.''
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says
that ``normally'' such subpoenaed items go ``back to the rightful
owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has
not been settled. ``Legal research is being done right now,'' she
says, referring to all the materials held by the various
independent counsels.
 &HT;    Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and
Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables,
and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called the most
sentimental'' of the president's presents.
 &HT;    If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent
Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are
likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate _ our first fully
curated presidential scandal _ special prosecutions have assured
the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality.
 &HT;    The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia
used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that
followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with
hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what
Tilley calls ``the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation
offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she
erased 18 minutes of tape.
 &HT;    Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer
hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security
Council. Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never
requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in
an exhibit on either subject. But a number of presidential
librarians point out that these institutions balance their
scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might
suspect.
 &HT;    The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just
acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters
taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton
Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to
get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to
own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least
national humiliation.
 &HT;    Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library
in Austin, recalls how LBJ, not too long before his death, judged
some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not
nearly ``mean enough.''
 &HT;    He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive
items, including one postcard that read: ``I demand that you as a
gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton
says he has ``tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed
ballot box that may have helped send ``Landslide Lyndon'' to the
Senate in 1948.
 &HT;    Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of
both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors
gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this
presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the
existence of government-run libraries (there are none prior to
Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the chief
executive.
 &HT;    The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after
Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the president's
secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the
president's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept
in his Oval Office desk.
 &HT;    Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the
Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House
managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that
their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture
is moved and used elsewhere.
 &HT;    The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with
one of the misprinted pens _ Untied States Senator, says the barrel
_ used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object
may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the
sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which
includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its
later repeal.
 &HT;    The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable
without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is
written right across the offending language in the original
document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial,
during which Sen. Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage
by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another
drawer.
 &HT;    (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct
a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in
plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950s
Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.)
 &HT;    Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton
Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this
future facility will have to address the events that led to
impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the
gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will
be made by professionals at some later time. ``We don't even have
an architect on board yet,'' he says.
 &HT;    The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the
impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one
thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal.
 &HT;    More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual,
videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost
literally alive with its stain of presidential DNA. It is a messy,
assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization
could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts.
 &HT;    No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the
connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more
compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money
might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much
awe or heartbreak _ like, say, the string with which Lincoln
repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of
Congress _ but like it or not, it too now belongs to the ages.

 By JAMES TRAUB  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Republicans in the House of Representatives are looking to their
new speaker, Dennis Hastert, with a yearning that appears
suspiciously like desperation. Few of them even pretend that they
consider Hastert a forceful leader.
 &HT;    As one leadership aide put it recently, and bluntly, ``What
people like about Denny is that he's not going to do something
stupid.''
 &HT;    Hastert is a modest, amiable soul who is fond of recalling his
past career as a high-school wrestling coach. When party leaders
came to Hastert in December to tell him that he needed to fill the
breach created by the stunningly unexpected resignation of Robert
Livingston, the speaker-designate, Hastert, according to one
Midwestern congressman, ``wasn't sure he could do it, he wasn't
sure he wanted to do it, and he was scared.''
 &HT;    What Hastert's colleagues are hoping is that the new Speaker
will somehow save them from themselves, as if his bulky frame were
a rampart standing between the G.O.P. and the cliff it seems
disposed to race off. Hastert's real virtue is that he is not his
predecessor, Newt Gingrich, for the retrospective view inside the
party is that Gingrich is at the heart of practically everything
that anyone thinks went wrong in the last few years.
 &HT;    Talk to Republican House members, as I spent the past few weeks
doing, and you'll hear that Gingrich was too obsessed with
destroying the president, failed to remind the public of the
party's accomplishments, caved to the Christian right and caved to
the Clinton left. You would think that Gingrich was a virus alien
to the party, rather than the party's leader and visionary for most
of the decade.
 &HT;    Hastert, the not-Newt, was trotted out for celebration at a
closed-to-the-press party-leadership retreat in Williamsburg, Va.,
earlier this month. The retreat began with a sobering presentation
from pollsters: Current numbers, they explained, show that voters
trust the Democrats more than the Republicans on almost all major
issues, including taxes, an issue on which the GOP has
traditionally been favored by a significant margin.
 &HT;    After dinner on the first night, Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia, the
new head of the National Republican Congressional Committee,
screened a video made up of clips of gloating Democrats, designed
to fire members with horror at the prospect of a Democratic
takeover of the House _ which is precisely what would happen were
an election held today, according to pollsters.
 &HT;    Hastert didn't speak until the following morning, when he got up
and more or less said, according to a summary provided by one
attendee, ``We need to work together, he's the coach, he wants to
put other people in the spotlight.''
 &HT;    It was a pep talk, and not a particularly memorable one, and it
lasted no more than 10 minutes. Then the group talked about issues
and heard a presentation from executives of a marketing firm, who
explained that in order to promote a winning message, the GOP
needed to empathize with voters, tone down the ideological content,
personalize and simplify. So yes, there had been a problem _ but
with the marketing, not the message.
 &HT;    ``The message needs to be delivered by people who are upbeat,
who are connectors with folks out there, who can relate everything
we're doing to people's everyday lives,'' Jennifer Dunn, a
congresswoman from Washington who is herself an important element
of the Republicans' new look, told me a few days after the retreat.
 &HT;    Or as Rep. Joe Scarborough of Florida put it, with perhaps a
trace of irony, ``Denny is this year's model.''
 &HT;    As the congressional Republicans head out into battle with the
ordeal of impeachment finally behind them, they hope to win back
the public with a kinder, gentler face. It should become clear soon
enough whether the problem really was Newt, and whether the answer
is Denny.
 &HT;    An alternative theory constitutes the nightmare underneath the
professions of optimism and bonhomie _ that the House Republicans
have actually lost touch with ordinary Americans, or rather are
captive to a base that is itself out of touch with ordinary
Americans, as the Democrats were 15 or so years ago.
 &HT;    Michael Forbes, the Long Island congressman who publicly
agonized over impeachment before voting with his party, said to me,
``If we keep defining the party by the extreme right, not only will
you see Republicans leaving the party, but you will also see a
permanent Republican minority where we will lose the White House,
we will lose the House and we will lose the Senate.'' And then
Forbes added, ``I have great hopes in the ascension of Denny
Hastert.''
 &HT;    
 &HT;    Among the congressional Republicans there is no bafflement like
the bafflement over the failure of the American people to rally to
the cause of impeachment.
 &HT;    John Doolittle, a California congressman who has both his car
and his office desk festooned with bumper stickers that read,
``Impeach Clinton for the Children,'' said: ``I feel good about
impeaching the president, and I would happily do it tomorrow. How
the rest of the country can not feel good about it is truly beyond
me.''
 &HT;    Frank Luntz, the Republican pollster, advances the almost
metaphysical argument that ordinary citizens, unlike congressional
Republicans, simply can not own up to their own true feelings on
the subject.
 &HT;    ``People don't want to admit that the man they voted for
president is so deeply flawed because that says something about
themselves,'' Luntz said.
 &HT;    A number of moderate Republicans pointed out that many of their
party brethren loathe the president so passionately that they
simply cannot conceive that people of good will could feel
otherwise. Given their own scorn, they cannot admit that most
Americans disagree with them without feeling contempt for the
people themselves, an emotion very few politicians permit
themselves to express.
 &HT;    Tom DeLay, the Republican majority whip and the leader of the
party's Clinton-hating faction, insisted in a speech before the
House that impeachment was a matter of ``relativism vs. absolute
truth.'' Given the choice, Americans, it turned out, preferred a
tolerant and forgiving relativism.
 &HT;    Some version of this understanding has now in fact become patent
to many Republicans. Vin Weber, a former congressman and Reagan-era
optimist who along with Gingrich proclaimed the coming of a new
``conservative opportunity society,'' said, ``The image that our
party is defined by a hectoring moralism is as dangerous to us as
it is on the left if they're defined by a pandering
permissiveness.''
 &HT;    But it's also true that impeachment did not provoke a new tone
of hectoring moralism from an essentially secular party; it brought
to the fore passions that have been bubbling at least since the
``revolution'' of 1994 and perhaps since the election of Clinton
two years before.
 &HT;    Gingrich stoked those passions and was finally, in the classic
revolutionary denouement, consumed by them. The speaker staved off
a coup from the right in the summer of 1997 and then was ousted
after last year's election. And on his way out, like a Jacobin
railing at the Terror as he's led to the tumbrels, Gingrich warned
darkly of the party's ``perfectionist caucus.''
 &HT;    This is the kind of epithet that may stick to the House
Republicans. Gingrich's lament suggests a very different
explanation for the Republicans' grave problems.
 &HT;    I heard such a theory from Peter King, the Nassau County
Republican who became a hero to Democrats everywhere by his
unwavering, and very public, opposition to the impeachment of
President Clinton. King has been held in fairly low regard inside
his own party since he made himself into a sort of celebrity
martyr, boasting of his victimization by party leaders and almost
flaunting his subsequent marginalization inside the GOP.
 &HT;    At the same time, as King told me, he has a perfect voting
record with the Christian Coalition. ``I am not a moderate,'' he
said flatly.
 &HT;    King doesn't see the party's problems precisely in ideological
terms. In the '80s, he explained, the party's base was not Sunbelt
evangelicals but Reagan Democrats. ``They weren't Holy Roller
types, but they wanted to have some semblance of decency, they
wanted to reward hard work.''
 &HT;    Today, King went on to say, those Reagan Democrats are ``looking
for someone like Reagan, but what they're seeing are these really
harsh, unrelenting, unforgiving, avenging-angel types _ that scares
them off. And as I look around the House of Representatives, there
are very few people who would be comfortable with Ronald Reagan in
terms of their attitudes _ the Democrats are the enemy, Bill
Clinton is evil, politics is evil.''
 &HT;    And yet Republican governors around the country, including
George Pataki, George W. Bush, Tommy Thompson and Christine
Whitman, have gained enormous popularity by emphasizing effective
government over moral or ideological campaigns. You won't see many
of these governors mounting the barricades on issues like
immigration or affirmative action, not to mention partial-birth
abortion.
 &HT;    Gingrich may have instituted the style and the rhetoric of total
war, but it is now a deep-seated reflex among the House
Republicans. It was, after all, Dick Armey, the Republican majority
leader, who said of Hillary Clinton, ``All her friends are
Marxists,'' and who referred to Barney Frank, the openly gay
Democratic Congressman from Massachusetts, as ``Barney Fag.''
 &HT;    DeLay, the House whip, has compared the Environmental Protection
Agency to the Gestapo. DeLay has replaced Gingrich as the most
powerful figure in the House as well as the Democrats' extremist of
choice. He is a small businessman _ an exterminator, more precisely
and deliciously _ who represents the new middle-class suburbs that
have grown up outside of Houston, an area very similar
demographically to Gingrich's DeKalb County and also largely devoid
of the yeasty ethnic mix that, King would say, lent a certain
realism and restraint to the Reagan Democrats.
 &HT;    In recent years, DeLay has developed strong ties to the
Christian right. Both he and Armey are among the few congressional
members of the Council for National Policy, an organization of
right-wing political and religious leaders.
 &HT;    Randy Tate, the head of the Christian Coalition, used to be one
of DeLay's deputy whips, and they remain close. A number of
Republicans suggested to me, without questioning the depth of
DeLay's convictions, that he had recognized that if you want the
power that comes with a mass following in today's Republican Party,
you cultivate the Christian Right.
 &HT;    DeLay is not exactly a practitioner of the school of genteel
bipartisanship. He is known inside the Beltway as the Hammer, a
nickname that he cherishes like a scar from an old brawl. Shortly
after Tate won election to Congress from Washington in 1994, DeLay
sent a letter to PAC's listing the amounts each had given to Tate's
opponent.
 &HT;    ``I was surprised to see you opposed Randy Tate,'' he wrote.
``You now have the opportunity to work toward a positive future
relationship. ... Your immediate support for Randy Tate is
personally important to me and the Republican leadership team.''
DeLay had served notice that lapses into bipartisanship would no
longer be accepted. ``He is,'' as one prominent Republican said
wonderingly, ``almost harsher than Newt.''
 &HT;    Yet party leaders recognize that the rhetoric of total warfare,
of Barney Fag and the Gestapo, has not gone down well with the
American public. The party wants to substitute some smiling faces
for DeLay's angry glare and to restore the sunny optimism of
Reagan.
 &HT;    GOP advisers such as Reed and Luntz have begun to remind the
party of why it was that Reagan was so popular and masterful a
figure. Recently, in a private memo to party leaders, Luntz wrote:
``Think about how often we were on the tube last year 'blasting'
someone or something. ... Ronald Reagan hardly ever raised his
voice, yet his message was clear, persuasive and popular. Let us
learn from our Great Communicator.''
 &HT;    Luntz suggested the Reaganesque strategy of head-shaking
ridicule and even provided examples: ``Bill Clinton wants to spend
millions of your taxpayer dollars on dance lessons for convicts.
Convicts!! It's a prison. Can you visualize prisoners dancing? Who
leads?''
 &HT;    It is probably safe to say that neither DeLay nor Armey can be
trusted to bring off this joke with just the right tone of voice.
(During the president's most recent State of the Union Message,
cameras periodically focused on DeLay and Armey as they smirked and
grimaced and virtually sat on their hands to keep from having to
applaud.)
 &HT;    By giving his maiden speech in the well of the House rather than
in a partisan setting, Hastert scored points; and he has said that
he wants to speak regularly to Richard Gephardt, though an aide of
Gephardt's said that the meetings to date have been procedural
rather than substantive.
 &HT;    Several of the Republican legislators I spoke to said that they
are waiting for a sign _ a sign that Hastert realizes the need to
publicly affirm a new identity for the party. Yet the reason why
Hastert, or Luntz, may not be able to cure what ails the GOP is
that the problem is not simply the messenger or the tone of voice.
The party can not be jollied out of its hectoring moralism. That
part of the party that is beholden to, and identifies with, the
Christian right is profoundly at odds with the part that isn't, and
doesn't.
 &HT;    It is also true that the Republican standbys that Reagan could
count on _ communism, crime _ have either evaporated or lost their
edge of urgency.
 &HT;    Clinton has vowed to set aside 62 percent of the projected
surplus to shore up the Social Security system _ and the
Republicans have agreed _ but that still leaves nearly $100 billion
over the next two budget years. The Republicans want to use some or
all of that money for tax cuts, while the Democrats want to use it
for Medicare, a few far-more-modest tax cuts and the kind of
domestic initiatives that have been waiting in the wings for just
such a moment of historic prosperity. The Democrats, too, have an
impatient base.
 &HT;    What's more, the economy could finally tumble off the rails,
though Republicans can't permit themselves to openly root for a
recession. Finally, the GOP could come up with a presidential
candidate more charismatic than Al Gore, which wouldn't seem
terribly difficult to do. A lot of things could happen, but the
auguries are grim.
 &HT;    ``Right now,'' said one Republican strategist, ``we're whistling
past the graveyard.''

 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Driving south on Utah's Highway 59, you slip out of the
subdivisions sprouting in the desert, ascend to a lonely stretch of
ink-colored juniper trees, then suddenly find yourself at the edge
of the last century. There on the Arizona border, tucked behind
towering flanks of red rock, is a town of about 5,000 people. Most
are Mormon fundamentalists, and most are outlaws: It is the largest
polygamous community in the United States.
 &HT;    Though polygamy is a felony, nobody has to hide from the law in
this town, called Hildale on the Utah side of the state line,
Colorado City on the other. More than a century after it was
outlawed, polygamy is flourishing in Utah and small pockets of the
American West, nurtured by religious directives and the hands-off
stance of legal authorities.
 &HT;    Laura Chapman, 36, is the 25th child from a family with four
mothers and 31 children, and she knows most of the people in
Hildale and Colorado City, even the few she is not related to by
blood. Chapman left the town years ago _ she calls it ``the land
that time forgot.'' Today she is one of a new group of women who
have fled plural families and want to draw attention to the reality
of modern polygamy.
 &HT;    Forget the sepia-toned notion of kindly Mormon patriarchs
frolicking with a bushel of happy wives, these women say. Forget
about the polygamy of Abraham or the Mormon pioneer Brigham Young.
 &HT;    Late-20th-century polygamy, practiced by people who seem
unconcerned about the law or public opinion, is a Dark Ages hybrid,
say women who have left the big families. They raise allegations of
sexual abuse, pedophilia and incest.
 &HT;    ``This is organized crime, operating under the cover of
religion,'' Chapman maintains.
 &HT;    If the charges of women such as Chapman have been shrugged off
before, that may be about to change. Last year a teen-age girl
emerged with a story of incest, child abuse and forced marriage at
the hands of one of Utah's biggest polygamous clans, the Kingstons
_ who are based right in Salt Lake City, within a few miles of the
domed capital building.
 &HT;    Whatever the outcome, Chapman and other ex-wives of polygamy
hope the resulting trials, scheduled to begin in April, will force
a reckoning with Utah's oldest ghost.
 &HT;    After the Mormon Church denounced polygamy and Utah outlawed it
in 1896 _ Washington had made this a condition of statehood - it
was thought that the practice of taking multiple wives would
ultimately disappear. But a century later the opposite has
happened, with anywhere from 20,000 to 60,000 people living in
families where one man is married to 2, 3, 5, as many as 30 women.
 &HT;    No one has been prosecuted for polygamy in Utah for nearly 50
years, and the state's power structure has not made enforcement an
issue. Last year Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, a Republican who is
himself a descendant of polygamists, even said the practice is not
often prosecuted in part because ``these people have religious
freedoms'' (a statement he later amended in the wake of a public
outcry).
 &HT;    The practice is still a minority one in this state of 2 million
people, of course, and the mainstream Mormon leadership in Salt
Lake City strongly condemns it. But it survives in ``clans'' _
massive patriarchal cabals linked by bloodlines and business ties,
whose members generally tithe 10 percent of all wages and earnings
to their church.
 &HT;    Those leaders insist that their only crime is following the true
word of God _ they see the church's capitulation on polygamy as a
blasphemous mistake. Sexual abuse is rare, they insist, and when it
occurs it is not tolerated.
 &HT;    There are at least four major clans in Utah. One of these
polygamous empires, based about 40 minutes south of Salt Lake, in
Bluffdale, is run by Owen Allred, age 84. The state has long
estimated its membership at about 5,000 people.
 &HT;    But Janet Bennion, a Utah Valley State College anthropologist
who spent five years studying the Allreds for a recent book,
``Women of Principle'' (Oxford University Press), says the number
is closer to 10,000, with clusters all over the West.
 &HT;    At the Allred compound, the headquarters is a huge, windowless
two-story building facing the Wasatch mountain range. Arrayed
around it are massive houses, with two or three minivans in many of
the driveways.
 &HT;    Lillian Bowles spent most of her life on this patch of arid
land. She grew up in a trailer not far from Bluffdale's church, one
of 40 children in a family in which her mother was one of eight
wives. She is not even sure where she fits in the family
chronology. ``I think I'm No. 17,'' she says. She remembers a life
of claustrophobia and fear of the outside world. ``I knew early on
that what we were doing was against the law,'' says Bowles, who is
26. ``We were always taught to hide. We couldn't play in the front
yard. When we drove somewhere, it was always 'Duck!' when you
passed a police car.''
 &HT;    At 16, she wanted to leave. But like other women who have fled
polygamy, she says she had no idea how to. ``We were taught early
on that we were God's chosen people, and everyone else was
condemned to hell. If you left, you were condemned.''
 &HT;    At age 17, she married a man who told her it was better to get
married young, rather than wait to be a third or fourth bride.
After six years of marriage, she says, Bowles left her husband when
he decided take on another wife.
 &HT;    Rowenna Erickson, 59, told me a similar tale when she described
her life within another major clan, the Kingstons. She married her
brother-in-law, Charles L. Kingston, and produced eight children.
 &HT;    ``The other wives kept telling me how this was all so wonderful
because we were going to heaven,'' she says between baby-sitting
chores for grandchildren in Salt Lake City. ``But if it was so
wonderful, how come I felt so horrible?''
 &HT;    I asked her if she was ever in love with her husband. ``It was
business,'' she says. ``Produce the babies. Don't question your
husband. But still, you get jealous. I remember when my husband had
his eyes on a very young girl. My sister and I were so hurt.''
 &HT;    She went on to explain a marital routine I heard from members of
polygamous families all over Utah, a sexual-rotation schedule with
all the romance of being a hen at a poultry ranch. ``When you're
ovulating, the patriarch is called,'' she says.
 &HT;    Polygamous leaders tend to shrug off stories such as those told
by Bowles, Erickson and Chapman, dismissing them as bitterness with
a political agenda. But they may have a more difficult time
explaining away an episode that rocked Utah last spring, when a
sobbing, badly bruised 16-year-old girl placed a 911 call from a
truck stop in northern Utah.
 &HT;    She told the police a story of indentured barbarism, alleging
her father had forced her into becoming the 15th wife of her uncle.
When she tried to flee, she maintained, she was whisked to a family
ostrich ranch, taken into a barn and whipped by her father.
 &HT;    The leaders of the Kingston clan run one of the biggest and
wealthiest family business empires in Utah. With 1,500 members and
interests in everything from restaurants to casinos, the clan is
worth $150 million or more, state officials estimate. The clan
operates much of its business out of an old brick office on State
Street just outside downtown Salt Lake City. The building has no
identification on the outside, save an address.
 &HT;    In a December pretrial hearing, the girl gave a hint of what her
life was like inside the clan. Her marriage was arranged by her
father and uncle; the latter had sex with her the first time at her
mother's home.
 &HT;    ``I guess it was my night, so he came over,'' the girl
testified. Then she was moved into a small apartment, with another
wife, one door away from a third wife. All the while, the girl
said, she was terrified. ``I felt trapped.''
 &HT;    The girl's uncle David O. Kingston has been charged with three
counts of incest and one count of unlawful sexual conduct. Her
father, John D. Kingston, has been charged with child abuse. The
two brothers will be tried separately in April, and both have
pleaded not guilty. (The father's lawyer _ and cousin _ Carl E.
Kingston refused to talk to me.)
 &HT;    But even in the face of the girl's court testimony that she had
been forced to marry her uncle and join 14 other wives, the state
has chosen not to bring polygamy charges.
 &HT;    State officials insist the law is unenforceable because most
polygamists have a marriage certificate only for the first bride;
the others are sealed in church ceremonies, without a paper trail
necessary for proof of crime.
 &HT;    The last major attempt at prosecuting anyone on polygamy charges
was in 1953, in Hildale/Colorado City _ then called Short Creek. A
big raid on the compound was written about and photographed by Life
magazine, and what resulted was a furor over families being torn
apart by the state.
 &HT;    Last year, six women from plural marriages _ including Bowles,
Erickson and Chapman _ founded one of the most unusual private
outreach groups in the country, an advocacy organization called
Tapestry of Polygamy. When such women hear Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah
intone about the sanctity of law and President Clinton's sexual
misdeeds, they want to shout from the top of the Mormon Temple:
``What about polygamy?''
 &HT;    Prompted in part by Tapestry, the state attorney general's
office recently sent emissaries to the Allred compound to discuss
things such as statutory rape, child abuse, the minimum wage and
other basic legal facts of modern American life. They gave out
phone numbers. According to the attorney general's office, dozens
of calls have come in _ women and children asking basic questions
about the outside world.
 &HT;    When Chief Deputy Attorney General Reed Richards said last year
that polygamy was not only nearly impossible to prosecute but,
technically, not a crime at all, it took the largely poor and
unschooled ex-wives of polygamous men to point out the law to him.
Polygamy is in fact covered by the statute that makes bigamy a
felony, the women noted, and the law says nothing about a marriage
certificate being needed for proof of crime, only that a husband or
wife ``purports to marry another person.''
 &HT;    I read that statute to Richards and mentioned that prominent
polygamists in Utah had their own Web sites and seemed to be
bragging about breaking the law. One man, Graydon Henderson, whom I
spoke to, lives openly with his five wives and 21 children in a
suburb just south of Salt Lake.
 &HT;    ``I'm not a bit afraid of the law,'' he told me. ``It's not even
worth worrying about.'' Richards finally said that he has no idea
why polygamy was not prosecuted in his state. But he added, ``If we
cracked down on it, I think it would all go underground.''
 &HT;    In Hildale/Colorado City today and in the Allred and Kingston
compounds, residents consider themselves the followers of the true
Mormon Church. In their view, the heretics are the ones operating
out of Temple Square in downtown Salt Lake.
 &HT;    On a tour of Temple Square, the global headquarters of the
Mormon religion, one of the fastest-growing in the world, I asked
the guide about the wives of Brigham Young, a founder of the Mormon
Church. We were in a former home of Young's, the Beehive House,
about a block from the Temple, and the guide was explaining how the
patriarch's wife made bread.
 &HT;    ``Which wife?'' I asked. Young had 27.
 &HT;    ``These other wives were mostly widows,'' the tour guide
replied.
 &HT;    But that sort of historical revisionism ends up infuriating both
the women who have fled polygamy and the people who defend it.
 &HT;    Chapman wants Utah's Mormons to acknowledge that some of their
most revered founding fathers had child brides. Fundamentalists
want the basic facts of the polygamists' past to remain a central
part of the Mormon narrative.
 &HT;    What seems to interest outsiders the most about polygamy is the
sex. The famed 19th-century eroticist, Sir Richard Burton, traveled
to Utah to have a firsthand look at a practice he considered quite
natural. Some people who defend modern polygamy take the same
approach, saying men are, after all, promiscuous animals by nature.
 &HT;    ``You look at the nature of men, and most of them are
polygamous,'' says Mary Potter, who was once one of three wives of
a policeman in a Salt Lake City suburb. (The family later split
up.) She has now formed a group in support of plural marriages, and
openly frets about ``having to wear a Scarlet P,'' as she calls the
cries for legal action. ``In polygamy, men are properly
channeled.''
 &HT;    She and other supporters of polygamy point to recent studies
that maintain that men are evolutionally wired for multiple sexual
partners. ``There's a desire on the part of men to have a diversity
of mates _ it's their natural urge _ so sex is definitely a
motivating factor for many of the patriarchs,'' Bennion says.
 &HT;    Viagra has been a blessing for a few of the older patriarchs,
she also notes. ``Some members of the Allred group are using Viagra
because they just can't keep up with their younger wives,'' she
says. ``There is a big age difference for many of these men. If
you've got three or four sexually active wives, that's a lot of
work.''
 &HT;    With its reputation for divinely sanctioned promiscuity, the
Hildale and Colorado City community attracts its share of misguided
visitors, says Dan Barlow, who is the town's mayor and an elder in
the church that owns nearly every house here.
 &HT;    ``They think what goes on here is all about sex,'' he says.
``It's foolish to make such a claim because we live a hundred miles
or so from Las Vegas. If people want sex, that's where they should
go.''
 &HT;    The mayor took me on a tour. The houses he showed me were huge,
some with as many as 15 to 20 bedrooms and others that looked more
like half-finished motels or dormitories. On a weekday afternoon,
every female in town was wearing an ankle-length dress.
 &HT;    ``These are happy, joyous homes,'' Barlow said. With its
extraordinary rate of reproduction, the community is growing by
better than 10 percent a year, he said.
 &HT;    As for the allegations that boys paw at their sisters and old
men prey on young girls, he shakes his head. ``Whenever you have
people living together, you're going to have people problems, the
same here as anywhere else.''
 &HT;    Prompted by the recent furor, two bills introduced in the
current state legislative session directly target polygamy. One
would raise the legal age of marriage from 14 to 16. The other
would provide money and shelters for women who want to flee but may
not meet the specific admittance rules of traditional halfway
homes.
 &HT;    ``What these women have brought into broad daylight is a civil
rights issue that is second to none in the history of Utah,'' says
State Sen. Scott Howell, the leader of the Democratic legislative
minority in Utah, who introduced one of the bills.
 &HT;    ``Here, we've got all the world coming to town for the Olympics.
Do we really want to be known as the place where we let old men
marry little girls?''
 &HT;    For the women who brought polygamy out of Utah's closet, the
2002 Olympics remain the trump card. More than 10,000 visiting
journalists will be deluged with information about the world's
greatest snow, the glowing city in the Wasatch, the spotless
facilities.
 &HT;    And then, when they grow tired of the luge and the Tabernacle
Choir stories, the press will have no trouble finding the women of
Tapestry, who will tell them about Utah's other heritage.

 By THOMAS MALLON  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    When William Rehnquist, the chief justice of the United States,
gaveled the Clinton scandal into history on Feb. 12, those with a
curatorial bent began wondering what will happen to the objects of
the president's affection _ the artifacts that may testify to Bill
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky long after both of them
are gone.
 &HT;    Whither the gifts _ the hatpin, ``Leaves of Grass,'' the Black
Dog T-shirt _ and, yes, the Dress? What provisions are being made
for their perpetuation in the curious gallery of anti-relics by
which presidential scandals and fiascoes live on in glass cases and
the public imagination?
 &HT;    ``It's tough to say what's going to happen to the dress,''
admits Steven Tilley, who for the past two decades has worked with
the holdings at the National Archives that relate to the Kennedy
assassination, Watergate and the various independent-counsel
investigations that followed.
 &HT;    The dress may yet, of course, figure in criminal proceedings
against the president, but eventually, Tilley said, ``we would
assume we'd get it. If we do, then we're going to retain it as a
piece of evidence from this very, very visible and highly
interesting investigation.''
 &HT;    A spokeswoman for the office of the independent counsel says
that ``normally'' such subpoenaed items go ``back to the rightful
owner,'' but adds that the disposition of Monica miscellanea has
not been settled. ``Legal research is being done right now,'' she
says, referring to all the materials held by the various
independent counsels.
 &HT;    Tilley adds that, so far, discussions between the archives and
Ken Starr's operation have involved only documents, not wearables,
and not the book of Whitman poems that Monica called the most
sentimental'' of the president's presents.
 &HT;    If Congress, as many expect, refuses to renew the Independent
Counsel Act, civil libertarians may cheer, but some historians are
likely to sigh with regret. Since Watergate _ our first fully
curated presidential scandal _ special prosecutions have assured
the survival of a whole Grand Guignol of historic illegality.
 &HT;    The archives, for instance, preserves much of the paraphernalia
used by the 1972 Watergate burglars and in the cover-up that
followed: Bernard Barker's address book, Chap Stick tubes with
hidden microphones and all the office equipment involved in what
Tilley calls ``the Rose Mary stretch,'' the gymnastic explanation
offered by Rose Mary Woods, President Nixon's secretary, of how she
erased 18 minutes of tape.
 &HT;    Advances in office technology yielded the archives some computer
hard-drives from Oliver North's offices at the National Security
Council. Tilley says that the Nixon and Reagan libraries have never
requested the loan of any Watergate or Iran-contra items for use in
an exhibit on either subject. But a number of presidential
librarians point out that these institutions balance their
scholarly and memorial aspects with more candor than one might
suspect.
 &HT;    The Gerald R. Ford Museum in Grand Rapids, Mich., has just
acquired the staircase that led toward the evacuation helicopters
taking off from the American Embassy in Saigon. Richard Norton
Smith, the museum's director, admits that while Ford was pleased to
get the object, some of the institution's trustees did not want to
own something so associated with, if not scandal, then at least
national humiliation.
 &HT;    Harry Middleton, director of the Lyndon Baines Johnson Library
in Austin, recalls how LBJ, not too long before his death, judged
some antiwar citizen mail being marked for a Vietnam display not
nearly ``mean enough.''
 &HT;    He urged the librarians to substitute more evocatively abusive
items, including one postcard that read: ``I demand that you as a
gutless son of a bitch resign as President of the U.S.'' Middleton
says he has ``tried very, very hard'' to find the infamous stuffed
ballot box that may have helped send ``Landslide Lyndon'' to the
Senate in 1948.
 &HT;    Because Judith Campbell's name appears on handwritten logs of
both telephone calls and appearances at the White House visitors
gate, the John F. Kennedy Library could not eliminate this
presidential girlfriend from the historical record. Before the
existence of government-run libraries (there are none prior to
Herbert Hoover's), it was easier to clean up after the chief
executive.
 &HT;    The biographer Carl Sferrazza Anthony points out that after
Warren G. Harding's sudden death in 1923, the president's
secretary, George Christian, probably destroyed photographs of the
president's mistress and illegitimate daughter, which Harding kept
in his Oval Office desk.
 &HT;    Materials from the Clinton trial will remain the property of the
Senate that conducted it. The curved tables at which the House
managers and White House lawyers sat have been marked, so that
their historical function will not be forgotten after the furniture
is moved and used elsewhere.
 &HT;    The deposition videotapes will go to the archives, along with
one of the misprinted pens _ Untied States Senator, says the barrel
_ used by the legislators to sign their oath as jurors. The object
may eventually join a handful of highly select materials in the
sliding metal drawers of the Archives' legislative division, which
includes the now-much-discussed censure of Andrew Jackson and its
later repeal.
 &HT;    The depth of feeling in Jackson's day is simply not graspable
without looking at his censure: the angrily literal expunction is
written right across the offending language in the original
document. The tally sheet for Andrew Johnson's impeachment trial,
during which Sen. Edmund G. Ross displayed his profile in courage
by casting the deciding vote for acquittal, rests in another
drawer.
 &HT;    (Lest all this seem excessively majestic, the archivists direct
a visitor's notice to a different sort of item carefully wrapped in
plastic: the first issue of Mad magazine, hauled before a 1950s
Senate subcommittee investigating juvenile delinquency.)
 &HT;    Skip Rutherford, local planning coordinator for the Clinton
Presidential Library in Little Rock, Ark., concedes that this
future facility will have to address the events that led to
impeachment. If it were up to Rutherford personally, neither the
gifts nor the dress would be exhibited, but all such decisions will
be made by professionals at some later time. ``We don't even have
an architect on board yet,'' he says.
 &HT;    The dress may be an extreme example of memorabilia, but the
impulse to preserve it is still more healthy than prurient. For one
thing, its existence determined the entire course of the scandal.
 &HT;    More important, in an age of virtual reality (even virtual,
videotaped witnesses), it remains grotesquely real, almost
literally alive with its stain of presidential DNA. It is a messy,
assertive fact that no amount of photography and digitalization
could hope to replicate. And it is the same with the gifts.
 &HT;    No matter how cheap or goofy or exquisite, they evoke the
connection between Bill Clinton and Monica Lewinsky far more
compellingly than, say, the computerized records of hush money
might have. The Black Dog T-shirt is not an object to inspire much
awe or heartbreak _ like, say, the string with which Lincoln
repaired his own spectacles, preserved in a box at the Library of
Congress _ but like it or not, it too now belongs to the ages.

 FROM: Washingtonian  
 &HT;    They'll try almost anything. Like the time Barbara Walters found
out that William Ginsburg, then Monica Lewinsky's lawyer, couldn't
get bran flakes for lunch at the Cosmos Club. Walters quickly
hopped a plane from New York with his favored food. Katie Couric
once sent skater Tonya Harding's lawyer a cake frosted with the
words WE REFUSE TO STOP SUCKING UP.
 &HT;    As TV talk shows and newsmagazines proliferate, the pursuit of
``gets,'' as high-profile interviewees are known in the business,
is reaching such a fever pitch that some anchors and reporters
wonder what kind of business they are in.
 &HT;    ``We all collectively find it repulsive,'' says ``20/20's''
Connie Chung. ``It's made reporting so much harder because we are
spending half our time booking instead of reporting.''
 &HT;    ``It's something I'm not comfortable with,'' ``60 Minutes''' Ed
Bradley confesses. ``But it's unavoidable.''
 &HT;    The competition isn't likely to cool down. If anything, it
promises to get worse. ``20/20'' has expanded to four nights a
week. ``Dateline NBC'' now puts on five shows a week, while ``60
Minutes'' has expanded to a second hour. Add to that the three
24-hour all-news networks _ MSNBC, Fox and CNN _ and consider that
CNN alone books 12,000 interviews a year. Stir in ``Hard Copy,''
``Inside Edition,'' Oprah, Jay Leno, David Letterman, Charlie Rose,
Leeza, Roseanne and Don Imus, and you have a recipe for insanity.
 &HT;    ``I was away from television for almost 2-1/2 years,'' Chung
says, ``and when I came back, I found the competition much worse.
Before, the arena was pretty much limited to big-name 'gets.' Now
it's spread to the kind of stories you find on the back pages of a
newspaper.
 &HT;    ``Just about any story we think about doing, whether we've read
it in a newspaper, heard it on the radio or come upon it through
word of mouth _ by the time you get there, every other network,
cable station and talk show is already racing to the scene.''
 &HT;    When the trophy is big enough, even the biggest names in
television are forced to hold their noses and pursue hookers,
felons, even convicted murderers. But most of the day-to-day work
in the guest-getting sweepstakes is done by segment producers, or
bookers, as they are known. Most are women, and they are pretty
intense, waging warlike campaigns to land the really elusive
guests.
 &HT;    Carol Ross Joynt, who used to be a booker for Larry King, spent
more than a year helping nail down Al Pacino, who was No. 1 on
King's wish list. ``I sent flowers on his birthday,'' Joynt says.
``I would send flowers on the announcement of a new movie. I made
friends with his assistant. I wrote intelligent-sounding but
fawning letters. When he appeared in a play in New York, I got
Larry good seats down front and made arrangements to go backstage
afterward. Finally, after a long telephone call that Larry placed
to Al, he agreed to come on.''
 &HT;    One producer tells about the scene outside the courtroom in Los
Angeles the day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced. Every TV
and print outlet in the country was trying to get reaction from
Nicole Simpson's sisters and mother, who were being escorted
through the jammed hallway to a waiting elevator.
 &HT;    Suddenly a booker from ABC reared back and hurled his cell phone
50 feet across the top of the crowd, screaming ``Denise.''
Amazingly, Denise Brown caught the phone. Later, the booker, who
was working for Diane Sawyer, called his number on the cell phone,
reached Brown and got the interview for Sawyer.
 &HT;    Mostly, success is a matter of patience, persistence and charm.
``Does their manner help? Absolutely,'' says Susan Carpenter
McMillan, who fields interview requests for presidential accuser
Paula Jones. ``Larry King's people are wonderful. John Gibson's
people are wonderful. High pressure does not play nearly as well.
When they tell me, 'We have the highest ratings' or 'We'll get
Paula's story out there the way she wants to get it out,' I find
that insulting.''
 &HT;    ``These young bookers have learned to say things like 'It will
make my career' or 'I'll get a big raise,''' says Linda Tripp's
friend Lucianne Goldberg, who was in demand as a stand-in for Tripp
when the Lewinsky scandal broke. ``How can you turn them down?''
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal focused a lot of attention on Washington
``gets.'' Tops on everyone's list was Lewinsky. Once it was
announced that she was giving the first interview to Walters, the
scramble did not stop as producers fought tooth and nail for the
right to the second interview with her.
 &HT;    Tripp, Ken Starr, Vernon Jordan and other players in the Clinton
drama also have been the subjects of heavy wooing. ``I have talked
to Linda Tripp half a dozen times at least,'' Mike Wallace says.
``I never promised to make her America's sweetheart, but I did tell
her, 'Look, if you decide you're going to do it, everybody is going
to ask you the same questions, Linda. You and I had a good
chemistry (when they had dinner at L'Auberge Chez Francois.) There
were five of us there. We all sat around and shot the breeze. We
had a drink, then another drink, and if you do that, it naturally
establishes a chemistry.''
 &HT;    At ABC, over the years, the brass have been trying, mostly
without success, to level the playing field between Sawyer and
Walters, but Walters continues to rack up the big ones _ Ted
Kennedy after Chappaquiddick, Michael J. Fox on his Parkinson's
disease, Colin Powell, Christopher Reeve, Elizabeth Taylor, John
Hinckley's parents, Muhammad Ali, Margaret Thatcher, Vaclav Havel
and every American president since Richard Nixon.
 &HT;    The Walters treatment includes everything from flowers, fruit
and charming notes to tea and cookies at her Fifth Avenue apartment
in New York. Her biggest selling points are her empathetic manner
and the big audiences she delivers. But she is also famously
aggressive in pursuit of her quarry.
 &HT;    During the 1992 presidential campaign, her colleague Donaldson
had lined up back-to-back interviews with Bill Clinton, George Bush
and Ross Perot on the same program. At the last minute, Perot
backed out. He had been contacted by Walters, who reminded him of
an earlier promise to give her the first interview.
 &HT;    Another time, Sawyer was getting ready to tape an interview with
Katharine Hepburn. Suddenly, Hepburn took a call from Walters, who
told her to hold everything: She would be right over to do the
interview herself.
 &HT;    Sawyer has been no slouch in getting guests. She did the first
interviews with Tonya Harding, Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
Presley, Marla Maples, caning victim Michael Fay, O.J. detective
Mark Fuhrman, newly outed Ellen DeGeneres and the family of Nicole
Brown Simpson, whom she interviewed three times.
 &HT;    Sawyer's presence has done wonders for the guest roster since
she began cohosting ``Good Morning America.'' Still, she finds it
hard to compete with Walters' Rolodex. Yet when Sawyer's contract
came up in 1994, and the other networks were offering her the moon,
she chose to stay at ABC. A big factor in her decision, it was
said, was the creation of a central booking unit meant to keep
ABC's magazine shows from competing with one another.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't stand was that I was making phone calls on
stories (for ``PrimeTime Live''), ``Day One'' was making phone
calls on stories, ``20/20'' was making phone calls _ it was crazy,
taking all our time doing this,'' Sawyer told an interviewer.
 &HT;    She has a point. One person who kept a log of calls _ the
public-relations executive hired by the parents of child beauty
JonBenet Ramsey _ was overwhelmed, not just by the number of calls
but by the number of different people from the same network who
contacted him.
 &HT;    According to Chung, who wrote a paper on the business of
``gets'' while she was a fellow at Harvard, the executive got 23
calls from ABC News staffers in one month. He also reported getting
18 calls from CBS News, 20 from NBC News _ not counting CNBC and
MSNBC _ 22 from CNN and ``Larry King Live,'' nine from Fox, plus
assorted pleas from ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy,'' Don Imus and
others.
 &HT;    The new booking unit at ABC was supposed to eliminate in-house
competition, making sure that both Sawyer and Walters got their
share of trophy guests. In fact, insiders say, the unit never
really worked. It couldn't function without Walters' cooperation,
and she refused to play ball.
 &HT;    After Westin assumed the helm of ABC News, he too fell under
Sawyer's spell. ``David positively lights up when she walks in the
room,'' a corporate source says. ``When Diane sets her sights on
dazzling someone, rarely if ever do I see a man, a powerful man,
fail to succumb. They just flop right over.''
 &HT;    Westin came up with a new solution to the Walters/Sawyer
competition: He merged ``PrimeTime Live,'' Sawyer's showcase, with
Walters' ``20/20.'' At the same time, he personally intervened on
Sawyer's behalf to get a hotly pursued interview with Kenneth
Starr. Westin committed to doing a full hour with him _ -something
``20/20's'' chief rival, ``60 Minutes,'' virtually never does.
 &HT;    Starr also wanted the interview to take place right after he
finished testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in
November. Westin offered Starr the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, a
night he said had a large viewing audience, and he pledged to
promote the interview.
 &HT;    Starr's appearance drew an audience of nearly 15 million people,
but the interview did not go as his people hoped, even though he
spent four hours taping with Sawyer. Starr's friends complain that
Sawyer was overly adversarial, that her questions were too long,
that his answers were cut down to snippets.
 &HT;    Journalists who watched the interview probably saw nothing amiss
in the way Sawyer conducted the interview. But other players may
have drawn some cautionary lessons from Starr's appearance.
``People are becoming more sophisticated about live vs. taped,''
says Gail Evans, who oversees the booking operation at CNN. ``You
hear them say, 'I'm only going to do live interviews, where I'm
sure of the way my answers will be used.'''
 &HT;    The reaction to Sawyer's piece on Starr illustrates the line
anchors and reporters have to walk if they want to bag the biggest
game. Those who have a reputation for being too prosecutorial often
lose out.
 &HT;    ``Does it hamstring me? I'm sure that it does,'' says tough guy
Wallace. ``It gets frustrating when I hear people have said, 'Oh,
good Lord, you're going to be interviewed by whom?' In one way,
it's flattering, I suppose. On the other hand, it's a myth.
Everybody asks the same questions. They just ask them in different
ways.''
 &HT;    If interviewers are perceived as going too easy, they risk
taking a shellacking in the press. That's what happened to Ed
Bradley after his ``60 Minutes'' interview with Kathleen Willey,
the woman who claimed to have been groped by President Clinton.
During the interview, Bradley gently led her through her story,
never asking her whether she had pursued a book deal (she had) or
if she remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged incident
(she did). Bradley was even criticized by friends of Willey's, who
complained that if he had been tougher, she wouldn't have been open
to so much White House-inspired criticism in the press afterward.
 &HT;    These days, professional handlers keep score for their clients,
and woe unto the journalist or talk-show host who says something
perceived as unfriendly. At one point, Walters was making headway
with her request to interview Paula Jones. But she lost the chance
after a panelist on Walters' syndicated show made an unflattering
remark about McMillan, Jones' spokeswoman.
 &HT;    ``One of the things I believe in strongly,'' McMillan says:
``You really pay back your friends and punish your enemies. It will
be a cold day in hell before Paula does any of the late-night
shows. After all the cruel things they said about her, comparing
her nose to a penis, they can just forget it!''
 &HT;    The one thing nobody on either side of the transaction wants to
talk about is the deals that are made. In exchange for getting the
first interview, broadcasters routinely allow celebrities and other
public figures to dictate the terms of their appearance. ``The
length of the segment is open to discussion, the areas of
questioning can be limited, as well as which of the personalities
or reporters will actually do the interview,'' says Random House
publicist Stuart Applebaum. ``But most of all the timing is
important.''
 &HT;    Timing was a big issue with Lewinsky, who was not paid for her
interview with Walters but had an understanding with ``20/20'' that
the interview would coincide with the release of her book. She also
retained the rights to the proceeds from any sales of the Walters
interview to foreign broadcasters. While that feature of her
agreement with Walters was a little unusual, the promotional
interview, in which celebrities tout their latest movie, book or TV
appearance, has become so standard that even the critics have
stopped bemoaning the naked commercialism of the transactions.
 &HT;    Occasionally, questions are raised about deals that go beyond
mere commercialism. Tom Rosenstiel reported in Esquire that one of
the figures in the 1989 Menendez brothers' murder trial told ABC
the story had to have a positive tone and demanded script approval.
ABC capitulated on both counts, according to Rosenstiel.
 &HT;    On one point, the established outlets are firm: They don't pay
for interviews. However, foreign broadcasters do: Britain's Channel
4 is paying Lewinsky an estimated $640,000 for its interview.
Domestic syndicated shows such as ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy''
and ``Roseanne'' also pay. Such shows are said to have showered
hundreds of thousands of dollars on friends, employees and
relatives of Michael Jackson's for information about him when he
was being accused of pedophilia.
 &HT;    Money occasionally rears its head at the Fox network as well.
Although Fox has denied paying Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, for its exclusive interview with him, he reportedly got
$600,000 for home movies and still photos of his sister.
 &HT;    About the only thing the networks and shows such as ``Oprah''
will pay for are airfare, meals and hotel rooms. And in hotly
competitive situations, the subjects may receive small ``tokens of
esteem.'' ''You get flowers, candy,'' Lucianne Goldberg says.
``Nothing you wouldn't get from a nice first date.''

more than a year helping nail down Al Pacino, who was No. 1 on
King's wish list. ``I sent flowers on his birthday,'' Joynt says.
``I would send flowers on the announcement of a new movie. I made
friends with his assistant. I wrote intelligent-sounding but
fawning letters. When he appeared in a play in New York, I got
Larry good seats down front and made arrangements to go backstage
afterward. Finally, after a long telephone call that Larry placed
to Al, he agreed to come on.''
 &HT;    One producer tells about the scene outside the courtroom in Los
Angeles the day the O.J. Simpson verdict was announced. Every TV
and print outlet in the country was trying to get reaction from
Nicole Simpson's sisters and mother, who were being escorted
through the jammed hallway to a waiting elevator.
 &HT;    Suddenly a booker from ABC reared back and hurled his cell phone
50 feet across the top of the crowd, screaming ``Denise.''
Amazingly, Denise Brown caught the phone. Later, the booker, who
was working for Diane Sawyer, called his number on the cell phone,
reached Brown and got the interview for Sawyer.
 &HT;    Mostly, success is a matter of patience, persistence and charm.
``Does their manner help? Absolutely,'' says Susan Carpenter
McMillan, who fields interview requests for presidential accuser
Paula Jones. ``Larry King's people are wonderful. John Gibson's
people are wonderful. High pressure does not play nearly as well.
When they tell me, 'We have the highest ratings' or 'We'll get
Paula's story out there the way she wants to get it out,' I find
that insulting.''
 &HT;    ``These young bookers have learned to say things like 'It will
make my career' or 'I'll get a big raise,''' says Linda Tripp's
friend Lucianne Goldberg, who was in demand as a stand-in for Tripp
when the Lewinsky scandal broke. ``How can you turn them down?''
 &HT;    The Lewinsky scandal focused a lot of attention on Washington
``gets.'' Tops on everyone's list was Lewinsky. Once it was
announced that she was giving the first interview to Walters, the
scramble did not stop as producers fought tooth and nail for the
right to the second interview with her.
 &HT;    Tripp, Ken Starr, Vernon Jordan and other players in the Clinton
drama also have been the subjects of heavy wooing. ``I have talked
to Linda Tripp half a dozen times at least,'' Mike Wallace says.
``I never promised to make her America's sweetheart, but I did tell
her, 'Look, if you decide you're going to do it, everybody is going
to ask you the same questions, Linda. You and I had a good
chemistry (when they had dinner at L'Auberge Chez Francois.) There
were five of us there. We all sat around and shot the breeze. We
had a drink, then another drink, and if you do that, it naturally
establishes a chemistry.''
 &HT;    At ABC, over the years, the brass have been trying, mostly
without success, to level the playing field between Sawyer and
Walters, but Walters continues to rack up the big ones _ Ted
Kennedy after Chappaquiddick, Michael J. Fox on his Parkinson's
disease, Colin Powell, Christopher Reeve, Elizabeth Taylor, John
Hinckley's parents, Muhammad Ali, Margaret Thatcher, Vaclav Havel
and every American president since Richard Nixon.
 &HT;    The Walters treatment includes everything from flowers, fruit
and charming notes to tea and cookies at her Fifth Avenue apartment
in New York. Her biggest selling points are her empathetic manner
and the big audiences she delivers. But she is also famously
aggressive in pursuit of her quarry.
 &HT;    During the 1992 presidential campaign, her colleague Donaldson
had lined up back-to-back interviews with Bill Clinton, George Bush
and Ross Perot on the same program. At the last minute, Perot
backed out. He had been contacted by Walters, who reminded him of
an earlier promise to give her the first interview.
 &HT;    Another time, Sawyer was getting ready to tape an interview with
Katharine Hepburn. Suddenly, Hepburn took a call from Walters, who
told her to hold everything: She would be right over to do the
interview herself.
 &HT;    Sawyer has been no slouch in getting guests. She did the first
interviews with Tonya Harding, Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie
Presley, Marla Maples, caning victim Michael Fay, O.J. detective
Mark Fuhrman, newly outed Ellen DeGeneres and the family of Nicole
Brown Simpson, whom she interviewed three times.
 &HT;    Sawyer's presence has done wonders for the guest roster since
she began cohosting ``Good Morning America.'' Still, she finds it
hard to compete with Walters' Rolodex. Yet when Sawyer's contract
came up in 1994, and the other networks were offering her the moon,
she chose to stay at ABC. A big factor in her decision, it was
said, was the creation of a central booking unit meant to keep
ABC's magazine shows from competing with one another.
 &HT;    ``What I couldn't stand was that I was making phone calls on
stories (for ``PrimeTime Live''), ``Day One'' was making phone
calls on stories, ``20/20'' was making phone calls _ it was crazy,
taking all our time doing this,'' Sawyer told an interviewer.
 &HT;    She has a point. One person who kept a log of calls _ the
public-relations executive hired by the parents of child beauty
JonBenet Ramsey _ was overwhelmed, not just by the number of calls
but by the number of different people from the same network who
contacted him.
 &HT;    According to Chung, who wrote a paper on the business of
``gets'' while she was a fellow at Harvard, the executive got 23
calls from ABC News staffers in one month. He also reported getting
18 calls from CBS News, 20 from NBC News _ not counting CNBC and
MSNBC _ 22 from CNN and ``Larry King Live,'' nine from Fox, plus
assorted pleas from ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy,'' Don Imus and
others.
 &HT;    The new booking unit at ABC was supposed to eliminate in-house
competition, making sure that both Sawyer and Walters got their
share of trophy guests. In fact, insiders say, the unit never
really worked. It couldn't function without Walters' cooperation,
and she refused to play ball.
 &HT;    After Westin assumed the helm of ABC News, he too fell under
Sawyer's spell. ``David positively lights up when she walks in the
room,'' a corporate source says. ``When Diane sets her sights on
dazzling someone, rarely if ever do I see a man, a powerful man,
fail to succumb. They just flop right over.''
 &HT;    Westin came up with a new solution to the Walters/Sawyer
competition: He merged ``PrimeTime Live,'' Sawyer's showcase, with
Walters' ``20/20.'' At the same time, he personally intervened on
Sawyer's behalf to get a hotly pursued interview with Kenneth
Starr. Westin committed to doing a full hour with him _ -something
``20/20's'' chief rival, ``60 Minutes,'' virtually never does.
 &HT;    Starr also wanted the interview to take place right after he
finished testifying before the House Judiciary Committee in
November. Westin offered Starr the Wednesday before Thanksgiving, a
night he said had a large viewing audience, and he pledged to
promote the interview.
 &HT;    Starr's appearance drew an audience of nearly 15 million people,
but the interview did not go as his people hoped, even though he
spent four hours taping with Sawyer. Starr's friends complain that
Sawyer was overly adversarial, that her questions were too long,
that his answers were cut down to snippets.
 &HT;    Journalists who watched the interview probably saw nothing amiss
in the way Sawyer conducted the interview. But other players may
have drawn some cautionary lessons from Starr's appearance.
``People are becoming more sophisticated about live vs. taped,''
says Gail Evans, who oversees the booking operation at CNN. ``You
hear them say, 'I'm only going to do live interviews, where I'm
sure of the way my answers will be used.'''
 &HT;    The reaction to Sawyer's piece on Starr illustrates the line
anchors and reporters have to walk if they want to bag the biggest
game. Those who have a reputation for being too prosecutorial often
lose out.
 &HT;    ``Does it hamstring me? I'm sure that it does,'' says tough guy
Wallace. ``It gets frustrating when I hear people have said, 'Oh,
good Lord, you're going to be interviewed by whom?' In one way,
it's flattering, I suppose. On the other hand, it's a myth.
Everybody asks the same questions. They just ask them in different
ways.''
 &HT;    If interviewers are perceived as going too easy, they risk
taking a shellacking in the press. That's what happened to Ed
Bradley after his ``60 Minutes'' interview with Kathleen Willey,
the woman who claimed to have been groped by President Clinton.
During the interview, Bradley gently led her through her story,
never asking her whether she had pursued a book deal (she had) or
if she remained friendly with Clinton after the alleged incident
(she did). Bradley was even criticized by friends of Willey's, who
complained that if he had been tougher, she wouldn't have been open
to so much White House-inspired criticism in the press afterward.
 &HT;    These days, professional handlers keep score for their clients,
and woe unto the journalist or talk-show host who says something
perceived as unfriendly. At one point, Walters was making headway
with her request to interview Paula Jones. But she lost the chance
after a panelist on Walters' syndicated show made an unflattering
remark about McMillan, Jones' spokeswoman.
 &HT;    ``One of the things I believe in strongly,'' McMillan says:
``You really pay back your friends and punish your enemies. It will
be a cold day in hell before Paula does any of the late-night
shows. After all the cruel things they said about her, comparing
her nose to a penis, they can just forget it!''
 &HT;    The one thing nobody on either side of the transaction wants to
talk about is the deals that are made. In exchange for getting the
first interview, broadcasters routinely allow celebrities and other
public figures to dictate the terms of their appearance. ``The
length of the segment is open to discussion, the areas of
questioning can be limited, as well as which of the personalities
or reporters will actually do the interview,'' says Random House
publicist Stuart Applebaum. ``But most of all the timing is
important.''
 &HT;    Timing was a big issue with Lewinsky, who was not paid for her
interview with Walters but had an understanding with ``20/20'' that
the interview would coincide with the release of her book. She also
retained the rights to the proceeds from any sales of the Walters
interview to foreign broadcasters. While that feature of her
agreement with Walters was a little unusual, the promotional
interview, in which celebrities tout their latest movie, book or TV
appearance, has become so standard that even the critics have
stopped bemoaning the naked commercialism of the transactions.
 &HT;    Occasionally, questions are raised about deals that go beyond
mere commercialism. Tom Rosenstiel reported in Esquire that one of
the figures in the 1989 Menendez brothers' murder trial told ABC
the story had to have a positive tone and demanded script approval.
ABC capitulated on both counts, according to Rosenstiel.
 &HT;    On one point, the established outlets are firm: They don't pay
for interviews. However, foreign broadcasters do: Britain's Channel
4 is paying Lewinsky an estimated $640,000 for its interview.
Domestic syndicated shows such as ``Inside Edition,'' ``Hard Copy''
and ``Roseanne'' also pay. Such shows are said to have showered
hundreds of thousands of dollars on friends, employees and
relatives of Michael Jackson's for information about him when he
was being accused of pedophilia.
 &HT;    Money occasionally rears its head at the Fox network as well.
Although Fox has denied paying Earl Spencer, Princess Diana's
brother, for its exclusive interview with him, he reportedly got
$600,000 for home movies and still photos of his sister.
 &HT;    About the only thing the networks and shows such as ``Oprah''
will pay for are airfare, meals and hotel rooms. And in hotly
competitive situations, the subjects may receive small ``tokens of
esteem.'' ''You get flowers, candy,'' Lucianne Goldberg says.
``Nothing you wouldn't get from a nice first date.''

 By ANDY BEHRMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    ___ He was hooked up, switched on, blissed out. __
 &HT;    
 &HT;    I'm lying on a gurney in the operating room at Gracie Square
Hospital, in New York City. I feel as if I'm waiting for either the
scariest roller-coaster ride of my life or for my own execution.
 &HT;    I'm convinced that if I live, my brain will be reduced to a
blank Rolodex. I look down at my bare feet. A flawless loafer tan
line. Maybe I'll die wearing flesh-tone loafers.
 &HT;    As far as manic-depressive tales go, my stories are typical. My
illness went undiagnosed for a decade, a period of euphoric highs
and desperate lows highlighted by $25,000 shopping sprees,
impetuous trips to Tokyo, Paris and Milan, drug and alcohol binges,
days without sleep, sex with strangers and jail time.
 &HT;    After seeing eight psychiatrists, I finally received a diagnosis
of bipolar disorder on my 32nd birthday. Over the next year and a
half, I was treated unsuccessfully with more than 30 medications.
My suburban New Jersey upbringing, my achievements as a film major
at Wesleyan University and a thriving career in public relations
couldn't help me.
 &HT;    April 11, 1995. I'm in front of Barneys, the upscale clothiers,
when it finally happens. My skin starts tingling and I feel as if
my insides are spilling onto the sidewalk. Everything moves in slow
motion. I can't hear. I rush home and climb into the empty bathtub.
I lie still for hours.
 &HT;    As a last resort, I'm admitted to the hospital for ECT,
electroconvulsive therapy, more commonly known as electroshock. The
doctor explains the procedure to me. But most important, he tells
me that I will get better.
 &HT;    _ Seven a.m. The doctor and his team, as well as a group of
residents, hover over me. Standing room only. I'm about to have my
brains jolted with 200 volts of electricity while 10 note-taking
spectators gawk. I'm thinking about being struck by lightning and
the electric chair. I'm joking incessantly to fend off the terror.
Is it too late for the call from the governor? No call. The show
must go on.
 &HT;    ``Got an Amstel Light?'' I ask. No response. I give the thumbs
up. An IV of Brevital, an anesthetic, is stuck into my arm,
silencing me. I struggle to stay awake _ a losing battle. But I've
been told what will happen: an IV of succinylcholine goes in next,
relaxing my muscles to prevent broken bones and cracked vertebrae.
The nurse sticks a rubber block in my mouth so I don't bite off my
tongue, a mask over my mouth and nose so my brain is not deprived
of oxygen, and electrodes on my temples.
 &HT;    All clear. The doctor presses a button. Electric current shoots
through my brain for an instant, causing a grand-mal seizure for 20
seconds. My toes curl. It's over. My brain has been ``reset'' like
a windup toy.
 &HT;    I wake up 30 minutes later and think I'm in a hotel room in
Acapulco. My head feels as if I've just downed a frozen margarita
too quickly. My jaw and limbs ache. But I feel elated.
 &HT;    ``Come, Electroboy,'' says the nurse in a thick Jamaican accent.
I take a sip of juice as she grabs my arm and escorts me
downstairs, where my father is waiting with my best friend, a
turkey sandwich and a Diet Coke.
 &HT;    I ask questions. Do I have a job? No. An apartment? Yes. A dog?
No. When I get home, I reacquaint myself with my apartment. I'm not
really sure it's mine. It feels as if I've been away for years.
After a nap, I shower, get dressed and hail a cab. By 8 p.m., I'm
at a restaurant downtown, deliberating between the salmon and the
veal.
 &HT;    After four treatments, there is marked improvement. No more
egregious highs or lows. But there are huge gaps in my memory. I
avoid friends and neighbors because I don't know their names
anymore. I can't remember the books I'veread or the movies I've
seen. I have trouble recalling simple vocabulary. I forget phone
numbers. Sometimes I even forget what floor I live on.
 &HT;    It's embarrassing. But I continue treatment because I'm getting
better.
 &HT;    And I actually start to love ECT. I have 19 treatments over the
course of a year. I look forward to them. It's like receiving a
blessing in a sanctuary. I rearrange my treatment schedule so that
one falls on my birthday. I start believing that electric current
purifies me.
 &HT;    I become addicted to the rituals _ fasting the night before,
driving across Central Park to the hospital in the early morning,
connecting to the machines that monitor my vital signs, closing my
eyes and counting backward. It's an oddly religious experience.
It's my meditation, my yoga, my tai chi.
 &HT;    On the one-year anniversary of my first electroshock treatment,
I'm clearheaded and even-keeled. I call my doctor to announce my
``new and improved'' status and ask to be excused from ECT that
week. He agrees to suspend treatment temporarily.
 &HT;    Surprisingly, I'm disappointed. ECT reassures me. Soon I miss
the hospital and my ``maintenance'' regimen. But I never see the
doctor again. Two and a half years later, I still miss ECT. But
medication keeps my illness in check, and I'm more sane than I've
ever been.
 &HT;    If I could only remember the capital of Chile.

 By MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 &HT;    You probably have heard of Scott Ritter, the UNSCOM weapons
inspector _ and former U.S. Marine _ who resigned his post last
August to protest what he saw as the failure of the United States
to act more forcefully against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    But you may not have heard of Denis Halliday, who resigned his
post as head of the United Nations' Oil for Food Program in Iraq
just weeks later to protest the humanitarian costs of the U.N.
sanctions.
 &HT;    ``Four thousand to 5,000 children are dying unnecessarily every
month due to the impact of sanctions,'' he said. ``We are in the
process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and
terrifying as that. It is illegal and immoral.''
 &HT;    Halliday, an Irishman, worked for the United Nations for 34
years. A specialist in Third World development issues, he was
stationed in Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as at U.N.
headquarters in New York. On Sept. 1, 1997, he was appointed U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq; he resigned 13 months later.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD: Why did you decide to resign from the United
Nations?
 &HT;    DENIS HALLIDAY: I found myself in the very uncomfortable
position of representing the United Nations, which in Iraq has two
faces. One is the face of sanctions, which are killing thousands of
Iraqis every month and sustaining malnutrition at the rate of 30
percent for children alone. At the same time, I was trying to run a
humanitarian assistance program, and I found these two functions
incompatible. I don't believe the Security Council has the right to
punish the people of Iraq simply because it is unhappy with the
president of the country.
 &HT;    Q: You have said that the sanctions policy is a breach of
international law. How?
 &HT;    A: It's a complete breach of the Convention of the Rights of the
Child, for example. It's a breach of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. It undermines the very charter of the United Nations.
The preamble of the charter is being clobbered by these U.N.
sanctions: the right of individuals to have a life, liberty,
opportunities to live, work and so on. It's very fundamental stuff.
 &HT;    Q: What is the magnitude of the suffering in Iraq? According to
one U.N. study, 500,000 Iraqi children had died as the result of
sanctions.
 &HT;    A: I believe the 500,000 is a UNICEF figure. It's probably
closer now to 600,000 and that's over the period of 1990-1998. If
you include adults, it's well over 1 million Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: What caused these deaths? What is the chain of fatality?
 &HT;    A: It originated with the horrendous and comprehensive damage
done by the missiles and bombing of the coalition forces during the
Persian Gulf War period, which was of greater extent than any of us
understand. They set about demolishing the civilian infrastructure
of this country, including water supplies, sewage supply systems,
electric power systems, production systems, educational facilities,
places of work.
 &HT;    It's hard to visualize, perhaps, but the infrastructure that
supports a good standard of living has been demolished. So that's
the starting point. And now you have the sanctions for seven or
eight years, and the damage that was done, combined with the lack
of money, or spare parts, upkeep for maintenance in the
agricultural sector. This combined has got us in the situation
where we have poor nutritional intake, very poor health services,
lack of drugs and medicines, and a disastrous water/sewage
situation whereby waterborne diseases like typhus are killing
thousands of Iraqis, particularly children.
 &HT;    Q: Were you an eyewitness to this hardship?
 &HT;    A: Yes, almost every evening driving back from the office I
would have to drive through raw sewage, which was often on the
streets of Baghdad. I would come up against 3- or 4-year-old
children begging for money at the traffic lights. And, of course, I
visited the poor parts of the country outside Baghdad, and I
visited the children's hospital.
 &HT;    Q: What was the hospital like?
 &HT;    A: The conditions are quite appalling. When I was there, there
was raw sewage in the basement of the hospital. The doctors do not
have drugs to deal with the problems they face. I was looking at
young children with leukemia; of four children I got to know, two
died within six weeks. That's a very common situation. Doctors are
making very horrible decisions as to who dies, who lives.
 &HT;    Q: What reaction do you get when you go around and speak about
the calamity of sanctions?
 &HT;    A: When regular, ordinary people understand some of the impact
and realize that Iraqi people are just like you and me, with all
the expectations we have for our children, it hits home that we are
rather callously sitting back and allowing people like ourselves to
be killed. But having demonized Saddam Hussein, policy makers in
Washington have demonized the Iraqi people. And they are just
regular people, with families, and gardens, and dogs, and houses
and all of that stuff. They have the same expectations we have _ to
live a life.
 &HT;    Q: What was your reaction to the massive U.S. and British
bombing campaign against Iraq in December?
 &HT;    A: I must say, I'm appalled that we are resorting to the
brutalization of an innocent people. I find this is incredible.
Apart from that, I really am concerned that nobody thinks through
the consequences of these sorts of actions. There is a bankruptcy
of ideas on how to deal with Iraq, and bombing is the fall-back
position.
 &HT;    It is a totally counterproductive effort. It enhances Saddam
Hussein's image. It outrages the Arab community. It reinforces the
general sense that Washington doesn't understand the Arab world.
 &HT;    Q: Aren't you concerned about the danger of Saddam Hussein
acquiring weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I think no matter what approach is taken, there's going to be
a risk factor here, unfortunately. But I believe that if we are
going to move forward, we have to separate economic sanctions _
which only hurt the people, not the leadership _ from the issue of
the rearming of Iraq. Separate those two things and deal with them
separately.
 &HT;    Q: And how do you ensure that Iraq doesn't cheat?
 &HT;    A: You need an elaborate system of control on the manufacture
and purchases of military items. The Iraqis will have to understand
that there would be a need to monitor military rebuilding well
after sanctions have gone. I think that would have to be one of the
arrangements.
 &HT;    Q: By your own estimation, what is the extent of Saddam
Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I would guess, and this is purely speculation, that it's
extremely modest. I think people overestimate his capacity. The
military is very depleted; the equipment is very old. I think the
capacity is largely diminished and greatly exaggerated. That's not
to say it couldn't be rebuilt. Of course it could. But as of today,
I think it's of no great importance whatsoever _ and certainly
outgunned by the neighborhood American equipment throughout the
gulf countries.
 &HT;    Q: Some people who are harshly critical of Saddam Hussein and
who take a bellicose stand say that the Oil for Food program wasn't
working and that Saddam Hussein was siphoning off the revenues of
the oil sales to feed the military, to feed himself, feather his
nest. What's the truth to that?
 &HT;    A: Well, there's absolutely no truth, whatsoever. Every penny
from oil sales goes into the hands of the United Nations, into a
U.N. bank account, and is released by the United Nations directly
to the contractors _ American, Russian, French, Chinese, whatever
they may be _ who provide the foodstuffs, medical equipment,
medical supplies. There's no possibility of funds being siphoned
off whatsoever.
 &HT;    Q: And what about the extent of the oil revenues? Was there
enough to meet the humanitarian needs?
 &HT;    A: No, absolutely not. It fell short on two counts: On the
day-to-day, current cash-flow needs it fell short in that the funds
available did not provide a balanced diet. We have been providing,
under the Security Council Resolution, a totally inadequate food
basket for the Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: How far short was it falling?
 &HT;    A: In terms of calories it was short, but it was more seriously
short in terms of proteins, basically animal proteins. And that was
only the immediate, day-to-day requirement. What is required to
deal with malnutrition of the kind we find in Iraq is a
multisectoral approach. That means putting real money _ and I'm
talking billions of dollars _ into the health-care situation, into
the potable water and sewage situation, into electric power
production, into domestic agricultural production, into education.
All of that money is simply not available.
 &HT;    Q: After the Iraqi experience, what's your view of economic
sanctions as a tool? And why were they legitimate against the
apartheid regime of South Africa but not Saddam Hussein's Iraq?
 &HT;    A: You've picked out the only possible example of economic
sanctions having worked worldwide. I think there was a severe
penalty for the people of South Africa, but I believe they went
along with this proposed program. This was part of their approach _
the ANC (African National Congress) approach _ to resolving the
problem of apartheid and the government at the time. That is not
the case in Iraq. These are innocent people who were not consulted.
They are bearing the brunt of sanctions in a much greater degree
than ever in South Africa, and we've seen the death and
malnutrition that has resulted. It's not putting pressure on the
Iraqi leadership, and it's certainly not producing the results that
the Security Council had hoped for.
 &HT;    Q: Right now the U.S. government is again trying to find and
fund some forces in Iraq that will overthrow Hussein. Do you think
that is credible?
 &HT;    A: Well, I think it makes no sense whatsoever and frankly, I
believe there are about 70 to 80 different Iraqi opposition groups
outside the country. Within the country, I think very few are even
in a position to contemplate any sort of change in government
systems. I don't understand the viability of this program.
 &HT;    Q: There are those in conservative circles in the United States
who say that the only real answer is for the United States to send
in the ground troops, march to Baghdad, overthrow Saddam Hussein
and occupy the country.
 &HT;    A: That's a total nonstarter. The American people would never
accept that kind of exposure to its troops. The Iraqis would fight
back, and the loss of life would be horrific. It would be another
Vietnam.
 &HT;    Q: But the argument is, basically, ``This guy is Hitler. You
can't appease Hitler. You've got to take Hitler out.'' To what
extent is the Hitler metaphor useful?
 &HT;    A: National Socialism grew up because of the Versailles Treaty
and the harshness of the conditions we placed on Germany after
World War I. The conditions that are being placed on Iraq are
rather comparable, and we're getting the same kind of results. And
that's very dangerous. If Saddam Hussein is gone tomorrow, the
system can continue: The party is there, the military is there, his
people are still there. There's not necessarily going to be a
dramatic change. And because of sanctions, we are building a new
generation of Iraqi leaders who are mad, who are introverted _ more
of the Taliban model.
 &HT;    Q: So what's your solution?
 &HT;    A: I think we'd be much wiser to focus on the reality of Iraq
today, work with what we've got and get the country back on its
feet. When the country is back on its feet, you may see change from
within, that's the only change that is likely to last. Clearly,
sanctions have strengthened the leadership. They've increased the
dependence of the average person on the central government. There
is a naive sense that out of this sanctions situation a miracle of
democracy will emerge. That, of course, is completely nonsensical.
I think there is almost nobody left in the country who has time to
think about governance. They're concerned with survival, putting
food on the table, getting their kids educated and keeping
themselves, their children and their families alive. It's naive to
think that positive change will come out of the present sanctions
regime.
 &HT;    Q: So your policy would be to lift sanctions right away?
 &HT;    A: Lift economic sanctions right away, but retain a series of
devices to control arms manufacture and arms purchases.
 &HT;    Q: What should people do who are concerned about the plight of
the Iraqi people?
 &HT;    A: Well, we already have 43 members of Congress who signed a
letter to President Clinton, making a suggestion of separating the
arms issue from the economic sanctions issue. That's the beginning.
And there are others in Congress who are ready to think and listen
and learn about the impact on the Iraqi people. Therefore it's up
to the American voters to express their views through their
electoral machinery.

 By MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD  
 FROM: The Progressive  
 &HT;    You probably have heard of Scott Ritter, the UNSCOM weapons
inspector _ and former U.S. Marine _ who resigned his post last
August to protest what he saw as the failure of the United States
to act more forcefully against Saddam Hussein's weapons of mass
destruction.
 &HT;    But you may not have heard of Denis Halliday, who resigned his
post as head of the United Nations' Oil for Food Program in Iraq
just weeks later to protest the humanitarian costs of the U.N.
sanctions.
 &HT;    ``Four thousand to 5,000 children are dying unnecessarily every
month due to the impact of sanctions,'' he said. ``We are in the
process of destroying an entire society. It is as simple and
terrifying as that. It is illegal and immoral.''
 &HT;    Halliday, an Irishman, worked for the United Nations for 34
years. A specialist in Third World development issues, he was
stationed in Iran, Malaysia and Indonesia, as well as at U.N.
headquarters in New York. On Sept. 1, 1997, he was appointed U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq; he resigned 13 months later.
 -0- 
 &HT;    MATTHEW ROTHSCHILD: Why did you decide to resign from the United
Nations?
 &HT;    DENIS HALLIDAY: I found myself in the very uncomfortable
position of representing the United Nations, which in Iraq has two
faces. One is the face of sanctions, which are killing thousands of
Iraqis every month and sustaining malnutrition at the rate of 30
percent for children alone. At the same time, I was trying to run a
humanitarian assistance program, and I found these two functions
incompatible. I don't believe the Security Council has the right to
punish the people of Iraq simply because it is unhappy with the
president of the country.
 &HT;    Q: You have said that the sanctions policy is a breach of
international law. How?
 &HT;    A: It's a complete breach of the Convention of the Rights of the
Child, for example. It's a breach of the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights. It undermines the very charter of the United Nations.
The preamble of the charter is being clobbered by these U.N.
sanctions: the right of individuals to have a life, liberty,
opportunities to live, work and so on. It's very fundamental stuff.
 &HT;    Q: What is the magnitude of the suffering in Iraq? According to
one U.N. study, 500,000 Iraqi children had died as the result of
sanctions.
 &HT;    A: I believe the 500,000 is a UNICEF figure. It's probably
closer now to 600,000 and that's over the period of 1990-1998. If
you include adults, it's well over 1 million Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: What caused these deaths? What is the chain of fatality?
 &HT;    A: It originated with the horrendous and comprehensive damage
done by the missiles and bombing of the coalition forces during the
Persian Gulf War period, which was of greater extent than any of us
understand. They set about demolishing the civilian infrastructure
of this country, including water supplies, sewage supply systems,
electric power systems, production systems, educational facilities,
places of work.
 &HT;    It's hard to visualize, perhaps, but the infrastructure that
supports a good standard of living has been demolished. So that's
the starting point. And now you have the sanctions for seven or
eight years, and the damage that was done, combined with the lack
of money, or spare parts, upkeep for maintenance in the
agricultural sector. This combined has got us in the situation
where we have poor nutritional intake, very poor health services,
lack of drugs and medicines, and a disastrous water/sewage
situation whereby waterborne diseases like typhus are killing
thousands of Iraqis, particularly children.
 &HT;    Q: Were you an eyewitness to this hardship?
 &HT;    A: Yes, almost every evening driving back from the office I
would have to drive through raw sewage, which was often on the
streets of Baghdad. I would come up against 3- or 4-year-old
children begging for money at the traffic lights. And, of course, I
visited the poor parts of the country outside Baghdad, and I
visited the children's hospital.
 &HT;    Q: What was the hospital like?
 &HT;    A: The conditions are quite appalling. When I was there, there
was raw sewage in the basement of the hospital. The doctors do not
have drugs to deal with the problems they face. I was looking at
young children with leukemia; of four children I got to know, two
died within six weeks. That's a very common situation. Doctors are
making very horrible decisions as to who dies, who lives.
 &HT;    Q: What reaction do you get when you go around and speak about
the calamity of sanctions?
 &HT;    A: When regular, ordinary people understand some of the impact
and realize that Iraqi people are just like you and me, with all
the expectations we have for our children, it hits home that we are
rather callously sitting back and allowing people like ourselves to
be killed. But having demonized Saddam Hussein, policy makers in
Washington have demonized the Iraqi people. And they are just
regular people, with families, and gardens, and dogs, and houses
and all of that stuff. They have the same expectations we have _ to
live a life.
 &HT;    Q: What was your reaction to the massive U.S. and British
bombing campaign against Iraq in December?
 &HT;    A: I must say, I'm appalled that we are resorting to the
brutalization of an innocent people. I find this is incredible.
Apart from that, I really am concerned that nobody thinks through
the consequences of these sorts of actions. There is a bankruptcy
of ideas on how to deal with Iraq, and bombing is the fall-back
position.
 &HT;    It is a totally counterproductive effort. It enhances Saddam
Hussein's image. It outrages the Arab community. It reinforces the
general sense that Washington doesn't understand the Arab world.
 &HT;    Q: Aren't you concerned about the danger of Saddam Hussein
acquiring weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I think no matter what approach is taken, there's going to be
a risk factor here, unfortunately. But I believe that if we are
going to move forward, we have to separate economic sanctions _
which only hurt the people, not the leadership _ from the issue of
the rearming of Iraq. Separate those two things and deal with them
separately.
 &HT;    Q: And how do you ensure that Iraq doesn't cheat?
 &HT;    A: You need an elaborate system of control on the manufacture
and purchases of military items. The Iraqis will have to understand
that there would be a need to monitor military rebuilding well
after sanctions have gone. I think that would have to be one of the
arrangements.
 &HT;    Q: By your own estimation, what is the extent of Saddam
Hussein's weapons of mass destruction?
 &HT;    A: I would guess, and this is purely speculation, that it's
extremely modest. I think people overestimate his capacity. The
military is very depleted; the equipment is very old. I think the
capacity is largely diminished and greatly exaggerated. That's not
to say it couldn't be rebuilt. Of course it could. But as of today,
I think it's of no great importance whatsoever _ and certainly
outgunned by the neighborhood American equipment throughout the
gulf countries.
 &HT;    Q: Some people who are harshly critical of Saddam Hussein and
who take a bellicose stand say that the Oil for Food program wasn't
working and that Saddam Hussein was siphoning off the revenues of
the oil sales to feed the military, to feed himself, feather his
nest. What's the truth to that?
 &HT;    A: Well, there's absolutely no truth, whatsoever. Every penny
from oil sales goes into the hands of the United Nations, into a
U.N. bank account, and is released by the United Nations directly
to the contractors _ American, Russian, French, Chinese, whatever
they may be _ who provide the foodstuffs, medical equipment,
medical supplies. There's no possibility of funds being siphoned
off whatsoever.
 &HT;    Q: And what about the extent of the oil revenues? Was there
enough to meet the humanitarian needs?
 &HT;    A: No, absolutely not. It fell short on two counts: On the
day-to-day, current cash-flow needs it fell short in that the funds
available did not provide a balanced diet. We have been providing,
under the Security Council Resolution, a totally inadequate food
basket for the Iraqi people.
 &HT;    Q: How far short was it falling?
 &HT;    A: In terms of calories it was short, but it was more seriously
short in terms of proteins, basically animal proteins. And that was
only the immediate, day-to-day requirement. What is required to
deal with malnutrition of the kind we find in Iraq is a
multisectoral approach. That means putting real money _ and I'm
talking billions of dollars _ into the health-care situation, into
the potable water and sewage situation, into electric power
production, into domestic agricultural production, into education.
All of that money is simply not available.
 &HT;    Q: After the Iraqi experience, what's your view of economic
sanctions as a tool? And why were they legitimate against the
apartheid regime of South Africa but not Saddam Hussein's Iraq?
 &HT;    A: You've picked out the only possible example of economic

   KABAT-COLUMN _ A lot has been written about birth order and how
it affects children. I do know the oldest child often is the
high-achieving, angst-ridden, overly responsible one. The middle
child's existence typically is a lifelong scream for attention. And
the youngest many times is spoiled, laid back, easygoing and the
happiest of the bunch. You see, by the time the last child comes
along, the parents have foregone all their high-falutin' parenting
skills, relaxed, and just allowed that baby to develop as he or she
was meant to. Those stereotypes may hold some truth, but there are
certain burdens the youngest child must bear. (Kabat, Waco

   COXNET-WHEELS 0305 _ The industry calls the Daewoo Lanos and
other cars in its class ``roller skates,'' meaning they're
generally small, sometimes peppy and almost always low-priced cars
targeting first-time buyers and those looking for basic, no-frills
transportation. Give Daewoo credit, though. The South Korean
builder reaches out to some prestigious sources _ primarily Italian
designer Porsche and General Motors, a former partner _ for help
designing and powering its lineup of cars. (DeVault, Atlanta

looking forward to taking their 10-month-old grandson to the
hospital for a CAT scan last week. He would need to be sedated so
he could hold still for 10 minutes, they figured. ``We didn't like
that idea with the medical problems he had,'' Patricia said.
Besides, they knew the drugs would make him groggy and grouchy for
another 24 hours. So they were delighted to arrive at Children's
Medical Center and find out it had a new high-speed CAT scan
machine that could take the necessary pictures in only two minutes.

happiest of the bunch. You see, by the time the last child comes
along, the parents have foregone all their high-falutin' parenting
skills, relaxed, and just allowed that baby to develop as he or she
was meant to. Those stereotypes may hold some truth, but there are
certain burdens the youngest child must bear. (Kabat, Waco
Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ In questioning a company's conviction in the
Mike Espy case, Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer wondered if,
in matters such as questionable gifts, ethics regulations aren't
preferable to ``bringing the blunderbuss of federal law into the
prosecutor's arsenal, where they can prosecute trivialities.'' If
that doesn't make sense to you, it's probably because you haven't
heard a sane voice for so long. (Tom Teepen is national
correspondent for Cox Newspapers.) MOVED MONDAY.

<P>
   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ MIAMI _ There is no telling how many hundreds
have drowned attempting to escape the hellish depressiveness of
Haiti, a country that has little to no economy and has had no
working government for almost two years and likely has no prospect
of one until November, if then. (Howard Kleinberg is a columnist
for Cox News Service.) MOVED MONDAY.

<P>
   SCHUETT-COLUMN _ GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ Contrary to youthful belief,
life in the '50s happened in vivid color. Whether it was better
than now or worse, I can't say. It was just different. But I
suspect it was also a heck of a lot easier. (Elizabeth Schuett, a
teacher and writer in Gibsonburg, Ohio, writes twice a week for Cox
News Service) MOVED.

   COXNET-WHEELS 0305 _ The industry calls the Daewoo Lanos and
other cars in its class ``roller skates,'' meaning they're
generally small, sometimes peppy and almost always low-priced cars
targeting first-time buyers and those looking for basic, no-frills
transportation. Give Daewoo credit, though. The South Korean
builder reaches out to some prestigious sources _ primarily Italian
designer Porsche and General Motors, a former partner _ for help
designing and powering its lineup of cars. (DeVault, Atlanta

who see the corporate marriage with Ford as a potential
contamination of the Volvo heritage. My guess is that nothing could
be further from the truth. If Ford's track record with Jaguar and

is not _ Ford will be more like a benevolent uncle than Big

   NEW-CATSCAN _ DAYTON, Ohio _ Douglas and Patricia Toler weren't
looking forward to taking their 10-month-old grandson to the
hospital for a CAT scan last week. He would need to be sedated so
he could hold still for 10 minutes, they figured. ``We didn't like
that idea with the medical problems he had,'' Patricia said.
Besides, they knew the drugs would make him groggy and grouchy for
another 24 hours. So they were delighted to arrive at Children's
Medical Center and find out it had a new high-speed CAT scan
machine that could take the necessary pictures in only two minutes.

 c.1999 The Arizona Republic

<P>
   A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; CENTENARIANS: THE STORY OF THE 20TH CENTURY BY THE AMERICANS WHO
LIVED IT &QL; 
 &UR; Bernard Edelman (FSG, $35)
</P>
<P>
   You don't need Peter Jennings to tell you about the past 100
years when you can listen to Philip Lord Carret _ born in 1896,
founder of one of the first mutual funds, called the ``Lou Gehrig
of investing'' by no less than Warren Buffett, survivor of 31 bull
markets, 30 bear markets, 20 recessions and the Great Depression.
Or Audrey Stubbart, born in 1895, a wife at age 15, mother at age
17, Wyoming homesteader, publishing copy editor and, until well
past her 100th birthday, a proofreader and columnist for the
Independence (Mo.) ``Examiner.'' Or Chester Cornelius ``Red'' Hoff,
born in 1891, the major league baseball player who, in 1911,
playing for the New York Highlanders, struck out Ty Cobb. Or Victor
Mills, born in 1897, inventor of Pampers disposable diapers and
Pringles potato chips. Edelman conducted interviews for this book
from 1995 through April, with centenarians who told stories about
their lives and about 100 years of American troubles and triumphs.
He groups their anecdotes under subheadings (Love and Marriage,
Pride and Prejudice, Prohibition, The Great Depression, The Second
World War, etc.) that make them easy to read in small doses. Of all
the recent books on the 20th century, this is the most charming.
``Never look back,'' says Geneva McDaniel, at age 111 the oldest of
Edelman's interviews. ``You always have to look forward. And
whatever you do, do it well.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ME &QL; 
 &UR; Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente as told to Garrison Keillor (Viking,
 &UR; $15.95)
</P>
<P>
   In November of last year, a professional wrestler named Jesse
``The Body'' Ventura was elected governor of Minnesota. Garrison
Keillor was watching, of course, although we do not know how he
voted. He was largely unfamiliar with Ventura, so in the spirit of
political inquiry, he rented a videotape of highlights from
Ventura's wrestling career and discovered that the governor-elect
had made his living by wearing a pink boa and dangling earrings and
hitting other men with folding chairs. Keillor was mildly impressed
_ ``I admired his chutzpah,'' he says, ``not a quality one
associates with Minnesotans'' _ but was unsure that he could write
anything fresh about a boa-wearing politician. In the end, he says,
because Ventura ``is his own invention and is in the midst of a
period of intense re-invention and realignment, it made sense to
write a work of fiction.'' Enter Jimmy (Big Boy) Valente, who is
none too kicked off about the ghostwriter sent by his publisher
(``I specifically asked them to assign a California writer, or a
European, someone who could appreciate me as an individual, and I
specifically said, `Not a Minnesotan,' so who do they send?'').
Indeed, Jimmy complains, Keillor is ``a tired old hack with a gecko
face and thinning hair and a body like a 6-foot stack of
marshmallows.'' This memoir is Jimmy's triumph over Keillor's
shortcomings. We learn of Jimmy's early life as a wimp named
Clifford Oxnard, of the mail-order body-building course that saved
him, of his enlistment in the Navy's elite Walrus program and his
service in Vietnam, of his entry into professional wrestling and
politics and his meeting with his hero, Arnold Schwarzenegger. We
think Jimmy should send copies of this to Paul Reiser, Chris Rock
and others who have written allegedly funny books, so they can see
what the real thing is. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; COWBOY: A LOVE STORY &QL; 
 &UR; Sara Davidson (HarperCollins, $24)
</P>
<P>
   ``How old are you?'' she asked. ``Thirty-nine,'' he said. ``Do
you know how old I am?'' she asked. ``No, ma'am, that's none of my
business.'' ``Older than you,'' she admitted. ``You've vintaged
well,'' he replied. She lived in Los Angeles, where she wrote
scripts for television's ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman.'' He was a
poor cowboy who lived in a trailer in Casa Grande. He wrote her a
note after they met at a cowboy poetry festival, and every third
word was misspelled. But her affair with a record producer wasn't
going well, so she invited the cowboy to come to Los Angeles for a
weekend. By the time she dropped him off at the airport for the
return trip to Phoenix, they had hit the sheets with a vengeance
and she was telling him she loved him. That's the way it goes in
this story of an affair between two people from different worlds.
Davidson (``Loose Change'') tells all _ more, in fact, than we ever
wanted to know _ although she uses fake names to preserve the
privacy of her children and her cowboy. That hardly seems necessary
_ if he's anything like she says he is, we doubt he'll ever read
it. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; HITCHCOCK'S NOTEBOOKS &QL; 
 &UR; Dan Auiler (Avon, $30)
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Hitchcock's opinion was that Fontaine was just too coy
and simpering to a degree that it was intolerable. She thought her
voice was irritating and was distressed about the whole thing.''
Those lines are from a memo written by Alfred Hitchcock to David
Selznick after he'd shown his wife, Alma, Joan Fontaine's screen
test for ``Rebecca.'' Auiler includes lot of other correspondence,
the storyboards for the crop-dusting and Mount Rushmore scenes from
``North by Northwest,'' Hitchcock's rough sketches for the shower
sequence in ``Psycho,'' transcripts of meetings between Hitchcock
and Tippi Hedren during the making of ``The Birds,'' and screenplay
draft comparisons that show the evolution of the script for ``The
Paradine Case'' and the interplay among the director, his wife and
the writer. Auiler is the author of ``Vertigo: The Making of a
Hitchcock Classic.'' &QL;

FLAGSTAFF'S BOOK FESTIVAL: A LITERARY MIRACLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   An unread story, Ursula Le Guin once wrote, is not really a
story at all, but ``little black marks on wood pulp. The reader,
reading it, makes it live: a living thing, a story.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 17, readers and writers will come together to celebrate
their stories at the second annual Northern Arizona Book Festival,
four days of readings and panel discussions throughout Flagstaff,
Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Among the writers will be Nobel Prize winner Czeslaw Milosz;
Michael Ondaatje, whose novel, ``The English Patient,'' won the
Booker Prize and was the basis of 1997's Academy Award Best Picture
winner; Russell Banks (``Cloudsplitter''and ``The Sweet
Hereafter''); and biographer Ron Chernow, who won the National Book
Award for ``The House of Morgan'' and critical acclaim last year
for ``Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.''
</P>
<P>
   Other participating authors include Grace Paley, Cristina
Garcia, Robert Pinsky, Dorothy Allison, Anchee Min, Bharati
Mukherjee, Leslie Marmon Silko, Susan Straight, Carolyn See, Ron
Carlson, David Haynes, Jewell Parker Rhodes, Daisy Zamora and Luis
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The slate is long, diverse and unabashedly literary, perhaps
because the organizers of the festival, which is sponsored by
Literacy Volunteers of Coconino County, set the bar so high last
year when their headliners were Banks and Nobel Prize-winning
novelist Toni Morrison. More than 4,000 people came out to see
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they really were interested in the immensity of it,''
says Jeff Biggers, 36, the festival's artistic director. ``It was
very high-caliber, and it wasn't just one or two big names. If we'd
only had Toni Morrison, it would have been just a lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``People liked having lots of readings to choose from, and they
liked the panels because we had unusual topics that started funny
and meaningful discussions. It almost seemed as if the smaller
events drew the greatest enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a constant schedule of author readings, this
year's festival will feature discussions on women in world
literature, the work of Edward Abbey and the place of literature in
commercial publishing. There will be appearances by theologian and
social activist William Sloane Coffin ``in conversation'' with
Chernow and Milosz. And like last year's festival, this one will
include ``poetry cafes,'' in which high school students read their
own poetry to some very sophisticated audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our kids read last year to standing room only,'' says
Priscilla Aydelott, who in June became director of the Literacy
Volunteers but before that taught English at Monument Valley High
School in Kayenta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joy Harjo was there, and Luis Rodriguez and Cin Salach. The
kids couldn't believe that writers like that had come to hear them.
They had fireworks in their eyes, constantly. It validated their
feelings and their sense of who they were and what sort of impact
they could have on the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Root, who came with his students from Hopi High School in
Keams Canyon, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best experiences they ever had,'' he says.
``I have the feeling that even if we'd flopped, we would still be
invited back _ that's how welcome we felt. But the kids got up
there and did great. It gave them a chance to see themselves as
poets. I sure was proud of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools are not the only participants coming back. Banks
will return (he appeared at the festival last year just as the
movie version of ``The Sweet Hereafter'' opened, and he comes now
after the release here of ``Affliction,'' which is based on his
1989 novel), as will Dorothy Allison, Alfredo Vea Jr., Susan
Straight, Quincy Troupe, Luis Rodriguez, John Nichols, Demetria
Martinez, Martin Espada, Ron Carlson and Jewell Parker Rhodes.
</P>
<P>
   ``That core group of regulars gives us a certain depth of
experience,'' Biggers says. ``Besides, these writers are important.
They should be household names. They are making major impacts in
poetry and literary fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   They also had a real good time last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lots of us are coming back just because it was fun,'' Vea
says. ``It wasn't like other festivals. It was so naturally done.
It wasn't self-conscious. There were no imperious matrons running
around in a huff, getting people here and there. It was a community
festival. Writers stayed in local hotels, and they walked from one
venue to the next with other writers and with people from the
community. There was no distance between them and the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Word of mouth also helped _ Banks and Ondaatje are friends, and
Banks encouraged Ondaatje to accept an invitation to Flagstaff this
year.
</P>
<P>
   All of this contentment is due in large part to the
persuasiveness and formidable organizing skills of Biggers, who,
Aydelott says, ``is not just an extraordinary man, but someone who
manages to make other people believe that they can be
extraordinary, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Raised in southern Arizona, Biggers has worked in adult
education since the early 1980s, both in the United States and
abroad. He became director of Literacy Volunteers in 1994. In
addition to expanding its literacy program, he set out to launch a
creditable reading series that would bring writers to audiences who
had never seen them before.
</P>
<P>
   He started small, with local authors and with audiences composed
mostly of his own friends. But the series grew and received a boost
when Biggers began to work with New York's PEN American Center,
which sponsors a ``Readers and Writers'' program that sends
nationally known writers to rural communities across the country,
free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   In Kayenta, Aydelott was already working with PEN American, and
she and Biggers became part of a cluster of PEN American sites
throughout Arizona. Among the writers who have come through the
program are Dorothy Allison, Sherman Alexie, Joy Harjo and Cristina
Garcia.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, we had all these great writers visiting,'' Biggers says,
``and I said to each of them, `Hey, if I could bring you all back
at one time, would you be interested?' They all said `Sure.' And I
said, `Well, would you help me by cutting your fees? Because I
can't afford you all at once.' It turned out that many of these
wonderful writers were willing to come for next to nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggers still depends on such kindnesses, but fund-raising is
easier after last year's success. The Northern Arizona University
Centennial Committee has been so generous this year that Biggers
refers to it as a ``co-sponsor.'' Other funders include the
Flagstaff Arts and Science Commission, the Marshall Fund and the
Arizona Commission on the Arts.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will cost roughly $70,000, Biggers says. Almost all
of it will go toward authors' fees, travel costs and
accommodations. The festival itself will be run by a small army of
volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any problem asking for money,'' Biggers says,
``because I believe so much in what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the country is beginning to notice. Chernow, who was
chairman of the Readers and Writers program last year, met Biggers,
Aydelott and other people from the program's Arizona sites when
they came to a meeting in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Jeff told me about his festival, I asked him how many
people came last year,'' Chernow says. ``I thought he'd say he had
a few hundred people, but when he told me he had a few thousand,
that the entire town was swept up in it, I began to be very
excited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to seeing firsthand what he has done. If
it's as good as I suspect it is, it could be a model, it could be
imitated by other parts of the country that aren't on the standard
writers' circuit. I'm always surprised by how imaginative and
enthusiastic people like Jeff and the others from Arizona can be.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggers would take that compliment for what it is, a sign that
any effort on behalf of literature should be noticed and enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can do this in Flagstaff _ if I can sell this wildly
diverse and very serious slate of writers and pull in thousands of
people to see them _ then we should be doing this in New York, in
LA, in San Francisco, in Phoenix,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Books matter. Events like this enrich our lives. We come
together, we find out we have common stories and we have things we
need to discuss. Writers play a huge role in that. They not only
tell our stories, but they help us to understand who we are.'' &QL;

 &HT;    Marc Jacobs has `ho-hum' in the bag
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Any designer who has his own New York-based signature
collections to produce twice yearly, as well as collections for a
luxury Parisian label, needs a deep bag of tricks.
</P>
<P>
   At least Marc Jacobs, who designs for Louis Vuitton, got the
deep-bag part right.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the buyers, editors and groupies attending Vuitton's
fall/winter runway preview Monday wondered what the purple leather
wristbands they'd received with their invitations signified.
</P>
<P>
   The answer came quickly when the first models strolled out
toting enormous red and purple backpacks, purses and suitcases
plastered with the Vuitton logo.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Jacobs, the darling of Seventh Avenue in spite of his
rebellious streak, intended the bags as a mockery. But of what? Was
he poking fun at his Paris employers, whose handbags are
distributed more widely than their apparel? Was he satirizing the
industry's love affair with small, ultra-modern ``utility'' bags?
Or were his gargantuan bags symbols of defiance against threatened
U.S. trade sanctions that could cause luxury goods from Vuitton to
double in price?
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps the bags were merely meant to serve as distractions
from Jacobs' designs. The collection featured flashes of the
brilliance that's made him one of the industry's most mimicked
designers, but for the most part it was dull.
</P>
<P>
   The primary colors were black, tan, moss and brown, with
splashes of red and orange interjected occasionally. The
form-fitting jackets and sweaters, paired with loose skirts or
flared pants, created an A-line silhouette that's already been
shown on countless runways in New York and Milan, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs distinguished Vuitton from other collections, however, in
the way he cut the waistbands: They rose high and loose above the
navel and were tied Elly May Clampett-style, with leather cords.
Jacobs also did interesting things with a foamy metallic fabric
that took the form of suits and eveningwear separates. And he
showed a few of the plush turtlenecks seen this season.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, very little leather was used, and most of the
collection was logo-free. Only the most faithful Vuitton customers
would recognize the label's signature diamond pattern as it was
applied to a few dresses and ponchos.
</P>
<P>
   This was a collection for those who'd grown weary of making
blind-faith purchases and needed their brand loyalty challenged
anew.

FEINSTEIN RENEWS PUSH TO EXPAND ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., renewed her effort
Tuesday to clamp more federal controls on rapid-fire guns.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the 1994 law that banned the manufacture of 19
types of semiautomatic weapons reintroduced a bill that would close
what Feinstein called a ``major loophole'' in the law. The loophole
allows imports of so-called clips or magazines that hold more than
10 rounds of ammunition if they were made before the end of 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ``We intended to ban the manufacture of all high-capacity clips,
leaving only a narrow clause allowing for the importation of clips
already on their way into this country,'' Feinstein explained.
</P>
<P>
   She said she and other lawmakers who agreed to the clause didn't
realize it would result in millions of high-capacity clips being
allowed into the United States more than four years later.
</P>
<P>
   The reason is that, despite the ban on importing post-1994
foreign-made high-capacity clips, U.S. law enforcement officials
have no way of determining when such clips were made. Their
manufacturers simply claim they were made before 1995, Feinstein
said, adding that 128 million high-capacity clips have since
entered the United States.
</P>
<P>
   American companies have been banned from making such clips since
the 1994 assault-weapons ban became law. But U.S.-made
high-capacity clips are still legal to buy and sell as long as they
were made before 1995. Unlike foreign-made high-capacity clips, the
U.S. clips contain serial numbers that allow them to be tracked
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation would not ban the sale or possession of clips
already in circulation,'' Feinstein said.
</P>
<P>
   She appeared at a news conference Tuesday flanked by police
officers and local government officials who told of recent
shootings in which the gunmen had weapons with high-capacity clips.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Kerns, deputy police chief of Oakland, Calif., said officer
James Williams was killed there in January when a man using an
AK-47 with two 30-round Chinese-made clips opened fire on Williams.
Kerns said the incident was over before the police officers who
were with Kerns knew what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Senate defeated a similar bill authored by
Feinstein. She said she is more optimistic that the measure will
pass this year because the Senate has nine new members. But the
margins are still the same with Republicans controlling 55 seats
and the Democrats controlling 45 seats.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein's bill has the support of the National League of
Cities as well as law enforcement groups. She said she plans to
take more time building support among lawmakers this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year it was just thrown on the floor,'' Feinstein said of
the bill. She noted that it was defeated only a few days after
Russell Eugene Weston Jr., a former mental patient from Montana,
went on a rampage in the U.S. Capitol July 25, shooting and killing
two police officers there with a Smith &AMP; Wesson revolver.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. introduced a measure identical to
Feinstein's in the House Tuesday. ``Instead of a stop-gap
compromise, we got a Mack-truck sized loophole,'' DeGette said of
the 1994 law. ``There's no legitimate purpose for these clips other
than to kill human beings.''
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein and DeGette said they intend to keep reintroducing
their legislation until it becomes law.

SOMETIMES THE REMOTEST DETAILS CAN RUIN YOUR DAY (For use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MONICA ANDERSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I can't believe it. I have six remote controls in my lap and not
a single one of them works on this television.
</P>
<P>
   I've been sitting here for 20 minutes, watching ``Rugrats,''
hoping that one of my kids would pass by and change the channel for
me. I wouldn't mind so much if it was ``Teletubbies'' or one of
those other R-rated children's programs, but I'd rather be watching
Rather.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose that I could summon one of the boys from their room
but my dad used to do that to me and it really irritated me. I
promised myself that I would never do that to my kids. Now I
realize that Dad must have been as tired as I am this evening. I
just do not have the strength to walk that whole six or seven feet
to the TV and possibly strain my already weak eyes trying to
distinguish the volume buttons from the channel buttons.
</P>
<P>
   Six remotes and I can't change the channel.
</P>
<P>
   This brown one worked fine until we lost the battery cover and
started using tape to keep the AAs from falling out. Now it's
useless.
</P>
<P>
   I don't even know where this long gray one came from. We don't
own an RCA television, but I tried it anyway, just in case. It
doesn't work either.
</P>
<P>
   The black remote will turn the TV on or off, but it won't change
the channels. This expensive, universal remote has always confused
me. Sometimes it works if you stand a few inches from the screen. I
tried that a few minutes ago but nothing happened so I came back to
my chair and sat down.
</P>
<P>
   I think this small, square remote is for the stereo, but I'm not
sure. It does make the floor lamp blink on and off like a strobe
light, which may come in handy later but is of no use to me at this
time. You know, this other thing is the cordless phone. No wonder
it wouldn't control the television. But that does explain the
strange sounds it made when I pressed the buttons.
</P>
<P>
   This kids' show is making me looney. Someone has got to change
the channel! OK, I'm down to my last resort. I'm going to light a
candle. It's a scented candle that's guaranteed to attract
children. I haven't tried it before. I've been saving it for an
emergency. This is definitely an emergency.
</P>
<P>
   Wow, only five minutes passed before a child appeared and said,
``Mom, is that popcorn I smell?''
</P>
<P>
   I quickly extinguish the candle.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sweetie, that must be coming from the neighbor's house,'' I
reply. ``But do you mind turning to Channel 8 for me?''
</P>
<P>
   Amazing, it worked like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's remote control.

WHY I LOVE A MESSY HOME 
</HEADLINE>
  By SUZANNE MATSON 
 c.1999 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For me, order and pleasure go hand in hand. I like a sock drawer
full of neatly rolled balls, a lingerie drawer in which things are
stacked by category. Tables and counters should have only what is
supposed to be on them and no more, their clear surfaces a sign
that life is in harmonious balance.
</P>
<P>
   These standards were formed before I had children.
</P>
<P>
   Before the birth of my two boys, each day's mail was sorted soon
after it arrived. Bills went to the bill folder, junk mail to the
recycling bin, personal mail to a drawer where letters could be
reread and answered.
</P>
<P>
   Before kids, my clothes and my husband's clothes hung tidily in
our closets, our shoes lined up by twos. When pictures came back
from the photo shop, I put the best ones in an album and filed the
rest by date. Dishes were washed as we used them.
</P>
<P>
   Some would say I was too neat. My husband still can't believe
that he once walked into the kitchen and saw me stapling a bag of
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Now, of course, I couldn't even find the stapler if I had a mind
to go sealing up the sugar, flour or rice. If I did find it,
probably in the Tupperware drawer or the magazine rack, you can bet
it would have no staples.
</P>
<P>
   My behavior modification program in learning to live with a mess
(OK, chaos) advanced in stages. When my first son, Nicholas, was a
newborn who stayed in one place, I could round up stray burp cloths
and booties several times a day. I could arrange his stuffed
animals in an esthetically pleasing semicircle at one end of his
changing table. It was hard to get those tiny clothes to stay in
neat stacks in the drawer, but I tried. The only sign of eroding
order was the bed. Because I took naps when I could, and often lay
down with the baby to nurse, the bed tended to stay unmade for days
at a time.
</P>
<P>
   When Nicholas started crawling, things got complicated.
Suddenly, we needed lots of toys in lots of areas of the house. The
best arrangement for these, from the baby's point of view, was to
have them scattered all over the middle of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   Had we been able to keep it at that, I would have been OK. But a
toddler can cross a room more quickly than the fastest crawler or
cruiser; this means he can be at the fireplace opening doors and
scooping up ashes with his toy backhoe before your mouth can form
the word no.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that your ``no'' has escalated to ``NO!'' your
toddler has vanished into the kitchen to serve himself from the
pitcher of juice you keep in the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, with one child, even a dynamo toddler, I found I
still had a fighting chance of straightening up once a day, though
I often had to wait until late evening.
</P>
<P>
   Then our second baby, Henry, arrived, and suddenly we had two
sets of toys on the floor, two sizes of dirty clothes scattered
about, twice as many used diapers overflowing the trash bags, and
Hot Wheels, Hot Wheels everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   With two kids, there is twice the stuff flying around and half
the time to deal with it. After two bathtimes, two bedtimes, two
daycare bags packed for the next day, dinner dishes and laundry, my
husband and I barely have the energy to brush our own teeth before
bed_forget about picking up the clutter.
</P>
<P>
   There is no choice but to surrender to the flow. Parents of
young children are so tuned to the elemental_ food, safety,
comfort, love_so focused on the urgent promptings of the moment,
that even the most committed neatnik has to let go.
</P>
<P>
   I am proud to say that I can now weave a path through our
cyclone-struck house with Zenlike detachment. Without pause I step
over the tote bags home from daycare with their bottles to be
washed; pick my way around coats tossed on the floor; walk past the
breakfast dishes, the mail, the laundry waiting to tee forded. I
can almost ignore the sound of Cheerios crunching underfoot.
</P>
<P>
   The thing is, I have not seen my boys all day. ``Mom, do you
want to play with me?'' my 3-year-old asks overturning the toy
basket in the den with a joyous racket and cascade of plastic. The
baby in my arms crows and squirms to be let loose in the pile.
</P>
<P>
   We play; we make a huge mess.

THE DISEASES THAT WON'T GO AWAY
</HEADLINE>
  Includes a contact box at bottom of take. 
 (Eds.: Elin is cq.) 
 By KIERAN MULVANEY 
 c.1999 E magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost 20 years ago, smallpox was eradicated from the earth and
medical science was feeling bullish. With good reason: As James W.
Brown and Elin A. Gursky wrote recently in the Medical Laboratory
Reporter, at that time ``it appeared civilization's oldest
enemy_infectious disease_had been beaten at last.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that optimism seems sadly misplaced. Two decades
after the elimination of smallpox, no other disease or
disease-causing organism has been similarly banished. Indeed, new
and previously unsuspected diseases_AIDS being probably the most
well-known and feared_are emerging with remarkable frequency; and
some old, and seemingly defeated, enemies are displaying resistance
to everything that medical science has thrown at them.
</P>
<P>
   First the good news_and there is plenty. There have been no
cases of polio reported in the Americas since 1991, and its
eradication is expected by 2000. Diphtheria cases in the U.S. have
been reduced from an estimated 15,000 annually during World War II
to only about three a year today; and the number of annual measles
cases in the country has plummeted from about 760,000 in 1958 to
fewer than 1,000 this decade.
</P>
<P>
   But, for much of humanity, infectious and parasitic diseases, or
IPDs, remain a deadly threat.
</P>
<P>
   More than 17 million people died from IPDs in 1995, meaning that
such diseases accounted for more than a quarter of all human
deaths. They are the leading cause of mortality in the Middle East
and Asia (outside China) and are responsible for more than half of
all deaths in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia kill more than 4 million
people a year globally and are the leading cause of death among
children under five. And despite repeated efforts to stamp it out,
tuberculosis refuses to go away, remaining the No. 1 cause of adult
death from infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the resilience of longstanding enemies, there is
the added complication of ``new'' and emerging diseases. HIV,
Ebola, hantavirus, Hepatitis-C, the Legionella bacterium and the
Cyclospora parasite are just some of the almost 30 ``new''
disease-causing microbes and infectious diseases recognized since
1973, according to the World Health Organization.
</P>
<P>
   In Zimbabwe, where 1994 estimates reckoned 900,000 people to be
infected with the virus, some scientists have projected that AIDS
may reduce the country's life expectancy at birth from its 1997
level of 51 years to just 33 years by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   Without HIV/AIDS, Zimbabwe's life expectancy by 2010 would be
expected to be about 70. Why this persistence and resilience? ``I
think the biggest factor involved in the emergence and spread of
new diseases is transportation,'' says Dr. S. Jay Olshansky at the
Department of Medicine, University of Chicago. ``With greater
mobility among and between populations, and with global trade
resulting in much greater movement across borders, we can now
transport disease-carrying organisms across the globe in a matter
of hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the same time, human populations are also moving into
environments where they hadn't been before, and altering those
environments, opening themselves up to organisms they haven't
encountered before.''
</P>
<P>
   Global warming could be another factor. According to Dr. Paul
Epstein, associate director of the Center for Health and the Global
Environment at Harvard Medical School, ``Climate restricts the
range at which tropical diseases occur, while weather affects the
timing and intensity of outbreaks. We're seeing an increase in
extreme weather events, which increases the incidence of disease.''
</P>
<P>
   Case in point: malaria. The incidences of malaria in Africa,
Southeast Asia and South and Central America are generally
associated with the clearing of forests, according to a report by
the World Resources Institute. For example, the malaria-carrying
mosquito breeds in sunlit pools along the partially cleared forest
margin, where it is responsible for high numbers of malaria cases
in South and Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   In the Amazon, a combination of rapid population growth,
migration and displacement of laborers and indigenous people,
environmental destruction and development have created ideal
conditions for the growth and spread of malaria. Reported cases of
the disease in the region have risen from 52,469 in 1970 to 577,520
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   As for the resistance of old diseases, much of the problem
there, says Olshansky, ``is our own fault. We've introduced
antibiotics, forcing microorganisms to evolve even faster than they
already do. We create new defenses, and they become resistant.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mary Wilson of the Harvard School of Public Health notes
that ``physicians are often under tremendous pressure from patients
to prescribe antibiotics for problems_such as earaches and many
respiratory illnesses_where they plainly won't have any effect.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she adds, even if we all took antibiotics far more
sparingly, the problem remains of the ``enormous amount of
antibacterial agents in the environment. Something like 40 percent
by weight of all antibiotics goes into cattle feed. Chopping boards
have antimicrobial agents, and so do household soaps. Antibiotics
are very overused.''
</P>
<P>
   Conversely, immunizations against viral diseases_sometimes
criticized and shunned because of their potential side-effects,
particularly on the very young_are essential tools in the fight
against disease. The World Health Organization argues that, without
vaccination, the risk of death from contracting measles is, in some
less developed countries, as high as 1 in 5; the odds of developing
encephalitis or a severe allergic reaction, by contrast, are just 1
in 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everyone was adequately vaccinated around the world,''
Olshansky argues, ``then most of these diseases would effectively
be wiped out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson agrees with the importance of widespread immunization,
but is less sanguine about its cure-all potential. ``Vaccines have
been extraordinarily successful,'' she says, ``but we can't rely on
them. Microbes change, and can get around each and every vaccine.
There are lots of other ways to protect people_sanitation, screens
on windows to protect them from insects, paying attention to
land-use and land-conversion issues. We need a multidisciplinary
approach.''

THE ART OF THE THANK-YOU NOTE (WITH ART)
</HEADLINE>

thank-you note with a large quill. The Adobe Illustrator file is

<TEXT>
<P>
   For six decades now, Hazel Haley has been preaching the fine art
of the thank-you note.
</P>
<P>
   So when friends threw her a birthday party on a Sunday night not
long ago, she did exactly as any old-school English teacher would.
By Monday morning, Haley had dashed off, in her own handwriting,
the appropriate thank yous to her hostess and the guests who made
the get-together special.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just don't think any human relationship has ever been
damaged by a nice thank-you note. It should be done within 24 hours
after you get home from a visit or a party,'' says Haley, an honors
English teacher at Lakeland High School in Lakeland, Fla. ``I think
people of good breeding still send thank-you notes.''
</P>
<P>
   In the age of electronic mail, the thank-you note seems more
like a throwback to a time when correspondence came by Pony
Express. And while etiquette consultants say e-mail is better than
nothing, few well-chosen lines have the impact of ink on nice
stationery.
</P>
<P>
   Just as snail mail has prevailed, so has the time-honored
obligation of thanking someone for a present or good deed. Kids
still learn the basics in school as ``friendly letters'' _ a
process that begins in elementary school, with a few refreshers
before life's final exam of graduation gift thank yous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difficulty is that we don't have many formal protocols
around the conventions of life,'' says Barbara Pachter, who teaches
business etiquette and communications to corporations. ``People go
into companies, and someone says hello to them, and they don't even
say hello back. People get so preoccupied, and it (writing
thank-you notes) hasn't been stressed enough.''
</P>
<P>
   As president of Pachter &AMP; Associates in Cherry Hill, N.J.,
Pachter knows people are busy. But claiming you don't have time,
she says, is no excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only two to four sentences,'' Pachter says. ``Once people
get into the habit of doing it, it's not very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   And in a competitive business climate, those who remember the
thank-you note have the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely,'' Pachter says. ``It stands out. To some degree,
they (bosses) expect them. But the quality of your writing counts.
I know of one young man who did not get the job, the promotion,
because after being interviewed he sent a thank-you note _ which is
good _ but it had typos and spelling errors.''
</P>
<P>
   Composing a thank-you card isn't rocket science. It requires
little more than the demure notes known as ``informals'' and a
sincere act of appreciation.
</P>
<P>
   The date goes flush right. Under it, to the far left, is the
salutation or ``Dear Jane.''
</P>
<P>
   Indent, thank the person for a nice evening or gift. Talk about
the present during your breezy note. But if the gift was money, do
not use a dollar figure. Adjectives such as ``thoughtful'' or
``generous'' will get the point across.
</P>
<P>
   Haley advises recipients not be too specific about what they
plan to do with a gift of cash.
</P>
<P>
   Be polite, even if it's the sixth crockpot you received this
Christmas. It serves no purpose to say in the note that it will be
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Manners' Judith Martin is a champion of the personal note.
And while her normal credo encourages hostesses to be nice to
everyone, she turns acidic when it comes to brides who refuse to
send thank-you notes.
</P>
<P>
   In Martin's ``Guide to Excruciatingly Correct Behavior,'' she
answers the question, ``When is a written thank-you note for a
wedding gift not necessary?'' with cold simplicity: ``When no
wedding present has been received.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's weddings are often a cooperative effort between the
bride and groom. According to the etiquette-graced Emily Post,
brides usually write and sign thank-you notes because most gifts
are sent to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``But,'' Post says, ``there is no reason the groom should not
share this task. There are many relatives and friends of the groom
who would be delighted to receive a thank-you note from him.''
</P>
<P>
   It is also not incorrect to sign both names, although it is
preferable to sign only one name and include the other in the text:
``Bob and I are so delighted ...''
</P>
<P>
   Most thank-you notes, however, are a response to events other
than weddings. They are sent after dinner at a friend's home, for
gifts or for favors.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming Allaire, who has an etiquette hotline and is known as
``Dr. Manners,'' says the key to getting notes out is a little
discipline.
</P>
<P>
   Allaire, who has a doctorate in education and lives in
Manchester, Conn., has a sure-fire method for making sure a gift is
acknowledged: ``Don't wear it, use it, eat it or spend it until
you've written the thank-you note.''

DREAMS TAKE OFF ON THIS RUNWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. - Strutting someday soon on an international
fashion runway: Sarah Alford.
</P>
<P>
   Or so she hopes. More than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   Alford, 15, was one of more than 400 girls and women who showed
up at Dillard's at Scottsdale Fashion Square on Saturday, hoping to
have their faces and features grace an ad for Roxy, a clothing
line.
</P>
<P>
   Roxy and ``Seventeen'' magazine sponsored the model search.
Would-be Cindy Crawfords formed a line that snaked around several
corners as they waited, Polaroids in hand, for one brief trip down
a runway set up in the store.
</P>
<P>
   Most had the model strut down, if not the practiced boredom and
put-upon look favored by so many supermodels. (Give them time,
they're still learning.)
</P>
<P>
   But none had the confidence Alford possessed. Every 15-year-old
girl is the center of her own universe. The refreshing thing about
Alford, who lives in Phoenix, was how freely she admitted it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have very, very high self-esteem,'' she said. ``Too high. I
have to make myself look just perfect every day even though I'm
only going to school. You never know if there will be a talent
scout.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fashion sense &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Alas, sometimes when the talent scouts are there, you don't have
your best day. Alford was decked out in a black halter top,
platform shoes _ that would have made the ``Goodbye Yellow Brick
Road''-era Elton John suffer vertigo _ and a red skirt slit so high
up her thigh a gust of wind would have gotten her arrested.
</P>
<P>
   But she wasn't happy with her runway performance, which included
blowing a kiss to the hundreds of people watching.
</P>
<P>
   She felt like she was too nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally I'm not that shy,'' she said, quickly recovering her
game face and adding, ``although I'd love to (model)
professionally.''
</P>
<P>
   She and everyone else in line. Though not everyone was so
upfront about her ambitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care,'' Heidi Mendiola said. ``I'm not the one who
wants to do this. I'm just here to make her feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Her'' was her friend Julie Ranoa, a confessed Roxy addict who
not only wore all Roxy clothes and a Roxy necklace but also showed
off (discreetly) the Roxy logo tattooed just above her hip.
</P>
<P>
   The two 19-year-olds had driven 12 hours from San Jose. Despite
the lack of sleep _ or maybe because of it _ they were plenty
perky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of a fun thing,'' Ranoa said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not like `if I don't win, my life is over.' We're going
to LA this summer,'' Mendiola added.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drama queens,'' Ranoa laughed. ``We want to go into
acting.''
</P>
<P>
   Always good to have a backup plan. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Natural, informal look &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Behind every good model, to mangle a phrase, is an understanding
mother. The line was peppered with several whose patience made Job
look like George Steinbrenner. Alford's mother, Sally, was one.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's meant to be, it's meant to be,'' she said of her
daughter's goals. ``There are other things that are more
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Without missing a beat, Sarah turned to her mother and said,
``Not to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When most people think of models, they think of tall, stark
beauties with physical attributes that defy gravity. That's not
what Roxy looks for, said Lori Weed, a Roxy representative.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want a professional model,'' she said. ``Our whole ad
campaign is based on the real girl. Just real natural, informal.''
</P>
<P>
   What about beauty? Not that important, she said. Think active,
healthy. She thumbed through a book of Roxy models to demonstrate.
All were indeed active-looking. And healthy.
</P>
<P>
   And _ what do you know? _ beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   This was the first stop on a five-city nationwide search. I
don't know if Weed and a ``Seventeen'' representative found what
they were looking for, but to the untrained eye, there was plenty
of model behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And if not? Nothing ventured, nothing gained.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to start somewhere,'' Mendiola said with a shrug.
And here was as good a place as any. &QL;

`CHIAPAS REVOLUTION' LANDS ON ARIZONA FRONT PORCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JACK MCGARVEY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO RICO, Ariz. - During their brief respite at my Rio Rico
home, a Chiapas father and son consumed big bowls of rice and
ranchero beans, 24 smallish corn tortillas, and big salad plates of
lettuce, ripe tomatoes and sliced avocados that I garnished with
mayonnaise, red chile flakes and chopped cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   They also ate a dozen raw jalapenos and peeled four oranges.
They drank nearly a gallon of milk and later snacked on a bag of
microwave popcorn. They were astounded by the microwave. They also
drank a liter of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   Father Ignacio and son Pedro were famished, having subsisted
only on cornmeal gruel during their two-month odyssey north to the
chilly Promised Land from the tropical, revolutionary Mexican state
of Chiapas. They walked on blistered feet, trudging into Arizona
armed only with dreams of a better life, while peeling out scant
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro, whose brown eyes brimmed with teenage optimism, had a
fever and hacking cough. I gave him aspirin and made him sleep for
eight hours in a warm bed instead of on cold ground.
</P>
<P>
   As Pedro slept, father Ignacio emptied his pockets to show me
his six remaining American dollars. He also showed me some fancy
Mexican documents which noted his occupation as ``campesino'' _
loosely translated as farmer.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio and Pedro, Mayan Indians, were artists. When Pedro awoke
_ feeling somewhat better _ father and son sat elbow to elbow at my
coffee table to draw detailed pictures of my house, my car, the
valley below and the mountains beyond, their appealing drawings
telling the story of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Ignacio told me he has hospitality waiting for me _ when, not if
_ I visit his wife and two daughters waiting back in Chiapas. I am
apparently expected there any day now.
</P>
<P>
   I really hated to see them leave. They were among the most
engaging folk I've met in quite a while. As I watched them walk
north along the Union Pacific Railroad tracks, they seemed so
conspicuous with their bad haircuts, short stature and
golden-brown, Mayan skin. When I turned away south to give my dogs
a walk, a Border Patrol helicopter, sounding like a loud lawn
mower, slid down over San Cayetano Mountain toward us.
</P>
<P>
   I expect that Ignacio and Juan likely will be nabbed by the
Border Patrol. But if they're vanned back across the border,
they'll try again. Ignacio told me they'd already been nabbed twice
before. No big deal, he said.
</P>
<P>
   If I were a millionaire, I'd work like hell to make them legal.
I'd open a nursery with Ignacio as manager. He's an expert on soil
and plants and knew all about the pocket gopher that's been gnawing
out the roots of my plants. I learned some new Spanish words, but
really learned nothing new from Ignacio about how to keep that
gopher's teeth from doing their damage, except by selling traps in
our new nursery. I'd also import Ignacio's wife and daughters and
send all their kids to college.
</P>
<P>
   Their desperate, two-month journey astounds me, and stirs
memories of my own Irish ancestors' ambition, four generations ago.
Any mystery as to why Mexican nationals keep trespassing into
Arizona has been dispelled. Ignacio told me the average Chiapas
wage is $2 a day. A diet of beans, rice and chiles consumes half of
that, he said, with little left over for schoolbooks.
</P>
<P>
   It is, though, such a helpless situation for this Chiapas father
and son. They bring only a desire to work hard and gardening skill,
which is very, very common and very cheap here in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   They have no friends or relatives in (begin ital) los estados
unidos. (end ital) They were headed for Phoenix, Ignacio said. But
it is Tucson they would first encounter. Imagine their shock of
trekking into huge Tucson from a rural Chiapas village, knowing
nobody.
</P>
<P>
   But I can't really worry about that, can I? It's their choice,
and I'll settle for having given Ignacio and Pedro some food and
warmth during their brief visit here. I'm not really surprised that
the ``Chiapas Revolution'' landed on the front porch of my Rio Rico
home.
</P>
<P>
   More Chiapas folk are on the way. Guaranteed. &QL;

`GUITAR HERO' TIM REYNOLDS ENJOYS UNPLUGGED LIFE WITH DAVE
MATTHEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN MURPHY  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (PHOENIX) - Calling from a hotel room in Indiana, Tim Reynolds
apologizes for technical difficulties that resulted in two abrupt
disconnections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I stand up and the cord falls right out of the thing,''
Reynolds says. ``Nice expensive hotel, but the phone sucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's just because it's probably been used the way I've
been using it . . . over and over.''
</P>
<P>
   It's probably something he should get used to. Reynolds, as in
Dave Matthews and Tim Reynolds, has been handling all the press for
the third acoustic tour featuring him and his good buddy.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, Matthews holds most of the name recognition, but
Reynolds is quickly connecting with Matthews' fans. The duo's
unplugged sessions are wildly popular, selling out in a matter of
minutes _ 15 in Phoenix's case.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Reynolds remains a mystery to some, namely those who live
outside of the Southeast and Charlottesville, Va., where he and
Matthews first met 10 years ago. Matthews worked as a bartender in
a local club, where Reynolds was playing gigs on Monday nights.
Once the two met, they began to jam, before Matthews formed his
band.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds says their gigs in the area were highly successful, and
once Matthews' band took off, a nationwide acoustic tour became
even more appealing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just a different way to present his songs,'' Reynolds
says. ``I think it opens up people's minds to the fact that he
really writes great songs.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds isn't so shabby himself. Besides Matthews calling him
his ``guitar hero,'' Reynolds has toyed with sitar, violin and
mandolin, to name a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't even list (the instruments) because I'm just too
neurotic to stay with one thing,'' Reynolds says. ``I don't
consider myself a master of many styles. But I consider myself a
master of my instrument. And, therefore, whatever style I want to
play, I can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that sort of confidence that has Reynolds feeling good
about his own group, which currently has two different names: Tim
Reynolds and His Power Trio or Puke Matrix. Reynolds likes the
latter _ ``It just makes me giggle'' _ while his PR folks
undoubtedly prefer the former.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, his new CD has only one name, ``Tim Reynolds Live.''
To support the album, Reynolds has been ``burning up the road'' and
using his time with Matthews for further inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tours are real great,'' Reynolds says. ``My music
benefits from the activity of this.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, fatigue hasn't been an issue for Reynolds or Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   ``These tours are pretty relaxing, pretty user-friendly,''
Reynolds explains. ``It's just acoustic guitars with one tech
onstage. It's so easy . . . when you're like me and Dave _ we just
like to play.''
</P>
<P>
   However, an open-taping policy at the shows has caused some
difficulties with Matthews' record company. The sale of unofficial
_ and most times inaudible _ bootlegs has forced the label to file
injunctions against independent record stores that sell them.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Matthews and Reynolds released this year's
double-CD ``Live at Luther College.'' Reynolds isn't sure who makes
the decisions regarding the policy, but says he allows open taping
because ``it can only help the music.''
</P>
<P>
   Lately, though, it doesn't seem as if Reynolds needs much help.
He has found what he thinks is his eternal resting place in Santa
Fe _ ``I will probably die there just because it's so awesome
there'' _ and has forged a name for himself sans Matthews.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if we can just get him a phone that works. &QL;

SHORTAGE OF ORGANS IS THE REAL PROBLEM  
 (ADV: THIS EDITORIAL APPEARED IN THE MARCH 8 ARIZONA REPUBLIC) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - A quixotic bid to exempt Arizona from a national human
organ allocation system should make people sick. The national plan
itself could make people sicker.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems prompt shouts of protest. But when the shouting is
done, when all arguments are made about any system of rationing
human body parts, a somber reality sinks in: No matter which system
is in place, patients will die because of a severe shortage of
lifesaving organs.
</P>
<P>
   Two proposals before the Arizona Legislature would essentially
reject the national plan. Under these proposals, organs harvested
in Arizona would stay in Arizona when at all possible. The sickest
patients would be first in line for transplants, followed by those
less sick on waiting lists here. Only when there were no matches in
Arizona would organs be offered to patients outside of the state.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Sue Grace, R-Phoenix, says her bill is her best
attempt to send Washington a message. Even if the message is
received, federal rule likely would supersede state law.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services wants to
replace local systems with a national plan. Donated organs would go
to the sickest patients in the United States regardless of where
they live.
</P>
<P>
   The federal plan, which is on hold pending further review by
Congress, attempts to bring equity to the organ allocation process.
Waiting lists for patients vary widely from region to region. The
feds believe the disparity creates discrimination based on
geography.
</P>
<P>
   Will the federal plan save more lives? Grace says no. And not
only will it not save more lives, she says it could reduce or
eliminate access in Arizona to lifesaving care.
</P>
<P>
   Under the federal plan, a transplant center will lose its status
if it does not perform a minimum number of operations. Grace said
Arizona transplant centers could come up short when competing
against larger counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the geographical dilemma lies the ethical question of
whether precious few organs should go to the sickest patients.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates for liver transplant operations, for example, are put
in three categories. Status 1 patients are the sickest of the sick.
They are expected to die within seven days. A successful liver
transplant occurs about 60 percent of the time for Status 1
patients. Those Status 1 patients who reject a liver would be
placed at the top of the list again for transplant operations.
</P>
<P>
   Successful liver transplants in Status 3 patients, by
comparison, occur 84 percent of the time.
</P>
<P>
   Should we allocate resources to highest and best use, or do we
serve the sickest people, knowing that in weighting the decision in
their favor we could deplete the organ supply even more?
</P>
<P>
   Does a legislative postcard to Washington send the wrong message
in the region or nationally: That Arizona would rather let someone
out of state die than give up an organ?
</P>
<P>
   In Arizona, 650 people await organs. In 1998, 302 organs were
harvested from donors in this state. An unknown number died
waiting.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, 12 people die each day waiting for a
transplant.
</P>
<P>
   All of the questions, the angst and the unseemly hoarding of
body parts would go away with an adequate supply of organs. That
would occur with more donors. &QL;

IN THE RIGHT THROAT, POPULAR MUSIC IS SIMPLY DIVINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD NILSEN  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - My wife has a simple theology. As far as she is
concerned, Ray Charles is God.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't an organized religion and she doesn't attend
services. But I know what she means: When you hear Ray Charles
sing, you can easily be convinced that there is a kind of divinity
making itself heard through his throat.
</P>
<P>
   Strictly speaking, it isn't his music that causes this reaction.
Some of the songs he sings are as trivial as any other pop music,
the arrangements just as kitschy, and his backup musicians are
often the same ones who show up elsewhere when no divinity is
present.
</P>
<P>
   No, it is a quality in his voice that transcends the pop music
he sings. It is as if all of humanity is trying to crowd through
the narrow pipe of his trachea.
</P>
<P>
   What you hear is pain, joy, weariness, enthusiasm, strength,
vulnerability, death and birth _ all at once.
</P>
<P>
   Well-trained voices of opera singers are meant to sound
effortless; they know how to ease the notes across their vocal
cords and project them to the back of the house. With Charles, the
rasp of his voice underlines how hard the music is working to get
so much meaning through so small a tube.
</P>
<P>
   I'm going on about one singer-deity, but I am myself a
polytheist. There are a tiny handful of others working in pop
culture that bring so much to their medium that they transcend it
and reach the rank of high art.
</P>
<P>
   You hear something of the same going on in the tenor of Willie
Nelson. Now, I am not a country-Western fan. Mostly, such music
gives me the worms. But Nelson is something beyond the category,
and every note he utters seems rife with human life.
</P>
<P>
   Others on my list include Billie Holiday, John Lee Hooker, and _
yes, I'm serious about this _ Jerry Lee Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   In each, there is an authenticity in their voice that gets only
more profound as they age.
</P>
<P>
   You should hear the Killer bend ``Somewhere Over the Rainbow''
into a melancholy confession of regret. I doubt he could have
managed that when he was a young Turk.
</P>
<P>
   And Holiday, in the year before she died, worn threadbare by
heroin and alcohol, sang her ``Don't Explain'' at New York's Plaza
Hotel with Duke Ellington. You can barely stand listening to her
pain:
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital) ``Cry to hear folks chatter
</P>
<P>
   And I know you cheat.
</P>
<P>
   But right and wrong don't matter
</P>
<P>
   When you're with me, sweet.'' (end ital)
</P>
<P>
   The same authenticity _ the sense that the joy of life depends
on the pain and loss caused by death _ shows in the guitar solos of
B.B. King and the comedy of Richard Pryor.
</P>
<P>
   In all these cases, the quality that transcends pop is soaked
thoroughly into the sound. Like a hologram, which you can scissor
into many pieces and each contains the whole image, you can slice
up a Ray Charles song or a B.B. King guitar lick and the whole of
humanity is in every sliver, complete and undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   When you hear something so human, you recognize instantly its
status as art. Most pop is merely commercial and, no matter how
catchy the tune, it comes and goes quickly, with no more lasting
influence than yesterday's newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   In an age that likes to downplay the difference between high and
low art, it is important to recognize the difference. Too often,
anyone who makes that suggestion is accused of being a snob and an
elitist.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a difference between those things that entertain us
and those that make us recognize and feel our own humanity, that
open us up to the wider world of thoughts and emotions. And despite
the reigning egalitarianism, one has more (begin ital) value (end
ital) than the other.
</P>
<P>
   A snob is someone who believes one thing is better than another
for the wrong reasons. But what do you call it when you recognize
the right reasons?
</P>
<P>
   A snob believes that money or birth or style makes one form of
art better than another. But it is not money or style that makes
something better.
</P>
<P>
   It is quality, authenticity, genuineness: Mozart at his best had
it and Ray Charles at his best has it. Style has nothing to do with
it.
</P>
<P>
   Which is why Ray Charles could sing country and Western, and why
Willie Nelson could sing ``Stardust.''
</P>
<P>
   For style is merely the vessel the humanity pours into. And it
is the humanity that makes it art, not the style. &QL;

JAILS AS PRIME WINTER VACATION SPOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The woman had set up the trip in August, working
through a travel agent. She and her husband teach school. They have
off the same week in February. Unfortunately, the package they'd
signed up for hadn't been at all what they'd planned.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel had turned out to be in a rotten section of San Juan,
Puerto Rico, in a relatively rough urban neighborhood that had
scared hell out of both of them. The room had come with an entire
civilization of burly, tropical bugs as roommates.
</P>
<P>
   She wanted me to write a column about how unreliable travel
agents can be, about how she and her husband had spent hard-earned
money on this long-awaited winter vacation, and the vacation had
been a depressing disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   I did feel sorry for her. It really was a shame that the
vacation hadn't lived up to her expectations and her husband's.
Still, you can't feel too sorry for people who can afford a winter
vacation with sun, surf and palm trees. I've seen too many people
who can't even dream of getting out of this icy part of the world
in February.
</P>
<P>
   Unless, that is, your idea of a vacation getaway involves steel
bars and jail guards in uniforms.
</P>
<P>
   I'll let you in on a little secret about northern cities like
Albany. The police know about it, and so does everybody else with
any experience with the criminal justice system. That secret is
this:
</P>
<P>
   In cold weather, a certain percentage of the residents of any
local jail are people for whom doing time constitutes a winter
vacation. The rest of the year, they're on the street. When the
weather gets grim, a clean bed, three squares a day and a heating
system that doesn't involve setting fire to something or somebody
can look pretty appealing.
</P>
<P>
   For some street people, a few nights of sub-freezing
temperatures means it's time for a little minor crime _ some boozy,
nonviolent disorderly conduct. Hey, they have cable television in
the can.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Keegan, now a justice of the New York Supreme Court, spent
16 years sitting in the Albany Police Court. He doesn't recall the
incident, but a cop I know was in his courtroom some years ago when
a hooker came up on a disorderly conduct beef. Thirty days, said
the judge. ``Hell,'' said the hooker. ``I can do that standing on
my head.''
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' Keegan said. ``Sixty days.''
</P>
<P>
   The hooker beamed. ``Thank you, Judge.''
</P>
<P>
   A street guy known as Michael the Archangel used to specialize
in going to sleep atop the statue of Moses in one of the city's
parks. When the cops spotted him, that was a direct ticket to the
can. Michael the Archangel has straightened out in recent years.
When last heard from, he was working in a flower shop.
</P>
<P>
   But George Flannery is in the can now, just as he was a few
winters ago. He's a good-natured guy of 46 who drinks a bit and
doesn't live any place on a regular basis. I dropped by to see him
at the Albany County Jail the other day. It's boring there, he told
me, except when the TV is on. George will be out in early July.
He's planning to hitch a ride to Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd better get there before winter,'' I advised him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I plan to,'' George Flannery said.
</P>
<P>
   I do feel sorry for the lady whose trip to Puerto Rico didn't
work out. But I feel sorrier for a street guy named Cornelius. One
January day some years back, hoping to land in jail or even in the
hospital, Cornelius sacked out in the intersection of Washington
Avenue and Quail, as he'd done for years, waiting for the cops to
show. A car rolled over him and killed him.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's what I call a bad trip.

 DiMAGGIO DESERVES A FITTING MEMORIAL IN HIS HOMETOWN  
 Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Everybody has a DiMaggio story, even my dad, who
used to play golf with Joe's brother Dom, a great player for the
Boston Red Sox who always suffered by comparison with the Yankee
Clipper.
</P>
<P>
   They're talking about Joe on Cape Cod, in Iowa and in Cuba. In
New York, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani is talking about naming the West
Side Highway after DiMaggio, probably because Giuliani wants to put
a new Yankee Stadium next to the highway.
</P>
<P>
   All over San Francisco, people are talking about Joe DiMaggio.
What is there to do but name something in San Francisco after the
city's greatest gift to the rest of America? This is a city and a
man well-matched in grace and class.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco could rename the Marina Green, near where Joe
bought his mother a home, DiMaggio Green.
</P>
<P>
   Aquatic Park, near the old DiMaggio stomping grounds of North
Beach and Fisherman's Wharf, could be renamed DiMaggio Park.
</P>
<P>
   Treasure Island could be renamed DiMaggio Island.
</P>
<P>
   City Hall, where DiMaggio married Marilyn Monroe, could be
renamed DiMaggio Hall. That one probably wouldn't go over, even
with the support of all the city's Marilyn fans.
</P>
<P>
   King Street in front of the new ballpark could be DiMaggio
Street. Then you could give directions involving Second and Third
and DiMaggio and Mays.
</P>
<P>
   Pac Bell Park could be renamed for Joe DiMaggio. Maybe Pacific
Bell would agree to give up the name if we all agree to sign up for
their phone service.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, I solicited names for Giants stadiums, and the
names Mays, DiMaggio, O'Doul and McCovey dominated the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   They lost to Pacific Bell, which sent its entry to the Giants
along with a promise of $50 million over 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   We name ballparks after corporations, not heroes.
</P>
<P>
   This is a city of heroes with their names on signs. Former Mayor
George Moscone has a convention center. The San Francisco Chronicle
columnist Herb Caen has Herb Caen Way along the water. Colin P.
Kelly, the first Medal of Honor winner in World War II, has a
street named for him. Lefty O'Doul has a bridge. Willie Mays has
Willie Mays Plaza.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he (DiMaggio) would have wanted anything named
for him. He was pretty private,'' said Dante Benedetti, DiMaggio's
old friend and owner of the New Pisa Restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   I asked Benedetti how he'd feel about naming something after
DiMaggio now that he's dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a great thing,'' he said. ``How do you go
about doing it? He certainly deserves it.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you go about doing it? First you throw out some
suggestions, then in true San Francisco fashion you have a
controversy, and finally you dedicate something that doesn't quite
do justice to the person being honored.
</P>
<P>
   ``There won't be any controversy about this one, except is it
good enough?'' said former Mayor Art Agnos, who had two encounters
with DiMaggio and never will forget them.
</P>
<P>
   Once, as a state assemblyman, Agnos was at the New Orleans Room
of the Fairmont Hotel and reached over to borrow a chair from the
next table.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear this very deep, stern voice saying, `I'm sorry, this
chair is taken,''' Agnos said. ``There he was, staring at me with
that look he must have given every pitcher he ever faced.''
</P>
<P>
   The second time Agnos met DiMaggio was at the Marina Middle
School after the 1989 earthquake. Sherry Agnos, the former mayor's
wife, had the sad task of telling people that their houses were
unsafe and could be entered only for 15 minutes to remove a few
valuables.
</P>
<P>
   There, at the end of the line, was DiMaggio. When Agnos told an
aide to bring DiMaggio to the front of the line, DiMaggio refused,
saying he didn't want special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Mr. DiMaggio, are you over 60?''' Agnos said.
DiMaggio said he was a few years older than that, and Agnos said,
``Well, we're giving special treatment to people over 60 because of
the heat.''
</P>
<P>
   Agnos said DiMaggio chuckled and finally agreed to come to the
head of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was understated,'' Agnos said. ``He knew how to wear his
hero status.''
</P>

Francisco to dimaggio(at)examiner.com. Faxes may be sent to

ENVIRONMENTALISTS STILL FOLLOW AUTHOR ABBEY'S CALL TO ACTION

   PHOENIX - Saving the giant redwoods of California.
</P>
<P>
   Taking cattle off taxpayer-owned arid Western lands.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing development across millions of acres of wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   Banning cars from portions of Grand Canyon National Park.
</P>
<P>
   Stopping urban sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   When Edward Abbey talked about these ideas, old ``Cactus Ed''
was considered by many to be radical, a crank, out there, a weirdo
_ and a darn good writer.
</P>
<P>
   His book ``The Monkey Wrench Gang'' helped spawn the Earth
First! movement and was linked to radical eco-terrorists and even
an alleged conspiracy to knock out power lines from the Palo Verde
Nuclear Generating Station west of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years after his death in Tucson, many of the thoughts of
this witty Western writer-philosopher-environmental activist are
mainstream, are happening, are embraced by government officials and
chambers of commerce.
</P>
<P>
   His books are selling faster than ever. Across the nation, they
are used in teaching college literature courses. His official Web
page is run by a woman in Sweden. Music, films and readings of
Abbey's works are scheduled throughout the Valley this week.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists everywhere quote him as often as they once did
the likes of 19th-century transcendentalists Ralph Waldo Emerson
and Henry David Thoreau, or Sierra Club founder John Muir.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed Abbey is really the modern visionary of the environmental
movement, dealing with our very modern problems, which are vastly
worse than Thoreau or Muir could have ever imagined,'' said Kieran
Suckling of Tucson. He is executive director of the Southwest
Center for Biological Diversity, one of dozens of environmental
groups headed up by folks who knew or were inspired by Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I and others had seen Abbey speak _ eloquently and
irreverently _ on many occasions about really just how incredibly
dire our environmental problems are today and the need for new
environmental groups to arise and take on those challenges in a
very uncompromising and passionate way,'' said Suckling, whose
group successfully has sued the government more than 80 times to
obtain protections for dozens of endangered plants and animals in
the Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial aspect of Abbey's writings is his
courting of destructive, even violent, action _ from putting sugar
in bulldozer gas tanks to spiking trees to plans for blowing up
Glen Canyon Dam.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of legitimized that sort of conduct, especially for
newcomers (to the West),'' said Dave Skinner, a spokesman for
People for the USA, a Pueblo, Colo., group that advocates mining,
logging, ranching and oil drilling on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Skinner, who has read Abbey, describes his books as fun, but
worries that they are taken too seriously by ``cranks,'' who go out
and actually ``monkey wrench,'' or sabotage, developments.
</P>
<P>
   In October, an obscure group, the Earth Liberation Front,
claimed responsibility for torching buildings and chairlifts in
Vail, Colo., the nation's busiest ski resort. The $12 million in
damage is believed to be the costliest act of eco-terrorism _ a
crime committed to save nature _ in the nation's history.
Mainstream environmental groups denounced the arson, which was done
in protest of the loss of habitat for the endangered lynx.
</P>
<P>
   Monkey wrenching is not new. There is a history of overt
activism in industrial nations that stems from early-19th-century
England, when Ned Ludd and other ``Luddites'' smashed new
labor-saving textile machinery in protest against unemployment and
reduced wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is fundamentally against everything I was raised
to believe,'' Skinner said. ``I love the West as passionately as
Abbey did, but I like folks, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I especially treasure is being able to show up at a
farmstead somewhere, learn a little and leave with guarantees of a
full belly next trip. It's getting harder to pull that off anymore.
That open handshake (among rural Americans) is fast turning into a
closed fist.''
</P>
<P>
   Skinner said he believes Abbey poisoned the political atmosphere
by advocating no compromises.
</P>
<P>
   But Nancy Zierenberg, who helped found Tucson's Wildlife Damage
Review, a group that rails against government extermination of
predators, said Abbey's writings purposely were rough-edged and
provocative.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were designed to tweak everybody. He said stuff on
purpose to get people mad, and make them think about why they were
mad,'' said Zierenberg, a former staff member of the Earth First!
magazine, which bills itself as ``The Radical Environmental
Journal.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people can write beautiful words. But Abbey was a
real thinker, and he translated that in his writings to make people
think about what they're doing and what they believe,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object of monkey wrenching is not to hurt any life, people
included. The object is to bring attention to the issue, or to make
something cost so much money that the corporation will abandon the
destructive effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew him say that Abbey endures because his own
personal experiences were steeped in the variety, the
contradictions and the lifestyles of the West.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Paul Abbey was born in 1927 in a small Pennsylvania town,
the eldest of five children. His father, Paul Revere Abbey, was a
noted anarchist, atheist and teetotaler. His mother, Mildred
Postlewait, played piano in church and taught her son classical
music and literature.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Abbey served as a military policeman in Europe at the end
of World War II. He attended a Pennsylvania college and the
University of Edinburgh and Yale, but received his graduate and
postgraduate degrees at the University of New Mexico in
Albuquerque.
</P>
<P>
   When he wasn't writing books, he worked as a ranger for the
National Park Service. He was a social worker and a fire lookout in
the forests. He wore cowboy clothes and lived in isolated rural
areas of Arizona and Utah. His friends say he showed his sympathy
for the decline of traditional Western lifestyles in his novel
``The Brave'' ``Cowboy,'' which later was made into the highly
acclaimed movie ``Lonely'' ``Are the Brave'' (1962), starring Kirk
Douglas.
</P>
<P>
   Abbey wrote 22 books, fiction and non-fiction. But among his
best known is one of his first, ``Desert Solitaire'' (1968), which
is required reading in English Professor Dick Kirkpatrick's
Southwest literature course at Mesa Community College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ed has been an integral part of the course from Day One. I've
yet to have, in 20 years, anyone walk away from reading Abbey and
have no opinion,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkpatrick and others said they see the influence of Abbey in
recent efforts to rein in growth, to save the Sonoran Desert around
Phoenix and Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect he has a tremendous influence, even on people who
have no idea who . . . Ed Abbey is. Even politicians now recognize
that we're dealing with finite resources,'' said Kirkpatrick, who
annually invited Abbey to speak to his students.
</P>
<P>
   ``His detractors would always come in loaded for bear. They
would take him to task on the credibility of something. He loved
that sort of challenge. He never backed down from it. He always did
it with great humor,'' Kirkpatrick said.
</P>
<P>
   It's Abbey's humor that environmental activists say keeps them
motivated; keeps them from becoming too angry, or burning out. And
it's Abbey's humor that keeps new readers flocking to his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too few people who can take life seriously, and still
laugh about it,'' said Charles Bowden, also a Western writer from
Tucson, who was a close friend of Abbey.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't like he was out of step. He was just a little
further down the trail than some of us. You've got to give the guy
credit. He died without any money, and yet the Barry Goldwaters of
the world ended up talking like Ed Abbey.''
</P>
<P>
   Theresa Kintz, an editor for the Earth First! journal in Eugene,
Ore., said the abiding theme in Abbey's work is total commitment to
preservation of what is left of the natural world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the whole idea of someone's passion for wild nature, the
passion Abbey had for wild nature and how good he was at
communicating that,'' said Kintz.

BLOOD FROM UMBILICAL CORDS OFFERS LIFESAVING POTENTIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Sue Tighe wanted to donate her newborn's
umbilical cord blood for good use. ``Otherwise it just goes down
the drain, so why not bank it?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Tighe, who had her son in December, was talking about one of the
newer innovations in transplant science.
</P>
<P>
   Blood taken from a newborn's discarded umbilical cord offers a
dense concentration of stem cells _ the same stuff found in bone
marrow, the manufacturing center for healthy blood cells.
</P>
<P>
   Although the transplant procedure is still new, cord blood has
been used successfully in place of donated bone marrow to treat
cancer patients dying of leukemia and other diseases that affect
the blood.
</P>
<P>
   Yet cord blood is also prompting some controversy. Along with
the recent development of community banks to accept cord blood
donations from people like Sue Tighe, others are offering a private
banking system for parents.
</P>
<P>
   For thousands of dollars, parents may now bank their newborn's
cord blood in the off chance the child develops a life-threatening
blood disease. Some health experts are cautioning parents against
such an individual banking system for financial, ethical and
practical reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no real oversight to make sure these companies do what
they'll say they do,'' said Dr. Marquis Hodes, a specialist in
blood diseases and an assistant professor of medicine and
pediatrics at the Albany Medical College in Albany, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   ``The companies that are doing this are marketing it to parents
as a fail-safe against the possibility their child has cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   Scientific evidence, however, shows that cord blood does not
need to be perfectly matched to be effective. So another's cord
blood may work just as well, if not better. And because blood
diseases are relatively rare, there also is the chance that a cord
donated by a newborn would be available for his or her future use
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would encourage anyone who has the opportunity and doesn't
have to pay for it to bank cord blood,'' Hodes said.
``Altruistically, it's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's easy to collect. After the baby's birth, the umbilical
cord is clamped, breaking the link between the baby and the
placenta. A small amount of blood, typically three to five ounces,
is then drained from the cord and taken to a cord bank, where it's
frozen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cord blood increases the options for patients who are looking
for a treatment for their disease,'' said Helen Ng, a spokeswoman
for the National Marrow Donor Program in Minneapolis, which is
hoping to set up a cord blood registry to keep track of donations.
</P>
<P>
   But cord blood has its limitations. Because only a small amount
of blood can be retrieved from an umbilical cord, bone marrow
transplants with cord blood cells have been a treatment option only
for children and those few adults who weigh less than 85 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   And there remains some uncertainty over the long-term effects of
freezing cord blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of unknowns associated with cord blood
transplants,'' Ng said.
</P>
<P>
   Tighe, a secretary at the Albany Medical Center, had hoped her
son's cord blood might help some of the young leukemia patients she
sees every day. Yet she had to give up the idea after learning that
the nearest places to Albany that accept donations are in New York
City and Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Such donations usually come from women who deliver at nearby
hospitals, not one that's three hours away. ``I was trying to do
this great thing and I had no outlet,'' said Tighe, 32.
</P>
<P>
   To date, there are some 16 cord blood banks in the country with
blood from an estimated 14,000 umbilical cords in storage.
</P>
<P>
   Yet physicians and the National Marrow Donation Foundation are
hoping to expand the number of places that accept donations, so
more cord blood may be collected for patients in desperate need of
a transplant.
</P>
<P>
   Considering its lifesaving potential, throwing it away seems
like a waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling among physicians is that cord blood banking for
the general good is a good thing,'' Hodes said.

PARENTAL CONTACT IS VITAL TO CHILD DEVELOPMENT, DOCTORS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (ATTN: Alabama)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SYLVIA WOOD  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Besides the routine physicals and vaccinations,
Dr. Kevin Karpowicz dispenses a lot of parenting advice.
</P>
<P>
   For a newborn, the Schenectady doctor believes nothing is better
than a parent's love and attention to ensure a good foundation for
the child's future.
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds like common sense, you're not too far behind the
last research in infant brain development, much of which builds on
age-old parenting techniques rather than expensive toys or classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't do the Mozart or the flash cards,'' said Karpowicz,
who advises parents with infants less than 2 weeks old to hold
their baby often or wear a baby sling to keep him close. ``We're
not trying to make these infants smarter. We're trying to make them
emotionally secure.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past 30 years, Dr. Craig Ramey, a specialist in child
development and a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, has written more than 200 scientific and
professional articles about child development. He is co-author with
his wife, Sharon, of the new book ``Right From Birth: Building Your
Child's Foundation for Life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1990, we've probably doubled our knowledge about how
babies' brains develop,'' Ramey said from his office in Birmingham.
``Between birth and age 2, about 90 percent of the architecture of
the brain will be laid down.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, thanks to new imaging technology, researchers have
found that by age 3, a child's brain is twice as active as that of
an adult as it experiences the outside world through the senses.
</P>
<P>
   These findings underscore the relatively new concept that an
infant's brain is remarkably unfinished at birth, even though it
has all the building blocks for development, including more than
100 billion brain cells.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is a complex network of connections between those
individual cells, a process of development that's encouraged by
appropriate, positive and frequent interactions with parents or
other caregivers.
</P>
<P>
   With such stimuli, an infant's brain develops trillions of
neurological connections that lay foundation upon which a child
builds a lifetime of skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to 15,000 connections might be made from one cell to
another,'' Ramey said. ``It's the old use-it-or-lose-it theory.''
</P>
<P>
   Such complex neuroscience shouldn't frighten or overwhelm
caregivers, who may wonder if they now need a doctorate to raise a
baby.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey is opposed to the current trend to accelerated learning
programs for very young children. Rather, he emphasizes that
intelligence is developed with proper nurturing and age-appropriate
experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're talking about a baby, flashcards are utterly
worthless,'' he said. ``You really have to engage children with
concrete three-dimensional props.''
</P>
<P>
   Parents are already taking steps to help their baby's
development when they hold them, talk to them, play with them and
respond to their cues, Ramey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the ways children become secure and attached to
caregivers is to have caregivers who are responsive to them,'' he
said. ``You really have to think of it as being a tennis game, or a
dance, or a great conversation where there's a back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For a baby, trusting that someone is going to respond to you is
the foundation of emotional development. The next step for an
infant is realizing that he or she can cause positive reactions in
other people.
</P>
<P>
   According to Ramey, babies who receive repeated opportunities to
do this, through interactive activities like playing, singing and
reading, are more apt to become interested, curious and active
learners in the world around them, now and in the future.
</P>
<P>
   In his new book, Ramey counsels parents against activities that
discourage such positive interplay during a child's first 18
months. His advice:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not park an infant in front of a television, even when
child-oriented, ``educational'' programs are on.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not leave a child where he may be ignored for long periods
of time or where there is no one to play and speak with him or her.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not subject an infant to situations in which the sights and
noises are overwhelming and insensitive to his or her needs.
</P>
<P>
   Ramey urges parents to understand how positive and influential a
role they can play in the development of a baby's brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really clear is that the quality of those early
experiences are vitally important to the short-term and long-term
development of the child,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (How and why emotionally secure babies develop into thinking and
caring children will be the theme of a daylong conference
``Building Baby's Brain'' on March 19 in Albany. The event will
Ramey and other specialists. For information, call 518-426-7181,
ext. 27. The cost of the daylong event, including lunch, is $25.)

LESSONS TO BE LEARNED FROM MA BELL'S SILENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA BASS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DANVILLE, Calif. _ Wednesday is the anniversary of the world's
first phone call. Lines have been busy ever since.
</P>
<P>
   On March 10, 1876, in the course of an experiment in the
extremely new field of telephony, Alexander Graham Bell
successfully transmitted a one-sentence message to his partner Tom
Watson, who was standing next door by a large receiver. It was the
birth of a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   These days, this revolution _ what with the Internet, cell
phones, electronic mail and cable _ has never been livelier or
better publicized (or better hyped). And as the non-stop IPOs,
megamergers and monsterously high price/earnings ratios indicate,
everyone is trying to divine where the industry is going and who
the next winners will be. If the past is a guide, this will be
tough.
</P>
<P>
   Telecommunications has been unpredictable since Bell made his
first connection.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Graham Bell was himself most unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Although as a young man he worked fanatically on the telephone _
first to invent it, then to prove it was his invention _ he later
lost almost all interest in it; he once told his secretary he had
no phone in his study because the ringing was so disruptive.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of his life he regretted that he would be
remembered only because the telephone was a ``money-making
invention.''
</P>
<P>
   Which it certainly was. But the story of how his invention made
money _ eventually, lots _ is itself something nobody could have
predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Bell patented the telephone in 1876. For the next 17 years, Bell
Telephone (later AT&AMP;T) guarded this patent with paranoid zeal.
What's weird is that, although company officials knew the patent
expired in 1893, they elected to do little about it.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of suing people, they did not market aggressively and
made only the mildest effort to ready themselves for the inevitable
competition. When competition came (3,000 phone companies by
1902!), AT&AMP;T lost half its share of the market share.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was even more surprising.
</P>
<P>
   In 1907 Theodore Vail became president of AT&AMP;T. Vail believed
phone service should be universal and excellent. He cut rates,
improved access and insisted operators stop hanging up on
customers. He also believed such service could best be supplied by
only one company _ his. Since AT&AMP;T still owned 50 percent of the
telephone market, this thinking smacked of monopoly, and the
company was threatened with government regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, AT&AMP;T agreed that they should be subject to
government regulation, but for a price: The government should
declare AT&AMP;T a natural monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   A company volunteering for regulation is most unusual; the
average business sees regulation and dives for the aspirin.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, no company ever has had the government hand
over a plum quite so ripe as the one AT&AMP;T received. AT&AMP;T retained a
monopoly in well over 80 percent of the U.S. telephone market, long
distance and local, until 1984.
</P>
<P>
   During this monopoly period, something else unusual happened.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of competition usually results in rising prices, while
innovation stumbles. This didn't occur with phone service; except
during the Depression, basic rates dropped while technology
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, both prices and technology might well have responded
even better to competition _ a tantalizing ``what if''? Still, for
many people, the age of the Bell monopoly remains the ``good old
days'' of phone service.
</P>
<P>
   There is one final twist _ the strange tale of how AT&AMP;T failed
to predict its own market. AT&AMP;T knew from the start that phones
were popular, but it didn't know why.
</P>
<P>
   It envisioned phones being used for practical purposes only _
business phones for business, home phones for crises _ and was
appalled to discover that people also were using their telephones
for gossip and fun.
</P>
<P>
   For 50 years this frivolity mortified AT&AMP;T; it was only during
the 1920s that it occurred to the corporation's managers to
actively encourage lighthearted consumerism. Next time you ``reach
out and touch someone,'' keep that in mind.
</P>
<P>
   On the day of Alexander Graham Bell's funeral in 1922, all
telephone service in the United States was suspended for one
minute. The history of his invention proves it will be hard to
predict who _ or what _ in the future of telecommunications will
inspire such silence. It's a less all of us _ consumers, businesses
and especially investors _ should well remember.

<P>
   WASHINGTON Microsoft and the government remain open to
</P>
<P>
   an out-of-court accord that would resolve their antitrust
</P>
<P>
   dispute, but they remain far apart on the terms.
</P>

   Limiting Microsoft's ability to leverage its Windows market
power into
</P>
<P>
   other emerging sectors, such as Internet commerce, remains a
central aspect of the government's case. Since Microsoft invariably
cites the ability to innovate using the Windows platform as
non-negotiable, that

   issue is not easily prone to a compromise.

   Speculation Microsoft might be willing to strike a deal

<P>
   with the Justice Department and the 19 states that took the
software giant to court in May increased when Intel cut a bargain
in its antitrust case.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Microsoft stock climbed $4.43 3/4 to $163.43 3/4
after the Seattle Times, citing unidentified persons, reported the
two sides are looking for a way to settle the case before the trial
resumes April 12. The Times noted, however, that there is no rush
to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's deal was announced Monday, one day before its antitrust
trial was to have begun. The world's largest maker of computer
chips,
</P>
<P>
   tentatively agreed to settle Federal Trade Commission charges
that it had
</P>
<P>
   used monopoly power to strong-arm customers over patent issues.
</P>
<P>
   As for Microsoft, its stance toward a settlement has been set by
Chairman Bill Gates. Last month, at the World Economic Forum in
</P>
<P>
   Switzerland, Gates said: ``Before the case was filed, we put
every effort into a settlement. But there's a basic principle here:
Are we allowed to make Windows into a better product? It's the key
to our business.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beyond that, sure, we'll enter into a dialogue.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a ``dialogue'' has not yet transpired. If it comes about at
all, it
</P>
<P>
   is unlikely to occur before mid-April when the trial, now in
recess, is
</P>
<P>
   to resume in federal court in Washington. The non-jury trial
began in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still believe we will prevail in court,'' Bob
</P>
<P>
   Herbold, Microsoft's chief operating officer, said Monday at a
news conference at the company's Redmond, Wash., headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think (the Intel case) has an effect directly on our
case,''
</P>
<P>
   added Brad Smith, Microsoft's general counsel for international
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the Intel matter is more closely related to an
earlier Microsoft
</P>
<P>
   antitrust proceeding, which resulted in a 1995 consent decree
over how it
</P>
<P>
   handled its Windows' licenses to hardware vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Smith declined to comment on whether any negotiations were
underway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there were discussions before the antitrust case
was filed a
</P>
<P>
   year ago,'' he noted.
</P>
<P>
   Those brief talks were held between Justice Department antitrust
chief
</P>
<P>
   Joel Klein and William Neukom, Microsoft's general counsel. The
Klein-Neukom negotiating channel is known to remain open.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman said Tuesday that the government
would have no comment on settlement talks.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: A. Sabella's Petrale Sole Catches Compliments   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Petrale sole with lemon butter is a San Francisco
classic that you'll find at all the restaurants that line
Fisherman's Wharf _ and dozens of ones that don't.
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a little tweeking, Michael Sabella of A. Sabella's has come
up with a variation that makes this classic dish even better.
Instead of regular lemon butter, he uses brown butter, which gives
a nutty flavor. Then he sprinkles fried capers over the top, which
adds a briny crunch.
</P>
<P>
   The fish is quickly sauteed and surrounded by spinach accented
with lemon and garlic. Toasted croutons add another unexpected
texture to finish the dish.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant was redone several years ago by well-known
designer Gary Hutton, making it one of the prettiest dining rooms
on the Wharf. Hutton retained some of the 1950s charm and updated
it to a Gucci-meets-the-Jetsons look.
</P>
<P>
   The food is a notch above the competition, too, partly because
of the more innovative preparations of seafood but also because of
the live fish tanks that ensure freshness. It's one of the best
places in San Francisco for fresh crab and lobster.

PETRALE SOLE WITH BROWN BUTTER &AMP; TOASTED CAPERS
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   4 slices French bread, each about 3/8 inch thick, crusts
removed, cut into 3/8-inch dice
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons + 1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 lemons
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon capers, drained and blotted dry
</P>
<P>
   9 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 cup cooked, peeled bay shrimp
</P>
<P>
   4 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 pound spinach, washed and stemmed
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   4 fillets of petrale sole, 7 to 8 ounces each
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons flour seasoned with salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the croutons:  &LR; Toss the bread with 2 tablespoons of the
olive oil until the cubes are evenly coated. Spread the cubes on a
baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until crispy. Remove from
oven and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   Using a sharp knife, cut off skin and all white pith from the
lemons. Then cut segments free from inner membranes. Set the
segments aside in a bowl; discard peelings.
</P>
<P>
   Pour 1/4 cup oil into a small frying pan and set over high heat.
When the oil is hot, add the capers and fry just until the buds
open and the oil stops crackling. Using a slotted spoon, transfer
capers to paper towels to drain.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To make the sauce:  &LR; Melt all but 1 tablespoon of the butter in
a saute pan over medium heat. When the butter turns brown, add the
lemon segments, then the shrimp. Reduce heat to medium-low and
cook, stirring for a minute or two. Reduce heat to the lowest
setting.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To cook the spinach:  &LR; Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon butter in
another saute pan over medium heat. Add the garlic, spinach and
salt. Saute, stirring, until the spinach is wilted and tender. Keep
warm over very low heat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To cook the fish:  &LR; Set a large saute pan over medium-high heat;
add the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Dust the fish fillets
with the seasoned flour, shaking off excess. When the oil is hot,
add the fish and saute until browned and the flesh is no longer
translucent, turning once.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; To serve:  &LR; Spoon the spinach into the center of warmed serving
plates, creating a depression in the middle for the fish. Place the
fish in the center and spoon the sauce over it. Sprinkle with the
fried capers and croutons.

 EDITORS NOTE: Bay Area Classics profiles food-related businesses 
 more than a half century old.  BAY AREA CLASSICS: Corned Beef Company Is No Turkey 
 &HT;       
   
 By Maria Cianci  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  ``E veryone is Irish on St. Patrick's Day,'' says
Jim Dixon, president of Roberts Corned Meats in San Francisco.
<P>
   At this time of year, the small retail shop of his plant swarms
with customers seeking corned beef. ``The whole street is lined
with customers. We sell three times as much corned beef in March as
we do all the rest of the year,'' says Dixon, who provides Bay Area
hotels, restaurants and retail stores with the meat that has become
synonymous in America with St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts is the oldest corned beef company in San Francisco and,
says Dixon, the fourth generation at the helm, the best. A lot of
other businesses must think so, too. Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco
has been a customer for 42 years, Lefty O'Douls at Union Square for
35 years. And the San Francisco Fire Department is staunchly loyal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fire department buys two pounds per person,'' Dixon says.
A normal serving, before cooking, is one pound.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts corns choice briskets, for the most part, using a simple
cure without garlic or phosphates. The recipe is ``absolutely the
same one that G.H. (his great grandfather, the founder) used,''
Dixon says. And, the brine is still injected into the meat, a
mechanized version of the method G.H. pioneered in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before then, they used to soak the meat for 30 days, which
made it very salty,'' says Dixon. Brine injection cuts the cure
time to two days and cures the meat more thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   The Roberts story begins in 1910 when George Henry Roberts, a
New Zealander and connoisseur of music, left his homeland to escape
the family corned meats business. He relented after arriving in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Believing his family's method of injecting the meat to be
superior to the soaking method used in the U.S. at the time, he
went into business to prove himself with a better product. He
rented basement space from the Schweitzer Meat Co. and sold to the
Presidio and hospitals, Dixon says. By 1915, Roberts moved his
business to a building he purchased on Bryant between Eighth and
Ninth streets, and has been there ever since.
</P>
<P>
   San Franciscans may remember the company's original ``Turkey
Brand'' label, a puzzling name for corned beef.
</P>
<P>
   The story goes that in Roberts' early business days, sailors
arrived in San Francisco sick from a lack of fresh vegetables after
having been at sea for months. They traded hunks of their highly
salty beef and pork provisions to the Italians and Irish for
vegetables from their gardens. These working-class San Franciscans,
many of whom weren't able to afford the customary turkey for Sunday
dinner, got a hankering for the taste of salted meat. Roberts
christened his corned beef ``Turkey Brand,'' thereby hooking into
the perception of a high-end Sunday dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgically, Turkey Brand is still associated with the
company, but in the early 1980s, the company patented Shamrock
Brand to replace it. ``Turkey was too confusing,'' says Deborah
Dixon Ward, vice president of sales and fifth generation of Dixons
in the family business.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Roberts corns about 70,000 pounds of beef a month as well
as a small amount of fresh leg of pork. Corned pork can be cooked
in the same way as corned beef, simmered in water for about three
hours.
</P>
<P>
   The Dixons swoon over glazed corned beef and pork. After
simmering, the beef or pork is baked with a sugar-mustard glaze so
every bite has a tangy-sweet hint. The recipe is on the company's
label.
</P>
<P>
   Retail markets carrying Roberts corned beef include Mollie
Stone's throughout the Bay Area; Apple markets in Novato and
Moraga; United Markets in Marin; and Falletti's Foods in
Burlingame. Wholesale customers include Joe's restaurants
throughout the Bay Area; St. Francis Hotel, Mel's Drive-In and
Sears Fine Foods restaurant, all in San Francisco; Brothers
Delicatessen and Restaurant in Burlingame; and Brennan's in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Jim toys with the idea of retirement in a few years, and if so,
Deborah will continue to run the business, perhaps with her
brother, Gregory, now in college. If the Dixons have anything to do
with it, the Irish-American tradition of corned beef and cabbage
will have a local source for many years to come.

 Monday Night Wines:  
 Some value-priced imports let you sip well every day   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Strolling the aisles at wine shops these days can
make a working-class wine lover cry. Zinfandels at $15, Chardonnays
at $20 and Cabernets at $30 line the shelves _ but where is a
decent, affordable bottle for Monday night's meatloaf?
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a strong economy fueling demand and some small California
harvests crimping supply, wine prices aren't what they used to be.
As one Sonoma County vintner said when announcing a price increase
to a local retailer, ``We can sell everything we make at $7.99, or
we can sell everything we make at $12.99. You make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who would like to put a bottle, or at least part
of a bottle, on the table most nights, these high prices can pinch.
But Bay Area retailers insist that they still carry modestly priced
``Monday night wines'' and that customers who are willing to
consider unfamiliar brands and blends still can drink pleasantly
for a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of wines in that (under $7) price range,'' says
wine industry consultant Eileen Fredrikson. ``There just aren't a
lot of coastal Chardonnays and Merlots in that price range.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's retailers have to look farther afield for bargains _ to
Chile, Argentina, Spain, Portugal and France's Languedoc region,
for example. They have to skim the cream carefully from
California's Central Valley, tasting to find the gems from this
less-distinguished grape-growing region. And they have to be
willing to hand-sell wines that their customers _ and sometimes the
retailers themselves _ don't recognize and often can't pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Les Blanches Fumees from the Pays d'Oc (France) for
$6.99 a bottle,'' says Wilfred Wong, a wine buyer for Beverages &AMP;
More. ``It's a good bottle of wine but you have to lead people to
it. It doesn't fly off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers searching for bargain wines to have
with a weekday takeout dinner should keep expectations modest.
Often made with grapes grown in hot climates and rarely stored in
oak, inexpensive wines typically lack the complexity and depth of
flavor that more costly wines can have. At their best, they are
clean _ without obvious flaws _ and fresh, with some clear fruit
character.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers agree that today's values can increasingly be
found among the imports. Bargains seldom come from the prestigious
Napa and Sonoma valleys, where planted vineyards can cost more than
$40,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Grape prices in the two valleys have soared in recent years, in
part because of phylloxera-induced shortages and strong demand, and
in part because there is simply not much more good land to plant.
In just the past two years, reports the California Department of
Food and Agriculture, the value of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes has risen 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, jostling for status _ equating top quality with top
dollar, as with so many consumer goods _ has kept prices climbing
as vintners try to match or exceed the price of their competitors'
wines. Some California wine fans on limited budgets have had
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get refugees from that market who just can't handle it
anymore,'' says Morgan Miller, whose Odd Lots Wine Shop in Albany
exclusively sells inexpensive imports. ``They may have a California
palate, but prices have gotten to the point that they're starting
to experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller typically has eight to 10 selections at about $5 a bottle
and rarely sells a wine for more than $10. Distributors bring him
wines that they can't find a home for elsewhere and he cherry-picks
the best, knowing that his customers won't flinch at the
unfamiliar. A mixed case of wine from Odd Lots might include
Spanish, Chilean, Italian and Rhone bottlings as well as
little-known Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   At Beverages &AMP; More, a display of ``Hot Buys'' offers shoppers
more than two dozen wines under $10. At San Francisco's Jug Shop,
Jack Hecker puts his best buys in a corner labeled ``Jed's Top
Ten'' to draw customers to pleasant everyday wines with low name
recognition. The store also holds an annual comparative jug
tasting, with voting by consumers and critics. Last year, a 1996
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Zonin (see related story) upset the
usual winner R.H. Phillips Mistura from California, made from a
blend of Rhone grape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mill Valley's well-heeled residents seek out these
lesser-known but well-priced wines, says Jim Canepa, a manager at
the upscale Mill Valley Market. ``Five years ago, we hardly ever
sold wine out of Chile or Argentina,'' he says. Now he has three
Chilean wines, all under $7.99, prominently displayed in his
grocery department. ``That's the kind of price range that people
buy everyday for themselves,'' says the merchant. ``Instead of
buying a jug, they're buying a $6.99 Merlot from Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   Canepa is right about jug wines. Sales of jugs have headed south
as sales of varietal wines in 750-milliliter bottles have
increased. Increasingly, Fredrikson says, consumers have moved away
from the generic wine that fills most jugs and toward more
flavorful varietal wines such as Chardonnay or Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   For James Arthur Field, an Orinda wine lover who launched his
own jug-wine label 23 years ago, that obsession with varietals is a
nemesis. Field sells 35,000 cases a year _ 30,000 in the Bay Area
alone _ of his two James Arthur Field wines, inexpensive red and
white table wines in 1.5-liter bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible battle,'' says Field. ``My biggest challenge
is overcoming the predisposition of the public to pay attention to
what's on the label, not to what's in the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Field has managed to hold on to what he admits is
an ``amazing niche,'' an audience of Bay Area drinkers who ignore
his wine's lack of status. Made from Central Valley grapes, the
white is French Colombard, the red is Ruby Cabernet. The two wines
are bottled in Healdsburg and delivered to restaurants and stores
by the owner himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Field filled his half-gallon jugs with bulk
wine from Sonoma County. But by the mid-1980s, like other low-cost
producers, he was forced to turn to the Central Valley, where the
hot weather tends to yield fruit with cooked flavors. By that time,
Field claims, better equipment and technology had made it possible
to produce respectable wine from Central Valley grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his most loyal fans are in Berkeley. ``I used to say, `If
I could clone Berkeley people, I could triple my business.'
Berkeley people, you cannot fool them. They know what they're
eating and drinking and to hell with labels.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fredrikson, a few other brands have managed to
thrive without varietal identity _ wines such as Spaghetti Red and
Spaghetti White, two blends made by Alan Haywood, son of a Sonoma
vintner; Prosperity Red and Prosperity White made by Firestone
Vineyard; and Hangtown Red from Boeger Winery. ``These are
delightful, fun wines that people are enjoying tremendously at
reasonable prices,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the breathtaking prices on many wines,
supermarket scanner data indicate that the average price paid for
wine in supermarkets is just $4.13 a bottle. (The calculation
includes generic jug wines by converting total volume sales into
750-milliliter bottles.)
</P>
<P>
   Varietal wines sold in supermarkets aren't much more expensive.
According to recent data from Nielsen WineScan, the average
Chardonnay is $6.37 and the average Cabernet Sauvignon is $6.80.
``That tells you that you can find good, everyday varietal wines at
$5 to $7 rather readily,'' Fredrikson says. ``When you're talking
about wines that people have every day, generally they are
purchased while people shop for food. So these (supermarket data)
really give the clearest picture of what people are drinking every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets may be the primary source for most shoppers'
everyday wine, but at least one other retailer sees opportunity in
the value category. Last November, 7-Eleven stores began offering
an expanded selection of moderately priced wines from producers
such as Kendall-Jackson, Fetzer, Beringer and Korbel. The average
store only sells about 10 bottles a day now, but management hopes
to triple that. And with 3,200 stores, the chain's wine program
could have impact. ``When you have the number of stores we have, 30
of anything starts adding up,'' says Dennis Phelps, the chain's
national manager for alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most positive things that's happened to
wine in a long time,'' Fredrikson says. ``Suddenly, instead of a
guy stopping in after work and picking up a Slurpee, a bagel and a
sixpack, there's a nice, well-edited bunch of national (wine)
brands there.''
</P>
<P>
   For wine advocates who would like to see more wine poured as a
Monday-night beverage, 7-Eleven's new program holds promise. Now

 Monday Night Wines:  
 Some value-priced imports let you sip well every day   By Janet Fletcher  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Strolling the aisles at wine shops these days can
make a working-class wine lover cry. Zinfandels at $15, Chardonnays
at $20 and Cabernets at $30 line the shelves _ but where is a
decent, affordable bottle for Monday night's meatloaf?
<TEXT>
<P>
   With a strong economy fueling demand and some small California
harvests crimping supply, wine prices aren't what they used to be.
As one Sonoma County vintner said when announcing a price increase
to a local retailer, ``We can sell everything we make at $7.99, or
we can sell everything we make at $12.99. You make the call.''
</P>
<P>
   For consumers who would like to put a bottle, or at least part
of a bottle, on the table most nights, these high prices can pinch.
But Bay Area retailers insist that they still carry modestly priced
``Monday night wines'' and that customers who are willing to
consider unfamiliar brands and blends still can drink pleasantly
for a pittance.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of wines in that (under $7) price range,'' says
wine industry consultant Eileen Fredrikson. ``There just aren't a
lot of coastal Chardonnays and Merlots in that price range.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's retailers have to look farther afield for bargains _ to
Chile, Argentina, Spain, Portugal and France's Languedoc region,
for example. They have to skim the cream carefully from
California's Central Valley, tasting to find the gems from this
less-distinguished grape-growing region. And they have to be
willing to hand-sell wines that their customers _ and sometimes the
retailers themselves _ don't recognize and often can't pronounce.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a Les Blanches Fumees from the Pays d'Oc (France) for
$6.99 a bottle,'' says Wilfred Wong, a wine buyer for Beverages &AMP;
More. ``It's a good bottle of wine but you have to lead people to
it. It doesn't fly off the shelf.''
</P>
<P>
   For their part, consumers searching for bargain wines to have
with a weekday takeout dinner should keep expectations modest.
Often made with grapes grown in hot climates and rarely stored in
oak, inexpensive wines typically lack the complexity and depth of
flavor that more costly wines can have. At their best, they are
clean _ without obvious flaws _ and fresh, with some clear fruit
character.
</P>
<P>
   Most retailers agree that today's values can increasingly be
found among the imports. Bargains seldom come from the prestigious
Napa and Sonoma valleys, where planted vineyards can cost more than
$40,000 an acre.
</P>
<P>
   Grape prices in the two valleys have soared in recent years, in
part because of phylloxera-induced shortages and strong demand, and
in part because there is simply not much more good land to plant.
In just the past two years, reports the California Department of
Food and Agriculture, the value of Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon
grapes has risen 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, jostling for status _ equating top quality with top
dollar, as with so many consumer goods _ has kept prices climbing
as vintners try to match or exceed the price of their competitors'
wines. Some California wine fans on limited budgets have had
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get refugees from that market who just can't handle it
anymore,'' says Morgan Miller, whose Odd Lots Wine Shop in Albany
exclusively sells inexpensive imports. ``They may have a California
palate, but prices have gotten to the point that they're starting
to experiment.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller typically has eight to 10 selections at about $5 a bottle
and rarely sells a wine for more than $10. Distributors bring him
wines that they can't find a home for elsewhere and he cherry-picks
the best, knowing that his customers won't flinch at the
unfamiliar. A mixed case of wine from Odd Lots might include
Spanish, Chilean, Italian and Rhone bottlings as well as
little-known Bordeaux.
</P>
<P>
   At Beverages &AMP; More, a display of ``Hot Buys'' offers shoppers
more than two dozen wines under $10. At San Francisco's Jug Shop,
Jack Hecker puts his best buys in a corner labeled ``Jed's Top
Ten'' to draw customers to pleasant everyday wines with low name
recognition. The store also holds an annual comparative jug
tasting, with voting by consumers and critics. Last year, a 1996
Montepulciano d'Abruzzo from Zonin (see related story) upset the
usual winner R.H. Phillips Mistura from California, made from a
blend of Rhone grape varieties.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mill Valley's well-heeled residents seek out these
lesser-known but well-priced wines, says Jim Canepa, a manager at
the upscale Mill Valley Market. ``Five years ago, we hardly ever
sold wine out of Chile or Argentina,'' he says. Now he has three
Chilean wines, all under $7.99, prominently displayed in his
grocery department. ``That's the kind of price range that people
buy everyday for themselves,'' says the merchant. ``Instead of
buying a jug, they're buying a $6.99 Merlot from Chile.''
</P>
<P>
   Canepa is right about jug wines. Sales of jugs have headed south
as sales of varietal wines in 750-milliliter bottles have
increased. Increasingly, Fredrikson says, consumers have moved away
from the generic wine that fills most jugs and toward more
flavorful varietal wines such as Chardonnay or Merlot.
</P>
<P>
   For James Arthur Field, an Orinda wine lover who launched his
own jug-wine label 23 years ago, that obsession with varietals is a
nemesis. Field sells 35,000 cases a year _ 30,000 in the Bay Area
alone _ of his two James Arthur Field wines, inexpensive red and
white table wines in 1.5-liter bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrible battle,'' says Field. ``My biggest challenge
is overcoming the predisposition of the public to pay attention to
what's on the label, not to what's in the bottle.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Field has managed to hold on to what he admits is
an ``amazing niche,'' an audience of Bay Area drinkers who ignore
his wine's lack of status. Made from Central Valley grapes, the
white is French Colombard, the red is Ruby Cabernet. The two wines
are bottled in Healdsburg and delivered to restaurants and stores
by the owner himself.
</P>
<P>
   In the early days, Field filled his half-gallon jugs with bulk
wine from Sonoma County. But by the mid-1980s, like other low-cost
producers, he was forced to turn to the Central Valley, where the
hot weather tends to yield fruit with cooked flavors. By that time,
Field claims, better equipment and technology had made it possible
to produce respectable wine from Central Valley grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his most loyal fans are in Berkeley. ``I used to say, `If
I could clone Berkeley people, I could triple my business.'
Berkeley people, you cannot fool them. They know what they're
eating and drinking and to hell with labels.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fredrikson, a few other brands have managed to
thrive without varietal identity _ wines such as Spaghetti Red and
Spaghetti White, two blends made by Alan Haywood, son of a Sonoma
vintner; Prosperity Red and Prosperity White made by Firestone
Vineyard; and Hangtown Red from Boeger Winery. ``These are
delightful, fun wines that people are enjoying tremendously at
reasonable prices,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, despite the breathtaking prices on many wines,
supermarket scanner data indicate that the average price paid for
wine in supermarkets is just $4.13 a bottle. (The calculation
includes generic jug wines by converting total volume sales into
750-milliliter bottles.)
</P>
<P>
   Varietal wines sold in supermarkets aren't much more expensive.
According to recent data from Nielsen WineScan, the average
Chardonnay is $6.37 and the average Cabernet Sauvignon is $6.80.
``That tells you that you can find good, everyday varietal wines at
$5 to $7 rather readily,'' Fredrikson says. ``When you're talking
about wines that people have every day, generally they are
purchased while people shop for food. So these (supermarket data)
really give the clearest picture of what people are drinking every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets may be the primary source for most shoppers'
everyday wine, but at least one other retailer sees opportunity in
the value category. Last November, 7-Eleven stores began offering
an expanded selection of moderately priced wines from producers
such as Kendall-Jackson, Fetzer, Beringer and Korbel. The average
store only sells about 10 bottles a day now, but management hopes
to triple that. And with 3,200 stores, the chain's wine program
could have impact. ``When you have the number of stores we have, 30
of anything starts adding up,'' says Dennis Phelps, the chain's
national manager for alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most positive things that's happened to
wine in a long time,'' Fredrikson says. ``Suddenly, instead of a
guy stopping in after work and picking up a Slurpee, a bagel and a
sixpack, there's a nice, well-edited bunch of national (wine)
brands there.''
</P>
<P>
   For wine advocates who would like to see more wine poured as a
Monday-night beverage, 7-Eleven's new program holds promise. Now
the chain just needs to train its clerks to know what wine goes
with meatloaf.

world in which being bony is the ultimate beauty ideal, this is the
only heartening feature of their strange, disgusting relationship.

 CHRON   One Cook's Cookie Is Another Cook's Disaster 
 &HT;       
   
 By Kim Severson 
 &HT;     c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;  The recipe for pastry chef David Chesarek's
Oatmeal Walnut Chocolate Chip cookies is fast becoming the most
famous (or infamous) one The Chronicle has published recently.
<P>
   The hoopla boils down to a lot of butter, a little technique and
some very different ideas about how a cookie should look and taste.
</P>
<P>
   We published Chesarek's cookie recipe a couple of weeks ago as
part of a collection of cookies prepared by professional Bay Area
pastry chefs. His recipe builds on a traditional chocolate chip
preparation with a decidedly upscale twist: a lot of butter _ 12
ounces _ and a fairly conservative amount of flour.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, Chesarek said, was to create a cookie with the taste
of a Toll House but the crispy, light character of a French tuile.
The result, at least for some Chronicle readers, was a cookie that
confused.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw his recipe, I was excited because I thought, `He
knows what he's doing,''' said John LaRocque, a practiced home
baker who is known as ``The Cookie Monster'' around his San
Francisco neighborhood. ``But the center was a lump, and the cookie
was thin and spread out like a florentine. It's not pretty, and the
mouth-feel is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray Jaffe, a baker in Napa, Calif., had a similar complaint.
The ratio of flour to butter made the cookies so thin he could
almost see through them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even Chesarek's mother, who lives in Los Gatos, Calif., sent him
an e-mail with questions about the recipe. Her friends had been
calling her to make sure the recipe in the newspaper was correct.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're standing by their mixers and can't understand how
there's 12 ounces butter,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   Chesarek, who last week left the Black Cat to take over as
executive pastry chef at Le Colonial, has a message for the world,
including his mother: Yes, the recipe is right. But there is a
little trick that assures the cookies come out as he intended.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are not supposed to be Toll House. I wanted a crispy,
buttery cookie with those flavors,'' he said. To get the right
result, pat the top of the dough once it's spooned onto the baking
sheet. Chesarek suggests just lightly pressing with your thumb.
That will help spread the chunks of chocolate, oatmeal and nuts to
the edges and assure a more uniform but still delicate cookie.
</P>
<P>
   Also, watch the cookies carefully once they're in the oven. They
can overbake easily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Reader interest in the recipe sent us back to the test kitchen,
where we made the cookies as the recipe directed and then tried
four variations. Each change, even one as subtle as adding a
quarter teaspoon of salt, made a distinctly different cookie. For
example, we found that adding an extra half-cup of flour and a
quarter teaspoon of salt made a more traditional chocolate chip
cookie with a less pronounced butter flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Reducing the amount of unsalted butter by 4 ounces and adding no
additional salt retained the toasty, buttery flavor but allowed the
chips and nuts to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the original recipe and four variations, plus staff
tasting notes. Each of the five versions has its strong points, and
all taste good.
</P>
<P>
   And the whole experience led us to this conclusion: What
constitutes a good cookie is absolutely in the eye _ and the cookie
jar _ of the beholder.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIMS) &QL; 
 &QL; 
VARIATIONS ON A COOKIE THEME &QL; 
 &QL; 
We made the following changes to David Chesarek's original cookie
recipe:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adding 1/4 cup flour. &LR;  This small change did nothing to alter
the toasty, buttery flavor, but it did turn the cookie's texture to
an unpleasant no-man's land between a tuile and a traditional
chocolate chip.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Reducing the butter to 8 ounces. &LR;  Less butter made the cookies
hold together better. Nuts and chocolate, not butter, dominated the
flavor. The cookies were still light and crisp.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adding 1/2 cup flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt. &LR;  The cookies were
markedly different from the originals, tasting much more like
traditional Toll House. The butter flavor was much more subdued.
These cookies took an additional 5 minutes to bake.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Adding 3/4 cup flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt. &LR;  This cookie is
very similar in flavor to the previous one, but it is much
sturdier. It may contain almost too much flour, but it might be a
good cookie for shipping to a college student. Also, it took about
5 more minutes to bake.

 CHRON   COOKS' BOOKS: Irish Recipes Will Make All Eyes Smile  
   
   
 By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Paper shamrocks and green bagels may be sprouting
everywhere as St. Patrick's Day looms, but they hardly capture the
essence of the Emerald Isle. Even the ubiquitous corned beef and
cabbage are little more than a cliche of Irish cooking.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If two new cookbooks are to be believed, today's Irish table
offers a lot more sophistication than this hackneyed combo. Either
book could be a great guide for cooks wanting to explore their
families' Irish roots _ reportedly 40 million Americans have some
ancestral ties to Ireland _ although they differ in approach.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, ``The Irish Heritage Cookbook,'' by Margaret M.
Johnson, an American who grew up in an Irish Catholic community in
Massachusetts, seems the more ethnically pure of the two volumes.
</P>
<P>
   ``West of Ireland Summers: A Cookbook,'' by British television
producer/food writer Tamasin Day-Lewis, goes further afield,
skipping cavalierly from traditional Irish potato dishes colcannon
and champ to ceviche or Poulet Vallee d'Auge.
</P>
<P>
   However, as the subtitle, ``Recipes &AMP; Memories From an Irish
Childhood,'' indicates, this is a very personal book, enhanced by
mood-setting pictures by photographer Simon Wheeler. So the latter
book is more of a read, the former more user-friendly for the cook.
</P>
<P>
   While Day-Lewis's international dishes are intriguing, we were
drawn to her Irish fare _ Christmas pudding, roast turkey with
chestnut stuffing, bread sauce, and an Irish stew that's comfort
food of the first order: lamb cubes supported by a gravy thick from
cooked-to-mush potatoes and barley, with carrots, celery and more
potatoes added in the last part of the cooking process so they are
not mushy.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's traditional approach does not preclude new takes on
old favorites. One of the most successful is cheddar colcannon
torte, a variation on the historic potato and cabbage dish given
the author by the chefs of Shaftesbury Square, a Belfast
restaurant. It layers cubed potatoes that have been tossed in bacon
drippings, blanched cabbage with crisp bacon bits and Irish cheddar
in a casserole that needs only a green salad and maybe a piece of
soda bread to make a sturdy supper.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the soda breads in the two books
demonstrate how this signature Irish bread can come in many guises.
We especially liked the complex flavors of the Heritage version
with eggs, buttermilk, caraway and golden raisins, although
specified baking timesand temperatures were on the low side.
</P>
<P>
   Both books offer plenty of the sort of recipes that evoke images
of eating around a wooden table on a blustery island day _ even if
you've never been within 3,000 miles of a peat fire. They will also
gladden the hearts and palates of all who have, once again, become
enamored of simple but luscious desserts _ Johnson's summer
pudding, rhubarb tart and Irish trifle, and Day-Lewis' peach and
almond crumble tart or black currant ice cream, mousse or fool.
</P>

CHEDDAR COLCANNON TORTE
</P>
<P>
   This is an update of an Irish classic from ``The Irish Heritage
Cookbook.'' If savoy cabbage is not available, one medium head Napa
cabbage may be substituted.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 head savoy cabbage, cored and shredded
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   6 slices bacon, diced
</P>
<P>
   4 baking potatoes, peeled, cut into 1/4-inch slices
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   8 ounces cheddar cheese, shredded (2 cups), preferably Kerrygold
from Ireland
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 400 degrees. Grease a 9-inch pie plate or
tart pan.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, blanch the cabbage in boiling salted water
for 2 minutes. Drain and plunge into cold water. Drain again and
transfer to paper towels to dry.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium skillet, heat the butter over medium heat. Add the
bacon and cook until browned. With a slotted spoon, transfer the
bacon to a bowl and reserve the bacon drippings in the pan. Add the
cabbage to the bacon and toss gently. Sprinkle the potatoes with
salt and pepper and toss in the bacon drippings.
</P>
<P>
   Layer 1/3 of the potatoes in the prepared pan. Sprinkle with 1/3
of the cheese, top with half the cabbage mixture and sprinkle with
another third of the cheese. Add another 1/3 potatoes, the
remaining cheese, then the remaining cabbage mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Top with remaining potatoes. Cover with a sheet of parchment
paper or aluminum foil and bake for 45 minutes. Remove from the
oven and let cool for 30 minutes, or to room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, cut into wedges and serve with a green salad.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 8.

IRISH STEW
</P>
<P>
   Tamasin Day-Lewis writes that this version of Irish stew might
make purists frown, but ``the Irish stew of my childhood always had
barley in it and that's how I like it.'' From ``West of Ireland
Summers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, sliced
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   21/2 pounds small potatoes or chopped large ones, peeled
</P>
<P>
   21/2 pounds boneless lamb slices (such as lamb tenderloin)
</P>
<P>
   1 bouquet garni: 2 bay leaves, 2 sprigs each, rosemary, thyme
and parsley, tied together
</P>
<P>
   5 to 6 cups chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   7 ounces pearl barley
</P>
<P>
   1 pound carrots, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   3 sticks of celery, sliced
</P>
<P>
   A handful fresh parsley, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large, heavy-bottomed casserole and add the
onions, garlic and half of the potatoes. Cook over low heat until
the onions are slightly softened. Add the lamb, bouquet garni and
the stock and bring to a boil. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the barley and simmer for 10 minutes, then add the carrots,
celery, half of the chopped parsley and the remaining potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   Simmer for a further 30 minutes, by which time the lamb should
be tender and the first lot of potatoes and the barley will have
thickened the stew. Season with salt and pepper, add the remaining
chopped parsley and serve in bowls.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 4 to 6.

NOVELIST'S LATEST HAS SCREENPLAY WRITTEN ALL OVER IT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1999 Special to The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   If film adaptations were a measure of a novelist's achievement,
Sue Miller would be successful beyond her wildest dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her first novel, ``The Good Mother,'' was the basis for a 1988
movie starring Diane Keaton and Liam Neeson. Five years later came
``Family Pictures'' with Sam Neill and Anjelica Huston, a
television movie based on her novel about the dynamics of a large,
troubled family. And in 1997, Liv Tyler starred in ``Inventing the
Abbotts,'' a film based on a collection of Miller's short stories.
</P>
<P>
   She signed over rights to each book with equanimity _ ``I've
always welcomed money,'' she says, ``because it buys time for
writing'' _ but she has refused to see any of the films that were
made of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know any writers whose testimony is that the
experience is great fun,'' she says. ``I'm just a very controlling
person. I don't want to see a line spoken differently from the way
I heard it in my head when I wrote it. There are lots of people
involved in a movie, and they'll each see things in a different way
_ the director will, the actor will; there will be so many
possibilities for it to be different that it will have to be. I've
been perfectly comfortable, so far, not seeing any of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, her latest novel might be the most cinematic of
all. ``While I Was Gone'' is the story of Jo Becker, a middle-age
wife and mother whose idyllic life in small-town Massachusetts is
shaken when a man from her past moves to town. Eli Mayhew's sudden
appearance brings with it the seductive pull of memory. It also
introduces something new from Miller _ that most dependable of plot
devices, an unsolved murder. This one was committed 30 years
before, in the shadowy history that Jo and Eli share.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was really the way the book began in my mind,'' Miller
says. ``I liked the idea of a woman whose past included this
episode, and that she was going to be reconfronted with it in some
way. I wanted to explore questions about what is and isn't
forgivable, and about degrees of guilt. Jo is called upon to
forgive a truly terrible thing, while at the same time she does
something terrible herself and needs to be forgiven.''
</P>
<P>
   Novel borrows from current events
</P>
<P>
   Current events played into the path her story took. The O.J.
Simpson trial was in the news when Miller began ``While I Was
Gone,'' and she became fascinated with Simpson's earnest denials of
guilt in the deaths of Nicole Brown and Ronald Goldman.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed to truly believe that he was an innocent person,''
Miller says. ``Maybe he is. I truly believe he's not. There was a
similar case in Boston _ a kid who was convicted of killing the
mother of one of his friends. He never admitted that he did it, and
his parents were adamant that he didn't. Their belief in him and
his need to believe that he couldn't have done such a terrible
thing made him seem very credible, despite DNA and other evidence
that was very, very convincing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a logical extension of our `cult of
self-forgiveness,' if you want to call it that. We all do it about
lesser evils in our lives _ we give ourselves a quick, fast-food
sort of forgiveness because we can't stand to think we are capable
of doing these things. We separate ourselves off from things that
we have trouble integrating into our sense of self. That's true in
varying degrees among the characters in this novel.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller began writing ``While I Was Gone'' after a failed effort
to write a memoir about her father's death of Alzheimer's disease.
She struggled for several years with the project before she fled
back to fiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``By that time I was very worried about myself as a writer,''
she says. ``Non-fiction was new for me, and I was bound to have
trouble with it, but after a few years I felt so terrible that I
just plunged into this novel. The drama of the story was part of
that _ I wanted something that would compel me as much as it would
compel the reader.''
</P>
<P>
   Family interplay rings true
</P>
<P>
   But ``While I Was Gone'' also is graced by Miller's trademark,
her remarkable ear and eye for the understated interplay among
members of a family _ in this case Jo Becker, her husband, Daniel,
and their three daughters. Miller has one son who is now 30, but
she grew up (``the difficult daughter,'' she says) in a family of
two boys and two girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were lots of those sibling scenes that I describe,'' she
says. ``People slamming doors and running away, that kind of thing.
``Family Pictures'' was the most mired in family of all my books.
Sad and terrible things happen in it, but I cautioned myself, when
I was writing it, to make sure it didn't sound like an
overwhelmingly awful life. Because it was a wonderful life in many
ways. That book trained me to write about families. The mother in
it actually says at one point that it's those small moments that
keep us going, the grace notes that embellish our lives and make
them seem beautiful. When they happen, they're worth recording.''
</P>
<P>
   With all of her books, Miller has walked the line between
serious writing and commercial success, sometimes taking critical
flak for the latter. One of two unpublished novels she wrote before
``The Good Mother'' was short on plot and long on literary effort,
she says, ``and I came to see it as weak because of it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about all of the novels I've loved as a reader,
about their depth and texture and how watching the characters walk
around doing things made me see life in a different way,'' she
says. ``But that's the point. They were walking around doing
things. There were scenes on the page.
</P>
<P>
   ``You owe your readers an engaging experience. Your book should
not make itself difficult. I know there are writers who feel very
differently, who say to hell with the reader who won't do an
enormous amount of work to read their stuff. But not me. It's a lot
to ask of people, at this time in our culture, to stop and read a
book. And it's a great privilege to be read, so your work should
justify itself, as Conrad said, word by word.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller herself is a reader. She loves the books of Alice
McDermott, Alice Munro, Ron Hansen and Carol Shields, writers with
whom she empathizes in their efforts to write fiction that
satisfies both themselves and their audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew a woman who compared writing a novel to knitting an
argyle sock the size of a football field,'' Miller says. ``I think
that is very apt. It's just such a struggle to shape it all up. And
then it's published, and I worry about it making its way in the
world. And then I worry about getting another idea. It's always
something.'' &QL;

   ARTICHOKE (Davenport, Calif.) _ This is the rough-hewn far edge
of America that has drawn painters and moviemakers and tourists.

customer, tightly closed and unyielding, more than forbidding

artichoke know just how to slip past its defenses. That's
especially true in San Francisco, where artichokes are as familiar

For a significant number of people, the flesh of this fish acts

GE CHIEF SEES CONTINUED GROWTH FOR BLUE-CHIP GIANT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. _ The General Electric Co. will outperform
the Standard &AMP; Poor's Index this year as it prepares for a change
in its top leadership, according to the company's chairman.
</P>
<P>
   A successor for GE Chairman John F. Welch Jr. is expected to
take over in 2000. But who the next chairman will be is a matter of
speculation. GE Power Systems President Robert Nardelli is
considered to be on the short list of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``We certainly have a luxury of having an enormous pool of
talented people,'' Welch said Monday in a satellite news conference
sponsored by the Wall Street brokerage firm Edward Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Welch is credited with building the company into a $325 billion
international giant. It is GE's recent international acquisitions
in Japan and other countries that are expect to continue to push
the company's profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Having a presence in developed countries such as Japan allows
the company to make the big moves that can produce large rewards
due to regulation, Welch said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The developed countries are the place to be if you're going to
make big bets,'' he said, noting Japan's regulations and energetic
and educated work force.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll outperform the S&AMP;P and the companies in it,'' said
Welch, who wants to match or exceed the 14 percent earnings and
dividend growth rates of the last four years.
</P>
<P>
   GE's global business will play an important role in maintaining
this growth rate. Sales, manufacturing and sourcing of materials
have to be drawn from various countries. Welch described Mexico as
an example of a country that is a great source for products sold by
GE.
</P>
<P>
   Welch also said that the international market will move faster
and that people will have to put aside their aversion to drawing
upon other countries for intellectual investments in products
produced by companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to globalize the intellect of the product,'' Welch
said citing India's wealth of software engineers as a resource.
</P>
<P>
   GE also will see more income from providing services to the
products it and its competitors sell, Welch said. ``Customers
increasingly want to know what is the solution to their problems.''
</P>
<P>
   GE Power Systems, the company's turbine business, is booming
currently. Its U.S. plants, including the one in Schenectady, N.Y.,
are operating at full capacity to serve the U.S. marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   With 40 percent of the world's gas turbine business, GE is now
considering the acquisition of the power generation business of
Alstom SA of Paris. Alstom has about 12 percent of the world's
market.
</P>
<P>
   Being the No. 1 maker of power generation equipment in the world
is in keeping with the GE philosophy developed under Welch of being
one of the two largest companies in any field.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to be No. 1 or No. 2 to survive in an increasingly
global market,'' Welch said.

ALBRIGHT CALLED LACKING IN POLICY FOLLOW-THROUGH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLUM LYNCH  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Madeleine K. Albright climbed the heights of
Washington's foreign policy establishment with a knack for chewing
out dictators, delivering pithy sound bites, and charming even the
most curmudgeonly Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, dictators don't seem to be listening to the
first female US secretary of state. The Republicans she so
assiduously courted, including Senator Jesse Helms, have not
delivered on some key foreign policy items she needed, including
funding for the United Nations. And Albright has been attacked for
lacking the follow-through to fashion durable foreign policy
solutions to back up her blunt one-liner style.
</P>
<P>
   After two years of unrestrained bipartisan admiration, a more
critical reassessment of Albright's record is emerging as an array
of foreign policy crises have stacked up. The once-undisputed
darling of the media is getting bad press. And even some of
Albright's closest allies are privately asking themselves whether
she is in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Albright has handled herself very well in public diplomacy,''
said Joseph Cirincione, the director of the arms proliferation
program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and an
ally of the administration on many issues. ``But in finding
creative solutions to new problems, she is just falling way
short.''
</P>
<P>
   A survey of international crises provides an unsettling view.
The ``strategic partnership'' with China has failed to translate
into greater respect for human rights. The Middle East peace
process has been jeopardized by renewed fighting between Israel and
Iranian-backed rebels in Lebanon. The civil war in Kosovo is
threatening to spoil NATO's 50th birthday party in April. The fate
of Russia's new democracy, ever fragile, appears as uncertain as
ever. And the State Department was unprepared when terrorists
targeted US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   The nuclear arms race has come back to life in the wake of
missile tests in North Korean and nuclear weapons tests in Pakistan
and India. Even Washington's relations with its closest European
allies have been strained by a trade war over bananas.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior US foreign policy specialists say the thorniest
issues _ China, the Middle East peace process and Iraq, arms
control, and missile defense _ have been taken over by President
Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger. Washington's
Asia policy has been dominated by the Treasury Department. And Vice
President Al Gore's national security adviser, foreign policy aide
Leon Furth, has become an increasingly active voice on foreign
policy, according to US officials.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's defenders say the roots of the problem lie elsewhere,
not with her.
</P>
<P>
   She serves a president who pays only sporadic attention to
foreign policy, they say. And she is leading foreign policy in an
era in which the neat strategic symmetry of the Cold War has given
way to an array of complex and intractable troubles that defy easy
solutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The administration has a lot on the table,'' Democratic
Senator John F. Kerry of Massachusetts said in an interview. ``And
these problems are going to beset any administration. It's the
nature of the new diplomacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, Madeleine is doing a very good job in a very
tough climate,'' he added. ``I think the Republicans have been
quite partisan. They are very quick to criticize and not very quick
to offer alternatives.''
</P>
<P>
   Even critics credit Albright with being among the first in the
administration to recognize that US military force would be needed
to end ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. And as US ambassador to the
United Nations, she spearheaded US efforts to create a war crimes
tribunal for Yugoslavia and Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
   Albright also effectively used her personal relationship with
the powerful chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee,
Jesse Helms, to win ratification of the treaty banning chemical
weapons. But Helms has failed to bring along House Republicans on
paying Washington's $1 billion debt to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's efforts to win US backing for two initiatives close
to her heart _ creation of an International Criminal Court and a
treaty banning land mines _ collapsed in the face of intense
Pentagon opposition. More recently, she stumbled in Kosovo, where
Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic ignored, so far without
consequence, a threat by Albright to sign a peace settlement or
face NATO airstrikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not Madeleine's fault that we're facing a rough patch for
foreign policy right now,'' said a senior US official in Albright's
inner circle, adding that she is being held to a higher standard
than her male counterparts. ``That's the nature of the ebbs and
flow of foreign policy.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Clinton administration, critics say, global strategic
considerations take a back seat to domestic policy. And when an
international crisis threatens to spill over to the national
agenda, the president's foreign policy team focuses on achieving a
quick fix _ before moving onto the next crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an administration that has an `in box' for foreign
policy,'' said Ivo Daalder, a former National Security Council
specialist on the Balkans in the first Clinton administration. ``It
deals with the crisis of the day with sufficient attention to get
it into the `out box.' Some issues, like Russia, go into the `too
hard' box.''
</P>
<P>
   While Daalder gives Albright credit for being tough on Bosnia,
he said she stumbled when it came to crafting a long term strategy
for the region after the bombs stopped.
</P>
<P>
   ``The actual policy had to be devised by someone else,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She conveys a mixture of authority and insecurity,'' Britain's
former UN ambassador, Sir John Weston, wrote in a memo to the
British foreign office recounted by Ann Blackman in her biography
of Albright. ``She is not good at devising a detailed game plan for
pursuing broad objectives,'' added Weston, who worked closely with
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's obsession with domestic politics can have
disastrous consequences for foreign policy, say observers. During
the 1996 election campaign, Clinton increased spending on missile
defense research after the issue emerged as a key element of
Republican candidate Bob Dole's platform.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the North Korean missile tests over Japan,
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen announced another $6 billion in
funding for missile defense research.
</P>
<P>
   ``This policy worked politically in 1996 and it will work in
2000,'' said Cirincione. ``But the international consequences are
severe. This all but kills any hope that the Russian Duma will
ratify Start II,'' the still unratified nuclear arms reduction
treaty between the US and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it has spurred weapons development in China,'' he added.
``Our European allies look at us like we are nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Privately, European diplomats say that, personalities aside,
they see little difference between Albright and her predecessor,
Warren M. Christopher.
</P>
<P>
   They complain that American foreign policy is not creative
enough and relies too much on the threat of military action. When
force is threatened and not delivered, as was the case in Bosnia,
Iraq, and Kosovo, it seriously undermines the credibility of the
West and NATO, they say.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, they said, Albright was willing to put her
credibility on the line in the Kosovo talks to bridge what seemed
an unbridgeable gap. But if Albright's gambit was gutsy, it also
was heavy-handed, several European diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is trying to prove she is as macho as Richard Holbrooke,''
one European complained, referring to the American diplomat who
negotiated an end to the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is unapologetic, saying diplomacy backed by the threat
of force is the only thing that despots like Milosevic and Saddam
Hussein listen to and respond to.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, she may be vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have indicated they are prepared to return
to France next week to sign the agreement that would restore
autonomy to Kosovo but would not guarantee an independence

   More importantly, she has been unfailingly loyal to the

people, to bring the message of our foreign policy home.''

THE RED SCARE 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Should China be encouraged to join the World Trade
Organization? The Clinton administration has been maneuvering for
years to bring the world's most populous nation into the 133-member
treaty on tariffs and trade. ``I think it should be out of the
question,'' said Senate majority leader Trent Lott (R-Alabama),
when asked about it Sunday on a morning talk show.
</P>
<P>
   That's the business end of the story about Chinese espionage
that made headlines over the weekend. The New York Times and
Newsweek magazine reported that the Chinese recently had made giant
strides in the miniaturization of their nuclear weaponry, thanks at
least in part to the theft of secrets from the United States during
the 1980s. And while the story looks mainly like the continuation
by other means of the GOP campaign against Clinton, it has serious
implications for the future of both the arms race and global trade.
</P>
<P>
   Some background: During the early 1980s, when Ronald Reagan was
in the White House, the Chinese apparently mounted an extensive
campaign to steal from US weapons shops plans for small nuclear
warheads that otherwise would have taken Chinese scientists many
years and huge sums to perfect. For reasons as yet unexplained, the
Chinese apparently found an easy mark at Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, the theft went completely unnoticed
until 1995, when weapons experts at Los Alamos monitoring Chinese
underground testing discerned some striking resemblances between
the characteristics of a Chinese device and America's latest
design, the W-88 warhead. A couple of months later, CIA analysts
received a copy of a Chinese document purporting to be dated 1988
that mentioned the W-88 by name and described some of its features.
</P>
<P>
   The central figure here is an US Department of Energy sleuth
named Notra Trulock. The department owns the Los Alamos lab;
Trulock was among those charged with policing its secrets. With the
aid of the FBI, he relatively quickly identified a likely suspect:
a Chinese-American computer scientist who had secretly traveled to
Shanghai in 1985. The suspect was still in his job.
</P>
<P>
   Trulock spread the alarm within the complex US intelligence
community with varying degrees of success; some thought he was
overstating the damage. Eventually he enlisted the support of FBI
director Louis B. Freeh and Central Intelligence director George
Tenet.
</P>
<P>
   But when he went to the top _ to National Security Adviser
Samuel Berger in 1996, to then Energy Secretary Frederico Pena in
1997 _ the administration did not act quickly enough to allay his
fears. President Clinton was briefed as well, but continued to
pursue commercial and scientific links with China _ despite being
under GOP fire for having accepted illegal Chinese donations to his
reelection campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point, Trulock's frustrations became known to a
number of Republican legislators. A select congressional committee
was convened, led by Representative Christopher Cox (R-Cal.); the
whistle-blower gave extensive secret testimony; and the rest is
history _ highly classified history. Portions of the committee's
700-page report, completed last fall, apparently are the basis of
much of the story so far.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has to do with the investigators' judgment _ and
their motives. Is Trulock a great detective? Or simply the latest
of a number of Reagan and Bush administration holdovers, including
Secret Service agent Gary Aldrich and White House secretary Linda
Tripp, who have sought to damage a president of whom they
personally disapprove? Did the White House move too slowly at the
beginning of Clinton's second term in responding to news of the
theft? Without a good deal more information, there is simply no way
to form a judgment.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese nuclear capability is not a trivial concern. But there
is a perfectly straightforward approach to the matter. Extend to
Central Intelligence director Tenet the same kind of insulation
from political tampering that has been enjoyed for some years by
Attorney General Janet Reno and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin.
Constructively engage the Chinese on commercial questions and human
rights concern. Bring them into the WTO. Continue working on new
methods of missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   Then hold the next election.

IN CARIBBEAN, DREAM VACATIONS FAN DISCONTENT 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By YVONNE ABRAHAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CASTRIES, St. Lucia _ Early on a Sunday morning, 250 smiling
vacationers cram into a departure lounge at Logan Airport. Within
hours, they will be on the Caribbean island of St. Lucia, joining
conga lines, sipping banana daiquiris, and making return trips to
buffet tables for second slabs of cheesecake.
</P>
<P>
   But their dream vacations will be fanning dark clouds of
discontent over the island, one of dozens of Caribbean locales that
attracted 9 million tourists from the United States last year,
drawn by increasingly inexpensive packages to ``all-inclusive''
resorts _ air, hotel, transfers, meals, drinks, and tips for one
price.
</P>
<P>
   As they settle into their sunnily appointed Club Med rooms,
these guests will be surrounded by St. Lucians who detest the kind
of tourism all-inclusive packages typify: resorts that are islands
themselves, deliberately separate from the life of the tiny nation.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists' sheets will be changed by maids who make as little as
$8 a day, on an island where sneakers cost $75.
</P>
<P>
   Taxi drivers will wait in their cars for hours hoping someone
ventures out of the compound for sightseeing.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurant owners will watch tables sit empty while resort
guests pile their plates high on Mexican Night.
</P>
<P>
   And the residents of shanty towns will see the tourists speed by
in buses on their way to spend money at the island's more
picturesque attractions.
</P>
<P>
   Foreigners spend more than a billion dollars annually on trips
to St. Lucia, but only a fraction, $284 million, ever lands there.
Of that, an estimated $198 million goes right back overseas to
suppliers of luxury goods for the travel industry.
</P>
<P>
   What remains, say many St. Lucians, is just enough to keep them
poor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're killing our country,'' said Stephen Raphael, a taxi
driver whose fares have been curtailed by pre-paid airport
transfers. ``Tourism is our main industry, but with the
all-inclusives, the tourist dollar is circulating only there, and
tourists who come to our country don't see its beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   Every March, high season for winter vacationers, thousands of
New England residents head to St. Lucia. Only the New York area
sends more tourists there each year.
</P>
<P>
   And four out of every five passengers on weekly direct charter
flights from Boston end up at all-inclusive resorts, a kind of
cross between a cruise ship and summer camp that provides
everything from free rum punch at the swim-to bar, to all-day
snorkeling _ all on one property, all for one up-front payment.
</P>
<P>
   These full-service resorts, which are highly profitable and
heavily touted by travel agents who stand to make higher
commissions on sales, have been the fastest-growing sector of the
Caribbean tourist industry since the early 1990s. And St. Lucia, an
island of 238 square miles and a population of 150,000, has a
higher proportion of all-inclusives than any of the other islands:
eight of its 14 major hotels, and about half of its total 3,500
beds.
</P>
<P>
   Because there are so many of them, the all-inclusive resorts
have fueled a bitter debate among locals about the future of the
former British colony. Critics say the all-inclusives give little
back to the islands, make locals feel like visitors in their own
country, and turn St. Lucia into a haven for the kind of tourist
for whom ease is all and location an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could take some of these hotels and put them in the middle
of the ocean somewhere and (the guests) would still be happy,''
said St. Lucian financial analyst Richard Peterkin.
</P>
<P>
   Or at least on any other island. One hotel, eager to meet
guests' expectations despite the realities of nature, shipped in
pristine, brochure-quality white sand from Guyana because St.
Lucia's product was too gray.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the Caribbean has long been a destination sold less
for its islands' particular attributes than for the generic trinity
of sun, sea and sand. And like many poorer destinations, it has
always raised questions among both visitors and islanders about
us-and-them exploitation.
</P>
<P>
   But tensions heightened in St. Lucia with the proliferation of
all-inclusive resorts, said locals.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of that development, some St. Lucians wonder if this
island, which passed between British and French control 14 times
before gaining independence in 1979, has merely exchanged one set
of colonial rulers for another, less predictable kind, staking its
fate on a tourist industry more concerned with its own bottom line
than with the island's future.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see this island, it is beautiful,'' said taxi driver
Thomas Favesh. ``But it's a kind of trap for us.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This past Feb. 22, St. Lucian Independence Day, the Unicorn, a
53-year-old, two-masted brig very popular with tourists here,
dropped its passengers in Soufriere, a poor fishing village, for a
bus ride to the island's renowned sulphur springs, in the bed of a
dead volcano.
</P>
<P>
   St. Lucians sat outside a row of shacks on the waterfront,
beside dinghies with names like Not Much, A Man Must Be Strong, and
Destiny, warily watching the tourists being driven through the
village. Although some tourists do stop in Soufriere, these
visitors, many of whom bought their tours through all-inclusive
resorts, would be back on the boat by lunchtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have tour guides. They have a schedule to follow,'' said
Lily St. Jean, who sells handicrafts at a stall in Soufriere. She
sat under a tarpaulin, crocheting a blanket. ``They keep their
money at the hotels. They're told they don't need it.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Jean says she sometimes goes weeks without selling anything.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of blocks from the waterfront, up a hill and across a
rocky ravine, Stephen Antoine sat in a dank wooden shack, his
soiled purple T-shirt stretched over his bare knees, a bag of
charcoal at his feet, waiting. He said he hoped the crew from the
boat would buy some fuel for their barbecues. But the tourist
dollar rarely penetrates as far as Antoine's home. So far this
year, he has sold a bag and a half of charcoal, earning $13 to
supplement his $30 monthly pension payment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever I get from them, I'm grateful,'' said Antoine, who
did not know his age, but appeared to be in his 60s. ``I take what
they give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Soufriere has been a flashpoint for the tension at the heart of
St. Lucia's tourist industry: The island, with a per capita income
of $3,200, 20 percent unemployment, and little in the way of
government assistance, depends on tourism for its economic future,
but many residents, unable to see how they benefit from it, resent
the industry, especially the all-inclusives.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know for a fact that tourism is bringing millions of
dollars into the country, but not everybody is getting their fair
share,'' said Raphael, the taxi driver, who relies on fares from
the non-all-inclusive hotels to the airport.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the hotel industry's supplies must be imported into St.
Lucia, which is fertile but does not produce food in sufficient
quantities for a large resort. The situation heightens the sense
that the industry contributes little to the island. According to
Price Waterhouse analyst Richard Peterkin, about 70 percent of the
income St. Lucia makes from tourism goes to imports. He emphasized,
however, that the 30 percent that remains of tourism revenues still
provides the island with far more income than agriculture does.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurant owners, taxi drivers and street vendors from the
north to the south of St. Lucia insisted they could capture far
more revenue from the tourist industry, keeping desperately needed
dollars on the island, had not the all-inclusives created enclosed
camps from which tourists seldom venture. But in Soufriere,
residents made their feelings clearer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been a lot of harassment there,'' said Eudes Bourne,
deputy permanent secretary of the Ministry of Tourism. ``People
were going up to the tourists asking if they want to buy this or
that, that they wanted to get something from them as if they were
encroaching on their property. It's a small pocket of resistance,
but it's being addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Industry leaders reject locals' concerns that all-inclusives
limit the benefits of tourism to fewer people. If vendors and
restaurateurs are upset, argued Maria Fowell, deputy director of
the St. Lucia Tourist Board, they should change the way they do
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has changed, and their approach must change,'' she
said. ``The restaurants haven't come together to make a great
dine-around (meal exchange) program with the all-inclusives. And
the other problem is pricing. People are not looking to be ripped
off. If the taxi fare is phenomenal, what's the point of leaving an
all-inclusive to go to a restaurant? People will take a chance only
if they feel they'll get value for money.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 CASTRIES, St. Lucia: ... for money.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The idea of the money not staying here is a myth,'' added Noel
Cadasse, president of the island's hotel association, who owns a
small, traditional hotel in the capital, Castries. ``I don't
measure the all-inclusives' contribution to St. Lucia purely from
what they purchase. Firstly, they pay salaries. And they pay local
amenities. And they purchase a lot locally from farmers. But their
demand for food is great, and you can't tell me I can't import fish
if the St. Lucia Fishing Corp. can't get me the fish I need.''
</P>
<P>
   Tourism employs 11,000 St. Lucians, according to a 1996
government estimate. The upmarket, 600-guest Sandals St. Lucia
resort employs 500 people, most local, said spokeswoman Judy
Deterville. The Odyssey resort, which averages about 900 guests,
employs 460.
</P>
<P>
   But since there is no minimum wage in St. Lucia, salaries vary
widely. At the higher paying resorts _ Odyssey, for example _ maids
earn about $100 a week, plus annual service charges of about
$1,000. Middle-level managers earn about $300 per week. Others pay
much less: At Club Med, in the south of the island, junior maids
make $8 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``What else is there to do?'' asked one Club Med maid who is
trying to support six children. She asked that her name be withheld
for fear of losing her job.
</P>
<P>
   Among more visible Club Med workers _ receptionists, sports
organizers and child care providers _ of whom just one-third are
locals, St. Lucians are paid less than imported workers _ about $85
per week in addition to their room and board. At Le Sport, one of
the island's most expensive but lowest-paying resorts, a bellhop
makes $70 a week. While the bellhop can buy a barbecued chicken
wing by the side of the road for 40 cents, processed food in St.
Lucia is far more expensive than it is in the United States. And
his sneakers cost more than a week's salary.
</P>
<P>
   Conscious of their long-running public relations problems, some
all-inclusives have launched community outreach programs. Some are
more ambitious than others: Club Med, for example, has budgeted
about $6,000 for charitable programs over the next six months, said
its chief, Christian Aubert. Sandals, one of the pricier resorts,
contributed $37,000 to charity last year, said Deterville.
</P>
<P>
   Odyssey, a budget resort opened in 1987 by St. Lucia resident
Bill Stewart, supports the education of 15 local children, and will
offer college scholarships to St. Lucian children starting this
year. Stewart says the resort also works with local farmers,
guaranteeing them sales if they can grow the kind of produce the
resort needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want tourists to come down and be seen as having no
real benefit to the community,'' Stewart said. ``But educating
people isn't easy.''
</P>
<P>
   The St. Lucian government, too, has launched a public relations
campaign to educate schoolchildren about the benefits of tourism,
and to make them more willing to embrace it as important to the
island's future in the wake of its declining banana industry.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But as long as the island is saddled with all-inclusives, there
will be resistance, locals say.
</P>
<P>
   All-inclusives provide ``a pasteurized holiday in a place that
might be a bit menacing,'' said Albert Haman, a Minnesotan who came
to the island 30 years ago and now runs a chain of gift stores.
``Americans like things their way. You go to a foreign destination
but you're protected from it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the more successful chains, Sandals, was founded partly
to keep locals away from the guests, industry officials said. Begun
in 1982 in Jamaica at a time of rising crime rates, the first
Sandals resort was made all-inclusive to protect tourists from
attacks, they said.
</P>
<P>
   When the resorts first came to St. Lucia, they alienated locals
by trying to keep them away from tourists, too, even though the
island's crime rate was far lower than Jamaica's, and public beach
access on the island is sacrosanct.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't need (protection from locals) in St. Lucia. There's
not that negativity here like you get in some islands,'' said Colin
Hunte, who operates a small, traditional hotel near one of the
island's two Sandals resorts. ``The all-inclusives had their
philosophy, and then there was the island's philosophy, and the two
clashed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, after local furor and legal challenges, the resorts
began courting St. Lucians, offering them greater access, although
they sometimes still treat locals with suspicion, searching some
cars as they enter or leave compounds.
</P>
<P>
   And while a few offer island tours, some, like Club Med, make it
hard for vacationers to see the world beyond their fences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear that it's not something they encourage,'' said
Club Med guest Jennifer Mott-Wylie, of Burlington, Vt. ``We were
talking to (staffers) during dinner, and they say it's not easy to
go into town. They said it was dangerous, and it makes you want to
stay right here.''
</P>
<P>
   However, all-inclusives are also more likely to attract guests
who prefer the generic resort to the specific location, said
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm on vacation,'' said Kay Foley, of Neenah, Wisc. ``I'd just
as soon stay in one spot. My biggest worry here is what am I going
to eat and what am I going to drink.'' Foley was wading by the
swim-to bar at Odyssey, drinking a Scotch.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is relaxing, and that's what I came for,'' said
Linda Beattie, of Detroit. ``It's more economical and it seems
safer. You're staying put, and they map everything out.''
</P>
<P>
   That worries residents, who say the all-inclusives have helped
to turn the island into Anyplace, Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   ``What bothers me and other St. Lucians is that we no longer see
tourists who have come here because they chose St. Lucia,'' said
Haman. ``They chose hotels. They're not coming to the island.
They're coming to Sandals.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has lately been taking steps to discourage new
all-inclusives. They provide tax incentives to standard hotels now
_ 15 years free of tax, compared to 10-year tax holidays for
all-inclusives.
</P>
<P>
   Industry experts are pinning their hopes on a new 300-room,
noninclusive Hyatt under construction. The new hotel, they said,
would attract well-heeled tourists who would also be more likely to
explore the island, patronizing local restaurants and stores.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there is another all-inclusive on the drawing board, in
the south. And Sandals St. Lucia is in the midst of a $15 million
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, St. Lucia has limited control over what kind of
developments are built. Because the bottom line, say St. Lucians,
is that this island needs the tourists far more than the tourists
need this island.
</P>
<P>
   ``So many thousands of youngsters have nothing to do,'' said
Georges Noah, a 73-year-old retired printer from the island's
poorer South. ``The bananas can't help them now. T'would be a
pleasure for us to see something else to take (their) place, but
what can we expect besides the tourists? St. Lucia is a poor
country.''

EUROPE: A YEAR PACKED WITH EVENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Americans are heading to Europe in record numbers. And for good
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   This will be a year for great music, a solar eclipse, medieval
events, fine art, royal happenings, a new currency, historic events
including a new capital for Germany, and the opening of Scotland's
own Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The European Travel Commission is predicting more than 11.5
Americans will visit the Continent this year. If this comes true,
it would be a 5 percent increase over 1998, making this the seventh
record travel year in a row for North American visitors. Europe
continues to account for nearly half of all overseas trips by
Americans and more than double the traffic to any other overseas
region, said Joseph E. Buhler of Switzerland, the US chairman of
the 29-nation European Travel Commission.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in tourism can be explained by not only the interest
in Europe but also the growing ease in getting from here to there,
traveling within the Continent, the multitude of tour packages
available, and the bounty of helpful information through guidebooks
and computer-related services.
</P>
<P>
   Boston, for example, now has extensive nonstop air service to
England, Switzerland, Ireland, France, Germany, and Belgium. United
Airlines will begin Boston-London service in April, which will mean
New Englanders will have four airlines flying this route daily _
British Airways has three daily flights.
</P>
<P>
   Still one of the best ways to get around Europe is via rail. The
service is excellent, providing comfortable and reliable
transportation to the heart of European cities. The Eurailpass,
which has provided countless miles of unlimited travel between
nations, has changed, giving travelers more flexibility in their
planning of an itinerary. But giving the rails competition are the
new open skies of Europe, with new discount airlines providing
competitive service between nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cruising in Europe has also made travel there a breeze. Cruises
are one of the easiest ways to discover the countries of Europe.
Ships that travelers are familiar with from Caribbean sailings now
become their European hotel, sailing from nation to nation with
none of the packing and unpacking associated with land tours.
</P>
<P>
   No matter whether you travel by sea or land, there are tour
packages for every budget, every interest.
</P>
<P>
   Even guides to the Continent are making it easier for first-time
travelers _ and even experienced ones _ to not only find their way
around but to really experience Europe at its best. Rick Steves,
who Americans have become familiar with through his popular PBS-TV
series ``Travels in Europe,'' projects that same friendly knowing
travel experience through his guides: ``Rick Steves' Europe Through
the Back Door''; ``Europe 101: History &AMP; Art for the Traveler'';
``Mona Winks' Self-Guided Tours of Europe's Top Museums.'' Steves
also offers a free guide to European railpasses (especially good
considering the number of passes available). Write to Europe
Through the Back Door, Box 2009, Edmonds, WA 98020. New are books
that say it all through their titles: ``First-Timer Europe,
Everything you need to know before you to'' (Rough Guide, $9.95),
``The Complete Idiots Planning Your Trip to Europe'' (Alpha Books,
$16.95). New, too, are CD-ROMs to pop in the computer and guide you
on your way. Choice Way Media offers interactive guides to London,
Paris, and Berlin/Munich. These CD-ROMs offer maps and information
on everything from airline terminals to sights, along with color
photos and videos. The CDs are $39.95 each and come with on-line
updates. For more information, call 408-323-1546 or visit
www.choiceway.com.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there's nothing like being there. Sure you can go to the
movies and see William Shakespeare ``in love,'' but nothing beats
the experience of seeing the places in England where he lived and
worked and hearing his plays as they were first performed 400 years
ago. The British Tourist Authority has lots of information on
experiencing Shakespeare: Call 800-462-2748 Mondays through
Fridays, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., or visit
www.usageteway.visitbritain.com.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's '99 calendar is loaded with special events. Germany
celebrates the Year of Goethe, with Weimar as Europe's 1999
Cultural Capital. Denmark plans a full year of medieval celebration
to prove the Dark Ages weren't so gloomy after all. Britain will
mark the Age of Cromwell. Amsterdam's Van Gogh Museum reopens in
June with more paintings on display. Spain celebrates the 100th
birthday of Ernest Hemingway. Monaco marks the 50th year of the
reign of Prince Rainier.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 11, a total eclipse of the sun will sweep across the
middle of Europe. The moon will block the sun and cast its shadow
on a 70-mile-wide path. The eclipse will take about 90 minutes on
its path from Land's End in England (11:10 a.m.) to Turkey (2:40
p.m.). The total eclipse will take a maximum of 2 minutes, 20
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   There will be great music with Strauss in Austria and Chopin in
Poland. No composer is more closely loved by the Austrians than
Johann Strauss (1825-1899), whose 400 waltzes (including ``The Blue
Danube'') provided the romantic tempo of late 19th-century Europe.
Poland's affection is equally strong for Frederic Chopin. To
commemorate the 150th anniversary of his death in 1849 at age 39,
Poland is staging an International Chopin Year with recitals
throughout the year.
</P>
<P>
   In the world of art, it will be Van Dyke in Belgium, Velazquez
in Spain. Antwerp will open the largest showing of Anthony van
Dyck's painting, May 15 through Aug. 20, at the Royal Museum of
Fine Arts (the show goes to London in September). Diego Rodriguez
de Silva y Velazquez, whose portraits of Spanish royalty and dwarfs
are considered among the greatest of European paintings, will have
a major show at Madrid's Prado.
</P>
<P>
   Denmark goes medieval this year. The Danes will be recalling
their medieval period (beginning with the advent of Christianity a
millennium ago) with exhibitions and reenactments. England is
recalling Cromwell and the English Civil Wars with exhibitions and
debates. Oliver Cromwell led the forces of Parliament against
Charles I and established England's only republic in 1653.
</P>
<P>
   Monaco will be celebrating Prince Rainier's 50th anniversary of
his reign all year and especially on National Day, Nov. 19. He is
Europe's longest-reigning royal today.
</P>
<P>
   Berlin will be marking a series of milestones: the 50th
anniversary of the end of the Berlin Airlift; the 10th anniversary
of the Fall of the Wall; and the official establishment of its
federal parliament in the city. In May, the German government will
leave its 50-year old home in Bonn and move into Berlin's rebuilt
Reichstag.
</P>
<P>
   Among other happenings will be Scotland's celebration of its own
parliament; Hungary has declared this to be the Year of the
Pleasures of the Palate; and Oslo's Akershus Fortress will mark its
700th year.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Encounters with Joe DiMaggio
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nobody cheered more loudly than I did when Al Gionfriddo, a
young Brooklyn Dodger reserve outfielder, chased and miraculously
caught Joe DiMaggio's sure home run in the sixth game of the 1947
World Series.
</P>
<P>
   I was 14, a Dodger fanatic. Joe DiMaggio was the enemy. Maybe it
was Red Barber's description on the radio. (''OH, Doctor!'') Maybe
it was because it was the peerless DiMaggio. Al Gionfriddo had his
six or seven seconds of eternal fame.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, in the '70s, my wife, Ruth, and I were standing on
the veranda of a wonderful old hotel at Cooperstown, N.Y. Joe
DiMaggio _ no longer the enemy _ was across the veranda, chatting
with friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to say hello to him,'' Ruth said. You had to know
her. I wouldn't have dared.
</P>
<P>
   She crossed the veranda, and quickly caught his eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Ruth Rosenfeld,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm Joe DiMaggio,'' he replied. It was, like everything else
about him, perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone knew.

VENICE IS A WONDERFUL AND WATERY PLACE 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM A. DAVIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
``Streets full of water. Advise.'' 
Robert Benchley 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Telegram sent from Venice to New Yorker editor Harold Ross. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   VENICE, Italy _ My first morning in Venice, I awoke to the loud
wail of an alarm siren. ``A fire somewhere,'' I thought, and went
back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   But the alarm was about water, not fire. As I later learned
(getting my shoes damp in the process), it was a warning that there
would be a tidal surge this day and, with it, extensive flooding as
the city's main canals overflowed their banks.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I roused myself and headed to the nearest cafe for
breakfast, there was nearly an inch of water on my narrow
cobblestone street, which ran between two canals. A few hours
later, when I arrived at Piazza San Marco, arguably the grandest
square in Europe, it resembled an ornamental lake designed by some
master landscape artist of the Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by a sheet of shallow water, the massive Basilica of
San Marco, a Byzantine extravaganza of domes and minarets, was a
fantasy island. The nearby Doge's Palace, fortified residence of
Venice's ruling dukes, seemed like a stone battleship at anchor.
</P>
<P>
   Venetians are used to their floods, and take them in stride.
Both men and women manage to look stylish, for instance, even when
sloshing around in utilitarian rubber boots instead of the elegant
footwear for which Italy is renowned.
</P>
<P>
   On high-water days, portable wooden walkways are laid down by
public works crews to provide dry passage through flooded areas. On
my visit to Piazza San Marco, a small army of tourists _ directed
with good humor by nattily dressed policemen in knee-high black
rubber boots _ was queuing up on the narrow boardwalks to cross the
vast square and enter the basilica and palace. There were a few dry
spots in the middle of the piazza, but these were all occupied by
San Marco's famous and pampered indigenous pigeons, who obviously
weren't about to share their turf with nonresidents.
</P>
<P>
   For visitors, Venice is about history, art, romance, and
atmosphere. But for the people (and pigeons) who live here, what
makes their city truly unique is water. It is a city defined by
water and dependent on it. There are no cars, and, as in no other
city in the world, boats of all types, from one-man gondolas to
high-speed water buses, are the dominant forms of transportation.
</P>
<P>
   Venice is really an archipelago, a group of several hundred
islands (most small and now surrounded by canals) in a lagoon some
three miles off Italy's Adriatic coast. It was founded in the fifth
century by refugees from the mainland fleeting the horsemen of
Attila the Hun, who could capture walled towns but were utterly
confounded by water.
</P>
<P>
   Water continued to protected Venice from marauding barbarians
and warring armies through the centuries. Water also brought
wealth. The great merchant navy the city developed, largely for
trade with the Byzantine Empire, made Venice one of the world's
wealthiest cities.
</P>
<P>
   Venice began to decline as a European power in the 15th century,
when the Byzantine Empire fell to the Turks and the discovery of
America changed trade and shipping patterns. But the accumulated
wealth of centuries continued to be spent lavishly on the city,
most visibly in the great churches and palaces that still line the
canals and cast their ornate reflections onto the shimmering water
with dramatic effect.
</P>
<P>
   At its height in the late Middle Ages, Venice had a population
of around 300,000, enormous for the time. A causeway to the
mainland was built in the 1930s, and since World War II many
Venetians have crossed it to settle in the booming industrial
suburb of Mestre, which lacks charm but has lots of jobs, modern
amenities (such as cars), and doesn't get flooded.
</P>
<P>
   Venice now has a year-round population of 65,000, less than half
of what it was 50 years ago. There is great concern in Italy about
``the vanishing Venetian'' and fear that Venice is becoming more a
museum than a city. However, since Venice gets about 12 million
visitors a year, its squares are as bustling and its canals as
heavily trafficked as they ever were.
</P>
<P>
   The streets are pretty busy, too. Since there is no automobile
traffic, all of Venice is a pedestrian zone. To enable walkers to
get around there are more than 400 bridges over the city's canals,
all arched so that the ubiquitous freight barges _ the delivery
vans of Venice _ can pass beneath them.
</P>
<P>
   The one canal that isn't easy to cross on foot is the most
important one of all: the Grand Canal. Shaped like a reversed
letter ``S,'' the Grand Canal both bisects and unites Venice. As
wide as a respectable river, the canal runs for almost 2 1/2 miles
through the heart of the city but has only three bridges across it.
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of water buses called ``vaporetti'' (literally,
``steamers'') plies the main canals but nowhere in such numbers as
on the Grand Canal, in effect, the main boulevard of the city.
Venice is an easy and interesting place to explore on foot, but
wherever I went my feet always seemed to take me back to the Grand
Canal and on to a vaporetto.
</P>
<P>
   The workhorse of the vaporetto system is the No. 1 line which
serves the length of the Grand Canal, with boats arriving and
departing every five or 10 minutes. Since most of Venice's main
sights _ including the principal churches, the grandest of the
palazzi, and the most important museums _ are on the Grand Canal,
an end-to-end trip on the No. 1 line amounts to a sightseeing tour.
This line is so tourist-friendly that stops are announced in
English as well as Italian, not the case on any other vaporetto
route.

   TAKE-BOS  
 VENICE: Italy: ... vaporetto route.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The busiest of the Grand Canal vaporetto stops is unquestionably
Piazza San Marco. It's estimated that about half the visitors
Venice sees annually are in the city for less than a day. At least
part of that time is invariably spent in Piazza San Marco, and
sometimes all of it is.
</P>
<P>
   The Basilica of St. Mark and the Doge's Palace are must-see
buildings, their grandeur _ both are filled with art as well as
being works of art themselves _ conveying as no history book can
the glory that was Venice in its heyday. The basilica also holds
the revered remains of the apostle Mark _ the city's patron saint _
smuggled out of Constantinople after its capture by the Turks and
made the city's patron saint.
</P>
<P>
   When not flooded, which, of course, is most of the time, the
piazza is usually filled with swirling crowds and buzzing with
activity. Street performers abound, for instance, and a platoon of
sailors from the local Navy base marches into the square daily at
sunset for an impressive flag-lowering ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza San Marco is rimmed by arcaded buildings on three sides
but open to the Venetian Lagoon on the fourth. Besides vaporetti,
private motor boats, and cruiseship launches, the piazza's
waterfront is also home port for a fleet of gondolas.
</P>
<P>
   No longer a primary means of transportation, the graceful
high-prowed gondola is still a symbol of Venice and a common sight
in the city. As popular tourist attractions, gondola rides are
priced accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   Gondoliers are not supposed to charge more than $80 during the
day and $100 at night for a 50-minute ride with up to six people.
They often demand more, however, charging extra for an off-key
rendition of ``O Sole Mio'' or claiming to take a more scenic route
than other gondoliers. Hard bargaining is recommended.
</P>
<P>
   Budget travelers (or cheapskates) who want to sample the gondola
experience without spending a lot of money or time should try a
traghetto. That's a gondola water taxi that ferries passengers
across the Grand Canal in the long stretches among the three
bridges. The trip takes just a few minutes but only costs about 35
cents. Tourists usually sit down in a traghetto, but it's a point
of pride with Venetians to make the trip standing up.
</P>
<P>
   The arcades around Piazza San Marco house upscale shops and
restaurants that are among the most expensive in the city. Full of
charm and character, the cafes here _ some, such as Florian's,
little altered since the 18th century _ charge about as much for a
cup of espresso as you might expect to pay for lunch elsewhere. Of
course, what you're really buying is a ringside seat at one of the
world's great people-watching spectacles. Not to mention the
possibility that your table was the very one preferred by Richard
Wagner, Ernest Hemingway, Truman Capote, or some other celebrated
Venice habitue.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza San Marco is classically grand and formal. The streets
radiating from it, however, are mostly narrow, winding, and invite
exploration. Although picturesque and full of old-fashioned
Venetian flavor, this is still the high-rent district with
top-class restaurants, pricey stores, and boutique hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Another much touristed but delightful area for shopping and
dining is the Rialto, which is not only on the Grand Canal but more
or less straddles it. One of the three bridges over the Grand
Canal, the Rialto Bridge not only has lively neighborhoods at both
ends but the bridge itself is lined with small shops and a sort of
mini-mall unto itself.
</P>
<P>
   The third member of Venice's tourist troika, along with the
basilica and the palace, is the Accademia, which is also easily
accessed by vaporetto No. 1. There are other excellent museums in
Venice, but the Accademia is the museum, a sprawling former convent
and school complex housing the city's largest and best-displayed
collection of paintings from the glory days of Venetian art. All
the masters are here _ Tintoretto, Bellini, Titian, Carpaccio, et
al. _ and represented by some of their best work.
</P>
<P>
   The grandest of the palaces built by Venice's wealthy merchant's
and nobles are found along the Grand Canal. These days, few palaces
are in the hands of the families that built them, and those that
are, often badly need work. However, many palazzi have been bought
by wealthy non-Venetians (often foreigners) and completely restored
at great expense.
</P>
<P>
   One such Grand Canal palace, a short walk from the Accademia,
belonged to the late Peggy Guggenheim, a wealthy American socialite
and art collector. Guggenheim lived and behaved in the grand manner
(Venetians nicknamed her ``the last duchess'') but was a serious
collector of modern European painting and sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   Now a museum, Guggenheim's 18th-century palace still feels like
a home but displays a superb art collection, including paintings by
Picasso, Braque, Chagall, and Pollock and sculpture by Brancusi,
Moore, and Giacometti. The duchess remains in residence: She is
buried in the sculpture garden along with her ``beloved babies,''
the dozen Shih Tzu pet dogs she owned in her long lifetime. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The day I left Venice, I had to get up early and take a last
vaporetto ride along the Grand Canal to Piazzale Roma, departure
point for the airport bus. Looking back down the canal from the
deck of the boat, I got the impression that Venice was putting on a
farewell performance just for me.
</P>
<P>
   The rising sun silhouetted the domes and spires of a dozen
churches and turned the murky water of the canal into beaten gold.
A small boat perilously overloaded with a grand piano, of all
things, chugged by, and the white bearded old man at the tiller
waved cheerfully. As the vaporetto approached my stop, a gondola
appeared out of nowhere, and the young gondolier _ dressed in the
once traditional but now less commonly seen blue- and white-striped
jersey and straw hat _ began to gracefully pole away in the
direction of Piazza San Marco.
</P>
<P>
   Images like that are not easily washed from memory. Not even by
the Grand Canal of time.

   WASHINGTON -- It's not exactly the same snake oil, but it sure
looks familiar.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the musings of Congress's Republican leaders as they
continue, post-impeachment, to wrestle with their internal
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Tax cut? Absolutely, the bigger the better. Maybe nothing kicks
in immediately, as in the next 18 months, but something like $800
billion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Military needs? Fill 'em all, especially Star Wars and other
hardware programs.
</P>
<P>
   Balanced budget? No problem. Keep hard and low ceilings on
domestic programs, at least outside those few we favor, and
there'll be someone here next week or the week after to talk
specifically about how we intend to slash and burn.
</P>
<P>
   Deep tax cuts, steep Pentagon increases, and vague, actually
disguised, intentions toward the rest of the government began to
appear on the national horizon when a front-runner presidential
candidate named Reagan bought into the concept in large part to
ward off a dynamic kid named Jack Kemp.
</P>
<P>
   That was $4 trillion in national debt in our past. That was also
when the country was enduring double-digit inflation and interests
rates, exacerbating an income tax squeeze, not to mention something
called the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   But this is now _ deficit-free, inflation-free, Soviet
Union-free, jobs-generating, and generally confident about the
future. Today, shock therapy threatens far more than it beckons.
But it's still around because the ideology behind it is stronger
than the restraints that ordinarily temper the impulses of serious,
governing parties.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, to keep a precise count, are actually on their
third attempt at presenting a policy face to the country this year.
</P>
<P>
   The first was the night of President Clinton's State of the
Union address six weeks ago. Still mired in the self-delusion of
impeachment proceedings, they presented a Punch and Judy show (via
Representatives Steve Largent of Oklahoma and Linda Smith of
Washington) that symbolized the banishment of serious policy issues
to their back burner.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately after the president's decisive acquittal, the
Republicans' desperation to talk about something else, anything
else, produced instant tax-cut babble _ 10 percent across the board
in income tax rates as argued by House Budget Committee chairman
and presidential wannabe John Kasich of Ohio, and his Senate
counterpart, New Mexico's Pete Domenici. Outside Congress, in the
nascent presidential field, it was even bigger _ symbolized by Dan
Quayle's spectacularly irresponsible figure of 30 percent (The
Reagan number, by the way).
</P>
<P>
   The problem, as it was last year, was that the Republicans had
yet to understand the political power behind Clinton's
determination to put the Social Security system, including
Medicare, at the head of line for surplus-generated dollars until
it is made whole for the baby boom generation. This year, it didn't
take them long to realize that their dream of deep income tax rate
cuts was not realistic for now, and leaks to that effect began to
cascade off Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The latest fallback position has been articulated in outline
form by Kasich and Domenici, fronting for a nervous Speaker Dennis
Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. It starts by
accepting the president's proposal to wall off 62 percent of any
budget surplus that occurs over the next decade to pay down the
part of the national debt held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   That's a great beginning. This not only frees up huge sums for
private investment in the domestic economy, it also makes the
eventual task of funding social security benefits at generational
crunch time 30-40 years from now that much less onerous.
</P>
<P>
   But that's as far as the Republicans go. They reserve nothing
for the equally important task of revitalizing Medicare, for which
Clinton is willing to dedicate another 15 percent of future
surpluses. However, they do keep the tax-cut spirit alive in
massive form after the year 2000, along with the large boost in
miltary spending. They don't quite acknowledge it yet, but the rest
of the budget would have to be cut overall by as much as 20 percent
to make all this work.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately for the rest of us, many Republicans in both Houses
are flat out unwilling to do that kind of dirty work on housing,
health care, the environment, and other domestic needs. And they
more than cover the slender margins the GOP enjoys in each chamber.
</P>
<P>
   This is still a very early moment in the budget season, but
until the Republicans accept the responsibility that Ronald Reagan
ducked 20 years ago of paying fully and realistically for tax cuts
and military spending increases, they are not going to fly in an
environment sobered by the lessons of what can go wrong when you
don't.

FASHION: WHEN THE PRICE, AND FIT, ARE RIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ What happens to a woman's body between the time
she graduates from college and then enters menopause some 30 years
later is enough to send her to a shrink.
</P>
<P>
   Depressing? Well, unless a figure stays basically the same
through childbirth, hormone replacement and just plain gravity _
and believe it or not, some women are able to keep their girlish
figures through excellent genes or rigorous dieting and exercise _
clothing sizes creep up along with those extra pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ready-to-wear is designed for ``hanger appeal,'' that is: It has
to look great just hanging there in the store. But there are very
few course corrections made for specific bodies in off-the-rack.
</P>
<P>
   Darts are not exact; waist-lines are standardized to whatever
the current template is; armholes are dropped and sleeves are
designed to fit the ``average'' arm length, so they're either too
long or too short.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, much of what you see hanging on the racks in
department stores is generalized and boxy; poorly constructed (have
you ever noticed the shelf-life of a button on a DKNY jacket?) and
getting more expensive all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, how many of us are fitting models? How many of us are a
perfect size 6, with hips and busts to match? How many of us don't
need to tweak a sleeve, lift a hem, let out a waist band or buy
something two sizes larger to accommodate the hips and then spend a
fortune on alterations?
</P>
<P>
   Such is the tyranny of sizing: What was once a perfect 6 is
probably an imperfect 10 as years advance. And what is a perfect
size 8 in one designer's line soars to a size 12 in another's.
</P>
<P>
   You don't hear men complaining about having to buy a suit two
sizes too big to fit their expanding gut. Because men have been
having their clothing made for years. In Britain, made-to-measure
Savile Row suits, the closest thing to women's couture, are called
``bespoke'' clothing. Which means: to order.
</P>
<P>
   In San Francisco, there is a growing trend toward a bespoke
mind-set for women _ clothes that are less expensive than European
couture.
</P>
<P>
   There are four designers in San Francisco who specialize in
custom-made-to-measure clothing for women _ Francesca Freedman,
whose new shop on Sutter has recently opened; Lily Samii on
Stockton Street; Azadeh Riaz of Azadeh on Union Street and in
Marin; and Suzanne Hanley of Atelier des Modistes, a comfy,
hand-built studio on Hyde and Green.
</P>
<P>
   Each designer will custom-tailor clothing for women from Size 0
to Size 22. And surprise, surprise: It's not all that expensive.
</P>
<P>
   At Azadeh Riaz's comfortable elevated boutique on Union Street,
skirts start at $175; jackets are as inexpensive as $260. Gowns
range from $450 to $1,000 depending upon the style, the yardage and
the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Says Riaz, ``My philosophy is that women don't need too many
clothes. People will buy things because they're pretty or they've
gotten a good deal and most of the time, the stuff doesn't fit
right and sits in the back of the closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Riaz and her contemporaries embrace the European ideal: That
less and better is more and better.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing about having something custom-built is that it is
sizeless. Ask Lily Samii whether her clothing runs true to size and
she and her design partner, Jacques Pantazes, laugh and say: ``You
will not find any sizes here. It's your size.''
</P>
<P>
   The experience of having something made especially for you
begins as a partnership, where client and designer learn to speak
the same language.
</P>
<P>
   One of the main things a designer can do for a woman is to help
her establish her style and eliminate those things that will do
nothing for her. A woman who is 5-feet-tall, built like the Venus
of Willendorf, may yearn for a silk charmeuse slip dress, but
she'll never look her best in it.
</P>
<P>
   For Azadeh Riaz, 36, an Iranian-born designer who worked for the
Saudi Arabian royal family, making clothes to fit each particular
body is like creating art: ``In my mind, I sculpt my women,'' she
says. ``When I put my collections together, I shape my client with
what suits her.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty frank with my clients,'' says Suzanne Hanley, the
tall, long-haired Easterner who has been at Hyde and Green in a
quaint, plank-floored workroom and retail space for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shop is very Old World. I believe in having a few really
good pieces. My main goal is to make things people can wear where
they don't question: Is it going to fit? Is it going to look great?
I have clients who insist on making certain changes that I know
won't look good on them. We usually end up redoing it.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In ready-to-wear, designers create seasonal lines. So do custom
designers. They create samples on fitting models in a number of
sizes and when you go to have something made, often, you can try on
the sample to see if you like the style and the material.
</P>
<P>
   If the designer is working with expensive fabric, then she will
create a working model or a ``toile'' _ a muslin replica _ which
will be fit on the client before she takes scissors to fabric.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers feel good when they're wearing something made
especially for them,'' says Freedman, 42, a size 2 sprite. ``It is
an incredible luxury to have something that fits correctly.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman talks about one of her clients, a woman with a size 8
top and a size 14 bottom. ``When she tried on her suit, she twirled
in front of the mirror and gasped, `I look so slender.' The clothes
took 25 pounds off her figure,''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman says.
</P>
<P>
   With bespoke or affordable couture clothing, a woman is
guaranteed to get exactly what she wants in a price range she can
afford.

TESTS EXPOSE SUVS' FLIP SIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies say the darnedest things.
</P>
<P>
   Just the other day, the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration released the results of its recent tests of sports
utility vehicles. In roadway accidents, these family-style tanks,
it is well known, are prone to crush opposing vehicles like so many
peanut shells. For this reason, they're better known by the acronym
SUV, which stands for Somebody's Under the Vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   In the usual highway crack-up, the sergeant at the controls, and
any accompanying six-year-old soldiers, often fare better than the
unlucky civilians on their way to the dentist in an average sedan.
But the SUVs do have a vulnerable spot, and this so-called
Achilles' wheel was on full display in the NHTSA tests.
</P>
<P>
   The NHTSA wanted to see how well SUVs protected their passengers
in side-impact collisions. So the agency rigged up a movable
barrier, gave it a big shove to 38.5 m.p.h., and then slammed it
into the side of several models. To be fair, it must be pointed out
that the vehicles withstood the battering quite well, and the test
dummies only lost a few teeth and staggered around for a short time
afterward asking whether that good-for-nothing Nixon was still in
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   What did the tests reveal? That SUVs, under the slightest
provocation, tend to leave the ground, flip and roll like a
Wallenda brother.
</P>
<P>
   Any fair-minded person knows there is no way to explain away
this fact. A US Department of Transportation report from December
1997 revealed that SUVs are three times more likely to roll over
than are passenger cars. Often the outcome isn't pretty. The most
recent data available show that in 1997, more than 9,400 people
died when their car, van or truck rolled. Of the people involved in
a rollover in a car, 21 percent died. Of those in a truck, 42
percent died. Of those in a SUV that performed a Wallenda, 62
percent were killed. What's more, the popularity of these vehicles
has more than doubled their rollover fatalies in the past decade to
1,482 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the recent NHTSA tests, three SUV models flipped over when
struck from the side. The test wasn't intended to measure the
vehicles' propensity to roll over. It was meant to gauge passenger
safety in a side-impact collision. The rollovers were wholly
unexpected. So how did the auto makers respond? Did they express
regret? Did they issue a statement of concern and a vow to correct
the problem?
</P>
<P>
   Here's the spokesman from Honda Motor Co., whose CR-V flipped,
as quoted in the Wall Street Journal: ``What the tests are designed
to test, the CR-V passed with flying colors.''
</P>
<P>
   Astounded by this remark, we here at the Dollars &AMP; Nonsense
Institute for Highway Safety decided to put several unnamed SUVs
through our own tests. In separate course runs, we turned on the
windshield wipers, the headlights, the radio at varying speeds. In
one test, we had the test dummy scratch his nose at 43 m.p.h. In
every case, these small actions sent the SUVs rolling like Lincoln
logs.
</P>
<P>
   Most revealing was the response of one automaker whose model
rolled when we flicked on the radio at 60 m.p.h. In the glare of
the TV cameras, he declared, ``Yes, but our radio produces the
finest hi-fidelity in the industry.''

WALL STREET SEES INTO THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is widely believed that the stock market is overvalued and
that investors are caught up in an ``irrational exuberance'' that
eventually will end in a nasty correction. Maybe that's true. But
on one important score, the stock market has been more level-headed
and clear-eyed than anyone else. Simply put, the market's
optimistic view of the US economy has been right on target.
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, as it has rallied ever higher, the
market has been saying that the economy is in great shape, that the
US can grow at a solid clip without triggering inflation and that
the world's economic problems are not dire enough to make a big
difference here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market has anticipated and reflected the economy's
strength better than any economist,'' admits Mark Zandi, chief
economist at Regional Financial Associates, a Pennsylvania
forecasting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average soared to a new high Friday
after the government said that wages rose only a small amount, even
in the face of robust job growth. The message for the stock market
was clear: the good times continue.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, by contrast, have been relatively pessimistic.
Consider: At the beginning of each year Business Week magazine asks
a group of economists for their annual forecast.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the economists predicted the gross domestic product
would grow 1.9 percent. The actual number turned out to be 3.9
percent. In 1997 the economists looked for growth of 2.1 percent;
the economy delivered 3.8 percent. Last year the forecasters
predicted 2.2 percent; The economy grew 4.1 percent. Raise your
hand if you see a pattern here.
</P>
<P>
   Like vistors to a haunted house, forecasters have seen danger
lurking around each corner. At various times they have worried that
the strong economy would generate inflation; at other times they
have worried that the economic problems of Asia, Russia and Latin
America would stop the economy in its tracks. ``Somehow the economy
manages to skirt every obstacle in its path,'' marvels Nancy
Kimelman, chief economist at Technical Data in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   What has the market seen that forecasters haven't? Rising
productivity growth, for one thing. If we are all working more
efficiently the economy can travel at a higher speed. Productivity
isn't soaring, but it has been consistently better than expected.
The government today will announce productivity numbers for the
fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Related to productivity is the technology's growing role. The
stock market loves technology, probably more than it should. But
the market's basic insight _ that technology is transforming the
economy in profound ways _ is getting harder to dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, investors have been more willing than economists to
believe that intensified competition can keep prices from climbing
as fast as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   Zandi doesn't quarrel with the notion the stock market has done
a better job of seeing the future than he and his fellow
forecasters. But he has some words of warning. The US economy isn't
magical. It's lucky. He argues that the weak world economy has kept
a lid on prices and interest rates here. With demand for goods
depressed around the globe, America is enjoying the benefits of
cheap gas, cheap steel, cheap food and cheap money.
</P>
<P>
   As the world recovers, say forecasters, the American economy may
reach the point where strong growth begins to translate into higher
prices. When that happens, the Federal Reserve will raise interest
rates which, in turn, could spell the end of the long bull market.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters may be right, of course. Good times and rising
stock prices can't go on forever. But keep one thing in mind: if
you had a nickel for every time in the last few years that an
economist said that the best news on growth, inflation and stock
prices was behind us, you wouldn't have to worry about investing in
the stock market. You'd already be rich.

   The Red Herring

<P>
   &QL;

</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Fleet Financial Group took some heat for paying a
$13.2 million retention bonus to chief executive Terry Murray.
Murray got the money by agreeing to stay on the job for three
years. Apparently the bonus worked. Murray is still at Fleet. Last
week the bank announced that Murray earned $9.7 million in 1998 for
leading the company to another strong year.
</P>
<P>
   Some might say that paying Murray a retention bonus was
ridiculous because he had no intention of going anyplace else. We
would never be that cynical.

AN AGENDA MIRED IN LIGHT FARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; He ordered the pasta without ever looking at the menu _ ``A
plate of spaghetti,'' to be precise. Then Governor Paul Cellucci
tucked a cloth napkin into his shirt collar in that funny way some
people do, showered his meal in grated cheese and red pepper and
twirled his pasta around a spoon as if he were sitting at some
sun-splashed cafe in Piazza Navona.
</P>
<P>
   My intention _ to come clean _ was to dine with the governor,
then write about his obvious deficiencies, perhaps starting with a
little joke about the wait staff's palpable fear that Cellucci
would insist on paying himself, then have his Mastercard rejected
for exceeding his spending limit.
</P>
<P>
   Then it would be time to launch into the oft-chronicled problems
with his anorexic policy agenda, the abysmal lack of creativity and
vision in his knee-jerk Republican push to cut taxes and enact a
death penalty, the petty small-mindedness of an administration of
post-adolescents solely devoted to itself.
</P>
<P>
   But a funny thing happened on the way to coffee and dessert.
Paul Cellucci, it ends up, is an eminently likable man, Exhibit A
in that ancient rule of journalism: Never get to know the people
you hope to dislike.
</P>
<P>
   Because there he was, sitting in the back room of Filippo's on
the outskirts of the North End, being self-effacing, telling a
charmingly discolored joke about President Clinton, discussing the
particular problems of being Massachusetts governor at this
particular time. He sipped a cappuccino and seemed to have all the
time in the world.
</P>
<P>
   All of which may help explain the public's early comfort with
him. Massachusetts elected him in the face of a national Democratic
tide. In one recent poll, 68 percent approve of his performance.
Some women swoon over his DeNiro-like looks.
</P>
<P>
   He withstands the onslaught of demands for greater spending on a
laundry list of programs, saying that long after prosperity fades,
any enlarged bureaucracy would need to be funded. He also appears
hellbent on fulfilling a laudable bipartisan promise to cut the
state income tax from 5.95 percent to 5 percent. ``Government is
about finding a balance _ meeting the state's obligations while
allowing people to live a better life,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But alas, much as you want to admire him as well as like him,
Cellucci seems adamant about playing to his weaknesses. He is off
to an undistinguished start, following an undistinguished 17-month
stint as acting governor. By choice or incompetence, he is ensnared
in a series of fights over the machinations of government and the
fate of former foes. Unwittingly or not, he has ceded much of the
policy limelight to the aggressive House speaker, Thomas M.
Finneran. Already, some Republicans whisper about his lack of
vision and complain about the narrowness of his inexperienced but
headstrong aides.
</P>
<P>
   His is in a complex predicament: how to lead in prosperous times
that were caused, in part, by the administration of Governor
William F. Weld, of which he was a crucial part. It's always
easier, more politically profitable, to clean up someone else's
mess rather than sustain the success of one's own making.
</P>
<P>
   Weld was blessed with the ability to promote a new vision at a
time when change was needed, confident enough to soar above the
swamp of daily governance, best suited to dealing in symbols.
Cellucci, on the other hand, is a government mechanic, a meddler in
the process, so insistent on involvement in daily decisions that he
can barely see the swamp for the reeds.
</P>
<P>
   He compares himself to Weld like this: ``I'm more from the
heart. He's more from the head. I tend to be more hands on.''
</P>
<P>
   Heart should bring vision, a reason to be. He touts so many new
anti-crime proposals, whether the death penalty or
three-strikes-and-you're-out, that it seems he is governing a
Serbian province rather than a state where violent crime is at a
near four-decade low. His aides carp at those they fear are
disloyal. A persistent target: Suffolk District Attorney Ralph C.
Martin 2d, a Republican who had the audacity to chat with
Cellucci's Democratic opponent, Scott Harshbarger on Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci is at risk of appearing too much like one of his
mentors, George Bush, a leader of good character who either
couldn't devise or enunciate a governing vision of his own.
Instead, he should seek to be like Texas Governor George W. Bush,
who defined an ambitious but attainable program and then pursued it
with abandon.
</P>
<P>
   He is a good man off to a mediocre start. He has time. He needs
better counsel. And soon enough, he'll need to explain and pursue a
more meaningful agenda. Here's hoping that he can.

MURPHY'S LAW: LOTS OF PRACTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN BICKELHAUPT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ When Alissa Murphy was in the fourth grade, she asked
her parents to come watch her play basketball with her after-school
team. OK, thought Art and Carol, they'd go watch, but they weren't
expecting much; the Murphys didn't even have a hoop in their
driveway, so all it seemed Alissa could do was dribble and dribble
and dribble.
</P>
<P>
   Well, she could dribble, and she could shoot, and she could pass
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``My gosh, where did she learn all this?'' Carol Murphy
remembers thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Alissa learned, it turned out, from the boys in the neighborhood
who always were looking for another good athlete to team up with
for games of soccer, baseball, or basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy went on to join a boys' under-15 AAU team, set scoring
records for both San Diego County and the state of California, and
led her high school team to three championships. She was recruited
by the Boston College women's basketball team, and at the end of
her junior season, the guard was named Most Improved Player by the
Big East Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we couldn't be at this point without
her,'' BC coach Cathy Inglese said of her team's first trip to the
NCAA Tournament. The Eagles (21-7) will face Ohio State (17-11)
Saturday in a first-round game at Knoxville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who started every game, led the team in scoring with
15.8 points per game; was the only player to score in double
figures for all 26 games; and shot 88.4 percent from the line _
tops in the Big East, sixth in the country. Her finest moment came
when she scored a career-high 32 points in the Eagles' upset of
UConn in January.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the 5-foot-10-inch Murphy started only two games
a year ago, deflecting to two seniors, and averaged 24.6 minutes
and 9.1 points a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think maybe the coach needed a spark off the bench,'' said
Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked her better coming off the bench,'' Inglese said.
``Either she or Kim (Beezer) could have started, but Alissa really
gave us a spark, and people understand that. Anybody wants to
start, but she still saw a lot of time, and it made her hungrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, she started to realize, if the opportunity is there
for me, I can do it, and really stepped up when Cal (Bouchard) went
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard, Murphy's roommate and also her backcourt mate,
underwent knee surgery halfway through the season for a torn ACL.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who grew up in San Diego, has two older brothers and a
younger one, but they never talked her into playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she was about 9 years old, she'd be up at 6, dribbling
with her right hand and her left hand,'' said her father.
</P>
<P>
   The family eventually got a hoop, but a slanted driveway
rendered it useless, so Art Murphy wound up driving his daughter to
a gym so she could play.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one year when for 365 days she would not miss a day
in the gym shooting,'' he said. ``I swear to God, I drove her on
Christmas Day.''
</P>
<P>
   When Murphy enrolled at Scripps Ranch High School, the passion
continued.
</P>
<P>
   The city of San Diego's leading scorer for three straight years,
she is San Diego's second all-time leading scorer. As a junior, she
was California's leading point-getter with 908 and averaged 28.2
points per game; as a senior, she averaged 27.5 points, 7.5
rebounds, and 7.5 assists.
</P>
<P>
   During her three years on the high school team, Scripps Ranch
was 20-6, 20-12, and 31-1, city champs each time. And Murphy often
would call coach Dan Regas, asking him to open the gym at 6:45 a.m.
so she could practice.
</P>
<P>
   When BC visited the city last December to play San Diego and San
Diego State, her No. 24 jersey was retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just knows the game of basketball; she knows where to be
on offense or defense and makes everyone around her better,'' Regas
said. ``She plays hard, she plays smart.''
</P>
<P>
   And boy, can she dribble.

MED SCHOOLS CHANGE COURSE IN ERA OF HMOS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Faced with the rapidly shifting, often harsh realities of
managed care, medical educators across the nation are training more
doctors outside of hospitals and adding new courses in economics,
ethics, law, and even how to document treatment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The transformation, observers say, will not only change the way
patients are treated, but also will likely ensure the continued
growth of managed care as incoming physicians increasingly view it
as a given rather than as one method of doing business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an interesting phenomenon because medical schools in the
past have not generally been about economics and business,'' said
John McCahn, associate dean of academic affairs at Boston
University Medical School. ``All of a sudden we have to deal with
the notion that students cannot walk out of our doors totally naive
about the world in which they will be working.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Lee, dean of educational affairs at the four-year-old
Managed Care Institute of the Tufts University Medical School, said
the change has a philosophical dimension as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``The students coming in today understand there is a shifting
and expanded role for the physician,'' she said. ``We have a
responsibility to . . .get them thinking about what ideal managed
care should be, so they can go out and try to attain that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes take many forms.
</P>
<P>
   A course in public health at BU for first-year medical students,
for instance, now includes a section on law and medicine taught by
a researcher in health-care economics. At Harvard Medical School,
among many other institutions, there is an emphasis on
``health-policy training'' and on teaching ethics because today's
doctors routinely have to weigh costs against benefits in ways that
previous generations did not. And at the University of
Massachusetts Medical Center in Worcester, all third-year medical
students must attend a two-day symposium at which issues relating
to managed care are taught and discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Comparable course additions and alterations are becoming
commonplace across the nation. Moreover, in a strong indication
that the new approach is taking hold, the American Association of
Medical Schools last year began sending out recommendations for
broad curriculum changes that incorporate many of the fiscal,
ethical and procedural realities of managed care.
</P>
<P>
   ``This certainly is the biggest shift in medical education in
decades, at least. . .and maybe since the early part of the
century,'' said Gregory Pawlson, associate director for health
affairs at George Washington University Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   In one telling departure from the past, a growing number of
medical students _ including at BU _ are now taught to document
their decisions and actions in detailed ways, and for reasons, that
didn't exist before.
</P>
<P>
   In managed-care practices, such records typically become part of
a communal pool of data that can be used for medical purposes by
other doctors _ a practice praised even by critics of managed care.
But there is concern about another use for such records: Insurance
firms and corporate executives review them, in part to help assess
the performance and set the salaries of individual doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic changes in medical education are taking place
in on-the-job training, as students spend more time learning at
outpatient facilities like managed-care offices, rather than in
emergency rooms and elsewhere in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   Young physicians receive the bulk of their hands-on experience
during their three-year residencies after graduating from medical
school. Historically, 65 percent to 95 percent of that training
time has been spent in hospitals, on the theory that intensive
exposure to inpatient work is the best way to hone skills and
develop judgment.
</P>
<P>
   But managed care practices permit patients to spend less and
less time in hospitals. So many educators are deciding, whether or
not they like the trend, that future physicians will be better
prepared if they focus more on outpatient care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Graduates too often have entered the world able to run an
intensive-care unit, but not an office,'' said Jeanette Shorey, who
directs the Brigham and Women's/Harvard Pilgrim Health Care primary
residency program in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   With pressure being exerted from above and below _ student
surveys show a strong appetite for more managed-care instruction _
experimental programs are popping up around the country that allow
residents to spend most of their three years at HMOs, family
practice centers, and other non-hospital settings.
</P>
<P>
   The most extensive and ambitious of these programs is the
Partnership for Quality Education, established in 1996 with an $8.3
million grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts. The Boston-based
project initially brought together eight influential medical
schools and their neighboring managed-care organizations to provide
training, develop curricula, and explore ways to promote such
activities nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the partnership has handed out 66 grants, a small number
within the 1,500 US residency programs. But some of the others have
independently embarked on similar initiatives, and officials
believe the prestige of the partnership's founding institutions and
the strength of its ideas will stimulate accelerated growth for
managed care in general and for resident outpatient training in
particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of what we want to do is not just create new
partnerships, but to create a movement,'' said Elizabeth March, the
program director for Partnerships for Quality Education.
</P>
<P>
   Among the participants are Harvard University and Harvard
Pilgrim Health Care, which have established a school department
within the HMO to run a large primary-care residency program; the
Tufts Managed Care Institute of Tufts University School of Medicine
and the Tufts Health Plan; and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, New
York Hospital, and Cornell University Medical College, which is
testing a novel approach in which some residents rotate into
policymaking positions within the HMO, in addition to their regular
medical training.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is wrestling with the issues of managed care, and we
may be turning a corner,'' said Larry Brown, a professor at the
Columbia University School of Public Health and one of three
outside evaluators of the partnership's endeavors. He said that a
great deal of resistance remains among mid-level medical school
officials and the majority of doctors, who detest the idea of
mixing business with medicine, but added that he believes ``it's
only a matter of time'' before so many young doctors have been
trained in managed-care techniques that they will become the norm
for most Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Acceptance of the norm doesn't mean a fondness for every aspect
of the new system, however. While many of those interviewed hailed
managed care's push for more primary-care physicians and lauded the
demise of virtually unrestricted, unmonitored testing and
prescriptions for patients, they said insurance-imposed guidelines
sometimes mean valuable medications aren't prescribed and
potentially revealing tests aren't conducted.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mere fact that someone's watching you is a step toward
self-improvement,'' said Benjamin Gavi, a third-year resident at
the Brigham/Harvard Pilgrim residency program. But, he added: ``The
danger in this kind of program is it forces residents to accept
some things as a given rather than encouraging them to question
what's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Federman, the dean for medical education at Harvard
Medical School, made much the same point even as he praised many of
the educational changes his institution and others are
implementing. ``We're worried that under the pressures of the
bottom line, physicians will feel a pressure to do less. I do
believe that's a risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Staunch opponents of managed care, meanwhile, said they feared
residents with too little hospital training might be less adept at
diagnosing some problems and conducting some procedures. In
addition, several doctors said they already encounter residents who
give more weight to financial considerations than to possibly
life-prolonging treatments, especially with elderly or terminally
ill patients.
</P>

   ``I'm disturbed that we're now hatching a generation of doctors
trained under the aegis of corporate greed, whose education is
based on the principle `first, make a profit,' '' said David
Himmelstein, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and a
cofounder of the Ad Hoc Committee to Defend Health Care. ``And they
will be practicing for many years.''

<P>
   CANTON, Mass. _ On their own field of dreams, the boys in
wheelchairs charged down the basketball court, chasing each other,
shooting baskets, blocking, sometimes locking wheels, showing no
mercy, asking for none.
</P>
<P>
   If their limbs have failed them, as most have, or are partially
missing, as some are, that does not hinder these wheelchair
basketball players at the Massachusetts Hospital School in Canton,
a state-operated school for youngsters with disabilities, in their
pursuit of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   A national championship is now within their reach.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member team is charged up for the challenge next
weekend at the 7th annual National Junior Wheelchair Basketball
Tournament at the University of Illinois at Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' said Richard Crisafulli, the school's director
of athletics. ``This is the World Series, the Super Bowl of
wheelchair competition. The important thing with this is that
college coaches will be there to scout the final 16 top-seeded
teams in the 35-member league. We're one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital school team qualified for the nationals by placing
second in the Mid-South Regional Tournament in Arkansas in January.
There, the team won five games and lost one, placing it among the
top 16 finalists and 11th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have worked hard for this honor,'' said team coach
Caryn Glazer,. ``During the season (from December to March), they
practice for about eight hours two nights a week.''
</P>
<P>
   When these kids are out there on the court,'' she said,
``they're not people with disabilities, they're basketball
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the hospital school has the only junior wheelchair team in
New England, Glazer said, the players, ranging in age from 12 to
22, come from all over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Beaulieu, 13, travels from Augusta, Maine to join in the
games. He said he ``can't wait'' for the nationals and wants to
play basketball in college.
</P>
<P>
   His father exemplifies the efforts parents make to get their
youngsters to the games. During the basketball season, Raymond
Beaulieu, 38, a pipefitter, drives Zack the seven-hour round trip
from Augusta to Canton twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zack couldn't play basketball or wheelchair tennis, he'd be
a different kid,'' Raymond Beaulieu said. ``This keeps him in shape
and in better health. It's Zack's positive attitude that gives the
family strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu said his son's spine was severed when he was 4 and
struck by a speeding car as he crossed the street to his
grandmother's house in Grand Isle, Maine. Now, he plans to be a
computer animator.
</P>
<P>
   Another player with a spinal cord injury, Jaime Mazzi, 17, of
Lynn, has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 4 and a
drunk driver hit the car his father was driving when Mazzi was
living with him in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Mazzi's mother, Edith Alvarado, who is legally
blind, accompanied her son to the basketball practices twice a week
and sometimes more on public transportation. The trip took them
three hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   Crisafulli calls Mazzi, ``the team's Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzi, the team's leading scorer, said, ``Playing basketball
makes me feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's other players have their stories, equally poignant,
but would rather talk about basketball and their hopes for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Damian White, 17, of Walpole, hopes to get an athletic
scholarship and study engineering. He has been paralyzed from the
waist down since a car accident when he was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wise of Needham, 16 next Sunday, said he was born with
spina bifida and has used a wheelchair since he was 3. ``I want to
be a computer graphic designer,'' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Vanelli, 17, of Holbrook, lost one leg below the knee after
he was stabbed in the calf. He loves the game, he said, but he also
plays ``to lose weight.'' Reynald ``Ray'' Grandoit, 16, of Boston,
the team's newest member, said he became paralyzed after
contracting spinal meningitis when he was a baby. His main concern
now is choosing a college to study psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Zuluago, 17, of Pawtucket, R.I., missed a recent practice
because of an after-school job, but Glazer said he will be at the
nationals. Zuluago's disability, Glazer said, ``was caused by a bad
polio vaccine he got in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Ferreira, 15, who comes from New Bedford but lives at the
school, is disappointed he won't be able to travel with his team.
``I was born with osteogenesis,'' Ferreira said, ``or brittle
bones. Then, I had to go and break a finger in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ferreira has something to look forward to. Described as ``a
whiz'' in table tennis, he plans to go to New Mexico in July to
take part in a table tennis tournament. He also participates in
track and field, and archery.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Christian, 15, who attends public school in Canton, was
home with a strep throat during a recent practice at the school,
but planned on being better when the team leaves for Illinois on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who has set swimming records, plays golf and
baseball, rides a bike, and is a ``gofer'' at a golf club near his
home, was born with partially formed limbs.
</P>
<P>
   He explained how he taught himself to propel his wheelchair and
shoot baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take off one leg so it won't get in the way and I hold the
ball with two arms and push up,'' he said. ``My parents helped me
out a great deal, but I was determined to do it on my own.''

THE CASE OF THE RUNAWAY DREAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR AND STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ She dreamed of stallions bred for beauty and strength,
descendants of English thoroughbreds that carried pioneers to the
West, and western movie stars into sunset dust.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Shaw fell in love with American saddlebreds, a breed whose
high head and chestnut hair makes it among the most prized in the
genteel, bluegrass world of horse shows. But for the 46-year-old
mother, living on the South Shore but born among the Kentucky
hills, the horses became an all-consuming passion.
</P>
<P>
   It was a passion, and a lifestyle, far beyond the cubicles and
carpeting of her $30,000-a-year job as an insurance claims
processor. But Shaw longed for horses still, and prosecutors say
those dreams led her to secretly siphon millions of dollars from
her Boston employer, New England Financial.
</P>
<P>
   Over a seven-year period, Shaw stole $3.3 million from the
insurance company, according to a 20-count indictment handed down
by a federal grand jury last week. Officials at New England
Financial say she drew the money in steady increments of $15,000 or
$25,000, fooling computer systems with phony names and numbers
dozens of times a year. She might have gone on longer if she had
not tripped herself, trying to deposit a check in December after
she inadvertently had stopped payment on it.
</P>
<P>
   In her scheme, Shaw was anything but the typical corporate
embezzler. There were no mansions or jewels. Instead, investigators
say, she bought, sold and showed some 70 horses _ a cross-country
hobby that demanded not only bottomless wealth, but a curious,
single-minded dedication.
</P>
<P>
   No arraignment has been scheduled yet in Shaw's case. According
to the US Attorney's office, she has not hired a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Following her indictment last week, Shaw returned to her home in
Marshfield. As she pulled into her driveway, wearing a nubby
country sweater and a low ponytail as she pulled into her driveway,
she had no public comment, saying only that reports about the
number of horses she owned were ``way, way off.''
</P>
<P>
   But as she built a prized stable with stolen funds, some say
Shaw found herself with another hobby that required just as much
care _ a double life, one that stretched from her South Shore
cottage to Kentucky's rolling pastures.
</P>
<P>
   To neighbors and co-workers, she was just another insurance
clerk who barely made enough to raise a son in her rented home and
care for her dying mother. But inside a complex circuit of regional
and national horse shows, Shaw was a proud competitor who talked of
a country-club childhood and seemed to come from money.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always thought she had a trust fund,'' said William Wise, a
trainer who stabled Shaw's horses and broke them in to ride on his
farm in Danville, Ky, the heart of bluegrass country. ``I got the
feeling it was a very prominent family.''
</P>
<P>
   And, like a woman of means, Shaw was generous, offering a horse
to a child who admired it, and retiring one of her aging champions
years before a more glory-seeking owner would have.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she loved the horses so much that she got in too deep,''
said Cherly Innis, a trainer in Somers, Conn. who has known Shaw
for 10 years, but who could do little but speculate about the
charges now facing her friend. ``I don't know what happened. But
she loved those shows. She loved her animals.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Overlooking a marsh and framed by a low wooden fence, the gray
Cape-style house that is Laura Shaw's home looks as colorless as
the office space where she issued claims. But inside, her living
room is a shrine to her passion.
</P>
<P>
   Paintings of horses, from every angle and every era, are the
wallpaper pattern covering walls painted in the deep blue-green of
Kentucky grass. A table of welded horseshoes sits a few feet from a
shining, chestnut rocking horse. From its wooden neck dangle the
gold, red and royal blue ribbons earned from years of showings at
county fairs and state championships.
</P>
<P>
   No one knows quite when or how Shaw's saddlebred dreams began.
This much, however, is known: While she lived in quiet anonymity in
Marshfield for 15 years, and worked at New England Financial for
21, Shaw's roots were not in New England.
</P>
<P>
   She came from Kentucky, though not the pastoral bluegrass
country where she played out her dreams. Records show she was born
in Paducah, a gray, industrial river port clinging to the banks of
the Ohio River. Her father, Jack Daniel Shaw, was a bookkeeper for
an insurance company.
</P>
<P>
   For a time, she lived in St. Louis. She never married, and at
age 23, she had a son, Mark Shaw. Two years later, mother and child
appeared in New England, where she began work for the insurance
company she would later become accused of betraying.
</P>
<P>
   But if Shaw had carried on in her father's professional
footsteps, the love of horses grounded family pride. Her mother,
Nell Shaw, also a Kentuckian, was a regular in horse-show social
circles before she died last year.
</P>
<P>
   In the offices of New England Financial, where professional
photographs of Shaw and her son on horses lined her desk,
co-workers said her equine interests were far from secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``She would come into work smelling like the animals
sometimes,'' said one colleague, who worked with Shaw for years and
who asked not to be named. ``It was definitely out in the open. But
that she had so many of them, and that they were so valuable, we
had absolutely no idea.''
</P>
<P>
   But behind the memorabilia was a second career and a serious
investment. It carried Shaw from the drudgery of office life to a
genteel pastime whose heyday ended with the automobile, but lives
on nonetheless in thousands of horse shows scattered across the
vast lands west of the Allegheny River.
</P>
<P>
   Inside that circuit, where owners are as loyal to specific
breeds as baseball fans are to teams, Shaw gravitated to the most
romantic breed of all _ the American saddlebred.
</P>
<P>
   Bred into being along the inlet of Narragansett Bay and prized
for their gait, they are among the most beautiful, and are among
the most expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very, very wealthy people involved with
saddlebreds,'' said Lynn Weatherman, senior editor of American
Saddlebred Magazine. Like many in the circuit, Weatherman knew of
Shaw as an accomplished shower, but nothing of her $30,000-a-year
job in Massachusetts. ``I don't see how you could support even a
dozen horses on something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet between 1986 and 1998, Shaw owned some 70 horses, according
to the American Saddlebred Horse Association in Lexington, Ky.
Their price tags averaged in the tens of thousands. According to
Wise, the Kentucky trainer, Shaw sold one of her prized horses, New
Trial, for $150,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   And Shaw spent thousands more each year tending to the animals:
boarding them in stables, paying trainers to groom and transport
them, as well as show entry fees and medical bills. According to
two former New England trainers for Shaw, the boarding fees alone
cost close to $7,500 per year, per horse.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was her own frequent travel _ flying
cross-country to show horses, often with her mother, and numerous
trips to Kentucky, where Shaw seemed determined to perfect her
riding.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was not a very good rider at first,'' said Wise. ``But she
worked hard at it. She'd come in on a Friday evening and ride until
Sunday. She'd go home so sore she could hardly walk.''
</P>
<P>
   In the eyes of judges and competitors, the effort paid off.
Between 1993 and 1997, her most prized horse, Shelby Stonewall, won
some two dozen prizes. The horse earned back-to-back world's grand
championships at the Kentucky State Fair, the most prestigious
competition for her breed. In all, the various prizes netted Shaw
close to $25,000 in prize money.
</P>
<P>
   The purses may have been prestigious, but not lucrative. The
money Shaw earned from Stonewall in four years could have barely
paid for one horse, and Shaw owned a dozen at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like horse racing,'' said Rob Turner, Shaw's longtime
trainer who trains horses in Brentwood, NH. ``The prize money is
minimal compared to what you put into it. The only real money comes
if you have a good horse and his value goes up.''
</P>
<P>
   Horse trading, co-workers said, was how Shaw explained her
pricey hobby. It explained changes in her life that were visible
enough to notice, but too subtle to raise suspicions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, she drove these heaps of cars, rusty, five- and
10-year-old things,'' said Shaw's longtime co-worker. ``Then, all
of a sudden, she was driving a Mercedes.''
</P>
<P>
   Records show that prior to 1990, Shaw mostly drove a
gas-guzzling, 1983 Ford LTD. Then, in recent years, she purchased a
1996 Dodge Intrepid and a 1997 Dodge Ram pickup truck. She also
bought a Mercedes _ a 1987 420 SEL.
</P>
<P>
   But even co-workers, who had the knowledge of Shaw's salary that
horse trainers lacked, never questioned the cars, or the horses.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was buying horses cheap and selling them for a profit,''
the co-worker said. ``That was the impression we got of why she had
this new money.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, those who shared Shaw's work space and stables wonder how
they never guessed, and why they never asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was never a problem with Laura paying her bills, and it
never occurred to me to ask where her money was coming from,'' said
Innis, Shaw's friend and Connecticut trainer.
</P>
<P>

CITY SEEKS ACTION TO REVERSE PEDESTRIAN DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Alarmed by the dramatic rise in pedestrian
fatalities in San Francisco, the city's Board of Supervisors is
seeking ways to reverse the death toll on streets and highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is awry, and I think it is incumbent on us to look
at the reality that this is a threat to public safety,'' Supervisor
Amos Brown said of the big jump in the number of pedestrians killed
by cars, buses, trucks and trains.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-year period ending June 30, 1998, 39 pedestrians were
killed on city streets, and two more were killed down on highways,
according to the latest statistics compiled by the San Francisco
medical examiner's office. In the previous year, 23 pedestrians
lost their lives in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The police, street safety and traffic officials are baffled by
the startling increase in pedestrian deaths. All agree there is no
single factor causing the rise in fatalities.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 32 cases handled by the San Francisco Police Department's
Hit and Run Detail between July 1, 1997, and June 30, 1998, 18 were
determined to be the fault of the pedestrian, including some who
were jaywalking or walking against a red light.
</P>
<P>
   In the cases in which the driver was at fault, several
pedestrians were hit as they were trying to cross the street
legally. Motorists making left-hand turns and not yielding to those
on foot killed several people. No fault was assigned in other
cases.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Brown and Supervisors Gavin Newsom, Alicia Becerril
and Michael Yaki all requested hearings into the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom, who called the large number of pedestrian deaths ``quite
significant and alarming,'' said the city needed to look at what
other cities are doing to promote pedestrian safety. He also wants
to look at beefing up the crossing guard program.
</P>
<P>
   Newsom said San Francisco's stepped-up efforts to combat
red-light runners by installing surveillance cameras at
intersections and increasing the fine for red-light running have
proved beneficial.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the past couple of years, red-light running has
decreased by 40 percent at camera-enforced intersections,'' Newsom
said. ``With this success as our model, I am confident that we can
stem this rise in pedestrian fatalities.''

SANCHEZ LEARNS WELL AT TEMPLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Nearly four years ago, Temple coach John Chaney
received a videotape of a basketball player from Argentina and a
note from a good friend who knew the youngster. ``If you want
him,'' George Severini's note said, ``he'd be interested in playing
in your program.''
</P>
<P>
   The coach popped the tape into the VCR, and after a few minutes
spent watching the Argentina junior national team, he called his
friend. ``Where is he?'' Chaney asked, only to be told he would
have to wait a few minutes. Pepe Sanchez was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he went into the game, I didn't see him make a basket,''
recalled Chaney. ``The only thing I saw him do was bring the ball
up and pass it around and play defense. And I said to myself, `Hey,
I'd like to have him.' ''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Chaney didn't figure on making Sanchez the
cornerstone of his patient, ball-control offense and menacing 2-3
zone trap defense. He had a scholarship to give. He needed a point
guard. He saw some things in the player from Argentina that showed
some promise. He figured he could teach him the finer points.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, Sanchez has earned a lion's share of Atlantic
10 honors (including first-team all-conference this season) and is
one of the primary reasons the Owls (21-10) enter the NCAA
Tournament as the sixth seed in the East Regional.
</P>
<P>
   The Owls, in the tournament for the 10th straight time, meet
11th-seeded Kent Friday at 2:30 p.m in their first-round game at
the FleetCenter.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he initially inquired about Temple, Sanchez had no
idea he would become one of the most celebrated guards in the
school's storied history. He had spent three seasons on Argentina's
junior national team, losing to a Stephon Marbury-led US squad in
the 1995 Pan American Games.
</P>
<P>
   Still, though he often posted impressive numbers (leading the
1995 World Championships in steals with 4.5 a game), it wasn't
until after he had signed with Temple that he discovered many
programs were interested in him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the intensity of play so I wonder if I could play over
there,'' said Sanchez, whose father, Carlos, attended one of
Chaney's clinics when his son was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Chaney had become a popular figure in Argentina after lecturing
there in 1979. Sanchez, who was 16 when he viewed his first US
college game on Argentinian cable television, became a fan and
wanted to play in the States. He asked Severini, a
Philadelphia-area soccer coach who grew up in Bahia Blanca, his
hometown, to put in a good word for him.
</P>
<P>
   Now Sanchez has become one of the top A-10 success stories in
recent years. Last season's defensive player of the year is
averaging 7.4 points and 5.8 assists a game. He led the conference
in assist-to-turnover ratio (2.95 to 1) this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez earned first-team defensive honors with 87 steals, six
short of his own mark of 93 in a season. His eight steals in
Temple's A-10 tournament semifinal win over Xavier tied his own
school mark, which he set twice last season. Sanchez as 266 career
steals, 15 shy of the Temple record set by Mark Macon.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez has shone in the classroom, too, making the A-10
All-Academic team for the second consecutive year and being named
GTE District 2 academic All-American.
</P>
<P>
   Though the 21-year-old entered Temple with budding athletic
talent, both he and Chaney agree it is his improving knowledge of
the game that has made him a celebrated player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basketball here, it's different, just like it was a different
world,'' said Sanchez. ``When I first got here, coach Chaney
started correcting things I didn't even think about, even nobody at
home thinks about. At home, it was just about making baskets,
period. Or making great passes. If you made a great pass, people
said you were good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I started learning different things like doing the right
things and taking care of the ball. I understand now how basketball
has developed here, and I know why American basketball is the best
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez said his defensive skills were initially developed from
playing soccer. Still, learning the other phases of the game
weren't easy, particularly when the teacher is a guy who doesn't
mince words.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a learning process that was hard for me, especially all
the discipline stuff,'' Sanchez said. ``But now, though I don't
like to talk about myself as a basketball player, I have improved
as a person. I always had discipline and work ethic but I had no
direction with that discipline.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney agreed, and added that Sanchez came to the program with
traits he often sees in foreign players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are feel-good players, happy-go-lucky, recreational
players,'' he said. ``Sometimes you holler at them and they quit.
Sometimes if you get pushy with them they get temperamental. So the
harder I got and the more argumentative Pepe became the worse I
got. I just kept pushing him to the point there he wanted to fight
me, because I didn't give a (expletive).
</P>
<P>
   ``If you know a person has some talent and some ability or if
you are speculating on it, the only thing you can do is keep
pushing until a light comes on in their head. Then you put them in
a tank of repetition where they say, `Hey something's going on,
here, and maybe it's beyond my control.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Chaney has had his moments with Sanchez this season,
particularly in last Saturday's loss A-10 championship loss to
Rhode Island when Sanchez stopped shooting after missing a few
times, and URI left him open to double-team other Owls. Still,
Chaney is the first to tell you the reserve of three years ago is
Temple's catalyst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone always has to be in charge,'' Chaney said. ``In my
house there was always a chair that only my father sat in, because
he was in charge. When I take one basketball I give it to one guy
to be in charge, and that's Pepe Sanchez.''

INITIAL NCAA GAMES CAN HOLD THE MOST FUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early days of the NCAA Tournament, there was no such
thing as seeding. First-round pairings were regional, and the main
perk awarded a team perceived to be powerful was a first-round bye.
The champions of the established franchises, such as the Big Ten,
the Pac 10, the ACC, and the SEC, were the normal recipients of
these byes.
</P>
<P>
   Numerical seeding began in 1979 on a 1-10 basis. The 7-10 and
8-9 teams played in the opening round, while 1-6 were advanced into
the second round. The current 1-16 seeding was instituted in 1985,
and the first teams to get No. 1s were Georgetown (East), Oklahoma
(Midwest), Michigan (Southeast), and St. John's (West).
</P>
<P>
   While most 1-16 and 2-15 games have been predictable and of the
84-60 variety, there have been some riveting games between teams
supposed to be Haves and teams supposed to be Have-Nots in the
first round. While the first No. 16 has yet to win a game, three
No. 15s have and a few No. 16s have come close.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five memorable first-round games. The first pre-dates
numerical seeding, to go along with two 1-16s and a pair of 2-15s.
But first pay attention to the words of former Louisiana Tech coach
Tommy Joe Eagles, who once said, ``This is March Madness, I
believe, and that's what makes it March Madness _ upsets.''

   1. March 13, 1976. Providence &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rutgers 54, Princeton 53 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Undefeated (28-0) Rutgers is staring at possible defeat when
Princeton's Pete Molloy heads to the line for a one-and-one with
four seconds left and the Scarlet Knights leading by 1. Coach Tom
Young takes two timeouts to ice the 5-foot-10-inch sub guard, and
it works as Molloy's first attempt hits the back rim and bounds
away. Princeton had complained that Molloy should have been
shooting two, anyway, but coach Pete Carril is philosophical
afterward, saying to Molloy, ``Just forget it. There are more
important things in life.'' Rutgers advances to its only Final
Four, where it is blown away by Michigan (86-70). Princeton will
have many more first-round heartaches before breaking through
against UCLA in 1996 for Carril's last victory.

   2. March 17, 1989. Providence &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 Georgetown 50, No. 16 Princeton 49 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The 19-7 Ivy League champs led by 8 at the half and 10 early in
the second half, subsisting almost entirely on a two-fold offensive
diet of threes and backdoor layups. The Tigers treat the basketball
like a winning lottery tricket (three turnovers). Georgetown (26-4)
is led by brawny freshman Alonzo Mourning, who finishes with 21
points, 13 rebounds, and 7 blocks, the last of which, on Princeton
center Kit Mueller, saves the game on the final possession.

   3. March 15, 1990. Knoxville, Tenn. &QL;

<P>
   No. 1 Michigan State 75, No. 16 Murray State 71 (OT) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Murray State (21-8), probably a bit underseeded to begin with,
battles into overtime when guard Greg Coble nails a 3-pointer at
the buzzer. The man who makes it all happen is none other than
Ronald Jerome ``Popeye'' Jones, whose dazzling variety of inside
moves chew up the Spartans (26-5) for 37 points. But the OT belongs
to future NBA All-Star Steve Smith, who scores 6 of his 22 as the
Big Ten champs escape with both a victory and a bruised ego.

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. March 14, 1991. College Park, Md. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Richmond 73, No. 2 Syracuse 69 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Richmond (21-9) controls the game from the opening tap,
bothering the Orangemen (21-9) with a confusing matchup zone to
become the first 15 seed to knock off a 2. Curtis Blair (18 points)
is on target throughout, but the big 'Cuse-killer is sub Terry
Connolly, who bounds off coach Dick Tarrant's bench with 14 points,
7 rebounds, and 5 assists. ``It wasn't a case of us playing
poorly,'' sighs Syracuse coach Jim Boeheim, whose team never leads.
``We played this way all year long.''

   5. March 18, 1993. Salt Lake City &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No. 15 Santa Clara 64, No. 2 Arizona 61 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you're 24-3 Arizona, and you score 14 unanswered points at
the end of the half and 11 more without an opposing whimper to
start the second half, you might figure that a 25-0 run would
decide the game, correct? Not this time. The resilient Broncos
(18-11) shrug it all off, regain their poise, and come back behind
the play of Steve Nash to pull the game out. The dramatics continue
'til the end as the Broncos miss four free throws in the final
seconds and Damon Stoudamire watches his attempt for a game-tying 3
at the buzzer bounce off the rim.

31 on 15-for-17 shooting . . . 1985: In the first year of 1-16
seeding, Fairleigh Dickinson goes up by 10 in second half and hangs
with Michigan until the final minute before losing, 59-55 . . .
March 13, 1986: No. 1 seed Duke is terrified by fearless
Mississippi Valley State, which makes 12 steals and blocks five
Blue Devil shots. Duke doesn't gain control until the fourth MVS
starter gets his fourth foul. Johnny Dawkins pops in 16 of his 27
in the final 5:44 as Duke escapes, 85-78 . . . 1989: No. 16 seed
East Tennesssee State, twice up by 17 against No. 1 seed Oklahoma,
loses in overtime, 72-71 . . . 1996: Gabe Lewullis fakes, re-loads,
and goes again for the winning backdoor layup from center Steve
Goodrich as No. 4 Princeton finally bags a buck to hang over the
mantel by defeating No. 13 UCLA, 43-41. On the same day Western
Carolina, a 16, takes Purdue, a 1, to the wire in a 73-71 game. The
final seconds include a missed layup, a blocked layup, and two more
misses. ``We didn't deserve to lose,'' said coach Phil Hopkins.
``We deserved to win.'' . . . 1998: Cincinnati (2) needs a
3-pointer by D'Juan Baker with 3.6 seconds left to hold off No. 15
Northern Arizona, 65-62 . . . Also 1998: Bryce Drew's

lifts No. 13 Valparaiso past No. 4 Mississippi, 70-69.

HOLYFIELD-LEWIS TRAINERS SQUARE OFF 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ They don't like each other much, which is why they
will be happy to get into separate corners of the ring at Madison
Square Garden Saturday night to settle their differences the best
way they can.
</P>
<P>
   They will be there with the same aim _ to beat the other down
and capture what promoter Don King is calling ``the unmitigated,
unadulterated, undisputed heavyweight championship of the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   While Holyfield and Lewis have been reasonably respectful of
each other, their trainers have been barely able to conceal the
enmity they feel for each other. The source of this is difficult to
determine, but Don Turner and Emanuel Steward are contemporaries
who have been around boxing for all of their adult lives, so their
paths have crossed many times.
</P>
<P>
   Steward, who trains Lewis, has never forgiven Holyfield for
replacing him with Turner not long after Steward had helped
Holyfield win back the heavywight title he lost to Riddick Bowe.
Turner has never forgotten the time that Steward, he believes,
tried to steal three of his fighters while they were training near
him.
</P>
<P>
   None of these actions are unusual in boxing. Neither is enmity
between competitors. But a week ago Turner went so far as to refuse
to do a teleconference with Steward out of concern for what he
might say if he heard the wrong thing coming out of his rival's
mouth. And they were scheduled to appear on a television show in
New York Sunday but refused, sources said, in part because Turner
is tired of Steward giving him little credit for Holyfield's recent
stirring performances and in part because Steward still believes
he, not Turner, is the one who remade the three-time heavyweight
champion's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know exactly what it is between them,'' said a
high-ranking source in the promotion, ``but when you're around them
it's pretty obvious they don't like each other much. You can feel
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward refuses to talk directly about it and so does Turner,
but when asked about the situation Monday, Holyfield's trainer did
say, ``I know the real Emanuel Steward. Not everybody knows the
real Emanuel. Emanuel gets jealous. He's so egotistical. He wants
everybody to think he's the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that's OK. I been married to the same woman for 34 years.
I'm 59 years old and just had cancer and I'm healthy again. I'm
happy with this time in my life. If I could beat cancer, why I got
to worry about Emanuel Steward?
</P>
<P>
   ``He's just jealous of Holyfield. He's like a crab in a barrel,
trying to pull everybody else down. So fine. When Holyfield knocks
his guy out, I got nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing could be farther from the truth, of course. Holyfield
imported Turner after firing Steward over money because he had been
impressed with the job Turner did preparing aged Larry Holmes when
the two of them fought a long and surprisingly difficult fight for
Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   In his first fight with Turner, Holyfield looked awful in losing
the title to Michael Moorer on a night when some claimed he
suffered heart problems.
</P>
<P>
   When Holyfield chose to reject the advice of many in boxing and
continued fighting, he kept Turner by his side, which is not the
normal reaction after a champion loses. Normally he blames the
trainer, as Lewis did the night a Steward-trained Oliver McCall
knocked him out to take the World Boxing Council title. But
Turner's stock with Holyfield rose more in defeat than it could
have in victory because he noticed Turner made no effort to blame
the fighter, as trainers so often do in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   They have been together through seven fights and nearly five
years that saw Holyfield lose his title to Moorer and his third
fight with Bowe but also win back the World Boxing Association
title by destroying Mike Tyson and then take the International
Boxing Federation crown from Moorer with an eighth-round stoppage
16 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it has come to this, a two-pronged battle between two boxers
and two trainers with long histories and longer memories. Steward
is a Hall of Fame trainer who has said Lewis would be the greatest
heavyweight of all time once he finished ``polishing his rough
edges.'' He also said that Holyfield's wins over Tyson were
predictable and gives Turner little credit for them. Beyond that,
he has promised Lewis will stop Holyfield Saturday night because
``Evander is a little man and Lennox is a big man.''
</P>
<P>
   Turner has said little but to echo Holyfield's guarantee that he
will stop Lewis in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``All through history, size hasn't meant that much in boxing,''
Turner said. ``Bowe is the only big man Evander ever had a problem
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander wants to win this badder than he wanted Tyson. He's
been putting in overtime to get ready. The beauty of boxing is the
trainers can say all they want but they don't fight. The fighters
do. The rest of us watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Lennox rises to the occasion, I just think Evander will
rise a little bit higher.''
</P>
<P>
   If he does, he'll take Don Turner with him. Right to the top.

EHLERS GETS THE PROBLEM IRONED OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTON, Pa. _ Brian Ehlers would have been scratching his head,
if he'd had the strength.
</P>
<P>
   Fran O'Hanlon could merely shake his.
</P>
<P>
   Both could see that Ehlers didn't belong on the same court with
his elders among the Lafayette College basketball team. Neither
could see why.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers was doing just as much running as his fellow Leopards. He
was just as diligent on the weights. No, that wasn't true. If
anything, he was doing more work than any of the veterans, putting
himself through ferocious workouts after his teammates had left
Kirby Field House, working maniacally with assistant coach Pat
Brogan to refine his defensive technique.
</P>
<P>
   And getting nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before head coach O'Hanlon began wondering
whether the ruthless shooter he'd lured from Bay Shore, N.Y., to
help resurrect a 2-25 laughingstock had been a monumental waste of
recruiting vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was always trying to do the same things we were doing,''
said O'Hanlon. ``And he was always working trying to get better.
But he never seemed to be in shape. I started thinking this wasn't
the same kid I'd seen in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers agreed wholeheartedly. A year after averaging 31.4 points
a game as the Suffolk County Player of the Year, he began thinking
he was out of his league _ a nonscholarship league at that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hard adjustment,'' he said. ``I think the strength
factor was the toughest. I realized you can't take a play off at
this level.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially when you don't have the strength to begin with. It
turned out that was the dirty secret of Brian Ehlers's struggles,
not sloth or ineptitude.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking a logical explanation, O'Hanlon finally figured,
``There's got to be something wrong with this kid,'' and dispatched
him to the infirmary.
</P>
<P>
   There a battery of tests revealed an iron deficiency, a
supplement was prescribed, and Ehlers finally had his legs back.
</P>
<P>
   His steely eye and iron will never had abandoned him, and now,
two years later, the junior guard is the Patriot League scoring
champion (18.2 points per game), Player of the Year, and tournament
MVP. He's also no small reason that Lafayette is in the NCAA
Tournament for the first time in 42 years, a 15th seed hoping to
topple No. 2 Miami Friday at the FleetCenter in the first round of
the East subregional.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could see the difference right away,'' Ehlers recalled of
the medical discovery. ``Suddenly, I was able to keep up. I wasn't
getting tired anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Now all that remained was a little fine-tuning of his psyche.
One of the major attractions O'Hanlon had seen in Ehlers during his
high school courtship was the 6-foot-4-inch, 195-pounder's
gunslinger's instinct, his hunger to take the deciding shot, and
utter conviction that he would make it.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hanlon wanted to assure Ehlers that such an attitude was
perfectly welcome in the Lafayette program. So during Ehlers's
freshman season, with the Leopards trailing Bucknell by a point and
five seconds left, the coach raised the eyebrows of his
upperclassmen and designed the climactic play for Ehlers: take the
ball downcourt, look for his shot, or dish off.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers took the ball downcourt. He looked for his shot.
</P>
<P>
   He missed.
</P>
<P>
   With no avenue of escape from the gym a despondent Ehlers felt
compelled to apologize to his coach, who immediately set him
straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Brian I had you take the shot because I wanted
you to take the shot,' '' recalled O'Hanlon. `` `So what if you
missed? You're going to take a lot more of those and you're going
to make a lot more of those.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The consolation prize _ his coach's unyielding faith _ buoyed
Ehlers. ``Just knowing the coach and players had confidence in me
in that situation made me feel good,'' he said. ``I've always
wanted to have the ball in my hands in that situation ever since
I've been playing ball. I want to be the guy with the ball in his
hands at the end.''
</P>
<P>
   That's pretty much where it's been for the past two seasons, and
both Ehlers and Lafayette have reaped the benefits. Last year he
was second-team all-league and Lafayette just missed an NCAA bid
when it lost the Patriot final to Navy.
</P>
<P>
   This year the results have been more rewarding, even as the task
has been more daunting. The Leopards' summer turned nightmarish
when center Stefan Ciosici, the reigning Patriot Player of the
Year, tore his anterior cruciate ligament during a camp pickup game
and was lost for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really devastated for him,'' said Ehlers. ``And it was
really hard for the team. But I also think we realized that even
without Stefan, we had a great team, people who could step in, who
had a chance to do more.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Ehlers. He has scored in double figures in every
game while shooting 49.7 percent. He killed Bucknell twice during
the regular season, once at the last second, then with a late
3-pointer that wrapped up the league crown. In the tournament, he
kept Lafayette alive with a buzzer-beater that disposed of Colgate
in the semifinals. And in last Friday's title game, he shook off an
indifferent first half (1 for 4) to finish with 16 points, tied for
the team high, while foiling Bucknell yet again with clutch hoops.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the great unknown, the Leopards' foray into the NCAAs,
where if tradition and seeding form hold, they won't linger.
</P>
<P>
   Ehlers is aware of that, and undaunted by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great accomplishment to get this far,'' he said, ``but
you always want to do more. Being the underdog makes us all looser.
We know we have nothing to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   And if by chance Lafayette finds it has something to win at the
end of the game against Miami, Brian Ehlers knows he'll have the
strength _ in every sense _ to take the deciding shot.

PROMOTER DON KING, HBO'S SETH ABRAHAM BACK IN THE SAME CORNER 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Oscar and Felix returned to Broadway not so long ago,
so why shouldn't Seth and Don get back into boxing's big arena on
Broadway, too?
</P>
<P>
   The successful return of ``The Odd Couple'' to a Broadway stage
was no less remarkable than the recent return of boxing's Odd
Couple to the production of big-time fights. The latter alliance
began in 1978 but had come to a grisly end in 1990 after HBO Sports
president Seth Abraham refused to remove commentator Larry Merchant
from Mike Tyson's boxing shows after promoter Don King promised
Tyson that would be part of their new contract.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson was irate, and his bombastic promoter ``went across the
street,'' as both sides now put it, taking Tyson to Showtime, HBO's
bitter rival. Thus began eight years of business acrimony that
overrode a longstanding personal friendship and led in large part
to the consistent blocking of every major match the sport needed to
prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, that squabble, plus the endless chicanery of boxing
sanctioning bodies and the usual greed of promoters, managers and,
yes, often the fighters themselves, led the sport toward what many
felt was the sad sunset of its existence. Gone were the networks.
Gone were most major advertisers. Gone were the marquee names and a
way to create new ones. Gone, all too often, were the fans
themselves, for they could no longer make sense of it all.
</P>
<P>
   But boxing, like so many of its legendary practitioners, is
resilient beyond logic. Mismatches, bad matches, and for too long
no matches have wounded it, some say marginalized it in the United
States, yet the sport still stands, bloody but unbowed, and
apparently the public still stands with it.
</P>
<P>
   The proof is the almost instantaneous sellout of next Saturday's
heavyweight unification fight between Evander Holyfield and Lennox
Lewis at Madison Square Garden. That could easily be seen as an
aberration, except that it comes on the heels of near-record
pay-per-view sales for a non-heavyweight fight when welterweight
champion Oscar De La Hoya squared off with Ike Quartey last month,
a remarkable 16.5 television rating and 28 share for the Pernell
Whitaker-Felix Trinidad match a week later on HBO, the network's
highest rating for a live fight in four years, and the fact that
HBO has now had 11 straight boxing shows do double-digit ratings.
</P>
<P>
   New talent has begun to emerge in Michael Grant, Shane Mosley,
Floyd Mayweather Jr., Fernando Vargas, Vitali Klitchko, Tim Austin,
James Page, and others. ESPN2's reconfigured ``Friday Night
Fights'' has drawn consistently solid ratings. And when TNT tried
its hand in boxing in September, it racked up a rating 24 percent
higher than its NBA broadcasts get.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it is not just numbers that indicate boxing is alive again,
but also the presence of three straight championship matches that
fight fans craved in the past month. The public's reaction has
signaled anew that there is always life in boxing if the right
fight is made. But it was not until King and Abraham agreed to do
business again that such matches could become reality.
</P>
<P>
   Big fights, or at least the promise of them, keep boxing in the
public eye during the long months of bad matches, mismatches, and
worse matches. It is for fights such as Muhammad Ali-Joe Frazier
that fans suffer through Muhammad Ali-Richard Dunn. It is for
Marvin Hagler-Thomas Hearns nights that they tolerate Marvin
Hagler-Wilford Scypion. It is for moments such as George Foreman
standing over a fallen Michael Moorer to become the oldest
heavyweight champion in history that they accept George
Foreman-Jimmy Ellis. But even boxing fans will pay that price for
only so long, and the sport was beginning to wither on the vine
during the years of enmity between King and HBO.
</P>
<P>
   That has become more obvious since their recent detente led to
Trinidad's win over Whitaker, the Holyfield-Lewis showdown, and the
possibility of a unification bout between Trinidad and Oscar De La
Hoya before the year is out.
</P>
<P>
   How did this happen and why? How did King get away with bringing
the biggest fighters he had at least temporarily to HBO from
Showtime and why did HBO, the most economically powerful force in
the sport, agree to it knowing that if its fighters lose, Showtime
will reap the benefit? The simple answer is that rapper Puff Daddy
was onto something when he sang, ``It's all about the Benjamins,
baby.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `This is what the people wanted,'' King insisted, while
acknowledging, too, that it was the only way to make big money.
``It was a necessity. At this stage, I could do without boxing and
do well, but I continue to work in it because it's a people
business and my power lies in my people ties. If you give the
people what they want, they will respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``In boxing, you can't take nothing for granted, even granite
itself, but if you're dealing with what's practical and real, these
are the biggest events that could be put on. I don't want to argue
any more which network the fight is on. People want to see some
fights. If my guys win, Showtime has it made.''
</P>
<P>
   That is certainly true for Saturday's fight and it, like
Trinidad-Whitaker and De La Hoya-Quartey, is being put on by HBO
and its pay-per-view arm, TVKO, in large part because they were
willing to pay the most and risk losing the titles two of their top
draws hold without an option on their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   King took the same gamble and won when Trinidad easily defeated
Whitaker. Now he's gambling on Holyfield, betting that his man will
win and he'll take the undisputed champion back to Showtime for a
summertime fight against Henry Akinwande for more money.
</P>
<P>
   This has not happened because of a sudden sense of largess on
the part of King or Abraham. It's primarily because the sport had
sunk to a depth where all sides realized a major change in the way
they did business had to happen or boxing could slide so far off
the radar screen that not even the burgeoning Hispanic market would
save it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is enjoying a bit of a renaissance,'' Abraham said
during a breakfast meeting recently in HBO's Manhattan offices.
``It's not the Golden Age but it's better than tin. At 67 or 68,
Don and Bob (Arum) should be looking at their legacy in boxing.
They've made plenty of money. It's time to leave something to the
sport. These fights help do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don and I realized together we could make some big fights. We
had a trial separation that lasted eight years but it didn't work.
After we made Lewis-Holyfield I was hoping it wouldn't be a
one-date relationship. It wasn't. We made Trinidad-Whitaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don wasn't boxed in there. It was a very level playing field
and he made the deal. He promoted it and generated record numbers.
That one goes in Don's column. He didn't have to make that fight
but he did. Against all odds, boxing people sometimes use common
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, King responded between bites of scrambled eggs, ``We
didn't ever have no issues but one. No one was more shocked, hurt,
or disappointed than me to leave HBO over a commentator. We'd made
a lot of history together. You can say it was a miscommunication or
call it what you will or may but that was the only issue between
Seth and me, from my perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm with Showtime now. My loyalty is there. I'd love to see
them get these fights but I know the history. HBO's got contracts
and they dig in their heels. This is no battle of the networks. I'd
love to see Showtime broadcast Oscar and Trinidad but don't let the
fight die because HBO's got a contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth understands where my loyalties lie but we put it aside to
make big fights Showtime couldn't make. The world needed to see
those fights. The world needs to see a unification of the
heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seth has a similar passion as I do for this game. We're trying
to get together to bring sanity into this insanity. We're trying to
be winners not whiners. That's why we've come together.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   HBO and King have given the world Trinidad's first big fight and
created a viable rival in the public's eyes for De La Hoya, which
is a key to building interest. Now comes Holyfield-Lewis, a fight
that had been discussed and abandoned twice before Holyfield
ordered King to make it and King gambled his biggest draw knowing
that if he loses he will be alone without HBO's dollars or the
power of the heavyweight championship behind him.
</P>
<P>
   But if Holyfield wins, he will not be alone atop the boxing
world. King will be there with him and, they believe, fight fans
will support them both in a way they have had no reason to in
recent years.

   TAKE-BOS  
 NEW YORK: ... recent years.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Lewis-Holyfield will be the centerpiece of American sports
Saturday night,'' Abraham insisted. ``We're expecting over a
million buys (at $49.95 each). People want to see the spectacle.
There are two kinds of boxing. There's boxing and heavyweight
boxing. Lewis-Holyfield is that second, magical sport. The
undisputed heavyweight champion is the closest thing we have to
Superman. There's something magical about it.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the magical things about it is that the undisputed
champion recently disappeared. There has not been one since Riddick
Bowe beat Holyfield and threw the World Boxing Council belt into a
trash can in London rather than make a deal with Lewis. What
followed was Lewis being named WBC champion retroactively, handed
the title for beating Razor Ruddock even though that was not a
title bout at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis would lose that title to Oliver McCall, a King fighter,
and two years after that win it back from McCall when it was again
vacant. There is no need to explain this further; the confusion you
feel at the moment is why boxing was in such sorry shape when King
and HBO rejoined forces in December. Almost immediately, King
insists, the fruits of his services became evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``First fight out and Trinidad is the highest-rated program on
HBO since Foreman-(Axel) Schulz,'' King said. ``Out of the top 10
rated programs in their history, I've had eight. I go away and they
struggle. I come back and they do the biggest program they had in
years. It shows again Don King makes the difference. I have the
distinct ability to bring in the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I got the biggest event in the Garden's history. It's four
times bigger, moneywise, than any promotion they've had. What was
the missing element? They had great fights before. Again, Don King
makes the difference. This is something you can verify. People can
say what they will or may but I'm ecstatic with delight.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is little you can verify in boxing except the results, and
sometimes not even those, but there's no question fight fans are
ecstatic with delight because they are finally getting the matches
they've longed for. But is boxing truly in a renaissance or is this
a mere moment of market-driven clarity that will soon turn myopic
after the checks are cashed?
</P>
<P>
   That is difficult to say, but Showtime executive Jay Larkin
indicated that a De La Hoya-Trinidad fight this year may not be as
simple as some want to think.
</P>
<P>
   ``Big fights are very good for boxing,'' Larkin said. ``That's
why we stepped aside and let these go to HBO. We've done more than
enough to show we're not obstructionists, but we're at a point
where we feel we've taken walkover after mismatch to maintain
Trinidad and we'd like to see our investment pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's conceivable that fight ends up over there (HBO) but our
deal is not with the fighters. It's with the promoter (King).
Through him we can insist our rights be looked after. Don would
like to work both sides of the street. We have no problem with that
if our rights are protected.''
</P>
<P>
   That makes it sound like continuing this flurry of big fights
may be more difficult than it appears. Yet the fact is HBO has an
exclusive contract with De La Hoya that prevents him from fighting
elsewhere and a three-fight deal with Trinidad. King promotes
Trinidad and has a promotional deal with Showtime. He can't deliver
De La Hoya, or even Trinidad now, and he has an out clause in his
Showtime deal that allows him to sell pay-per-view fights to the
highest bidder.
</P>
<P>
   Yet King is not stupid. He knows that if a third straight
big-money fight ends up with his new partner, his old partners may
make him pay for it when his own deal with Showtime expires at the
end of the year. In the past, these types of entanglements led many
a great fight to dissolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boxing is firmly established as a niche sport,'' said NBC
Sports executive Kevin Monaghan, who used to buy fights for his
network before it got out of the business. ``The names are
developed on cable now. It's a mainstream sport for Latino fans.
They talk about it. But it's not a regular topic of most sports
fans except when there's a big fight like Holyfield-Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's been less of it on TV so it's become more of a
novelty and so it gets bigger ratings. There's some more value back
in it but HBO wanted a sport it could dominate and it did a
wonderful job doing that. It changed the business model to the
point the networks can't afford boxing.
</P>
<P>
   ``HBO paid a premium to lock up the sport. It got its victory,
but at what price? Now not enough people know Felix Trinidad
because he only fights on cable. That's an ongoing problem for the
sport: how to create new stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``So have things improved? Yes. Is boxing healthier? Yes. But it
won't ever be what it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly not, but Abraham understands that if the men who run
the sport make alliances like the one he and King have forged,
boxing can flourish again. That is why he spent last week cajoling
Roy Jones Jr.'s promoter, Murad Muhammad, to persuade Jones that a
unification fight with Reggie Johnson for the light heavyweight
title should not be priced out of existence by demands for a $7
million payday.
</P>
<P>
   It is also why he sent out the word recently that while the
biggest money in boxing is still at HBO, the way to get it may have
become more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last two months we've gone to every promoter we do
business with and told them no more Ricky Frazier fights (an
embarrassment in which Jones destroyed an overmatched New York cop
in two rounds),'' Abraham said. ``We'll use every means available
to enforce that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told them all if they want to keep fighting here they have
to stop thinking they're a house fighter that we're protecting.
When the sport is healthy, it benefits all of us.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lewis had a contract with HBO that is ironclad. We didn't have
to budge but we softened the edges to send Don a message that we
weren't going to stuff a deal down his throat because we knew we
wouldn't be able to make other deals and that's what we all know
the sport needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``So Saturday night is bigger than just a prize fight. It's an
event. The celebrities want tickets. They want to be seen here.
That creates interest in boxing. We didn't have to sell this to
fight fans. We had to sell it to the rest of the community. No one
can do that better than Don King.''
</P>
<P>
   The proof of that is in the selling, and a week ago King sold
foreign broadcast rights in Bosnia, a country torn apart by civil
war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten both sides to put a moratorium on March 13,'' King
said. ``They gonna stop fighting to watch the fight. Then they can
go back to shooting. That's the power of big-time boxing.''
</P>
<P>
   Try and do that in Bosnia with the Final Four.

WHAT THE EURO WILL MEAN TO TRAVELERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The euro is here.
</P>
<P>
   The new single currency of 11 nations has been called ``Europe's
single most daring venture of our time,'' according to Jacques
Santer, president of the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   The euro will cover nearly 300 million people and a vast economy
comparable to that of the United States. It is trading this week at
.91 units to the US dollar.
</P>
<P>
   When it fully takes, the new currency should make travel for
Americans a lot easier, especially those on grand tours covering
many nations in a week or two. There will be less translating
dollars into local currencies, and spotting a good buy will also be
a lot easier. However, some analysts predict the coming of the euro
will mean higher prices in less-expensive regions and lower prices
in high-cost areas.
</P>
<P>
   While the euro officially arrived on Jan. 1, travelers will not
see much of a change until Jan. 1, 2002. Until then, you'll still
deal in local currencies. You'll pay in francs, pounds, lire, etc.
When you exchange dollars for notes or coins, you will still
receive national currencies _ the only difference will be that
these currencies will be fixed to the euro and will be close to
what they are now. And when you exchange one of the national
currencies for another, the rate will not fluctuate because all
these currencies will be fixed to the euro and therefore fixed to
each other.
</P>
<P>
   You will see prices in both the euro and the local currency.
This is being done to acquaint Europeans with the value of the
euro. While some companies plan to add euro traveler's checks to
their offerings, these will be good for exchange in national
currencies. Some credit card purchases may be charged in euros; if
so, the credit card company will convert the euro charge to dollars
on the bill you receive when home, just as they do now on current
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   Not all European Union nations are participating in the new
currency. Those that are include Austria, Belgium, Finland, France,
Germany, Holland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Spain, and Portugal.
Opting out at this time are Britain, Denmark, and Sweden. Greece
hopes to qualify soon.
</P>
<P>
   With the inauguration of euro notes in 2002, US visitors will
then receive only euros when exchanging dollars in banks and ATM
machines, although travelers will still encounter national
currencies in transactions with individuals and business. The
withdrawal of francs, marks, lire, etc., begins on Jan. 1, 2002,
and is expected to be completed by July of that year. At that time,
the euro will stand alone in the 11 participating countries.

   TWA is offering international travelers cellular and satelite
phone rentals. Although all TWA international passengers will be
able to rent a phone, Trans World One (TWA's premium business class
service) passengers will receive free phones for a week.
</P>
<P>
   British Airways is featuring ``create your own vacation'' in
London, the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Europe. The program offers
more options, from hotels in London for $39 to $233 a person a
night, to black taxicab tours, to apartment rentals (great for
families). For those booking by March 31, the airline is offering
discounts of $100 a person on packages valued at $300 and $200 to
those purchasing land arrangements costing at least $500 a person.

PORTLAND: WARM ON THE INSIDE

<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Maine _ This is a city for all seasons, including
snowy winters and wet springs. There are indoor attractions aplenty
to complement the outdoor ones, even in March.
</P>
<P>
   A two-hour drive from Boston, Portland is a compact waterfront
city of 65,000. Nothing in the eminently walkable downtown _ which
has undergone a renaissance in recent years _ is hard to reach. If
the weather turns foul, there is someplace inviting to duck into
nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Under the vast timbered ceiling of the new Portland Public
Market, for instance, it's always harvest time. The latest addition
to the lively downtown scene, the market is an urban oasis and a
showcase for Maine's agricultural and marine bounty, from poultry
to potatoes, from eels to elk steaks. You can get bison burgers
made from Maine-bred buffalo and fresh fillets from Down East
salmon farms.
</P>
<P>
   The 23 vendors at the market, which opened in October, include
purveyors of ice cream, homemade pies, wines, fresh fish and
lobster, aged cheeses, exotic coffees, flowers, fresh-baked bread
(made with wheat grown in northernmost Aroostook County), hot
soups, and local crafts. There is, in addition, an unusual amenity
for a farmers' market: a large fireplace flanked by stone benches,
an ideal place to linger on a chilly day over a cup of cappuccino
or a glass of cider.
</P>
<P>
   The market's dramatic interior is frequently used for concerts
and special events. (For information, call 207-228-2000. The
market, at the corner of Preble and Cumberland streets, is open
7-6, Monday-Saturday; 10-5, Sunday.) A covered skybridge connects
it to a garage that provides two hours of free parking with a
validated ticket.
</P>
<P>
   A few blocks from the market is the Old Port, a restored
neighborhood that runs back from the waterfront, and is known for
its restaurants, boutiques, specialty stores, and brew pubs.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is the largest fishing port in the area, and the
waterfront _ also a departure point for ferries to Nova Scotia and
the Casco Bay islands _ is active and atmospheric year-round.
</P>
<P>
   Close by, at 7 Congress Square, is the Portland Museum of Art.
One of the best medium-size museums in New England, it has a fine
collection of paintings by artists who have lived and worked in
Maine, such as Robert Henri, Rockwell Kent, and Andrew Wyeth. It
also organizes major special exhibits such as the current ``Louise
Nevelson: Structures Evolving,'' on view until March 21. Considered
one of the country's most innovative sculptors and print makers,
Nevelson, who died in 1988, grew up in Rockland. (Admission: $6,
adults; $5, seniors and students; $1, children 6-12. Open Tuesday,
Wednesday, Saturday, 10-5; Thursday-Friday, 10-9; Sunday 12-5;
closed Monday. Information: 207-773-2787.)
</P>
<P>
   The area around the museum is officially designated ``the Art
District,'' and there are several galleries, including the Frost
Gully Gallery at 411 Congress, which specializes in Maine art. The
Maine College of Art at 522 Congress, which occupies the
turn-of-the-century former Porteous department store building, has
galleries displaying the work of students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   Housed nearby in a handsome Greek Revival building, the
Children's Museum of Maine, at 142 Free St., is usually filled with
happy kids and beaming parents. Interactive exhibits simulate Maine
landscapes, including a fishing pier complete with lobster boat, a
flowing stream, a mountain traverse, a bear's den (appropriately
dark and just a little spooky), and a giant pine tree that invites
climbing. (General admission $5; under 1 year old, free. Open:
Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, 10-5; Thursday, 9-5; Sunday 12-5;
closed Monday-Tuesday. Information: 207-828-1234, ext. 001.)
</P>
<P>
   The Old Port is between Commercial Street (which parallels the
waterfront) and Congress, a neighborhood of narrow cobblestoned
streets lined with 19th-century brick and granite buildings, most
restored within the last dozen years. Shops sell tacky T-shirts and
souvenirs, but also upscale jewelry, clothing, and hand-crafted
glass and pottery.
</P>
<P>
   Portland is a restaurant mecca, with most in the Old Port or
along the waterfront. There is a restaurant for just about every
taste and budget, and following your nose isn't a bad way to both
sightsee and find some food. Local favorites for fresh seafood at
moderate prices, in an informal atmosphere, include Gilbert's
Chowder House, 92 Commercial St., and the Porthole, around the
corner at 32 Customs Wharf. The core early-morning clientele of
both are fishermen, which says something.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most popular of the brew pubs is Gritty McDuff's, 396
Fore St. Gritty's brews its own ale, stout, and bitter and serves
fish and chips, shepherd's pie, and other pub-grub favorites. The
paneled decor is pubby as well. Portland has a long and lively pub
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer the city erected a statue to the late movie director
and local resident John Ford _ born Sean Aloysius O'Feeney in 1895
_ at the corner of Center and Pleasant streets. The statue shows
Ford sitting in a director's chair gazing pensively at the spot,
now a parking lot, where his Irish immigrant father ran a saloon
catering to thirsty dock workers.
</P>
<P>
   Besides restaurants and pubs, Portland also has a lot of
bookstores for a city its size. Books Etc. at 38 Exchange St. in
the Old Port is a general-interest independent bookstore with a
good selection of books about Maine and by its authors. Allen Scott
Books at 89 Exchange specializes in used, scarce, and out-of-print
books and has a room devoted to secondhand and rare children's
books. Also rewarding to browse are Cunningham Books in Longfellow
Square at the east end of Congress and Carlson &AMP; Turner Antiquarian
Books at 241 Congress, which stocks 75,000 older books.
</P>
<P>
   A magnet in Portland for railroad buffs of all ages is the Maine
Narrow Gauge Railroad Co. and Museum, on the waterfront at 58 Fore
St. All of the locomotives and cars in the museum were built _ some
as long as 117 years ago _ for use in parts of Maine, commonly to
haul logs and carry passengers through the North Woods. However,
for 50 years they chugged through the cranberry bogs of Carver in
southeastern Massachusetts as the Edaville Railroad, a popular
tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   Edaville closed in 1991, and the antique rolling stock was
brought back here. The train museum is housed in one of the old
red-brick buildings of a harborside industrial complex where
locomotives were once manufactured. The museum also operates 1 1/2
miles of 2-foot-wide track and offers rides. The rides, which last
about 30 minutes, are available weekends only until mid-May, when
the daily schedule resumes.
</P>
<P>
   (The Narrow Gauge Museum, open daily 10-4, is free. Excursion
rides are $5 for adults, $4 for seniors, $3 for children 4-12.
Information: 207-828-0814.)

THESE PLACES RATE A `OUI' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD P. CARPENTER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you're looking for one of the hottest restaurants in Paris,
visit the crowded but cool Le Buddha Bar or the Louvre's chic Cafe
Marly. But if you want to avoid a dreadful dining experience, skip
the area around Pigalle, which has become ``tacky and touristy.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the advice of Jacques Pillet, head concierge at Paris's
elegant Hotel Meurice, writing in A: the Audley Group Hotel
Magazine. More advice:
</P>
<P>
   --Best food. L'Ambroisie, Alain Ducasse, Pierrre Gagnaire,
Laurent, Guy Savoy, and Le Grand Vefour.
</P>
<P>
   --Best breakfast. ``The homemade viennoiserie and fine teas and
coffees at Dalloyau . . . place it at the pinnacle of Parisian
breakfasts.''
</P>
<P>
   --Best afternoon tea. English style: Marriages et Freres.
Parisian style: Laduree (oh, those macaroons!).
</P>
<P>
   --Best spot for a quiet romantic drink. The Forum bar or La
Closerie de Lilas.
</P>
<P>
   --Best show. The Moulin Rouge is still the top Parisian cabaret.
(Expect mostly tourists there, however. That, at least, was our
experience.)
</P>
<P>
   --Hottest clubs. Les Bains Douches, Le Queen, and Niel's.
</P>
<P>
   --Best shopping. The 6th arrondissement represents ``the epitome
of Left Bank chic'' with high-style shops like Sonia Rykiel and
Prada. Also check out Armani's new Emporio Saint-Germain, the
Versace Collection (also on the Boulevard Saint-Germain in the 7th
arrondissement), and the smart antiques shops around the Quai
Voltaire.
</P>
<P>
   --Best souvenir shopping. For general souvenirs, the arcades of
the Rue de Rivoli. For china and glassware, the Rue du Paradis.
Also: Fauchon for gourmet delicacies, Debauve &AMP; Gallais for
chocolates, and La Maison de la Truffe for wondrous truffles.
</P>
<P>
   --Best view of the city. Although the Eiffel Tower and
Montmartre are the classic sites, the Meurice staff recommends the
view from the 59th-floor Terrace of the Tour Montparnasse, and,
understandably, the panorama from the Meurice's newly refurbished
penthouse suite. (For more information on the Hotel Meurice, call
33 (1) 44 58 10 10.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel Trivia: Where in Europe will you find the 3,323-foot-long
April the 25th Bridge? (Answer at end of column.) &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a name: In France, Germany, and Great Britain, a US billion is
known as a milliard. &QL; 
 &QL; 
In a phrase: We say, ``Let's Splurge.'' In Great Britain, they say,
``Let's splash out.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Quotable: ``You cannot extinguish the Irish passion for freedom.''
_ Padraic Pearse, in 1916. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Rhyme time: In warm weather, Dublin's River Liffey can be a bit
aromatic. At such times, local wags refer to it as the ``Sniffy
Liffey.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Fascinating fact: The channel between England and France grows 300
mm (11.81 inches) each year. (With thanks to uselessfacts.net via
frequent contributor Mike Schuster of Foxborough, who adds, ``I'm
sure both the British and the French are happy about this.'') &QL; 
 &QL; 
Travel bookshelf: ``Daytrips Ireland'' by Patricia Tunison Preston
(Hastings House, $14.95) offers step-by-step information on 50
one-day getaways from wherever you are in the Emerald Isle. There
are 22 walking tours, 24 tours using a car and/or public
transportation, and four tours that combine walking and public
transportation. Fifty-five maps are also included. &QL; 
 &QL; 
A multistar hotel: What do Stephen Spielberg, Franco Zefferelli,
Elizabeth Taylor, Marlon Brando, Harrison Ford, Warren Beatty,
Shirley MacLaine, Liza Minnelli, Lauren Bacall, Charlton Heston,
Olivia Newton-John, Victoria Principal, Robert Wagner, and
Stephanie Powers have in common, other than the movies? They are
among the many celebrities who have stayed at the Athenaeum Hotel
in London's West End. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Oh, that Winston: The underground complex where British Prime
Minister Winston Churchill directed the Allied effort during World
War II is now open to the public. Among things a visitor learns
when visiting the complex, located on King Charles Street in
London: The underground offices and bedrooms were protected by a
three-foot slab of concrete. Yet when the city was being bombed,
Churchill was likely to be found not in his protected quarters but
on the building roof, watching the air raids. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Changing times: The birthplace of the great singer John McCormack
in Athlone, Ireland, is now a Chinese take-out restaurant. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Did you guess it? The 3,323-foot-long April the 25th Bridge is in
Portugal. April 25, 1974, was the date of the ``Carnation
Revolution'' _ so-called because soldiers put carnations in their
rifle barrels

 &HT;    TALL TALES AND SHORT STORIES: In public school they teach you to

<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ Gov. George W. Bush wants vouchers for
Texas parents who had rather educate their children in private
schools or home schooling.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays it seems that whatever George W. Bush wants, he gets.
From what I read, if and when he decides he wants to be president,
he'll get elected.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe then he'll want school vouchers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation of public education: Is that what we're talking
about? If so, hold the phone.
</P>
<P>
   I happen to have an opinion about public education. My opinion
is that no other institution has contributed more to democracy in
America.
</P>
<P>
   And now we're going to whittle it down into a bunch of splinter
groups?
</P>
<P>
   People who want their kids to go to private or church schools,
or who want to school them at home, think they ought to be able to
spend their tax money for education the way they please. After all,
it's THEIR kids.
</P>
<P>
   That sort of argument may sound like it makes sense. The truth
is, it's talking silly.
</P>
<P>
   You might as well argue that people whose kids are out of
school, or single people who never even had children, shouldn't
have to pay school taxes, that government should give back their
money so they can spend it as best benefits them.
</P>
<P>
   But that's not the issue, what's best for you or what's best for
me. Rather, it's what's best for America.
</P>
<P>
   Every citizen has an investment in public education. Our
nation's children represent our nation's future. As they succeed,
we all succeed. It's not by luck that America enjoys the most
advanced technology and the healthiest economy.
</P>
<P>
   You like the idea of school vouchers? Then why not this:
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not park vouchers for parents who'd rather take their
children to Disneyland instead of public parks?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not road vouchers for motorists who prefer toll roads to
the public highway system?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not water vouchers for those of us who drink bottled water
instead of city water?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not zoo vouchers for animal lovers who enjoy their own
personal menagerie over the public zoo? (With eight dogs and two
cats, personally I could use the money.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Why not protection vouchers for private police and firemen who
would come to the aid of only those who subscribe to their
services?
</P>
<P>
   _ And why not, while we're at it, arms vouchers for militia
groups who don't trust the U.S. military to defend the nation?
</P>
<P>
   Why not, indeed? Because it's silly, that's why.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposals for school vouchers aren't silly. Such ideas,
proposed by such leaders as Gov. Bush, are very serious _ a very
serious threat to our public education system.
</P>
<P>
   You want to home-school your children? Fine.
</P>
<P>
   You want to send your children to private schools? Fine.
</P>
<P>
   But not at the expense of OUR public schools.

<P>
   BOSTON _ They have come from all over New England, from as far
away as Vermont's Canadian border to nearby South Boston. But the
132 souls huddling on chairs in a windowless conference room in
Dorchester don't look particularly lost. They are physicians,
engineers, software consultants, house painters, store owners,
lawyers, students, single mothers, and an Episcopal priest, and
they belong to a group sociologists might call ``the worried
well.''
</P>
<P>
   They have come to the Forum because they sense something is
amiss in their lives, and they've heard that the program's 3 1/2
days of intense self-examination might help them smooth out the
cracks in their relationships with families, friends, and
co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   They are people like Paula Houghton, 50, who runs a gift shop on
the coast of Maine and says she ``hasn't touched'' her husband in
years, even though they run the business together.
</P>
<P>
   Or Marisa Reilly, 39, who owns a body spa in Waltham and is
struggling to raise a 4-year-old daughter amid the turmoil of a
difficult divorce.
</P>
<P>
   Or Ray Barrieau, 42, a general contractor from Rockland, who
lost the will to love when his teenage son died in a car accident
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Many in this mostly white and middle-class group had heard about
the Forum from someone in their lives who had already taken the
program. (In Houghton's case, it was her daughter; in Barrieau's,
several friends.)
</P>
<P>
   But quite a few had also heard about the controversial roots of
the Forum, which reached about 68,000 people worldwide in 1998.
Indeed, the very first question asked by a plaid-shirted woman in
the audience is: ``Is this a cult?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not a cult,'' replies the Forum leader, a
39-year-old former New Yorker named Beth Handel, who addresses the
concern head-on. Handel explains that the Forum is the
reincarnation of est, the self-help movement started in 1971 by a
former car salesman from Philadelphia who left his family and
changed his name from John Paul Rosenberg to Werner Erhard. In
1985, Handel says, Erhard ``retired'' est and retooled it as the
Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Before leaving the United States for parts unknown, he sold the
``technology'' of the Forum in 1991 to his employees, who formed a
new company known as the Landmark Education Co., headquartered in
San Francisco, with Erhard's younger brother, Harry Rosenberg, as
its president.
</P>
<P>
   What Handel leaves out is that est was widely criticized in its
heyday for fostering an authoritarian atmosphere, with reports of
est leaders humiliating participants and refusing to let them go to
the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   The Forum, one participant later jokes, seems to be a ``kinder,
gentler est.'' Anyone can leave at any time, and if people leave
before midafternoon on the first day of the workshop (which takes
place over three 14-hour days and one evening), they get their $325
entrance fee back.
</P>
<P>
   Two people actually take advantage of that offer. The rest stay
planted in their chairs, waiting impatiently for the
``transformation'' that Handel says she has ``produced . . . in
thousands and thousands of people's lives.'' (Among the attendees
is a Globe reporter whom Forum officials and participants know is
there).
</P>
<P>
   It isn't until late in the afternoon, after seemingly endless
plugs for other Landmark courses and a rambling lecture on
linguistics, that Handel gets down to the guts of the session. She
says that all human beings listen through a prism of judgment,
deciding whether what they hear is right or wrong, to be agreed
with or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way of listening will never disappear, but I notice it
now when I do it,'' says Handel, a pixieish, dark-haired woman
whose hands and face are in constant motion.
</P>
<P>
   Another fundamental aspect of human nature, she adds, is that we
all want to look good in front of others.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything you do is to look good,'' she says, with the
comedic timing of Joan Rivers. ``That's what it will say on your
tombstone: `looked real good.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The audience laughs, but a woman in the back row, with coifed
gray hair, looks thunderstruck. A few minutes later, she makes her
way to one of the three microphones set up around the room. (At
regular intervals during the 43-hour-long ride along
self-transformation lane, Handel encourages people to come up and
share their thoughts, revelations, and questions with her and the
group.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a 26-year-old son who is a drug addict and an
alcoholic,'' the gray-haired woman says haltingly. ``And we have no
relationship, because I'm too busy looking good.''
</P>
<P>
   At each break, participants are encouraged to find someone they
don't know and share something they have just learned about
themselves. And late that evening, before Handel dismisses the
weary group for the day, she gives everyone a homework assignment:
Go and write a letter to someone in your life whom you have ``run a
racket on.'' A racket, she already explained, is a mind-set that
compels people to respond negatively to others. After you write the
letter, she says, call the person and ask for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, calling the ghosts in one's life _ people you
have unfinished business with, whether a present or former spouse,
a parent, sibling, or child _ is a key ingredient in the Forum's
dynamic. By the next day, the phones in the Forum office are jammed
with participants dialing loved ones and asking forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Judie, a flight attendant in her 50s who lives in Quincy, did
her homework the first night. She called her ex-husband to
apologize for blaming him for everything that had gone wrong in
their marriage. ``Our divorce was so bitter that my kids got caught
in the crossfire,'' Judie tells the group the next day, tears on
her cheeks. ``What I've realized is that I had a part in it. My
biggest racket was being a victim, and what I lost was not just my
marriage, my house and my husband, but I lost my girls.''
</P>
<P>
   When she called Friday night, Judie says, her ex wasn't home,
and the person who answered the phone was her youngest daughter,
who is 17.

 BOSTON: ... who is 17.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I knew then that she was the person I needed to talk to. I
told her that I knew the divorce had caused her a lot of pain and
that I avoided responsibility by acting like it was all Dad's
fault. And I asked for her forgiveness.'' Judie pauses and the
silence is deafening. ``My daughter said, `I've waited two years to
hear this. I forgive you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   A sigh like a balloon releasing air can be heard around the
room.
</P>
<P>
   By evening of the second day, many participants are sharing
tissues and crying openly as the painful, most intimate details of
people's lives crash up against them like waves, each more powerful
than the next. And the stories, the awakenings, the tears, flow all
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't seen such good theater in a long time,'' marvels
Linda Kellay, 40, of Charlton, during one break.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone, however, is achieving breakthroughs. At one point,
an emigrant from India gets up and tries to talk about how people
discriminate against him because of his skin color and accent.
Handel lights into him. ``You haven't owned up to your racket,
which is that people discriminate against you,'' she says. ``You're
not taking responsibility for it. You keep pointing your finger at
others. You need to own up to your racket.''
</P>
<P>
   The man, a health professional who asked not to be identified,
persists, saying that a lot of his problems with people at work and
elsewhere had to do with racism. ``You are one of the most
uncoachable people in the Forum,'' Handel replies calmly. ``It's
been two full days and you haven't looked at yourself yet. All you
see is people stepping on you.''
</P>
<P>
   After a short break (during which the man finds himself
surrounded by sympathetic participants telling him to hang in
there), Handel unloads what some would later say is the biggest
bombshell of the weekend: ``Consider that life is empty and
meaningless,'' she says. ``There is no meaning; life just is.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, people's faces crumple with bewilderment. Paula
Houghton, the gift-shop owner from Maine, is one of the first to
get the point. ``If life is empty and meaningless, you can create
anything you want,'' she says triumphantly.
</P>
<P>
   Marisa Reilly follows her to the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so powerful,'' Reilly says. ``I don't need to be a
victim anymore. This is better than church; it's almost better than
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's when Ray Barrieau, the general contractor from
Rockland, raises his leonine head. Barrieau has been slumped in the
back row of the room, eyes half-closed, shoulders bowed. But on the
afternoon of the third day, he strides to the mike.
</P>
<P>
   In a choking voice, Barrieau reads a letter he had written to
his son, who died 18 months ago in a car accident at age 16.
Barrieau says he now realizes that even though his son is dead, he
can still have a relationship with him. ``You were an extraordinary
person, and I miss you terribly,'' Barrieau reads to an audience as
silent as stone. ``But what I realize now is that although my
relationship with you is different, I can continue to give you 100
percent of my love.''
</P>
<P>
   When he finishes, Handel asks, ``Is there anything else you need
to do?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive myself?'' Barrieau replies softly. ``I think I just
did.''
</P>
<P>
   On the last day of the Forum, Tuesday evening, Barrieau walks
into the room smiling. His back is straight, his blue eyes wide and
peaceful. Other participants also pour in with big smiles on their
faces, hugging people they met only five days before and talking
about the changes in their behavior in the last two days.
</P>
<P>
   One of the huggers is Joan Hathaway, a real estate broker from
Marlborough. The first day of the Forum, Hathaway, when asked what
she thought, had put a finger in her mouth as if to throw up.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, she had a different response.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm always skeptical of these self-help things,'' said
Hathaway. ``But I couldn't deny what was going on in front of my
eyes. I could see the transformations taking place right in front
of me.''
</P>
<P>
   Reached a month later, Barrieau and other participants also say
their lives and attitudes remain altered.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my line of work, I deal with people who don't always have a
handle on reality, and I notice that I deal with it differently
now,'' says Barrieau, who is working on restoring a huge farmhouse
north of Boston. ``For instance, if something goes wrong, one crew
is always ready to point the finger at another crew, and in the
past I might have gotten involved in that. Now I just say, jeez,
this is their racket, and I'm not going there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not as if Barrieau or others don't have lapses; it's an
imperfect world out there. Marisa Reilly, who shares custody of her
daughter with her ex-husband, says she still finds herself drawn
into arguments with him over past ``insults.'' But instead of
getting angry and marching off in resentment as she used to, Reilly
says that she was able to defuse their latest squabble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took a deep breath, went outside, came back in, and made a
request. I said, `You don't have to respect or like me, but I just
want you to respect me as Gwendolyn's mother,' '' she recalls.
``And that was the end of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly adds, ``Experiences like that weekend could be like a
bubble _ you get it for the moment and then poof it's gone. But
this has had a lasting effect on me.''

THE SOUNDS OF SILENCE AT HOME PLATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK McGUIRE  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The Hall of Fame Gallery is a mausoleum of
sorts, dedicated to the immortals of baseball's past. It is a place
in the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum where talk is
naturally muted, reserved for reverential, hushed tones.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, that quiet was amplified and echoed. Joe DiMaggio,
the game's designated Greatest Living Player, was dead. It was a
time to pay respects to one of the most respected players in the
history of sport.
</P>
<P>
   Fans trickled past the terse plaque dedicated to DiMaggio that
encapsulates his on-the-field accomplishments, but fails miserably
to capture his impact off it. A wreath of white roses hung around
the bronze memorial, a sign to those who know that Joltin' Joe had
left and gone away.
</P>
<P>
   His death at age 84 in the early hours of Monday morning came
too late for many to make a special weekday trip to the Hall of
Fame. The crowd was light, average for a March Monday, and most of
the pilgrims there learned of DiMaggio's demise while en route.
</P>
<P>
   Becky Moreau, a 25-year-old oncology nurse from Ilion, N.Y., was
an exception. She donned her Yankees jersey and came specifically
to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard that (he died) I knew I had to come,'' she said.
``He is an icon in Yankee history, and in all of baseball and
American history.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was the last direct link in the chain of Yankees
dynasties from the 1920s to the 1960s, a lineage that began with
The Babe, carried through Iron Man Lou, and on to Joe D. and
ultimately The Mick. DiMaggio's death leaves Ted Williams and Bob
Hope as among the last surviving cultural icons dating back to
World War II.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio was blessed with a long, graceful swing and stride, and
a silent, gentlemanly manner, a man who never lashed out in a
tell-all book or sought to grasp at the last rays of stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't like the limelight,'' said Charlie Washington, 48,
who was with his wife, Deborah, from Richmond, Va. ``He just wanted
to be known for his accomplishments.''
</P>
<P>
   They are numerous, from the 10 World Series appearances (nine
wins) to his .325 lifetime batting average, to, of course, The
Streak.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, a magical year in which Ted Williams became the last
player to hit .400 (.406), DiMaggio once again one-upped his Boston
Red Sox adversary and friend. The Streak started on May 15, in a
game in which the Bronx Bombers got bombed, 13-1. It stretched two
months, until July 16: 56 games in a row with at least one hit.
</P>
<P>
   The still-standing streak so captured the prewar nation that Les
Brown and his Orchestra, long before Simon &AMP; Garfunkel used
DiMaggio as a metaphor in ``Mrs. Robinson,'' recorded the
impossibly hokey ``Joltin' Joe DiMaggio:'' He'll live in baseball's
Hall of Fame, He got there blow by blow.
</P>
<P>
   When DiMaggio retired after the 1951 season, he demurred when it
was suggested he was irreplaceable. ``There's always some youngster
coming up _ they'll find somebody.'' The Yankees did. His name was
Mickey Mantle.
</P>
<P>
   But for excellence mixed with style and dignity on and off the
field, the pickings are slim today. Joe Pelaia, 49, and his
20-year-old son, Mike Pelaia, offered Cal Ripken Jr. as the closest
thing (Ripken, who played the most consecutive games in history,
knows streaks himself), although the Maryland pair admit they are
Baltimore Orioles fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was different; I don't think (DiMaggio) was cocky,'' the
son said. ``Most players today are cocky.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s, coming back from visiting the troops overseas,
Marilyn Monroe, briefly DiMaggio's wife but the love of his life,
told him, ``You never heard such cheering.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, he replied: ``Yes, I have.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, through the Hall of Fame, there was silence, as loud
as any cheering he ever heard.

WORLD-CLASS TUBBIES, UNITE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ We may not like Monica Lewinsky very much, but she
has done a lot for the full-figured woman.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that she and Bill Clinton had fat in common was a bond
between them, not a turnoff. Thanks to them, pleasingly plump is
in.
</P>
<P>
   In a world in which being skinny and bony is the ultimate beauty
ideal, this is the only heartening feature of their strange,
disgusting relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Monica slimmed down somewhat for her Barbara Walters interview
and gargantuan European book tour but she makes no secret of her
continuing obsession with her life-long effort to control her
weight.
</P>
<P>
   It fluctuates, depending on her seriousness at attempting any
given diet. She has dresses in several sizes and hangs the larger
ones in her ``fat closet.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if she wished to ignore the poundage, it fascinates the
rest of us, and we will not let her off the hook. The tabloids and
magazines have made a habit of reporting what she eats in
restaurants and how much, with emphasis on the desserts. Her
Walters interview was in part underwritten by not-so-subtle
commercials for a low-calorie drink and diet cookies as well as
supplements meant to help people lose weight.
</P>
<P>
   She told Elle magazine that ``everybody hates me; they think I'm
fat.'' Actually, we don't like her because of her behavior, not her
shape, which is tubby but quite cuddly. Yet she is accurately
reflecting a real problem faced by overweight people. Many studies
have documented that society discriminates against them in covert
ways because their appearance is not seen as attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska writer and teacher Ruth Raymond Thone, in her book
``Fat _ A Fate Worse Than Death?'' describes a multitude of ways in
which weight and size constitute the last socially accepted
prejudice. She rages against snide remarks, cruel ridicule, the
constant commercial barrage for get-thin products, male attitudes
toward sexual beauty and cultural pressure that affects competition
for jobs and husbands.
</P>
<P>
   Thone feels that women are cheated by society's concentration on
weight and outward appearance and distracted from addressing the
real issues of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Other studies have confirmed that being overweight damages a
young person's social and economic potential, particularly that of
females. Heavyset women complete about half a year less schooling,
are 20 percent less likely to get married and earn considerably
less per year than their slimmer counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Monica, in fact, attributes some of what she admits were low
``feelings of self-worth'' to her own weight problem. That did not
stop her, of course, from aggressively going after a married
president twice her age.
</P>
<P>
   She empathized with a fellow fat-sufferer. She reports that the
first time Clinton took off his shirt in front of her he sucked in
his stomach. She says he told her that as a child he was so chubby
and ran so slowly the other children beat him to the chocolate eggs
during the annual Easter egg hunt.
</P>
<P>
   In his Clinton biography ``First In His Class,'' author David
Maraniss describes a youthful Clinton preoccupied with his weight.
In a letter to a friend, Clinton lamented that he and his younger
brother Roger were eating too many sweets. ``Sometimes I think the
whole house will sink into a heap of sugar,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The president has lost some girth in the White House, where fast
food is usually banned and the resident chefs serve healthy,
low-calorie meals. Intern-delivered pizza seems to have been an
exception.
</P>
<P>
   But his pudgy, puffy-faced image endures. Cartoonist Mike Peters
told me that he tried to slim down his drawings of Clinton but was
flooded with complaints. A skinny Clinton just didn't look like
Clinton. He lost the buffoon quality.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of us who also have to watch our weight can identify
with this miserable couple. They are both physically attractive,
proof that size is not everything. I saw Monica in person only
once, during one of her plumper phases. She was lovely. And every
time I see the president I am struck anew by his friendly, mobile
face and personal magnetism.
</P>
<P>
   It's not their outward appearance that turns us off. It's the
moral emptiness inside that is the trouble.

CHURCH OF CHRIST MINISTER CONDEMNS THAT SWING THING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM JONES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dancing still is considered a wicked activity by some
conservative Christians.
</P>
<P>
   I was reminded of that recently when a friend gave me a copy of
``36 Reasons Why Christians Should Not Dance.''
</P>
<P>
   At first I thought the document condemning popular dancing as an
evil, lustful activity might be out of date. But its author, Mac
Layton, a veteran Church of Christ minister from Edmond, Okla.,
still stands by it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think dancing is wrong, but very few people are teaching
that anymore,'' Layton, a minister at the Deer Creek Church of
Christ near Edmond, said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Layton is among Church of Christ leaders who recently condemned
students at Abilene Christian University _ one of the largest
Church of Christ-related universities _ for taking part in
swing-dance lessons off campus.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of Church of Christ and Baptist congregations that have
been known to oppose dancing spend less time condemning the
practice these days.
</P>
<P>
   Some Baptist leaders have gone so far as to say that dancing can
be a harmless and wholesome activity.
</P>
<P>
   That was the case three years ago when Baylor University in
Waco, Texas, the nation's largest Baptist-related university,
lifted its 140-year-old ban on campus dances. Robert Sloan,
Baylor's president, led the dancing with his wife. He said
controlled dances on campus could help promote a spirit of
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   But Baylor isn't going wild with dancing since the ban was
lifted.
</P>
<P>
   Only four on-campus dances are held at Baylor each year, said
Liz Webb, a spokeswoman for the student activities office. Alcohol
is banned from all dances, even the off-campus ones. And all dances
are strictly chaperoned and have time constraints.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many conservative Christians like Layton say Baylor is
compromising its moral standards by allowing any kind of dances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are just giving in to the world, I think,'' Layton said.
</P>
<P>
   Layton wrote ``36 Reasons Why Christians Should Not Dance'' 25
years ago. Some of his reasons are:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The dance is the only place where the vilest of men can
embrace the purest of women.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The fondling and embrace in dancing is not permitted in
decent society without music. What is wrong without music, is wrong
with music.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Nightclubs, roadhouses, taverns of infamy, late hours, are
companions of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Young women lose their modesty and chastity, and influence,
by dancing.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Thousands of men engage in the dance as the surest way to
trap an innocent girl.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxie Boren, preacher at the Brown Trail Church of Christ in
Bedford, Texas, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was ``disgusted'' that officials at his alma mater,
Abilene Christian, failed to reprimand students for doing swing
dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I graduated from Abilene Christian in 1955, we would have
been sent packing if the administration knew we danced,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the 2.5 million people in Church of Christ congregations
don't hear preaching against dancing anymore, said Tyler Young,
minister at the Granbury Street Church of Christ in Cleburne.
</P>
<P>
   But a minority of congregations, including his own, are still
following what he called ``the old path.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold the position that dancing _ popular dancing that goes
on at bars and clubs _ is lascivious and tends to arouse lust,'' he
said. ``We also believe all that sexual bumping and grinding we see
on MTV is wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Young doesn't condemn all dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing in and of itself is not a sin,'' he wrote in his
church's newsletter recently. Married couples who dance in their
homes are not sinning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   People danced joyfully in biblical times, with God's approval,
he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``David danced before the Lord when the Ark of the Covenant was
returned,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Young and other conservative religionists are realists. They
acknowledge they are fighting an uphill battle against dancing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing has been a popular amusement for many years,'' he
said. ``And the opponent of the modern dance is considered an old
fogy or an ancient fossil.''

TERMINATOR 2 AIMING TO BE BEST 3-D ACTION ATTRACTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; If the T-1000 was the ultimate Terminator, what
does that make the T-1,000,000?
</P>
<P>
   At least 1,000 times worse.
</P>
<P>
   But the new Terminator 2 3-D attraction starring the ultimate
spider from hell and now being built at Universal Studios Hollywood
already has proven every bit as much of a technical challenge for
its creators as the T-1,000,000 is for the show's protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   The 12-minute attraction (with an eight-minute preshow in an
anteroom) melds live actors, wind and mist generators, massive
cyborgs, smoke and lights, automatic weapons, moving seats and the
world's most expensive one-person roller coaster. That all combines
with a three-dimensional film stretched across three screens,
starring the original ``T2'' stars and directed by three Oscar
winners.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kicks,'' said one of those Oscar winners, original ``T2''
director James Cameron. ``It's really cool.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Arnold Schwarzenegger's ``good'' Terminator time
travels from the future to a place somewhere around now to help
Edward Furlong's budding savior of the human race.
</P>
<P>
   Together they jump back to the future (wait, that's another
Universal ride) to try to destroy the T-1,000,000 and the Skynet
artificial intelligence it protects before the machines can wipe
out the human race.
</P>
<P>
   The attraction itself is also something of a sequel, a slightly
updated version of the $60 million attraction that Cameron and
co-directors John Bruno and Stan Winston first crafted for
Universal's Orlando, Fla., site two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's coming to Los Angeles, largely unchanged other than to
accommodate additional design challenges such as tougher building
codes and the ride's location atop a parking structure.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the cast is rehearsing, and the concrete is curing on
the massive structure, with an exterior mimicking the headquarters
of Skynet's corporate creator, business bad guy Cyberdyne Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The sleek futurist concrete exterior is purposely plunked down,
just as Cyberdyne might do, in a place where it doesn't quite fit,
along a small-town main street area of the theme park.
</P>
<P>
   Little touches, such as a massive, pixelated version of a still
scene from the movie, help decorate the exterior of the 700-seat
theater and waiting areas. Near the attraction's exit, a
restaurant, T2 store and decorative gardens are also being put in.
</P>
<P>
   Fine-tuning those structures has been a months-long challenge
for show organizers, who are racing toward a May 6 opening date,
but nothing like the technical obstacles surrounding what ends up
on the screen, its makers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim asked me to design a show based on a script that he had
worked on with Landmark Films,'' said Bruno, a longtime Cameron
collaborator who won an Oscar for visual effects on Cameron's ``The
Abyss'' and most recently directed ``Virus.'' ``He wanted to make a
movie; he didn't want to do a gimmick.''
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business was to visit every 3-D ride they
could find, to see what audiences reacted to and what fell, well,
flat.
</P>
<P>
   One obvious change was needed: ``The overall rule was the camera
had to move,'' Bruno said. ``No one ever did that before, and for a
reason.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because it's a pain in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're doing the shot twice, once for the left and once for
the right eye,'' Bruno said. To get the slightly offset shots
needed for each eye, you either use a bulky special camera that
takes both shots at once or you shoot the same shot twice from ever
so slightly different angles.
</P>
<P>
   A related challenge has to do with ``motion control'' work,
tracking precisely where objects are in a frame so special effects
can be added later that move realistically within the frame.
</P>
<P>
   And with 3-D, every one of those problems is multiplied by at
least two.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's off-center even a little bit, not only does it give
you headaches, it looks bad, and the 3-D effect is lost,'' said
Digital Domain's Michael Kanfer, who supervised the show's imaging
effects work and has his own Oscar for visual effects on
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, most 3-D shots usually end up as locked down and
immobile as a shorted-out cyborg.
</P>
<P>
   Cameron didn't want that, leaving to Bruno and Digital Domain to
figure out how best to make the camera move while still capturing
both fast-moving 3-D shots and allowing for compelling special
effects. With special software, a custom 450-pound camera and a few
other tricks, they made it work.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cool part of any 3-D is the stuff coming at you, and you
duck,'' said Kanfer. ``We exaggerated a lot of this to make it look
cooler. It's like hyper-stereo vision.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet another major complication was the decision to use 65mm
film, instead of the industry-standard 35mm size, and to run that
film at 30 frames per second, instead of the standard 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you get is three to four times the resolution of 35mm
film,'' Bruno said. ``And 30 frames per second is just an
incredibly huge leap in sharpness. After that, it's not as great
(an incremental further improvement).''
</P>
<P>
   The bigger format also meant special challenges while shooting.
The sets at a former iron-mining camp near Joshua Tree National
Monument in Riverside County had to be lit up like a Roman candle
factory after a napalm attack to get the right post-apocalyptic
look, for instance.
</P>
<P>
   And higher-resolution film meant higher-resolution special
effects, straining even Digital Domain's cutting-edge computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Digital Domain had to come up with a way to store that
information, five times as much information, and do it for each
eye,'' Bruno said. ``They had to do 10 times what is done in a
regular movie'' with each effects shot.
</P>
<P>
   To meld live-action actors with those on the screen, Bruno
enlisted magician David Copperfield's chief illusion designer to
figure out how to make the performers appear to jump out of the
screen and then back onto it.
</P>
<P>
   The trick is an involved one, using a unique projection screen
and a remarkable, rebuilt Harley-Davidson motorcycle attached to a
roller-coaster track hidden under the stage.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the show's gee-whiz technology, however, not all the
effects rely on high tech.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the monstrous T-1,000,000 is frozen, just as
happened to the T-1000 in ``T2,'' and shatters. As shards of the
creature ``fly'' past ducking onlookers, misting nozzles above the
audience give a physical dimension to the visual sensations.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when tiny hovering ``mini hunter killers'' in the
film appear to fly out over the audience, fans overhead blow air
down on viewers' heads while the 48-speaker sound system tricks
listeners' ears into thinking the machines are overhead.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking technological legerdemain, however, involves
the film's last few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In that climactic third act, three screens are used, wrapping
completely around viewers' normal field of vision and pulling them
into the action. But it also tripled, or more, the creative
complications.
</P>
<P>
   ``We use everything in this, and everything is like six times
harder because you have six projectors (two for each screen to
create the 3-D look),'' Kanfer said.
</P>
<P>
   That's most notable as the T-1,000,000 jumps from screen to
screen as it fights with Schwarzenegger and Furlong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This thing runs from screen to screen, so the choreography is
really hard,'' Kanfer said. ``This is the type of thing in
pre-production meetings where the guy says what he wants you to do,
and you look at him like, `You're dreaming.' &UR;  &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   To Bruno, though, that almost willful ignorance of what was
``possible'' is what made the show great.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were actually approaching this in a naive way,'' Bruno
said. ``We paid no attention to the rules, which is why it worked
so well.'' &QL;

COMEBACK OF 3-D FILMS ENVISIONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ Though it's hard to believe, stereoscopic
photography has been around for 161 years, ever since Sir Charles
Wheatstone figured out how to use a collection of angled mirrors to
create the illusion of three-dimensionality using two
two-dimensional photos of the same shot.
</P>
<P>
   In 1903, the pioneering Lumiere Bros. of France sent Parisian
moviegoers fleeing from the theater with a one-minute, 3-D film of
a train's arrival at a station.
</P>
<P>
   The golden age of 3-D film hit 50 years later, but only briefly,
with 65 films churned out between 1952 and 1954 before new
wide-screen technology proved an inexpensive alternative draw.
</P>
<P>
   Now 3-D might be poised to make a comeback, but on the very big
screen, say Charlotte Huggins and Ben Stassen, the producer and the
director, respectively, of the just released 3-D large-format film,
``Encounter in the Third Dimension.''
</P>
<P>
   The 39-minute show _ which debuted recently at IMAX theaters in
Exposition Park, Ontario and Irvine _ is a fun review of the
science and history of 3-D theater, featuring excerpts of some of
the best recent 3-D theme-park attractions, including ``Terminator
2 3-D.''
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``Encounter'' particularly interesting, however, is
that the 3-D is done on a truly gargantuan scale, pitched for the
five-story-high IMAX screens. Combined with computer-generated
sets, the technology allows for a remarkable experience that
Stassen and Huggins believe soon will be embraced by other
filmmakers looking for an all-consuming cinema experience, if they
can stand the production complications.
</P>
<P>
   Even simple questions such as film magazine size and reloading
time are more difficult with 3-D, they said. Instead of getting 12
minutes per magazine, and needing only five minutes to put in a new
one, 3-D cameras hold only three minutes of film, and take as much
as a half hour to reload.
</P>
<P>
   But the results in a large-format 3-D film can be wonderful,
Stassen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as you go (with a) smaller (film format), you have a
window you're looking through,'' Stassen said. ``With large-format,
you don't have a window, you have a space. It's immersive. To me,
it's really a new language of cinema, because it's so different
from what we're used to.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair and their Sherman Oaks-based company, nWave Pictures,
already are working on other 3-D, large-format films, including a
science-fiction title and an undersea adventure.
</P>
<P>
   But only 10 large-format 3-D films ever have been made, despite
a recent building boom in IMAX and other large-format theaters
whose cameras can show the titles.
</P>
<P>
   With only two 3-D camera rigs now available in the world,
Stassen said more needs to be invested in the camera technology for
such films to become more common.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've spent $1.5 billion building (large-format) theaters,
$200 million making films and only $5 million on the camera
technology,'' Stassen said. ``The tools aren't there. Something has
to be done.''

<P>
   My opinions regarding the baseball legend Joe DiMaggio would be
of no particular interest to the general public were it not for the
fact that 30 years ago I wrote the song ``Mrs. Robinson,'' whose
lyric ``Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio, a nation turns its lonely
eyes to you'' alluded to and in turn probably enhanced DiMaggio's
stature in the American iconographic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after ``Mrs. Robinson'' rose to No.1 on the pop
charts, I found myself dining at an Italian restaurant where
DiMaggio was seated with a party of friends. I'd heard a rumor that
he was upset with the song and had considered a lawsuit, so it was
with some trepidation that I walked over and introduced myself as
its composer. I needn't have worried: He was perfectly cordial and
invited me to sit down, whereupon we immediately fell into
conversation about the only subject we had in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I don't understand,'' he said, ``is why you ask where
I've gone. I just did a Mr. Coffee commercial, I'm a spokesman for
the Bowery Savings Bank and I haven't gone anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   I said that I didn't mean the lines literally, that I thought of
him as an American hero and that genuine heroes were in short
supply. He accepted the explanation and thanked me. We shook hands
and said good night.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in the shadow of his passing, I find myself wondering about
that explanation. Yes, he was a cultural icon, a hero if you will,
but not of my generation. He belonged to my father's youth: He was
a World War II guy whose career began in the days of Babe Ruth and
Lou Gehrig and ended with the arrival of the youthful Mickey Mantle
(who was, in truth, my favorite ballplayer).
</P>
<P>
   In the '50s and '60s, it was fashionable to refer to baseball as
a metaphor for America, and DiMaggio represented the values of that
America: excellence and fulfillment of duty (he often played in
pain), combined with a grace that implied a purity of spirit, an
off-the-field dignity and a jealously guarded private life.
</P>
<P>
   It was said that he still grieved for his former wife, Marilyn
Monroe, and sent fresh flowers to her grave every week. Yet as a
man who married one of America's most famous and famously neurotic
women, he never spoke of her in public or in print. He understood
the power of silence.
</P>
<P>
   He was the antithesis of the iconoclastic, mind-expanding,
authority-defying '60s, which is why I think he suspected a hidden
meaning in my lyrics. The fact that the lines were sincere and that
they've been embraced over the years as a yearning for heroes and
heroism speaks to the subconscious desires of the culture. We need
heroes, and we search for candidates to be anointed.
</P>
<P>
   Why do we do this even as we know the attribution of heroic
characteristics is almost always a distortion? Deconstructed and
scrutinized, the hero turns out to be as petty and ego-driven as
you and I. We know, but still we anoint. We deify, though we know
the deification often kills, as in the cases of Elvis Presley,
Princess Diana and John Lennon. Even when the recipient's life is
spared, the fame and idolatry poison and injure. There is no doubt
in my mind that DiMaggio suffered for being DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   We inflict this damage without malice because we are enthralled
by myths, stories and allegories. The son of Italian immigrants,
the father a fisherman, grows up poor in San Francisco and becomes
the greatest baseball player of his day, marries an American
goddess and never in word or deed befouls his legend and greatness.
He is ``the Yankee Clipper,'' as proud and masculine as a
battleship.
</P>
<P>
   When the hero becomes larger than life, life itself is
magnified, and we read with a new clarity our moral compass. The
hero allows us to measure ourselves on the goodness scale: OK, I'm
not Mother Teresa, but hey, I'm no Jeffrey Dahmer. Better keep
trying in the eyes of God.
</P>
<P>
   What is the larger significance of DiMaggio's death? Is he a
real hero? Let me quote the complete verse from ``Mrs. Robinson'':
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
</P>
<P>
   Going to the candidates' debate
</P>
<P>
   Laugh about it, shout about it
</P>
<P>
   When you've got to choose
</P>
<P>
   Every way you look at it you lose.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
</P>
<P>
   A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these days of presidential transgressions and apologies and
prime-time interviews about private sexual matters, we grieve for
Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his grace and dignity, his
fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to the memory of his wife and
the power of his silence.

Princess Diana and John Lennon. Even when the recipient's life is
spared, the fame and idolatry poison and injure. There is no doubt
in my mind that DiMaggio suffered for being DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   We inflict this damage without malice because we are enthralled
by myths, stories and allegories. The son of Italian immigrants,
the father a fisherman, grows up poor in San Francisco and becomes
the greatest baseball player of his day, marries an American
goddess and never in word or deed befouls his legend and greatness.
He is ``the Yankee Clipper,'' as proud and masculine as a
battleship.
</P>
<P>
   When the hero becomes larger than life, life itself is
magnified, and we read with a new clarity our moral compass. The
hero allows us to measure ourselves on the goodness scale: OK, I'm
not Mother Teresa, but hey, I'm no Jeffrey Dahmer. Better keep
trying in the eyes of God.
</P>
<P>
   What is the larger significance of DiMaggio's death? Is he a
real hero? Let me quote the complete verse from ``Mrs. Robinson'':
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon
</P>
<P>
   Going to the candidates' debate
</P>
<P>
   Laugh about it, shout about it
</P>
<P>
   When you've got to choose
</P>
<P>
   Every way you look at it you lose.
</P>
<P>
   Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio
</P>
<P>
   A nation turns its lonely eyes to you
</P>
<P>
   What's that you say Mrs. Robinson
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Joe has left and gone away.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In these days of presidential transgressions and apologies and
prime-time interviews about private sexual matters, we grieve for
Joe DiMaggio and mourn the loss of his grace and dignity, his
fierce sense of privacy, his fidelity to the memory of his wife and
the power of his silence.

 By SUSAN BOLOTIN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    We all know them, if only by caricature. The parents who devote
hours each night to the ritual of their children's bedtimes. The
children with roomfuls of toys who complain of nothing to do. The
parents whose phone conversations are really interruptions
interrupted by conversation. The children who won't do their
homework unless their parents are nearby. The parents who intervene
on their children's behalf whenever a teacher delivers a bad grade,
a rebuke, a punishment. The children so incapable of dealing with
frustration they explode in rage whenever something goes any way
other than theirs. The children who think of no one but themselves.
The parents who think of no one but their children.
 &HT;    These are the parents, and these are the children, whom John
Rosemond would expunge from the national fabric.
 &HT;    Among an ever-growing group of usually conservative, often
Christian givers of authoritarian child-rearing advice, he is the
expert of the moment, largely because of a recent public dispute
with T. Berry Brazelton over the timing of toilet training.
 &HT;    But Middle America saw his day coming long before the potty wars
hit the papers. Twenty years ago, Rosemond (``Train them by 2!'')
was a family therapist in Gastonia, N.C., with an occasional
article in the local paper. Today, his weekly column appears in
about 150 newspapers.
 &HT;    His practice boarded up, the 51-year-old Rosemond wanders the
country eight months of the year, the Johnny Appleseed of
discipline, putting on nearly 250 shows annually. He publishes a
bimonthly magazine, Affirmative Parenting. He operates a Web site.
And his eight books, which have sold a total of more than a million
copies, have experienced a 30 percent increase in sales over each
of the last two years.
 &HT;    There's more in the works: an infomercial to market a ``take it
home'' effective-discipline kit; a series of nine hourlong programs
being developed for possible placement on PBS; a series of ``news''
segments to be marketed to television stations.
 &HT;    In the fall of '99 you'll even be able to take a cruise with
Rosemond. And when you return home, if he has done his job, you
will, in his words, ``fling open the door and say, 'Hey, kids,
things will never be the same!' ``
 &HT;    It wasn't a cruise, but they came mostly two by two, as hopeful
of salvation as the animals to Noah _ young married couples, women
walking with the shared gait of friends. They came by the hundreds,
up the steps to Wichita's Century II Convention Center.
 &HT;    They came with the purposefulness of disciples, ready to receive
the wisdom being handed out that day. And they were not
disappointed.
 &HT;    Though Rosemond's posture is stooped _ think John Lithgow on a
bad-back day _ his manner is straightforward, unambivalent. Part of
that authority must come from familiarity with his material. Not
only does he repeat three basic talks hundreds of times a year, but
he also uses the same anecdotes in his shows that he uses in book
after book.
 &HT;    ``Are you the kind of parents who tell your kids to pick up
their toys and then leave the room?'' Rosemond asked. ``Or are you
the sort who wants to have a warm and fuzzy relationship going with
the kid?'' His disdain turned to parodic soprano: ``I know, let's
make a game of picking up the toys. The person who gets the most
will get a bowl of ice cream after supper.'''
 &HT;    Rosemond moved on. ``If you punish your child,'' he advised,
``he will hate you. He won't talk to you for three days.'' Beat.
``It's a blessing. Take a vacation.''
 &HT;    The crowd laughed and clapped. They felt ``empowered'' _ a word
I heard to this side of nausea _ by Rosemond. He may have been
telling them they were jerks, but he was also telling them that
they could change. They could realize that rearing kids is ``a
no-brainer.'' They could learn to ignore the ``mental-health
professionals who have convinced us, with the assistance of the
media, that we were all raised in pathological, dysfunctional
families.''
 &HT;    They could forget everything they've ever heard about building
self-esteem in children. They could see their children as ``direct
descendants of Adam and Eve'' and, as such, ``inclined to
mischief.'' They could start confronting their children every time
they misbehaved, and then they could punish them. They could put
their marriage at the center of the family. They could stop
worrying about their relationships with their children and accept
the challenge of leadership. They could make their children happy
by making them well behaved.
 &HT;    Rosemond has not always thought such thoughts; indeed, the story
of his transformation is proof that there really is no conservative
like an ex-drug-taking, rock 'n' roll-playing liberal.
 &HT;    This is how he tells it: His parents divorced when he was 3;
when he was 7, his mother remarried, to an older man who moved the
family from Charleston, S.C., to Chicago. The marriage was marked
by violence, first verbal, then physical. (``I wasn't traumatized
by it, just scared to death.'') His stepfather believed all
emotions should be kept under wraps.
 &HT;    When Rosemond was 15, he went to live in Georgia with his
father, a golf pro, who gave him his own apartment. (``This was not
good for me.'') He finished his high-school years in Chicago. (``My
mother moved into her own room with a bolt lock and her own
refrigerator.'') He then went to Western Illinois University, where
he eventually received his master's degree in psychology.
 &HT;    While there, he played in a rock band. He did a lot of drugs. He
sported red hair down to his shoulders and a fatigue jacket with a
flag sewn upside-down on the back. But after he was married _ he
was 20; his bride, Willie Herman, was 19 _ it was time to get a
job, at a community-health center in the mountains of North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Their son, Eric, was born in 1969. At first, John and Willie
followed the advice of the ``nouveau parenting experts'' they
despise these days. But their son's rambunctiousness and Willie's
second pregnancy (Amy, their second child, is now 26) combined to
make them reconsider. ``Eric's behaviors were going to destroy our
relationship,'' Willie recalls.
 &HT;    The Rosemonds came to understand that Eric needed discipline of
the old-fashioned kind, and the conversion began.
 &HT;    (``This is Eric,'' Rosemond says, introducing me to his son.
``His career,'' Eric adds, laughing.)
 &HT;    As Rosemond's attitudes toward child rearing solidified, his
politics turned toward the right. These days he cannot abide
no-fault divorce; homosexual parenting; Selma Fraiberg's ``The
Magic Years''; sex-education programs; Thomas Gordon's Parent
Effectiveness Training program; homework planners (``a source of
codependency'' between the overinvolved parent and the
irresponsible child); single parenthood by choice; the inclusion of
spanking in definitions of child abuse; TV; and Hillary Clinton and
Marian Wright Edelman (``ultraliberals, leftists, socialists'').
 &HT;    The Rosemonds' home in Gastonia is Country Living perfect _
sampler pillows, stenciled walls, racks and racks of pipes, George
Washington hanging over the fireplace. But when Eric and his wife,
Nancy, walk in with their two little boys, ready for a lovefest
with Grandpa, it takes on the aura of a stage set. The afternoon
feels rehearsed, and everyone in the cast _ including me _ knows
his or her part.
 &HT;    Eric (``I don't read the books, I don't read the articles'') is
there to scoff at Dad. ``So, do you think he seems harsh, like not
a fun person?'' he asks me right off, laughing. ``Well, I tell
people he can dole out punishment with a smile on his face.''
 &HT;    Nancy casually but firmly minds the children, while Willie
soothes any queasiness Rosemond's beliefs about women might
engender. Rosemond is the well-rehearsed pro.
 &HT;    Here he is, in nutshell version.
 &HT;    _ Parents should stop worrying about developing self-esteem in
their children. If held accountable for their behavior and allowed
to experience hardship and frustration, children will develop
self-esteem on their own. Mothers, in particular, he says, are
guilty of rushing in the minute the child begins feeling unhappy or
distressed.
 &HT;    ``If there are two words that underlie self-esteem,'' Rosemond
says, ``they are 'I can.' Well, I was in a school recently. I
walked into the boys' bathroom. Above the mirror, there was this
sign that said, 'You are now looking at the most special person in
the whole world.' This isn't self-esteem. This is narcissism.
Today's child justifies anything. Bill Clinton is a prime example.
He grew up with a single mother who told him his excrement didn't
stink.''
 &HT;    _ Spanking is fine, if done swiftly, occasionally, privately, in
anger but not in rage, with the hand, on the rear.
 &HT;    _ Attention Deficit Disorder is not genetic _ as much as parents
(who don't want to think it's their fault) and professionals (who
want to continue treatment forever) want it to be.
 &HT;    ``Every 2-year-old has ADD, because the left temporal lobe is
not sufficiently developed,'' Rosemond claims. Parents who pay
attention to their children's proper brain development _ by
shielding them from electronic media, making them focus on adult
authority figures and expecting them to finish tasks _ cause this
innate ADD to disappear.
 &HT;    _ Toilet training should occur by the age of 2; otherwise, a
child will become a spoiled brat. Here's how it's done, on the
now-famous three-to-five-day plan: ``You take their clothes off.
You put the potty where they can see it. When they have an accident
they scream, because they hate it running down their legs. Every
time you hear them screaming you put them on the potty.'' Carpet
cleaning is the final step.
 &HT;    _ Chores are essential. By their teens, children should be doing
all kitchen cleanup, most of the housework and the lion's share of
the laundry.
 &HT;    _ All disobedience, no matter how small the infraction and even
if followed by an apology, must be punished. The punishment should
be unpleasant, memorable and inflicted at a time that is convenient
for the parent.
 &HT;    Rosemond talks like this until dusk, indefatigable, cool, even
when I ask if it might be easier to get his point of view across if
he separated it from his religion (``nondenominational
Jewish-Christian,'' by his description) and his politics: ``People
need to understand that conservatives did not politicize parenting
in America, that the people who did are people like Hillary Clinton
and Marian Wright Edelman.''
 &HT;    I didn't know then that Rosemond has his eye on a possible run
for the House of Representatives, but the information wouldn't have
mattered; my role in our stage play does not include a debate about
who politicized the family, how Clinton and Edelman came to be
linked at the hip or why he's polarizing the debate.
 &HT;    It is very easy to find people willing to take on Rosemond.
According to the executive director of the North Carolina
Psychology Board, Martha N. Storie, the board investigated a
complaint brought against Rosemond in November 1987. After an
informal hearing early the next year, a reprimand was issued.
 &HT;    In September 1995, after the board received another complaint,
Rosemond voluntarily entered into a consent order, which stipulated
that a state supervisor review his columns prior to publication.
 &HT;    (Rosemond, who first told me of these incidents, says the first
complaint referred to a column in which he said there was no
evidence that putting a very young child into therapy was efficient
either in time or money; the second complaint was a response to his
advice to the family of an 18-month-old who had been sexually
abused. He told them to forgo therapy for her, since she would
never remember the incident anyway. His descriptions of the
columns, which he stands by to this day, are generally accurate.
They have been excised from the archives on his Web site.)
 &HT;    Much more recently, Grace Reef, director of intergovernmental
relations for the Children's Defense Fund, told me that Edelman has
never worked on any legislation to make spanking illegal, as
Rosemond claims, and that the CDF knows nothing about any program
that would mandate a visit to every new mother to assess her
ability to mother, as Rosemond inveighs against.
 &HT;    I'm sure I also could have found sociologists more than willing
to label his thinking on women sexist. (``Women don't want men to
be more involved, they just want them to be more at their beck and
call.'') But it seemed too easy.
 &HT;    Besides, writing Rosemond off might suggest I don't recognize
anything of my family in the ones he criticizes. I do, and have to
admit that my husband and I have recently made subtle
Rosemond-inspired shifts in our child rearing. Now when we say,
``This is our car, and we are listening to 'All Things
Considered''' _ that ultimate line in the sand _ we mean it. Our
kids, age 10 and 13, look at each other, roll their eyes and
mutter, ``Brainwashed in Kansas.''
 &HT;    The people who adhere to Rosemond's philosophy would laugh at
that _ for more than the obvious reason of our general wussiness.
Their families had once been out of control, their children more
headache than pleasure, but that's history.
 &HT;    As Amanda Riley, a mother of two from Danbury, Conn., tells me,
hearing Rosemond speak three years ago ``rocked'' her world, though
the change in parenting style was not easy at first. ``My daughter
did not get that there were consequences for bad behavior,'' Riley
recalls. ``Since then, I haven't tried anything from Rosemond that
hasn't worked. He's kind of like a religion to me. What he says is
gospel.''
 &HT;    Rosemond often asserts that all parenting advice can be broken
down into a series of aphorisms. ``I'm going to give you enough
rope to hang yourself.'' ``You paddle your own canoe.'' ``You can't
get something for nothing.''
 &HT;    But what, I wonder, about that other maxim: ``Don't hold a
grudge''?
 &HT;    And that's what troubles me most about Rosemond. I respond to
some of what he says, but not to how he says it. ``Gotcha!'' he
seems to bellow, delighting in every punishment doled out. And
while research has shown that children turn out best in families in
which parental demands are enforced, that is true only if the
punishment is not punitive. Loosey-goosey parenting may not work,
but neither does ``seeing and not hearing'' children.
 &HT;    Besides, where does the fun in rearing children get factored in?
Where is the acknowledgment that complexity is not necessarily bad?
Where is the intellectual adventure that comes from helping kids
learn to discriminate between legitimate and bogus authority?
 &HT;    My time with Rosemond has helped me develop a theory. I call it,
in homage to the sociologist Arlie Russell Hochschild's ``second
shift'' (the work a woman does after returning home from her paid
job), ``the third shift.'' But unlike Hochschild's work of
scholarship, my theory is based on that grand journalistic
standard: myself and a couple of friends.
 &HT;    Somewhere along the line, my female friends and I took on,
unasked, a ``third shift'' _ the job of family-happiness manager,
juggling not only lessons and games and school events and nights
out with adult friends, but everyone's emotional well-being,
articulated or not. This is a thankless and exhausting task,
particularly if it includes eradicating frustration and boredom
from children's lives while simultaneously making sure they feel
good about themselves.
 &HT;    I accepted this work, without thinking much about its
consequences, until I met Rosemond. And then it came to me like a
nightmare. He might worry I was turning my children into the Bill
Clintons of tomorrow. But I had another concern: What if I was
rearing them to be Monica Lewinskys _ young adults who don't want
jobs where hard work is expected, who turn petulant when they don't
get what they want, even when what they're looking for is their own
happiness.
 &HT;    That realization _ that your kids can't grow up unless you let
them do it for themselves _ is what I'll take away from this
Rosemondian adventure. Or, as the man says, ``You can't get
something for nothing.''

   CANTON, Mass. _ On their own field of dreams, the boys in
wheelchairs charged down the basketball court, chasing each other,
shooting baskets, blocking, sometimes locking wheels, showing no
mercy, asking for none.
</P>
<P>
   If their limbs have failed them, as most have, or are partially
missing, as some are, that does not hinder these wheelchair
basketball players at the Massachusetts Hospital School in Canton,
a state-operated school for youngsters with disabilities, in their
pursuit of the prize.
</P>
<P>
   A national championship is now within their reach.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-member team is charged up for the challenge next
weekend at the 7th annual National Junior Wheelchair Basketball
Tournament at the University of Illinois at Champaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is big,'' said Richard Crisafulli, the school's director
of athletics. ``This is the World Series, the Super Bowl of
wheelchair competition. The important thing with this is that
college coaches will be there to scout the final 16 top-seeded
teams in the 35-member league. We're one of those.''
</P>
<P>
   The hospital school team qualified for the nationals by placing
second in the Mid-South Regional Tournament in Arkansas in January.
There, the team won five games and lost one, placing it among the
top 16 finalists and 11th in the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids have worked hard for this honor,'' said team coach
Caryn Glazer,. ``During the season (from December to March), they
practice for about eight hours two nights a week.''
</P>
<P>
   When these kids are out there on the court,'' she said,
``they're not people with disabilities, they're basketball
players.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the hospital school has the only junior wheelchair team in
New England, Glazer said, the players, ranging in age from 12 to
22, come from all over the region.
</P>
<P>
   Zack Beaulieu, 13, travels from Augusta, Maine to join in the
games. He said he ``can't wait'' for the nationals and wants to
play basketball in college.
</P>
<P>
   His father exemplifies the efforts parents make to get their
youngsters to the games. During the basketball season, Raymond
Beaulieu, 38, a pipefitter, drives Zack the seven-hour round trip
from Augusta to Canton twice a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Zack couldn't play basketball or wheelchair tennis, he'd be
a different kid,'' Raymond Beaulieu said. ``This keeps him in shape
and in better health. It's Zack's positive attitude that gives the
family strength.''
</P>
<P>
   Beaulieu said his son's spine was severed when he was 4 and
struck by a speeding car as he crossed the street to his
grandmother's house in Grand Isle, Maine. Now, he plans to be a
computer animator.
</P>
<P>
   Another player with a spinal cord injury, Jaime Mazzi, 17, of
Lynn, has been paralyzed from the waist down since he was 4 and a
drunk driver hit the car his father was driving when Mazzi was
living with him in Bolivia.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, Mazzi's mother, Edith Alvarado, who is legally
blind, accompanied her son to the basketball practices twice a week
and sometimes more on public transportation. The trip took them
three hours each way.
</P>
<P>
   Crisafulli calls Mazzi, ``the team's Larry Bird.''
</P>
<P>
   Mazzi, the team's leading scorer, said, ``Playing basketball
makes me feel free.''
</P>
<P>
   The team's other players have their stories, equally poignant,
but would rather talk about basketball and their hopes for the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Damian White, 17, of Walpole, hopes to get an athletic
scholarship and study engineering. He has been paralyzed from the
waist down since a car accident when he was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Wise of Needham, 16 next Sunday, said he was born with
spina bifida and has used a wheelchair since he was 3. ``I want to
be a computer graphic designer,'' Wise said.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Vanelli, 17, of Holbrook, lost one leg below the knee after
he was stabbed in the calf. He loves the game, he said, but he also
plays ``to lose weight.'' Reynald ``Ray'' Grandoit, 16, of Boston,
the team's newest member, said he became paralyzed after
contracting spinal meningitis when he was a baby. His main concern
now is choosing a college to study psychology.
</P>
<P>
   Jaime Zuluago, 17, of Pawtucket, R.I., missed a recent practice
because of an after-school job, but Glazer said he will be at the
nationals. Zuluago's disability, Glazer said, ``was caused by a bad
polio vaccine he got in Venezuela.''
</P>
<P>
   Dustin Ferreira, 15, who comes from New Bedford but lives at the
school, is disappointed he won't be able to travel with his team.
``I was born with osteogenesis,'' Ferreira said, ``or brittle
bones. Then, I had to go and break a finger in practice.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Ferreira has something to look forward to. Described as ``a
whiz'' in table tennis, he plans to go to New Mexico in July to
take part in a table tennis tournament. He also participates in
track and field, and archery.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Christian, 15, who attends public school in Canton, was
home with a strep throat during a recent practice at the school,
but planned on being better when the team leaves for Illinois on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Christian, who has set swimming records, plays golf and
baseball, rides a bike, and is a ``gofer'' at a golf club near his
home, was born with partially formed limbs.
</P>
<P>
   He explained how he taught himself to propel his wheelchair and
shoot baskets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take off one leg so it won't get in the way and I hold the
ball with two arms and push up,'' he said. ``My parents helped me
out a great deal, but I was determined to do it on my own.''

   MEXICO-BOOK (Mexico City) _ A new children's book in Spanish and
English is being published by a small press in El Paso, a profusely
illustrated ``History of Colors'' that tells an ancient Mexican
Indian myth of how colors came into the world. The publisher got a

   CHINA-NUKE (Washington) _ The White House is resisting a House
panel's efforts to make public information about how the Clinton
administration has handled China's campaign to acquire sensitive
American military technology, congressional officials said. A
special bipartisan committee and the administration have been
quietly negotiating how much of the report could be publicly
released, but in recent weeks the discussions have entered a
sensitive stage. The special committee goes out of business at the
end of the month. A few days later China's prime minister comes to

 &HT;    ENDLESS ANNOUNCEMENTS ARE CANDIDATES' BID TO BE NOTICED
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (p) politics categories.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Presidential hopefuls are using a new ploy to
attract the attention of tuned-out voters: multiple announcements
about ``exploratory committees'' as a prelude to the formal rollout
of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Dole is traveling to Iowa on Wednesday to announce
that she is forming an exploratory committee to determine whether
to run for president, even though few doubt she has already begun
to run.
</P>
<P>
   The best example of this phenomenon is former Vice President Dan
Quayle's campaign for the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
   In a well-publicized appearance on CNN's ``Larry King Live'' in
January, Quayle announced that he would be forming an exploratory
committee. The first week in February in his home state of Indiana,
he announced the actual formation of the committee. Later that same
week, he made the same announcement in his adopted state of
Arizona, then went to Iowa and New Hampshire for similar
announcements.
</P>
<P>
   Still to come is Quayle's official announcement of his
candidacy, now expected in April in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actually think we're on the light side of announcements,''
said Quayle spokesman Jonathan Baron, ``at least compared to
some.''
</P>
<P>
   He cited Texas Gov. George W. Bush's numerous pronouncements
about whether he would run prior to last week's announcement to the
Texas media that he intended to announce the formation of an
exploratory committee, which he announced Sunday. No date has been
set for the actual announcement of his candidacy, however.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason for the process _ sometimes called the
``strip-tease'' by political reporters _ is that presidential
candidates are trying ``to milk every last ounce of publicity,''
said Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia professor who is an
expert on the relationship between presidential candidates and the
media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a commentary on the short half-life of public memory and
the electorate's general lack of attention to politics,'' added
Sabato. ``It probably takes a half-dozen 'hits' before the public
gets the message that X or Y is running.''
</P>
<P>
   Often, advisers say an exploratory committee is being formed
because federal election regulations require one before the
potential candidate can raise money and travel to ``test the
waters'' before officially entering the race.
</P>
<P>
   The regulations of the Federal Election Commission (FEC) contain
no such requirement, according to Ian Stirton, the FEC's spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, FEC regulations specifically contain ``testing the
waters'' exemptions from having to register with the federal
agency, which oversees federal elections. And in campaigns prior to
1996, presidential aspirants generally did not register with the
FEC while testing their potential appeal as a candidate. ``We never
used to see much of this,'' Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the coming months, the FEC assumes the 2000
presidential candidates will amend the names of their campaign
organizations to drop the word ``exploratory'' from the title,
Stirton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Exploratory' is really a term the candidates have just
decided to use _ for whatever reason,'' he said.

RICHARD F. CUNNINGHAM, HEARST EXECUTIVE, DIES AT 52 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Richard F. Cunningham, group finance and
administrative officer for The Hearst Corporation's Entertainment &AMP;
Syndication Group, died Monday at his home in Suffern, N.Y., after
battling cancer for several months. He was 52 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cunningham, who joined The Hearst Corporation in financial
planning in 1977, had held the finance and administrative officer
position since the formation of the Entertainment &AMP; Syndication
Group in 1989. Mr. Cunningham was responsible for the financial
activities for all Hearst interests in the group, including A&AMP;E;
Lifetime; ESPN; The History Channel; King Features Syndicate; New
England Cable News; First DataBank; and Hearst Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he was a member of the boards of A&AMP;E Television
Networks, First DataBank-Europe, Hearst/ABC Video Services and New
England Cable News.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cunningham was an adviser to the board of TVA, a supplier of
cable and satellite television services in Brazil in which Hearst
is an investor, and was active in the operations of Hearst's joint
venture in Locomotion, the all- animation channel in Latin America,
Spain and Portugal. He also played a key role in such group
acquisitions as Medi-Span Inc., a supplier of drug product
information to the healthcare industry, which was consolidated into
First DataBank.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dick Cunningham was instrumental in the growth and success of
Hearst's many activities in entertainment and syndication,'' said
Raymond E. Joslin, group head of Hearst Entertainment &AMP; Syndication
and vice president of The Hearst Corporation. ``His death is a
tremendous loss to the company and to his many colleagues who were
inspired by his energy, wisdom and foresight. He will be greatly
missed.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cunningham joined The Hearst Corporation as manager of
financial planning in 1977 and was named assistant controller of
the company in 1981. The following year, he was appointed assistant
treasurer and director of financial planning of The Hearst
Corporation.
</P>
<P>
   In this capacity, he coordinated corporate financial planning
activities and contributed to Hearst's numerous acquisitions in the
1980s, including Esquire magazine, Diversion magazine, and the
Cowles and North America syndicates which were consolidated into
King Features. He was a principal Hearst representative in the
process leading to the merger of ARTS with the Entertainment
Channel, which formed A&AMP;E, and the merger of Daytime with Cable
Health Network, which created Lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to joining Hearst, Mr. Cunningham was an assistant vice
president for Irving Trust Co., where he was responsible for
financial reporting. He also held executive positions with St.
Regis Paper Co. and Arthur Andersen &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   He was a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the New York State Society of Certified Public
Accountants and the Financial Executives Institute. He was active
for nine years with the Suffern, N.Y., Little League, as a member
of the board, treasurer and coach, and was a coach for the Suffern
High School baseball team.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Cunningham served as a sergeant in the U.S. Army's Signal
Corps, with top secret security clearance. He held two degrees from
Fordham University: a B.S. in accounting and an MBA in finance.
</P>
<P>
   He also completed post-graduate study in finance and
econometrics at Pace University.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Dawn, and their four children,
Michael, Brian, Amy and Meghan, of Suffern, N.Y.; two brothers,
Victor of Valley Cottage, N.Y., and Thomas of Monroe, N.Y.; and one
sister, Ann Marie Fitzgerald of Long Valley, N.J. Funeral services
will be held at 10 a.m., Thursday, March 11, at Church of the
Presentation, 271 West Saddle River Road, Upper Saddle River, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Remembrances may be donated to the Suffern Little League, c/o
Cunningham Family, 45 Maplewood Boulevard, Suffern, N.Y. 10961.

   You see the description on the menu _ caramelized _ and in an
instant, you're a kid again on the midway at the county fair. That
little taste of the sweet tinged with fire is being touted on more
and more restaurant menus these days, so much so that Food &AMP; Wine
magazine spotted caramelizing as a top menu trend for 1999.

</P>
<P>
   The industry calls the Daewoo Lanos and other cars in its class
``roller skates,'' meaning they're generally small, sometimes peppy
and almost always low-priced cars targeting first-time buyers and
those looking for basic, no-frills transportation. Give Daewoo
credit, though. The South Korean builder reaches out to some
prestigious sources _ primarily Italian designer Porsche and
General Motors, a former partner _ for help designing and powering
its lineup of cars. (Includes 3-column color photo of the exterior

</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 1 COLOR ILLUSTRATION, 1 COLOR PHOTO, 1 COLOR MUG)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a financial secretary who keeps track of your bills,
pays them when due and lives on the Internet or the hard drive of
your computer. That's the promise of electronic banking: to
automate the routine chores of paying bills, checking bank balances
and balancing your checkbook. (Includes 5-column color illustration
of electronic banking)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MAC NEWS: At a recent trade conference in Tokyo, Apple
announced more than 1,500 new software programs for the Mac have
been released. That's good news _ except, where do you find all
these new titles?
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH REPORT: The Web can be full of lies, which is part of
its appeal. In a Web chat room, a short, lumpy unemployed person
can become tall, svelte and gainfully employed. And no one knows
the difference. (Includes 1 color photo of the cover of Yahoo!
Internet life)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: There's a virulent form of hacking growing in
popularity that allows almost anyone to invade your computer and
read files, delete them or add new files ... all from a remote
computer while you are on the Internet. (Includes 1 color mug shot)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH TOOLS: Try changing your program settings to make a
program do something you think it ought to be able to do. It
doesn't always work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have
so many user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: A TOUR FOR EVERY TASTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 5 COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS)
</P>
<P>
   A group tour of Europe used to mean one thing: 50 people crowded
on a ''motor coach'' (brochure-speak for enormous bus) racing
through 10 countries in as many days. Those tours still exist. But
something strange has happened in the tour business. A ``European
tour'' now can mean many things. (Includes 4 color illustrations,
varying from 3 columns to 1 columns, depicting ways to travel in
Europe such as via bike, hiking, riding a horse and traveling with
a pet.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL COLUMN: Adventure travel used to mean something
along the lines of riding a camel through dust storms in Morocco,
hot on the trail of the mysterious Blue People, or hacking your way
with a machete through Peru's jungles, looking for a lost tribe.
But lately, the word adventure is just a marketing term to make
tame tours sound more thrilling. (Includes a 1-column color
illustration of plane passengers on a wacky flight)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL BRIEFS: An early bloom won't stop Austin's famous floral
festival.

</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 3 COLOR PHOTOS, 1 COLOR MUG SHOT)
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual guru and author Iyanla Vanzant is the picture of
serene success. Vanzant seems perfectly at peace, and why not?
She's a regular on TV's ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' Hallmark has turned
her daily affirmations into a line of greeting cards and her string
of best sellers includes ``Acts of Faith,'' a book many loyal
readers call the black women's Bible. (Includes 2-column color
photo of author Iyanla Vanzant)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ''Monica's Story'' might well be called ''The
Miseducation of Monica Lewinsky.'' It's the story of how an
emotionally needy young woman sought to assuage her low self-esteem
with eating binges and affairs with unavailable men _ one of which
just happened to be the president of the United States _ and who
threw this country into a tabloid frenzy and the first impeachment
trial in 131 years. (Includes 2-column color photo of book jacket)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ``The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky,'' widely believed
to be the only first-person, on-the-spot account of a major
artist's collapse into psychosis, is a harrowing book. Losing one's
mind is not romantic. But, oh, how we like to think it is.
(Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: No one is so romantic as the
hero-worshipping academic, and no one quicker to hiss when the
daydream is punctured. (Includes 1-column color photo of columnist)

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: PLUGGING A HOLE TO SAVE A LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES 3 COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS)
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for developing infants to have a small opening in
their heart while in the womb and as newborns. The hole is
considered harmless because it typically closes in the first few
days after birth. But it often doesn't in premature babies. An
experimental device and procedure being performed in Augusta, Ga.,
is aiming to treat the condition. (Includes 4-column color photo of
child who underwent procedure along with family, a 1-column photo
of surgeon performing procedure and a 6-pica detail photo of device
used in procedure)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: END OF LIFE: Death does not come easily to doctors.
Inevitable as it is in their line of work, it flies in the face of
their training, purpose, even their egos. But many social and
technological issues are forcing doctors to add end-of-life care to
their purview of prevention and treatment.

A TABLE TAKES TIME. MOSTLY YOURS. 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By RICK MARIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The minute Evelyn Kenvin walked into Bouley Bakery
for dinner on the evening of Jan. 30, something felt a little off.
</P>
<P>
   The hostess flashed a surprised look and retreated to confer
with the manager. After this huddle, Ms. Kenvin and her party of
four were seated, and everything was fine.
</P>
<P>
   But some instinct told her to check her machine, so she called
it from her cell phone. It turned out the restaurant had left a
message that afternoon saying their 6:30 reservation had been
canceled. The reason: ``a technical problem.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Kenvin, a vice president at Citibank who has been to her
share of fancy eateries, this was a first. She'd never been
``canceled'' before. Imagine attending a party from which you'd
been disinvited. ``I was amused, frankly,'' she said. ``My husband
was annoyed. He doesn't understand the pompousness of these
places.''
</P>
<P>
   New Yorkers can go almost anywhere in the city for the privilege
of bad treatment, and trendy restaurants are among the most
reliable locales for insult and ego injury. The cruel irony is that
just as it seems servers are getting better _ less surly, more
helpful _ the experience of making it past the front door is
getting worse.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of a creeping, cavalier callousness are everywhere: the
endless confirming and reconfirming reservations, the ``we'll need
the table back by'' bum's rush. The secret VIP phone lines
segregating diners into two classes: those who have The Number and
those who don't.
</P>
<P>
   Apprised of the cancellation incident, David Bouley expressed
appropriate dismay. Construction in the building had threatened a
power outage, and the possibility existed that the restaurant would
have to close that night, he said. Perfectly plausible, but no such
information was offered the Kenvin party at the time. And the room
was filled with diners. Had they, too, been canceled?
</P>
<P>
   Making reservations, never a walk in the park, has become a
maddening time suck. Some diners are starting to get annoyed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to set my Palm Pilot to remind me to recall places to
make sure I did what I already did!'' said Anthony Giglio, a senior
editor at P.O.V. magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Herscher, a marketing manager at Broadway Books, made a
reservation for four at Bond Street, was asked for his credit card
number and was told that if he didn't show up he'd be charged $50 _
not an uncommon practice for large groups, but this was four
people. ``I understand that Bond Street is hip and busy,'' he said.
``But this isn't an airplane reservation.''
</P>
<P>
   How bad have things become? As an experiment _ albeit a highly
selective and unscientific one _ I called a dozen restaurants for
dinner. I tried to make myself as accommodating as possible: just
two people, something close to 8 o'clock, on a quiet night
(Wednesday), with 10 days' notice. A simple enough request. Or so
it seemed.
</P>
<P>
   Union Pacific asked for a reconfirmation call 48 hours in
advance (italics)and(end italics) a credit card number. ``Don't
worry, we will never charge your card,'' the hostess chirped.
``It's merely an incentive for you to call.''
</P>
<P>
   I was put on hold for what seemed like a very long 30 seconds;
then, a brusquely efficient female voice offered me 8:45, provided
I called the special reconfirmation line the day before between 10
and 5 p.m. I said I'd be traveling that day and asked what would
happen if I couldn't call. ``We will rebook the table if we don't
get a confirmation,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   At Jean Georges, I was transferred into a many-circled voice
mail hell. After a long recorded message advertising Jean-George
Vongerichten's Epicurian empire (Vong, Jo Jo, Mercer Kitchen), a
French-accented woman picked up.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Mmm,'' she said twice, furrowing her syllables. ``We can give
you 5:30, but we need the table back by 8.'' Then she noticed a
7:30, but I'd have to be out by 9 or 9:30. I asked if the time
limit was a regular thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's usually two and a half hours for a party of two,'' she
said cheerily, asking that I reconfirm by 10 a.m. the day before
and assigning me the confirmation number 151.
</P>
<P>
   Balthazar, Veruka, Bond Street and Cena all insisted on
reconfirmation calls, and none of them seemed particularly flexible
about my professed inability to call back. Union Square Cafe,
however, promised to hold my 6 p.m. table until 6:30, even if the
staff didn't hear from me.
</P>
<P>
   All the restaurants called me to check if I was coming, many
with brusque messages detailing the time my reservation would be
terminated if I failed to call back.
</P>
<P>
   The most laid back of the lot was, amazingly, Le Cirque. When I
asked if I should call to reconfirm, the reaction was far from a
cold Continental shoulder. ``No, no problem,'' the hostess said.
``We trust that you're going to come.''
</P>
<P>
   Trust. The word seemed quaint in the cold, transactional
business of getting into a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, no-shows can cost a restaurant thousands on a bad
night. They are indeed nefarious criminals of New York dining
society, averaging 25 percent to 30 percent, according to studies
by American Express. And they have the effect of the bad kid in
school, whose anonymous mischief means the teacher has to punish
the whole class.
</P>
<P>
   Sirio Maccioni, the owner of Le Cirque, prefers a more lenient
approach. ``Of course there are people who make reservations in two
or three restaurants on one night,'' Maccioni said. ``But what can
you do, call the police?''
</P>
<P>
   Some restaurateurs sound as if they would like to. Keith
McNally, the owner of Balthazar, for one, said: ``There are
customers who walk in who are infuriating, who are drunk or who are
so socially insecure it's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   There does seem to be an increasingly adversarial relationship
between diner and host. Tim Zagat, whose populist guides talk as
much about how customers are served as what they are served,
pointed out that there were ways of dealing with the problem of
hotness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Danny Meyer makes you feel good even when he's saying no to
you,'' Zagat said. ``Other places, when they're saying yes, you
want to hit them in the face.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for any restaurateur is that his place gets, in Yogi
Berra's formulation, so popular nobody goes there anymore.
</P>
<P>
   At Asia de Cuba, just try to ascend the stairway to the
restaurant and bar area without a gatekeeper demanding to know if
you have a reservation. Mercer Kitchen has Asia de Cuba's
two-tiered security system: outer and inner sanctums.
</P>
<P>
   Greeter No. 1 waylays you in the Mercer Hotel lobby, while she
double-checks your reservations before permitting descent into the
restaurant downstairs, where Greeter No. 2 awaits. Cafe Moomba
dispenses with even the pretense of politesse: a bouncer with
clipboard mans the velvet rope.
</P>
<P>
   But clubby attitude has trickled down to restaurants that don't
live or die by Leo sightings. Take Balthazar: When I called the
regular Balthazar number to ask for an 8 p.m. reservation, I was
told there was nothing for two and a half weeks. When I called The
Number, an 8 o'clock table opened up the next night.
</P>
<P>
   McNally said he did not believe his system of diner
discrimination _ ``reservationism,'' you might call it _ was
exclusionary. ``It's not really private since it gets printed all
over the place,'' he said of the secret number, exposed in the
March issue of Vogue.
</P>
<P>
   Its code cracked, Balthazar has been calling Very Important
Diners and giving them a new secret number: 625-8665.
</P>
<P>
   It might work for a few more days. &QL;

   You see the description on the menu _ caramelized _ and in an
instant, you're a kid again on the midway at the county fair. That
little taste of the sweet tinged with fire is being touted on more
and more restaurant menus these days, so much so that Food &AMP; Wine
magazine spotted caramelizing as a top menu trend for 1999.

<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 2 COLOR PHOTOS AND 1 COLOR MUG SHOT OF COLUMNIST)
</P>
<P>
   The industry calls the Daewoo Lanos and other cars in its class
``roller skates,'' meaning they're generally small, sometimes peppy
and almost always low-priced cars targeting first-time buyers and
those looking for basic, no-frills transportation. Give Daewoo
credit, though. The South Korean builder reaches out to some
prestigious sources _ primarily Italian designer Porsche and
General Motors, a former partner _ for help designing and powering
its lineup of cars. (Includes 3-column color photo of the exterior

battery is rated. (Includes 1-column photo of columnist Nora
Carter)

   &UR; PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY: ELECTRONIC BANKING &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 1 COLOR ILLUSTRATION, 1 COLOR PHOTO, 1 COLOR MUG)
</P>
<P>
   Imagine a financial secretary who keeps track of your bills,
pays them when due and lives on the Internet or the hard drive of
your computer. That's the promise of electronic banking: to
automate the routine chores of paying bills, checking bank balances
and balancing your checkbook. (Includes 5-column color illustration
of electronic banking)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: MAC NEWS: At a recent trade conference in Tokyo, Apple
announced more than 1,500 new software programs for the Mac have
been released. That's good news _ except, where do you find all
these new titles?
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH REPORT: The Web can be full of lies, which is part of
its appeal. In a Web chat room, a short, lumpy unemployed person
can become tall, svelte and gainfully employed. And no one knows
the difference. (Includes 1 color photo of the cover of Yahoo!
Internet life)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECHNOBUDDY: There's a virulent form of hacking growing in
popularity that allows almost anyone to invade your computer and
read files, delete them or add new files ... all from a remote
computer while you are on the Internet. (Includes 1 color mug shot)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TECH TOOLS: Try changing your program settings to make a
program do something you think it ought to be able to do. It
doesn't always work, but nowadays programs are so flexible and have
so many user-changeable parameters, it's always worth trying.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TRAVEL: A TOUR FOR EVERY TASTE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 5 COLOR ILLUSTRATIONS)
</P>
<P>
   A group tour of Europe used to mean one thing: 50 people crowded
on a ''motor coach'' (brochure-speak for enormous bus) racing
through 10 countries in as many days. Those tours still exist. But
something strange has happened in the tour business. A ``European
tour'' now can mean many things. (Includes 4 color illustrations,
varying from 3 columns to 1 columns, depicting ways to travel in
Europe such as via bike, hiking, riding a horse and traveling with
a pet.)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: TRAVEL COLUMN: Adventure travel used to mean something
along the lines of riding a camel through dust storms in Morocco,
hot on the trail of the mysterious Blue People, or hacking your way
with a machete through Peru's jungles, looking for a lost tribe.
But lately, the word adventure is just a marketing term to make
tame tours sound more thrilling. (Includes a 1-column color
illustration of plane passengers on a wacky flight)
</P>
<P>
   TRAVEL BRIEFS: An early bloom won't stop Austin's famous floral
festival.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOOKS: IYANLA VANZANT &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (PAGE INCLUDES 3 COLOR PHOTOS, 1 COLOR MUG SHOT)
</P>
<P>
   Spiritual guru and author Iyanla Vanzant is the picture of
serene success. Vanzant seems perfectly at peace, and why not?
She's a regular on TV's ``Oprah Winfrey Show,'' Hallmark has turned
her daily affirmations into a line of greeting cards and her string
of best sellers includes ``Acts of Faith,'' a book many loyal
readers call the black women's Bible. (Includes 2-column color
photo of author Iyanla Vanzant)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ''Monica's Story'' might well be called ''The
Miseducation of Monica Lewinsky.'' It's the story of how an
emotionally needy young woman sought to assuage her low self-esteem
with eating binges and affairs with unavailable men _ one of which
just happened to be the president of the United States _ and who
threw this country into a tabloid frenzy and the first impeachment
trial in 131 years. (Includes 2-column color photo of book jacket)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: REVIEW: ``The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky,'' widely believed
to be the only first-person, on-the-spot account of a major
artist's collapse into psychosis, is a harrowing book. Losing one's
mind is not romantic. But, oh, how we like to think it is.
(Includes 6-pica color photo of book jacket)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: SKUBE ON BOOKS: No one is so romantic as the
hero-worshipping academic, and no one quicker to hiss when the
daydream is punctured. (Includes 1-column color photo of columnist)

   &UR; SCIENCE &AMP; HEALTH: PLUGGING A HOLE TO SAVE A LIFE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PAGE INCLUDES 3 COLOR PHOTOGRAPHS)
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for developing infants to have a small opening in
their heart while in the womb and as newborns. The hole is
considered harmless because it typically closes in the first few
days after birth. But it often doesn't in premature babies. An
experimental device and procedure being performed in Augusta, Ga.,
is aiming to treat the condition. (Includes 4-column color photo of
child who underwent procedure along with family, a 1-column photo
of surgeon performing procedure and a 6-pica detail photo of device
used in procedure)
</P>
<P>
   WITH: END OF LIFE: Death does not come easily to doctors.
Inevitable as it is in their line of work, it flies in the face of
their training, purpose, even their egos. But many social and
technological issues are forcing doctors to add end-of-life care to
their purview of prevention and treatment.

</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Note optional trim)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
</P>
<P>
   I don't have the connections to find out the answer. All I have
are my hopes and prayers. This is what I hope. This is what I pray.
</P>
<P>
   That DiMaggio is in a place where he is forever young on the
outside, with a lifetime's worth of wisdom on the inside. I can
close my eyes and see DiMaggio standing tall and regal in Yankee
pinstripes, with no ache in his bones or his heart. I can see him
in full glide at the crack of the bat, his legs carrying him across
the vast, old Yankee Stadium outfield as fast as he needs to go.
</P>
<P>
   I see October and afternoon shadows. I see _ in grainy
black-and-white _ DiMaggio at the plate, the bases loaded. The
count is full. The game is in the balance. DiMaggio is at the plate
with his wide stance and supple wrists, No. 5 on his back. There is
no place to put him. Here comes the pitch ...I see into the night.
DiMaggio is wearing a tailored suit and walking hand-in-hand with
the love of his life. Free at last from mourning the loss of
Marilyn Monroe, he allows himself a toothy, uninhibited smile.
Would he explain to her why he sent roses to her grave week after
week, year after year?
</P>
<P>
   None of your business. None of my business. None of anybody's
business.
</P>
<P>
   I see Joseph Paul DiMaggio safe at home. For good. No more
awkward moments with strangers. No more impertinent questions from
nosy people. This is what I hope. This is what I pray.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio died early Monday morning. Cancer and pneumonia must be
so proud of themselves, picking a fight with an 84-year-old man.
What a knock-down, drag-out battle it turned out to be. He'd take
the reading of the last rites as his cue to defy death a little
longer. At one point, a doctor adjusting a breathing tube in
DiMaggio's throat got a quick earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to get the hell out of here,'' DiMaggio said, ``and go
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, DiMaggio got his way. Just as DiMaggio did upon
coming out of a coma and discovering that the world had been
getting up-to-the-minute updates on his condition. He angrily told
his doctors to keep their mouths shut, and that was that. He got
out of the hospital in January, after a 99-day stay, and spent the
rest of his days at home. Quietly. Privately.
</P>
<P>
   For those who had never seen DiMaggio play, it provided a hint
of the will that it took for the son of Italian immigrants _ the
eighth of nine children _ to become an American icon and a defining
figure of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Joe. The Yankee Clipper. Mr. Coffee.
</P>
<P>
   One of the cruel cultural jokes of the 20th century is that far
more people saw DiMaggio pitching coffee makers than saw him
roaming center field at Yankee Stadium. Clearly, there was more to
DiMaggio than his Hall of Fame resume could ever capture. Something
besides numbers moved Ernest Hemingway to rhapsodize about DiMaggio
in ``The Old Man and the Sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Something besides numbers compelled Richard Rodgers and Oscar
Hammerstein to write the following lyrics in ``South Pacific'':
``Bloody Mary is the girl I love. ... Her skin is as tender as
DiMaggio's glove.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio played 13 seasons, batting .325, with 361 home runs and
1,537 runs batted in. He won the American League's MVP award three
times. His team won 10 pennants and nine World Series. He had the
56-game hitting streak. He was the first $100,000 ballplayer.
</P>
<P>
   And to think, DiMaggio was so unsophisticated when he arrived in
the majors that he once acknowledged: ``I can remember a reporter
asking for a quote, and I didn't know what a quote was. I thought
it was some kind of soft drink.''
</P>
<P>
   There were better hitters, better base runners, better defensive
center fielders than DiMaggio. Yet DiMaggio carried the vote in
1969 when a panel decided to anoint ``The Greatest Living
Ballplayer.'' During his later years, DiMaggio would not appear at
public functions unless assured he would be introduced as such.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who weren't around when DiMaggio played will just
have to take it from Connie Mack, who managed more games than
anybody in major-league history: ``As one of nine men, DiMaggio is
the best player who ever lived.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who weren't around then will just have to take it on
the authority of Hall-of-Famer Yogi Berra: ``He was the perfect
ballplayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who weren't around then will have to take the word
of Ted Williams: ``I really in my heart think he was the greatest
player I ever saw. ... He made it look so easy, so good. Never saw
him look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Witness after witness would marvel at the DiMaggian elegance and
grace. He played center field the way Clark Gable played Rhett
Butler. DiMaggio lost three years of his prime fulfilling military
service obligations in World War II. What could he have done at
ages 28, 29, and 30? What could he have done if he hadn't played
half his games in a stadium that was Death Valley to right-handed
pull hitters?
</P>
<P>
   Left center at Yankee Stadium was 457 feet from home plate
during DiMaggio's day. Dead center was 461 feet. Right center was
407. Home run after home run wound up in somebody's glove. DiMaggio
batted .315 with 148 homers at home. He batted .333 with 213 homers
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Joe DiMaggio would have played in any ballpark except
Yankee Stadium,'' Mickey Mantle used to say, ``he would have hit
over 500 easily.''
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of DiMaggio's career, somebody asked why he still
pushed himself so hard and demanded so much of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because,'' DiMaggio said, ``there might be somebody in the
stands who hasn't seen me play before.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio retired when he knew his skills had diminished, even
though the Yankees happily would have continued to pay him his
six-figure salary. Having conquered one national pastime, he took
on another in 1954 by marrying Marilyn Monroe. She broke off from
their honeymoon in Japan to perform for U.S. troops in South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never heard such cheering,'' Marilyn told him afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I have,'' DiMaggio said.
</P>
<P>
   Their marriage lasted less than a year. Still, DiMaggio never
seemed to get her out of his system. Rumors of a re-marriage were
floating when she died in 1962. DiMaggio made the funeral
arrangements and barred people he deemed as unfit influences _
Frank Sinatra and Peter Lawford, to name two _ from attending. For
the next two decades, DiMaggio sent fresh roses to her grave three
times a week.
</P>
<P>
   People knew better than to interrogate DiMaggio about his
feelings for Marilyn. Even as the culture went the way of Barbara
Walters and Jerry Springer, DiMaggio remained zealously private. He
was one of the last of a breed that is dying too fast.

WHY ARTICHOKE FIGHTS WITH WINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Conn.)   (af)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   Artichokes can play a nasty trick on the palate. Some people
find that anything they eat or drink after tasting one seems sweet.
Not such a terrible side effect, perhaps, but it can be a nightmare
for sommeliers. An artichoke can make an elegant white wine seem
tinny and cloying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's impossible to pair with wines,'' said Doug Washington, a
managing partner and a wine director at Jardiniere in San
Francisco. ``You fumble, you really do fumble.''
</P>
<P>
   Washington encourages people to try Champagne because, he said,
its acidity goes better with artichokes than buttery flavors.
(Chardonnays, for instance, are to be avoided.) Or he will pair the
wine not with the artichoke but with its sauce, hoping that that
flavor bond will overpower the sweetening effect.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Stone, the wine director at Rubicon in San Francisco,
relies on lean white wines from France, particularly Quincy, that
are ``mean'' and aggressively acidic to cut through the sweetness.
</P>
<P>
   He has also found that it helps if the artichoke is young and
has been cooked with some kind of acid _ wine, vinegar or citrus.
</P>
<P>
   Few studies have been done on the subject, but one performed in
1972 by Linda Bartoshuk, a professor at the Yale University School
of Medicine, found that cynarin, an organic compound in artichokes,
is the cause of this reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Cynarin inhibits sweet receptors on the tongue. When it is
rinsed away with liquid, the inhibiting effect is released and the
taste cell misinterprets that as a stimulus. ``The brain gets a
barrage of messages from the sweet receptors, but all you have in
fact in your mouth is water,'' Dr. Bartoshuk said. Or wine.
</P>
<P>
   The reaction to cynarin appears to be genetic and, she said,
more prevalent in women.
</P>
<P>
   For now, as long as people hanker for artichokes, sommeliers are
left to sweat it out.

OUT OF THE MIST, THE ARTICHOKE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVENPORT, Calif. _ Standing at the edge of the jagged cliffs
that run along Highway 1, you can hear the violence down below, the
powerful Pacific shattering itself on the rocky shoreline. But what
you feel is gentleness, a light briny mist that suffuses the air.
</P>
<P>
   This is the rough-hewn far edge of America that has drawn
painters and movie makers, surfers and tourists. But it is also, as
it turns out, the domain of the artichoke, which flourishes in the
mild mist here _ particularly in the stretch just north of Santa
Cruz _ as it does nowhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The land is covered with the lush, green bushy plants, a shag
rug that stops just where the land drops off into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Here, Steve Bontadelli, a man with meaty hands and a handlebar
mustache, tends 400 acres of the thistle plants. ``The old-timers
say in April you can grow an artichoke on a telephone pole here,''
Bontadelli said as he drove a two-and-a-half-ton flatbed truck
through his fields.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for growers like Bontadelli, that hasn't been the
case lately. In the 1990s, the artichoke crops in California _
where almost all artichokes in the United States are grown _ have
been pounded to bits like the waves on the shore below.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Bontadelli's fields were hit with frost. In 1995, a
tornado ripped through, flattening the plants like pancakes. Then
in 1998, rains from El Nino _ which artichoke growers refer to as
``the N-word'' _ drowned the roots.
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 crop promises to be different. In fact it looks as if
this just might be one of those Aprils. In a harvest that began in
late February, the artichokes are already coming in bountifully.
And when artichokes are good, they are glorious.
</P>
<P>
   The large-petaled bulb that is eaten is actually the plant's
flower bud. It is as dense as a potato, nutty and sweet, a flavor
both unique and perplexing. And though you can buy artichokes all
year round, none compare to the ones harvested in the cool, dewy
spring months.
</P>
<P>
   The abundance is all thanks to a light frost the day before
Christmas, which set the plant's buds. Then a long, cool winter
with temperatures never much lower than 40 degrees or higher than
60 allowed the buds to develop slowly, making them meaty and
succulent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant itself is stunningly beautiful, with large silvery
green leaves that spout up from the base like a fountain. A single
plant can cover 45 square feet in a field. What space it demands in
the field, though, the artichoke makes up for in generosity to the
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Every artichoke plant offers three different-size buds. A single
large one that can be as large as a coconut forms on the central
stem; a handful of medium ones grow around it, and almost a dozen
small artichokes, the size of a lime, form around the base.
</P>
<P>
   It is believed that the first artichokes grown in California
were brought from Spain or Italy and raised in mission gardens. As
the immigrant population grew in the 19th century, so did the
variety of crops. ``This whole coast was old Italian guys,''
Bontadelli said of the farmers sprinkled through the area.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of artichoke growing is about 40 miles south of
Bontadelli's land, in the coastal region of the Salinas Valley.
There, the air smells of artichokes.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the property in the area was originally Spanish land
grants, and descendants rented it out to farmers. In Castroville,
Andrew Molera, one such descendant, owned a large portion of the
arable land and rented it to sugar beet growers for decades. But
early in the 20th century, when the sugar beet market declined, the
Moleras sought other crops with more stable markets.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes were still a fairly small industry, but they were
grown near San Francisco and sold in the city's produce markets.
Andrew Molera thought they would be a profitable crop and pushed
for farmers to grow them in Castroville. The first commercial
fields were planted in the Salinas Valley's loamy river-sediment
soil in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't stopped since. Castroville, where 75 percent of all
California artichokes are grown, now calls itself the artichoke
capital of the world.
</P>
<P>
   The number of farmers dwindled from about 60 in the 1960s to
about 10, and the Molera family slowly sold off its land. Today,
California artichokes are grown either by descendants of the
original families or by the Dole Food Co.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, two groups of small farmers banded together,
forming Sea Mist Farms and Associated Produce Distributors, so they
could share their packing and shipping operations and be more
competitive. But they didn't change how they grew their artichokes
and harvested them, and those tasks are still done as they have
been for hundreds of years: by hand.
</P>
<P>
   The green globe artichoke, the most common variety, can be grown
only from cuttings and does not yield to the methodical motions of
an insensible harvesting machine. Its buds can appear on any part
of the plant. They must be discovered by eye and cut off with the
swipe of a knife.
</P>
<P>
   One small grower, the Leonardini family, has been raising
artichokes for four generations. ``We are the survivors,'' said
Tony Leonardini, 54. He began working on his father's 125 acres in
Castroville when he was a teen-ager. He grew up with the growers
who are now his partners in Associated Produce Distributors, as
well as with his competitors in Sea Mist Farms.
</P>
<P>
   Driving through his fields _ he now has 500 acres _ Leonardini
reminisced about playing football in high school with youths from
other farming families and going out at night with them to shoot
gophers in the artichoke fields. They still stick together. When El
Nino's rains wiped out a neighbor's crop, everyone donated cuttings
to get him back on his feet.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   But competition is beginning to seep in from outside
Castroville's serene agricultural oasis. Agricultural researchers
have developed artichokes that can be grown from seed. Unlike the
globe _ which is finicky about climate and requires careful
cultivation to preserve the rootstock _ seed varieties will grow
anywhere, even in the desert, and practically any time.
</P>
<P>
   To Traci des Jardins, the chef at Jardiniere in San Francisco,
the flavors of the seed varieties ``are not as intense and they're
more watery.'' She won't use them at all.
</P>
<P>
   Seed varieties have a smaller heart and are often pale in
flavor. They also tend to fall apart after cooking, and if
overcooked at all, Ms. des Jardins said, ``they turn to absolute
mush.''
</P>
<P>
   That the best artichokes are still grown in and around
Castroville is no accident. The Leonardinis and other small growers
have kept their business exclusive. As Leonardini put it, ``If you
were Howard Hughes and said you wanted to go into the artichoke
business, and you needed to buy some cuttings from a grower, I
don't think you could find that grower.''
</P>
<P>
   So outsiders went elsewhere: the lab.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for growers of the globe artichoke lies with
retailers, few of whom mark the name of the variety on their
display bins. Even fewer consumers can detect a difference, before
the artichokes are on the table.
</P>
<P>
   But there are clues: most seed varieties do not have thorns on
the ends of the petals like those on a globe. Globes flood the
market from March through May, then follow with a small second
season in October.
</P>
<P>
   They're now selling for as little as 69 cents each in Manhattan;
growers expect the price to drop even more as the season
progresses. The seed varieties are in the market mainly during the
globe's off-season.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring in Castroville, when the globe seems invincible,
Leonardini's fields in the flat Salinas Valley are flush with
healthy plants and dotted with groups of workers.
</P>
<P>
   With vinyl baskets latched on like backpacks, the workers waddle
down the rows, their heads barely visible in the sea of bushy
plants. As they swipe off an artichoke, they toss it into the air
like a tennis ball and keep on moving, heads bowed, so it drops
ever so gently into the basket.
</P>
<P>
   Because the artichokes on each plant mature at different rates,
each field is harvested once a week. The large central artichoke is
the first to go. The medium ones are usually ready about a week
later, the small ones a week after that. The small ones _ often
called baby artichokes _ are not actually babies at all. They, too,
are mature; they simply never grow bigger.
</P>
<P>
   After a field has been harvested, the workers prune the plants
to the base and give the trimmings to a local dairy farmer to feed
his cows. Because the plant is a perennial, it will regrow the next
year. Most growers keep plants 5 to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   In late February, the artichokes in Leonardini's field were
heavy and firm, with thick, rubbery leaves. He held up what
appeared to be a perfect specimen. Then he pointed out a small
black hole. In this case, it wasn't pesky weather, but the plume
moth, that was the invader.
</P>
<P>
   He tore off leaf after leaf riddled with black holes carved by
the moth, which is but one of the plant's enemies. (Mice and
gophers are some others.) ``That sucker,'' he said, ``he'll go all
the way to the center and just munch.''
</P>
<P>
   The pests are what has kept his farm from going organic. ``If I
could go out and not put a chemical on my field and grow a crop
that is profitable,'' Leonardini said, ``I could make more money.''
But, he added, ``who is going to set aside the ground for two years
to get it certified organic?''
</P>
<P>
   Other growers are finding ways. Bontadelli, for instance, who
relies on other crops for part of his income, has set aside a few
plots for the University of California at Santa Cruz to experiment
with organic techniques.
</P>
<P>
   It may be up to future generations to make the transition.
Driving past a neighbor's field, Leonardini slowed to say hello to
Mike Scattini, a son of his partner. Scattini was reporting on the
progress of the fields by cellular phone, but he was growing those
artichokes the same way his family has for generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still ask Mike to go on his property,'' Leonardini said.
``It's just common courtesy, even though I used to change his
diapers.''
</P>
<P>
   He sighed, then added: ``It's sometimes difficult to let them do
what they want to do. It's a changing of the guard that we have
going on.''
</P>
<P>
   But he does. Because the artichoke, an ancient, succulent
delight, is too precious to lose.

FISH STICKS AND TARTER SAUCE FOR GROWN-UPS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This is the sixth of eight columns by Rick Moonen, the executive
chef and an owner of Oceana in Manhattan. His collaborator on these
columns is Dorie Greenspan.) 
 (HLW)  
 By RICK MOONEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Friday was fish day when I was growing up, and lots
of times the fish was frozen fish sticks, the sauce was tartar, and
the salad was coleslaw. With seven kids and a full-time job, my mom
wasn't thinking fancy when Friday rolled around. But I enjoyed the
crunch of the fish sticks' crust, the moistness of the fish and the
coolness of the slaw. And it didn't hurt that the tartar sauce was
sweet and sharp. I had these things in mind when I created jumbo
lump crab cakes with chipotle sauce. Crab cakes may be fancier, but
they have the same appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The secret to great crab cakes is proper seasoning and, of
course, great crab meat. They are seasoned with a cooked mayonnaise
that includes onion and fresh bell peppers for sweetness, lime
juice and Dijon mustard for zing, Tabasco for heat and Vietnamese
fish sauce (nuoc cham) for a complex saltiness. Finally, I fold in
lots of fresh herbs for a clean, refreshing finish.
</P>
<P>
   A word on crab meat: it's expensive _ but even more expensive if
you don't buy the top grade. The best crab meat, jumbo lump, has
all large pieces of the choicest parts of the crab and the least
cartilage. You pay more, but you get more crab for your money. If
you buy less expensive lump or back-fin crab meat, with a lot of
cartilage, you have to buy more to get enough meat.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest preparing this dish as I do at the restaurant. Mix and
shape the crab cakes. Chill them for one to six hours to firm them
up. Make the chipotle sauce ahead, too.
</P>
<P>
   Chipotles are smoked jalapeno peppers (they usually come canned
in adobo sauce), and they've got a rich, slightly sweet flavor with
a soft smoky heat. Mixed with lime juice, rice vinegar and
cilantro, then blended with vegetable oil, they give the sauce a
depth of flavor that belies its lightness.
</P>
<P>
   I created the sauce for crab cakes, but any fish, grilled or
sauteed, would take to it.
</P>
<P>
   JUMBO LUMP CRAB CAKES WITH CHIPOTLE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1 hour, plus at least 2 hours' chilling
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups vegetable oil, plus more for sauteing
</P>
<P>
   { cup finely diced red, green and yellow bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   \ cup finely diced onion
</P>
<P>
   2 egg yolks
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon Tabasco
</P>
<P>
   1{ teaspoons Vietnamese fish sauce
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground white pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 pound jumbo lump crab meat, picked over to remove cartilage
</P>
<P>
   { to 2/3 cup fresh bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons each of roughly chopped fresh dill, chives and
parsley
</P>
<P>
   1 cup panko (Japanese bread crumbs)
</P>
<P>
   1 chipotle pepper with 1{ teaspoons adobo sauce
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped garlic
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon finely chopped shallot
</P>
<P>
   \ cup (packed) roughly chopped cilantro leaves
</P>
<P>
   \ cup seasoned rice vinegar
</P>
<P>
   Juice of { lemon
</P>
<P>
   Coleslaw, homemade or store-bought, for serving (optional)
</P>
<P>
   1. Prepare a saucepan of boiling water and a bowl of ice cubes
and cold water. To make mayonnaise, put { cup of oil in a saucepan
with peppers and onions, and cook over medium heat until oil
simmers and vegetables are tender, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, in a
metal bowl whisk together yolks, lime juice, mustard, Tabasco and
fish sauce. Add vegetables to yolk mixture, along with hot oil, by
droplets, whisking steadily until mixture is smooth and slightly
thickened. Season with salt and white pepper. Put bowl over pan of
boiling water, and still whisking, cook 1 minute. Transfer bowl to
ice-water bath. When mayonnaise is cool, cover, and refrigerate
until thoroughly chilled.
</P>
<P>
   2. Put crab meat in a large bowl, and gently fold in 1 cup of
mayonnaise. Fold in { cup bread crumbs. Mixture should be lightly
bound. If necessary, fold in more bread crumbs. Fold in herbs.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dust a plate with panko. Place a 2-inch-diameter ring mold,
1{ inches high, on panko, and pack mold with crab meat. Dust top
with panko, and tamp down crab meat, pressing hard. Remove mold,
and transfer crab cake to another plate; repeat with remaining
mixture. Cover crab cakes, and chill for at least 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   4. To make sauce, put chipotle, garlic, shallot, cilantro, rice
vinegar and lemon juice in a small food processor and pulverize.
While machine runs, gradually pour in remaining vegetable oil,
blending until sauce is emulsified. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Refrigerate. Bring to room temperature before serving.
</P>
<P>
   5. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Pour \ inch vegetable oil into a
large saute pan, and set over medium heat. When oil is hot, slip
crab cakes into pan. Cook about 2 minutes on one side until brown,
then transfer to a baking pan. Bake 5 minutes. Spoon coleslaw, if
using it, on each plate. Surround with chipotle sauce, and top with
two crab cakes.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

   It looks like a bird balancing on its belly. A black rubber
handle is its body, and a curved amber plastic shaft is its
outstretched neck. Nothing gives a clue to its clever function. But
if you hold it in your palm, neck upward, and glide the tip
backward over an orange, an amazing thing happens: a perfect strip
of zest, with no pith attached, begins pulling away from the fruit.
And you barely need to apply pressure.
</P>
<P>
   This zester has a second feature, too. On the inside curve of
the shaft is a thin fin of plastic. If you run it along an orange
vertically, and connect the slits, you can easily remove the peel
in sections.
</P>
<P>
   This odd little implement was created last year by Mastrad in
Paris. The design is based on a tool that jam factories use for
peeling oranges, said Mathieu Lion, the president of the company.
It was simply made more ergonomic for home cooks.
</P>
<P>
   And though it has but two uses _ one of them rarely needed _ it
performs so perfectly that it's worth adding to the gadget drawer.
Then, when you're in the mood for a martini, you can marvel at the
perfect curl of lemon bobbing up and down in your drink.
</P>
<P>
   The citrus zester is $7 at Dean &AMP; DeLuca, 560 Broadway (Prince
Street), in New York; (212) 431-1691.

FLOWER-WATCHERS SINGING THE BLUEBONNET BLUES IN TEXAS

<P>
   HOUSTON _ Nature has raised the curtain early on Texas' annual
springtime wildflower extravaganza. But even as roadsides burst
into bloom with Indian paintbrush, yellow-petaled coreopsis and
bluebonnets, experts worry that the season will be feeble and
short.
</P>
<P>
   Flower-watchers within a 100-mile radius of Houston report that
bluebonnets and other spring bloomers like golden wave, paintbrush
and evening primrose, are appearing in pastures around Cuero,
Yoakum and Brenham. To the northeast in Woodville, flowering trees
like redbud and dogwood are starting to show their colors.
</P>
<P>
   Carolina jessamine and some violets have been spotted in the Big
Thicket, and, farther afield, rangers at Big Bend National Park
have reported patches of verbena and mustard.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, blossoms have appeared weeks before they normally
would be expected, and in towns where flower tourism is an economic
factor, chamber of commerce officials have heralded the early
blooms with glee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The warm weather is just popping them out,'' said Deloris
Gause, president of the Yoakum Garden Club. ``They should peak in a
week or so. Evening primrose, golden wave, bluebonnets _ there is
lots of variety in flowers around here, but those predominate.''
</P>
<P>
   But some plant experts take a darker view.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bluebonnets are coming up early,'' said Texas A&AMP;M
University biologist Hugh Wilson. ``But that may be a stress
response. They seem a little stunted. I have a feeling that, for
the short term, this will not be one of our better springs.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who has studied native plants for two decades, said last
year's wet fall seemed ``maximal'' for bluebonnets and other winter
annuals. The plants germinated on schedule, set out wreaths of
leaves known as ``rosettes'' and were ``chugging along'' in
preparation for a March bloom, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has happened, though,'' he said, ``is that January and
February have been remarkably dry. The business of flowering and
doing reproductive things has been inhibited by lack of water. It's
just kind of suppressing the entire operation.''
</P>
<P>
   At Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport, only 2.2
inches of rainfall were recorded during those months _ 3.3 inches
below average. No rainfall has been recorded this month.
</P>
<P>
   Pat Marks, senior naturalist at the Houston Arboretum and Nature
Center, suggested the dry spring is only the latest in a series of
climatic events that have hurt plants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were exceptionally dry last summer, then exceptionally wet
in the fall, and now we're a little drier than normal,'' she said.
``Separately, each of these things can be harmful; together they
can be devastating. We lost a lot of mature woody plants.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Wilson's wildflowers, Marks' stressed trees have
compensated by ``putting on extra heavy blooms and put on extra
seed.''
</P>
<P>
   Without rainfall, though, she predicted, some summer-blooming,
daisy-like plants may not make a show at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson may be,'' she said, ``that people need to see the
wildflowers now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lack of rain definitely is a stress factor,'' said Dee
Howell, Houston's senior horticulture superintendent, who
supervises Memorial Park's wildflower plantings. ``It's an early
season, but it could be short.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the flowers just dehydrate and don't pollinate and make
seed,'' she said, ``it won't eliminate the plantings, but it will
really knock them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dry conditions also have prevailed elsewhere in the state.
</P>
<P>
   Roadsides in the Texas Hill Country are ``a little parched,''
said Patricia Alholm, spokeswoman for the Austin-based Lady Bird
Johnson Wildflower Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not too late for a little rain to help native plants
out,'' Alholm said. ``There are two scenarios in which we can pull
through. One is that we get a little rain. The other is that things
cool off and stay in that holding pattern until we get our spring
rains. Central Texas gets the majority of its rain in April and May
and a couple of months in the fall. In a couple of weeks, we should
know what the season will bring.''
</P>
<P>
   In good years, fields of bluebonnets _ known as ``buffalo
clover'' until pioneer women noted the blossoms' resemblance to
miniature sunbonnets _ cover thousands of acres in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Ninety-eight years ago this month, the Texas Legislature
designated one species of the plant, ``Lupinus subarnosus,'' as the
state flower. That designation was expanded to at least four other
bluebonnet species in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The highway department began sowing bluebonnet seeds along Texas
highways in the 1930s.

SECRETS OF A LEMON LOVER IN A SEASON OF PLENTY  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA KAFKA   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there is one idiosyncratic hallmark of my cooking,
it is the plentiful use of lemon juice and lemon zest. As a child,
I always loved unsweetened lemonade, and now, when asked what might
improve a dish, my response is frequently, ``Lemon!'' Both the
juice and the zest give a fresh edge to food, adding a welcome
acidity to some dishes, and a tart sweetness to others.
</P>
<P>
   The zest is not the entire rind or peel, but the thin outer
yellow layer, with none of the underlying white pith attached. Zest
is aptly named, as it has a complex flavor with a slight bitterness
provided by the oils in the rind. Those who do not like this
bitterness can reduce it a bit by blanching the zest for a minute
or so and then running it under cold water.
</P>
<P>
   While there are plenty of devices on the market that will take
off thin strips of the fruit, I don't use one. I find the
traditional four-holed zester inefficient, as it leaves much of the
zest behind. Most zesters also cut the fruit in slivers of uniform
size, and there are many times when I want broader strips to add to
a stew or to chop for other uses. Of course, you could also use a
grater, but once again you leave lots of lemon behind, this time on
the grater.
</P>
<P>
   I use a sharp vegetable peeler, which removes zest easily and
provides 10 to 12 strips, two inches long and a half inch wide, per
lemon. For thinner strips, halve the strips crosswise, stack two or
three and, using a sharp knife, cut them lengthwise; repeat with
remaining strips.
</P>
<P>
   It is always a good idea to give lemons a light scrub with a
vegetable brush under running water before peeling, as they may
have been coated with a preservative to protect them during
shipping.
</P>
<P>
   Though lemons are a year-round crop these days, ripe, juicy
lemons from Florida are coming into stores in New York right now,
so it is time for lemon lovers to pounce. A good lemon has no bumps
on its skin and feels heavy with juice. I freeze fresh juice in an
ice-cube tray, using two tablespoons for each cube. After the juice
is frozen, the cubes can be popped out and kept in a plastic sack
in the freezer. This is a particularly nice trick for Meyer lemons
and Key limes, as these fruits are in season for such a short time;
stock up when you can, then enjoy the juice for months afterwards.
</P>
<P>
   To use the frozen juice in uncooked dishes _ in salad dressings,
for instance _ simply let the cubes come to room temperature first.
I never heat them to defrost them, but it is perfectly all right to
pop a frozen cube into a dish that has almost finished cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Frequently, both lemon juice and zest are called for in the same
recipe, as they are in the two here. Take the zest off the whole
fruit, then slice and squeeze the juice out. The creamy lemon pasta
dish makes a light first course and can be tossed with some cooked
asparagus tips, peas or even shrimp. It would also be good as a
side dish with broiled fish or roast chicken. The zest infuses the
cream with lemon flavor, and the dish is so quick to assemble that
the cream never gets a chance to curdle.
</P>
<P>
   The lemon wafers are good on their own or as an accompaniment to
fresh fruit or sorbet. They look like old-fashioned vanilla wafers
but have a little surprise _ that little nip that we lemon lovers
can't do without.
</P>
<P>
   CREAMY LEMON PASTA
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes
</P>
<P>
   12 ounces wide egg noodles
</P>
<P>
   Zest and juice of 2 lemons; zest cut in very thin strips 1 inch
long

stir to separate. Cook for 8 minutes or until tender. Drain, then
return to the cooking pot.
</P>
<P>
   2. Just before noodles are done, in a small saucepan combine the
lemon zest, cream, salt and pepper. Cook over medium heat for 2
minutes, or until cream comes to a boil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Pour cream mixture over drained noodles, and add the lemon
juice. Stir to coat. Cook over medium heat, stirring, until all the
liquid is absorbed, about 1 to 2 minutes. Season with additional
pepper, if desired.

WINE TALK: UNDISCOVERED, AFFORDABLE BURGUNDIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you love Burgundy and you know the region well.
Gevrey-Chambertin, Morey-St.-Denis, Beaune, Volnay _ you're
familiar with them all. OK, ever heard of Marey-les-Fussey? Or
Magny-les-Villers, or Meloisey?
</P>
<P>
   Don't feel bad if you haven't; hardly anyone in this country
has. At least not yet. They are little villages in the region known
as the Hautes Cotes, an area the wine critic Robert Parker Jr. has
called the backwoods of Burgundy. If your idea of the backwoods is
rundown farms and rusted cars, forget it; the Hautes Cotes
(pronounced OAT coat) is rural and quiet but beautiful country. And
it produces some attractive Burgundy wines.
</P>
<P>
   Collectively, the great wine towns of Burgundy are known as the
Cote-d'Or, or the golden slopes. The northern half of the Cote-d'Or
is called the Cotes de Nuits and the southern half the Cotes de
Beaune. The Hautes Cotes region, which lies to the west of the
well-known vineyards, is divided in the same way, into the Hautes
Cotes de Beaune and the Hautes Cotes de Nuits.
</P>
<P>
   The name means, literally, the high slopes, and in fact most of
the approximately 2,500 acres of Hautes Cotes vineyards are at an
elevation of 1,000 to 1,500 feet, well above the height of the
famous vineyards of the Cote-d'Or.
</P>
<P>
   There have been vineyards in the Hautes Cotes at least since the
17th century, when they were said to cover some 11,000 acres. Most
were abandoned after a phylloxera blight ravaged them in the late
19th century. Not until after World War II did the demand for
Burgundy wine prompt growers to take another look at this
once-productive area in what amounted to their back yard.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1950s, the price of vineyard land in the Cote-d'Or
had encouraged some winemakers to return to these hidden valleys
and villages, many of them little more than a 15-minute drive from
the bustling towns of Nuits-St.-Georges and Beaune. By 1961, both
the Hautes Cotes de Beaune and the Hautes Cotes de Nuits were
awarded the coveted appellation controllee designation, which meant
that the French government considered them to be among the
country's better wines.
</P>
<P>
   I first visited the Hautes Cotes some years ago with Jean-Claude
Vrinat, the owner of the Taillevent restaurant in Paris and a
passionate wine enthusiast who spends his rare days off prowling
the vineyards of France seeking additions for his incomparable
cellar. We drove up from Beaune to Magny-les-Villers to visit the
cellars of Robert Jayer-Gilles, one of the best-known winemakers in
the Hautes Cotes.
</P>
<P>
   Jayer-Gilles is related to the many Jayers who make wine in
Burgundy, including Henri Jayer of Vosne-Romanee, one of Burgundy's
most respected producers. Like Henri, who is now retired,
Jayer-Gilles is best known for his Echezeaux from the Cote de Nuits
area. But knowledgeable wine lovers, like Vrinat, also treasure his
wines from the Hautes Cotes, both red and white, which have set
admirably high standards for other winemakers in the region.
</P>
<P>
   A common complaint about wines from the Hautes Cotes is that
they lack depth. Because the vineyards are at a higher altitude,
Hautes Cotes grapes do not always ripen as quickly as grapes in the
Cote-d'Or. Jayer-Gilles and winemakers like him compensate by
keeping vineyard yields low. Fewer grapes means more intensive
wines and, at their best, Jayer-Gilles wines show all the intensity
of wines from much more famous Burgundy vineyards.
</P>
<P>
   In almost the same class are the Hautes Cotes de Nuits Clos du
Vignon wines of the Domaine Thevenot le Brun in the village of
Marey-les-Fussey. The Thevenot wines include a delicious pinot
gris, a pleasant change from chardonnay. Thevenot is owned by the
Domaine Antonin Guyon in Savigny-les Beaune, and some of the Hautes
Cotes de Nuits wines appear in this country under the Guyon label.
</P>
<P>
   The Domaine Mongeard-Mugneret in Vosne-Romanee is another
estimable Burgundy maker that turns out limited quantities of a
good Hautes Cotes de Nuits. Michel Gros of the Domaine Jean Gros,
also in Vosne Romanee, is another mainstream Burgundy producer who
turns out good, concentrated wines from the Hautes Cotes de Nuits.
</P>
<P>
   Look, too, for the Hautes Cotes de Beaune from Francois and
Denis Clair, and a somewhat lighter style wine from the same
appellation made by the Domaine Arnoux Pere &AMP; Fils in
Chorey-les-Beaune. One of the best-known estates is Denis Carre at
Meloisey, in the Hautes Cotes de Nuits. Denis Carre also owns
vineyards in Pommard, Auxey-Duresses and Meursault in the Cote de
Beaune.
</P>
<P>
   For travelers less inclined to venture off the main roads, the
growers of the Hautes Cotes maintain a cooperative called Les Caves
des Hautes Cotes on the highway between Beaune and Pommard, to the
south. The coop makes and sells about 25 percent of all the wine
from the two Hautes Cotes appellations.
</P>
<P>
   The best wines of the Hautes Cotes are the reds, made from the
pinot noir grape. The whites, mostly chardonnay, tend to be lean
and are not usually as good buys as some of the less expensive
white Burgundies from the Cote-d'Or.
</P>
<P>
   Wines from the Hautes Cotes are still scarce in this country,
partly because importers are unfamiliar with them and partly
because they are only at their best in years when an abundance of
sun and heat give them that extra bit of intensity they need.
</P>
<P>
   But when they are good _ and both the 1996s and 1997s are good
vintages _ they are bargains: Most are in the $15 to $20 range.
</P>
<P>
   Jayer-Gilles Hautes-Cotes wines cost more, usually in the $25 to
$30 range, at least in part because they are always made in
expensive new oak barrels. The Hautes Cotes may be the back woods,
but at Jayer-Gilles, they are the back woods of Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some wines from the Hautes Cotes region of Burgundy
that are worth seeking out.

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It can seem like a nasty customer, tightly
closed and unyielding, more than forbidding enough to frighten off
a cook or two. But those who know the artichoke know just how to
slip past its defenses. That's especially true in San Francisco,
where artichokes are as familiar in restaurant kitchens as
potatoes.
</P>
<P>
   The trick, the city's chefs say, is to keep it simple and don't
wear yourself out. A great artichoke doesn't need much work.
</P>
<P>
   At the Black Cat, a restaurant in North Beach, Reed Hearon
slices small artichokes into quarters and fries them in oil with
sliced fennel. The artichokes become crispy on the outside and stay
succulent on the inside; the fennel melts in your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   He also roasts artichokes like potatoes, trimming and quartering
medium ones, tossing them with olive oil, garlic and rosemary, and
roasting them at 500 degrees. The outer leaves curl and brown,
caramelizing the sugars, and the hearts soften.
</P>
<P>
   Artichokes can even be left raw. At Zuni Cafe, Judy Rodgers
thinly slices trimmed small artichokes _ leaves, heart and all _
and dresses them with lemon juice, olive oil, pine nuts and
Parmesan cheese. The hearts stay crunchy and sweet and the leaves
are like buttery soft petals on the tongue.
</P>
<P>
   A taste of just one of these dishes and you soon realize there
is no reason to be cutting artichoke hearts into cubes or pureeing
them into some fussy creation. An artichoke is a precious vegetable
with a preciously short season. It's best to make it easy on
yourself and leave it in its purest form.
</P>
<P>
   But before you begin cooking artichokes, it is important to buy
good ones. You want one that feels heavy for its size. Lift a few
in the pile and compare them. The artichoke should be firm and the
leaves tightly bound. If some of the leaves are streaked with black
lines, this isn't a sign of rotting, but of frost damage. It is a
cosmetic flaw and nothing more.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get home and are faced with this hard, green bulb it is
difficult to know where to begin and even more difficult to part
with all that needs to be trimmed. ``You have to think of an
artichoke as a big spiny plant,'' said Traci des Jardins, the chef
at Jardiniere, ``and the leaves are part of that spiny plant.''
</P>
<P>
   Just as you trim the greens from the top of a carrot or the
outer leaves of a head of lettuce, so, too, the outer one or two
layers of leaves of an artichoke must go. This is especially
important when braising or cooking the artichoke whole, so that
none of the tough parts are left on it.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, with a large or medium artichoke, it's simply a
matter of cutting off the top, down to the point where the leaves
are tender _ where they are light green to butter yellow _ and
trimming the base and stem. Then, you can either use a spoon to
scoop out the fuzzy choke or cut the artichoke in half and cut out
the choke with a paring knife.
</P>
<P>
   With small artichokes, the choke is not usually developed enough
to remove. (As you trim artichokes, add them to a bowl of water
acidulated with lemon juice so they don't discolor.)
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try an artichoke in its purest form _ and the
form easiest to prepare _ boil it. Bring a large pot of salted
water to a boil. While it's heating, pull off any tough outer
leaves. Cut off the top, trim and peel the stem and rub cut parts
with lemon.
</P>
<P>
   Add the artichokes to the boiling water and simmer until tender,
about 30 to 35 minutes, depending on their size. An artichoke is
tender when a knife inserted near the heart of the choke offers no
resistance, or a leaf can be pulled out easily.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the water and let cool, petals downward, on a baking
rack, so the water drains out. You may want to squeeze them out a
little before serving. This is the best way to eat the first of the
season. Each person gets a whole artichoke. And he can attack it
any way he pleases _ pulling leaves off one by one and sucking off
the nugget of meat at the base, or forgoing the leaves altogether
and digging into the heart. The stem is edible, too.
</P>
<P>
   Dipping sauces are an item of debate. Real enthusiasts do not
approve of any. Others consider the artichoke merely a vehicle for
the sauce. A simple homemade mayonnaise or vinaigrette is a
reasonable and tasty compromise.

PASTA FROM THE PANTRY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can never have too many pasta recipes, and finding a good
new one is an event. This is especially true of fast pasta recipes,
the kind in which the sauce is so easy that you have to start
boiling the water before getting out the garlic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, there is a subset of pasta recipes that go beyond fast,
prepared with just a few ingredients that are almost always in the
house. These are the pasta dishes of the desperate cook, the one
who has been too busy to shop or too busy to think, or who must put
dinner on the table in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I made a cooking date with Arthur Schwartz, the host
of ``Food Talk,'' a daily radio program on WOR-AM in New York. His
latest book, ``Naples at Table: Cooking in Campania''
(HarperCollins, 1998), focuses on a part of Italy where the people
are generally poor but where simple but great pasta dishes appear
on the table every day, seemingly done with smoke and mirrors.
</P>
<P>
   In about an hour, he made three pasta dishes while I did nothing
but type, eat and peel garlic. His choices were spaghetti with
fried eggs, a quicker version of carbonara; linguine with canned
tomato ``fillets,'' and linguine with walnuts and anchovies.
</P>
<P>
   All of these recipes have one thing in common: garlic cooked
lightly in good olive oil. As Schwartz noted, ``Neapolitans use
garlic delicately; they want the flavor in the oil, but frequently
cook it lightly and remove it.'' The garlic is not browned but
``blonded'' (``imbiondito'' in Italian), lightly cooked to release
its gentle nature.
</P>
<P>
   In the first dish, sometimes known as ``poor man's spaghetti,''
you fry a couple of eggs in the olive oil after removing the
garlic; tossed with the pasta, the eggs and oil create a creamy,
delicious sauce.
</P>
<P>
   The mahogany-colored walnut and anchovy sauce is astonishingly
complex considering how few elements go into it.
</P>
<P>
   In the tomato sauce, the three main ingredients are combined in
a cold pan, brought to a boil and cooked about five minutes. Even
when made with pantry tomatoes, it retains an astonishingly fresh
flavor. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SPAGHETTI WITH FRIED EGGS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   { pound thin spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or lard
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, lightly smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   4 eggs
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese, optional. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Start the sauce in
the next step, and start cooking the pasta when the water boils.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine garlic and 4 tablespoons of the oil in a small
skillet over medium-low heat. Cook the garlic, pressing it into the
oil occasionally to release its flavor; it should barely color on
both sides. Remove the garlic, and add the remaining oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Fry the eggs gently in the oil, until the whites are just
about set and the yolks still quite runny. Drain the pasta, and
toss with the eggs and oil, breaking up the whites as you do. (They
will finish cooking in the heat of the pasta.) Season to taste, and
serve immediately, with cheese if you like.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 or 3 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LINGUINE WITH TOMATO `FILLETS' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 28-ounce can plum tomatoes, or about 2 pounds peeled fresh
tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 pound linguine or spaghetti
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes to taste
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced basil or parsley. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Cut tomatoes into strips, discarding seeds and juice; place
in a strainer to drain while you bring a pot of salted water to the
boil for the pasta. Start the sauce in the next step, and start
cooking pasta when water boils.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine tomatoes, oil, garlic, salt and pepper in a 10-inch
skillet, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Cook briskly
for about 5 minutes (8 minutes for fresh tomatoes), stirring
occasionally. The tomatoes should remain in pieces, and there
should be no liquid remaining in the pan other than the oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Toss the pasta with the sauce and the basil or parsley, and
serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   LINGUINE WITH WALNUTS AND ANCHOVIES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 20 minutes &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   { pound linguine
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 large cloves garlic, lightly smashed and peeled
</P>
<P>
   { cup shelled walnuts, coarsely chopped (pieces of about \ inch
or a little less)
</P>
<P>
   Red pepper flakes to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 whole salted anchovies, rinsed and filleted, or 8 oil-packed
anchovy fillets, rinsed. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Bring a pot of salted water to the boil. Start the sauce in
the next step, and start cooking the linguine when the water boils.
</P>
<P>
   2. Combine the garlic and oil in a deep 10-inch skillet over
medium-low heat. Cook the garlic, pressing it into the oil
occasionally to release its flavor. When it is just beginning to
color on one side, add the nuts and the pepper flakes. Remove the
garlic when it colors on the other side; cook the sauce another
minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   3. Add the anchovies, and increase the heat to medium, mashing
them into the oil as they cook. As soon as they dissolve, almost
immediately, add { cup of the pasta's cooking water to the pan.
Remove the sauce from the heat until the pasta is cooked.
</P>
<P>
   4. When the pasta is still a little undercooked _ about 2
minutes less time than usual _ drain it, then turn it into the pan
with the sauce. Cook the linguine in the sauce, stirring and
tossing constantly, until all the liquid has been absorbed and the
linguine are tender. Serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 or 3 servings.

   NEW YORK _ Lately, some New York restaurants have been offering
a fish of unparalleled richness that, miraculously, is hardly
fattening at all. It's called escolar, and it would be a dream come
true except for one problem:
</P>
<P>
   For a significant number of people, the flesh of this fish acts
like a laxative.
</P>
<P>
   So restaurateurs have found themselves in a predicament _ go
with it anyway, even if a few customers suffer, or give up on a
food that other customers crave.
</P>
<P>
   ``People call from out of town to see if we have it,'' said
Jeremy Marshall, the chef and owner of Aquagrill, who likens
escolar to foie gras. The fish is often on the Aquagrill menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has a great balance of flavor, and it's very delicate,''
said Henry Meer, who serves it at the Cub Room in Manhattan. ``And
I love the whiteness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the same fish that has been banned in Japan since 1977
because the Japanese government believes it is toxic. In this
country, enough people complained about escolar's purgative effect
for the Food and Drug Administration to issue an import bulletin in
the early 1990s that recommended not selling the fish, which is
found in the Gulf of Mexico, the South Pacific and tropical waters
around the world. Early last year, the alert was canceled because
the agency, unlike the Japanese government, decided escolar was not
toxic.
</P>
<P>
   The fish had virtually disappeared from markets and menus, but
now it's back. And so are the complaints.
</P>
<P>
   Escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) and its West Coast cousin,
walu (Ruvettus pretiosus), have been available across the country
since the 1980s. The two fish, members of the snake mackerel
family, are sometimes called white tuna. They are a by-catch of
long-line fishing for tuna, which means their availability is
erratic. They were once considered practically worthless. Now they
retail for about $10 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   What gives these fish their desirable taste is actually a
component similar to those used to produce Olestra, the fake fat
found in some snack foods: a fatty substance called wax esters.
Humans cannot digest these wax esters because they lack the enzymes
necessary to break the large molecules into smaller, absorbable
components.
</P>
<P>
   Harold McGee, the author of ``On Food and Cooking'' (Scribner,
1984), described the process elegantly in a paper he delivered at
the 1997 Oxford Symposium on Food and Cookery: ``The wax esters
therefore pass intact, their lubricating properties undiminished,
from the small intestine into the colon, where a sufficient
quantity will defeat our normal control over the ultimate
disposition of food residues.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Gurrera, owner of the Citarella markets on the Upper East
and Upper West Sides of Manhattan, said he had heard no complaints.
``The fish flies out of here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs who are serving escolar seem aware of the potential
problem, in some cases thanks to information from their suppliers.
``It has been a controversial fish,'' said John McGuire, president
of Gotham Seafood in Manhattan. ``The first time someone got
diarrhea, we stopped selling the fish. We talked to the FDA and
found out it was nontoxic, not dangerous, and there was not much
pain with the diarrhea, but we said we'd rather not sell it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gotham Seafood still does, on request. But McGuire said last
week that he might give it up completely: ``There have been enough
cases of diarrhea so I don't think we'll be selling it.''
</P>
<P>
   That will not make one of his customers, Meer, very happy.
Although he serves escolar at the Cub Room, it is not on the menu
at his newer restaurant, City Hall. ``It's extremely, extremely
popular, but we've had a couple of calls from people who ate at
City Hall and reacted to it,'' Meer said. ``They had hot flashes
and sweated for about an hour. That's one of the reasons we took it
off the menu.''
</P>
<P>
   Meer, who has no problem consuming six or eight ounces of
escolar, said he was very disappointed that he had to take it off
the City Hall menu.
</P>
<P>
   Don Pintabona, the chef of TriBeCa Grill, had a fling with
escolar early on but also gave it up with great regret. ``It was
hugely popular when we first opened in 1991,'' he said. ``We'd
serve 60, 70, 80 portions a night, but I had one or two people who
felt queasy and had headaches.'' Then, after Pintabona saw an
article warning about adverse effects, it was good-bye escolar at
TriBeCa Grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the great fish out there, it seems silly to go with
fish that may cause problems,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wonderfully succulent,'' Charlie Trotter, the Chicago chef,
raved in the cookbook ``Charlie Trotter's Seafood'' (10 Speed
Press, 1997). ``A spoon is all you really need.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, there have not been any complaints at Aquagrill. ``It's
so rich and decadent,'' Marshall said. ``We tell the customers that
it is extremely high in natural oil and that it melts in your
mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   But will patrons construe such a description as a warning?
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the Hawaii Health Department warned people not to eat
large quantities of it _ anything more than a six- or eight-ounce
serving. (Trotter's recipe calls for three-ounce portions.)
</P>
<P>
   But John Rowley, a seafood marketing specialist in Seattle,
said: ``You can't predict who will be affected. I counseled
restaurateurs I worked with not to serve it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there are those for whom discreet servings of
these fish may be a blessing _ those who do not have enough fiber
in their diets.
</P>
<P>
   McGee said that the fish are used in folk medicine in the Canary
Islands. The earliest written reference to them was in 1841, when
escolar's purgative powers were already recognized.
</P>
<P>
   McGee also noted that the fish is mentioned by Charles B.
Nordhoff, the co-author of ``Mutiny on the Bounty,'' who fished for
it and was moved to write: ``The celebrated effects of eating
Ruvettus are somewhat exaggerated, but the fish is so good that one
is likely to eat too much of it, when of course the purgative
effects are bound to be felt.''
</P>
<P>
   As if the purgative effects of escolar were not enough to make
people wary, mishandling presents another, far more serious
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Snake mackerel belong to a family of fish that can cause
scombroid poisoning, the result of delayed refrigeration, which
increases the histamine levels in the fish through bacterial
decomposition.
</P>
<P>
   The family includes tuna and mackerel, and scombroid poisoning,
which causes diarrhea, vomiting and edema, cannot be cooked away.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, there were cases of scombroid poisoning from escolar
sold at Balthazar, said Michael LaHara, the downtown restaurant's
general manager. One person went to the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Escolar is no longer on the menu.

ANTIDOTE TO OVERSALTING 
RUBBERY SHIITAKES
</HEADLINE>
   (mk) 
 By MELISSA CLARK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Is there an antidote to oversalting a dish?
</P>
<P>
   A. There are several, depending upon what sort of dish it is. In
most cases, stirring in some lemon juice or vinegar will help. If
the dish then tastes too tart, add a pinch or two of sugar as well.
</P>
<P>
   For soups, stews and ragouts, try adding chunks of peeled
potato, and then simmer the mixture until they are nearly tender,
about 15 minutes. The potatoes will absorb some of the excess salt
(remove them before serving the dish). A cup of rice or pasta, tied
up in cheesecloth, will also do the trick. Or, just add unsalted
chicken broth or vegetable broth or another unsalted liquid to
dilute the salty flavor, though this will give you a thinner
mixture.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't feel like dealing with the salty dish now, freeze
it for a few weeks. Once thawed and reheated, the salt flavor won't
be as pronounced because freezing dulls all flavors, especially
salty and spicy tastes.
</P>
<P>
   Rubbery Shiitakes
</P>
<P>
   Q. I have been using dried shiitake mushrooms to make a
wonderful soup from a Verbena restaurant recipe. Although I soak
the mushrooms for half an hour in hot water, they are rubbery and
tough when julienned. What am I doing wrong?
</P>
<P>
   A. You may not be doing anything wrong; it could be the
mushrooms themselves. For the wild mushroom broth, Diane Forley,
the chef at Verbena, recommends fresh shiitake mushrooms if
possible for the most delicate flavor and best texture. Dried
shiitakes can be substituted, but they are always going to be a bit
more rubbery.
</P>
<P>
   When substituting dried mushrooms for fresh, use the best you
can find. Look for whole, firm mushrooms with no crumbling edges or
a deeply musty scent (they should smell fresh). Buy the mushrooms
from a reputable, busy store with a high turnover, since even dried
mushrooms can get too old. Take care to soak them for only the
prescribed time, and then don't overcook them once they are added
to the broth (this can intensify their chewy texture).

GOVERNMENT'S DIETARY GUIDELINES COME UNDER FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Charging that federal dietary guidelines are biased
against minority groups, many of whose members are lactose
intolerant, a health organization called on the government Tuesday
to make its recommended daily intake of dairy products optional.
</P>
<P>
   The Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, a nonprofit
group based here, said the government, which is now updating its
dietary recommendations, should take into account the food needs of
minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dairy products should be considered optional and in no way
superior to other calcium sources such as green leafy vegetables,
beans and other legumes or fortified fruit juices,'' Dr. Neal
Barnard, a physician and the group's president, said at a news
conference. ``For many Americans, these are better choices than
cow's milk,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government currently recommends that Americans
consume two to three servings of dairy foods such as yogurt, cheese
and milk, which provide calcium for bone growth, each day. The
guidelines serve as the foundation for most school lunch programs
and virtually all other nutrition programs across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But many people from minority groups cannot digest dairy
products, a condition known as lactose intolerance, which can
result in painful abdominal cramps, bloating and diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   Lactose intolerance occurs when a person's body no longer
produces enough of an enzyme known as lactase, which aids the
digestion of lactose, a milk sugar found in dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   According to the physicians group, as many as 70 percent of
African Americans, 70 percent of American Indians, 50 percent of
Hispanics and 95 percent of Asian Americans are lactose intolerant.
</P>
<P>
   This compares with about 15 percent of whites who suffer from
the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Milton Mills, a physician and associate director of the
organization, charged that food guidelines advocating consumption
of dairy products reflect ``a profound racial bias.''
</P>
<P>
   But the top nutritionist at another medical advocacy
organization said the physicians group was taking ``an extremist
stance on milk and dairy products.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ruth Kava, director of nutrition for the New York-based
American Council on Science and Health, said that lactose-reduced
milk products are widely available and provide as much calcium as
regular dairy products.
</P>
<P>
   Kava said that a dairy-rich diet can reduce high blood pressure
and prevent osteoporosis _ the loss of bone density _ later in
life. She said in a statement that ``to warn such people away from
valuable sources of calcium is to offer advice that is potentially
detrimental to their health.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Diary Council said that the physicians group
overstates the problem. While the council acknowledged that
minorities are more prone to lactose intolerance, it said that
gradually increasing one's intake of dairy products over time often
can eliminate the condition.
</P>
<P>
   Government revisions of the dietary guidelines are completed
every five years. An advisory committee consisting of officials
from the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services
is scheduled to publish the new guidelines next January.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a snow storm in Washington, spokemen for the
Agriculture Department and HHS could not be reached for comment.

 &HT;    ANGRY SENATORS THREATEN CRACKDOWN ON SWEEPSTAKES
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Angry senators warned operators of America's
best-known sweepstakes Tuesday that their industry may already be a
loser in a contest to avoid a congressional crackdown.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Publishers Clearing House, Reader's Digest,
American Family Enterprises, and Time Inc. defended practices such
as telling millions of potential sweepstakes players that ``it's
down to a 2 person race for $11 million,'' and they were one of the
lucky pair.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our promotions are clear and that no
reasonable person could be misled by them,'' said Deborah Holland,
senior vice president of Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Governmental Affairs Committee's permanent
subcommittee on investigations were plainly peeved.
</P>
<P>
   Chairwoman Susan Collins, R-Maine, told the witnesses that she
was ``absolutely stunned'' by testimony that people who received
contest mailings would not be misled.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., called one letter with a personal tone
that Publishers Clearinghouse mailed to 9 million people ``a lie''
that was ``purposefully misleading, purposefully deceptive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to have to correct this with or without support of
companies here with us today,'' he vowed.
</P>
<P>
   Levin proposed legislation that would require _ in type as big
as any on the page _ that making a purchase does not improve the
chances of winning. The same prominent disclaimer should also
disclose if a letter is computer-generated and the odds of winning
the contest, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said she is ``gaining co-sponsors every day'' for
legislation that would regulate the mailings and impose stiff fines
for violations.
</P>
<P>
   The sweepstakes officials testified that most recipients of
their mass mailings understand that they don't have to subscribe to
a magazine or buy a sponsored product in order to enter the contest
and that their odds of winning are not enhanced by making a
purchase.
</P>
<P>
   The officials denied targeting elderly people, and said the
contests have internal programs to find the few customers who don't
understand the rules and might be making excessive purchases in
their efforts to win.
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes are used ``to attract attention to mailings amidst
an extremely cluttered mailbox'' and to ``raise interest in the
product being promoted,'' explained Naomi Bernstein, vice president
of marketing services for American Family Enterprises, a consortium
of magazine publishers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point of our mailings is not to convince people they've
won a sweepstakes, but rather to be excited about the possibility
of winning and to consider our products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing horror stories on Monday(cq) about confused
elderly consumers spending thousands of dollars on unneeded
products in vain attempts to win the sweepstakes, senators
countered that the contests were clearly deceptive.
</P>
<P>
   They displayed a ``Dear Eustace Hall'' letter from Publishers
Clearing House in which Contest Manager Dorothy Addeo wrote that
her boss came into her office to say, ``It's not right when someone
as nice as Eustace Hall doesn't win.'' Addeo promised a prize if
Hall would just ``return the Guaranteed Winner Document.''
</P>
<P>
   Testifying on Monday, Hall broke down in tears and said he
thought the message was a personal one. On Tuesday, Holland said
Publishers Clearing House had sent the same letter to 9 million
people _ each the subject of a conversation between ``Dorothy'' and
her boss.
</P>
<P>
   Calling the purposed conversation ``a dramatization,'' Holland
said ``of course'' no company officials had actually talked about
Eustace Hall or any other individual contestant. However, she
denied that the letter was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Subcommittee members expressed outrage over the letter and other
sweepstakes promotions. They decried bulletins with headlines that
scream ``You're a winner'' and tiny type that says ``if you have
the winning number.'' They blasted complex rules that make it easy
to enter if the contestant subscribes to a magazine, but
discouragingly hard if no purchase if made.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should not need a law degree or a magnifying glass to
read the rules or to decipher how to enter without placing an
order,'' said Collins.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., said he was disappointed at hearing
the sweepstakes officials defend their practices. The hearing left
him even more convinced that legislation should be passed to end
the abuses, he said.

EX-GANG MEMBER TAKES AN INSIDERS LOOK AT YOUTH CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JULIE CHAO  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In his forthcoming book, ``Chinese Playground: A
Memoir,'' Bill Lee provides the first insider look into the lethal
mix of youthful bravado, cultural maladjustment and turf warfare
that culminated in the 1977 shootout at the Golden Dragon
restaurant, one of the worst massacres in San Francisco history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to write this for the kids so they can see how
they're being recruited and exploited,'' Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   Not much has changed in the Chinese underworld since the 1970s,
Lee said. Only the faces are new, as more and more Asian young
people are lured into the gang life.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Dan Foley, lead investigator of the San Francisco Police
Department's Asian gang unit, said the gangs are continually trying
to sign up new members.
</P>
<P>
   ``Recruiting is going on all the time,'' he said. ``Right now,
the gangs are reorganizing. They're at various high schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee likens the dai lo, or ``big brothers'' who recruit
teen-agers, to cult leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``They hit the weak points, give them empowerment and a sense of
identity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   They try to entice teen-agers, Lee said, with offers such as:
``Here, here's a pager. Here's a cellular phone. Here's some money.
You don't need your parents.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee, 44, is intimately familiar with the intrigue of gangs. From
peddling fireworks at age 7 to hustling in pool halls around the
city, he grew up around children involved in some kind of crime.
While their mothers labored at factory jobs and their fathers
lingered at gambling parlors, the youngsters roamed the streets
unchecked.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lee tried to resist the violence, he couldn't resist
the camaraderie of gang life.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was a student majoring in psychology at San Francisco State
University when he joined the Chung Ching Yee, also known as the
Joe Boys. They offered him what his family didn't _ acceptance and
protection _ and he considered them blood brothers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a part of me that was very self-destructive,'' he
said. ``Once I stepped over, everything else I was feeling, the
pain ... suddenly you feel strong and powerful. It's a facade, but
you're in a new family, everyone feels important.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee describes his father as an alcoholic who was physically and
emotionally abusive to his five children. Yet he was also one of
the most respected men in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He actually took me into the underworld,'' Lee said. ``Sitting
there in the coffee shop (when I was a kid) with him and all his
associates, the elders of the tongs, talking about business and
what have you. I was kind of bored, but I'm sure a lot of that also
sunk in, as far as how to resolve things.''
</P>
<P>
   The hub of gang activity was the playground of the book's title.
It was where Lee stashed his fireworks supply and where he learned
the code of the streets.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, it was where a group of immigrant kids _ teased and
harassed by the U.S.-born Chinese kids _ formed the Wah Ching,
which would eventually become the most powerful gang in Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Located in the heart of Chinatown, the Chinese playground still
exists. To this day, control of the playground represents
dominance, Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   A long-standing feud between the Joe Boys and the Wah Ching
culminated in a Fourth of July shootout in Chinatown in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   What pushed the Joe Boys over the edge was not that some of
their brothers were killed but that their grave sites were being
vandalized, breaking an unwritten code of respecting the dead.
</P>
<P>
   That act of disrespect, Lee writes, led to the shooting at the
Golden Dragon restaurant, in which five people, including two
tourists, were killed and 11 others wounded. It was a wake-up call
to the city's leaders and led to the formation of the police gang
task force.
</P>
<P>
   Although the shooting was committed by three of his blood
brothers, Lee said, he had no advance knowledge of it. Still, the
police had a file on him, and he was the first person called in for
questioning. Later, he was almost killed because gang members
mistakenly thought he was a police informant.
</P>
<P>
   The Joe Boys disbanded, and Lee eventually went into a career in
recruiting for technology companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took my dark side and carried it into Silicon Valley,'' he
said. ``It was a new type of gang, the high-tech gang, just as
brutal. It was take-no-prisoners and win-at-any- cost.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 brutal years in the corporate trenches, Lee gave up all
competitive activities _ recruiting as well as sports _ because
they brought out his dark side. He is now living off savings and
focusing on promoting his book, which he hopes will benefit not
only teens, but also teachers, parents and the police.

LAWMAKERS LOOKING TO CRACK DOWN ON INTERNET ALCOHOL SALES
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JENNIFER CORBETT DOOREN  
 c.1999 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Lawmakers introduced legislation Tuesday to make it
more difficult for minors to use the Internet to purchase alcoholic
beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, which would confer more power on state law
enforcement officials to crack down on such activity, also would
empower state officials to stop alcohol sales over the Internet,
mail-order catalog or phone in the 20 states where direct delivery
of alcoholic beverages is illegal.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Klein, assistant attorney general of Utah _ one of the 20
states _ said state officials recently intercepted 244 cases of
beer from a distributor called Beer Across America which sells beer
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   There is no evidence that large numbers of minors actually use
the Internet to purchase alcohol, but several local television
stations have recently broadcast stories showing how easily it can
be done.
</P>
<P>
   One such story, which was displayed on monitors Tuesday during a
Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Internet alcohol sales,
showed how a 13-year-old ordered a case of beer using a home
computer from a micro-brewery with her older brother's credit card.
</P>
<P>
   The teenager simply clicked on the icon that stated that she was
at least 21 years-old. Three weeks later the beer arrived at her
parents' door step, according to the TV station, KUTV, of Salt Lake
City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a 13-year-old is capable of ordering beer and having it
delivered by borrowing a credit card and making a few clicks with
her mouse, there is something very wrong with the level of control
that is being exercised over these sales,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch,
R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would allow states to use federal courts to go after
direct alcohol distributors. State officials have complained that
it is difficult to prosecute direct alcohol distributors if they
are located in another state.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation, however, has raised the ire of the California
wine industry, which says it could inadvertently hurt its efforts
to sell wine over the Internet that is not readily available in
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. George Radanovich, R-Calif., who also operates a small
California winery, said the Hatch legislation ``would have the
unintended consequence of crippling small wineries in this
country.''
</P>
<P>
   John DeLuca, president of the Wine Institute, an organization
that represents more than 450 California winemakers, said the
legislation would harm industry's efforts to lobby individual
states to change their laws to allow wineries to ship their
products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry argues that liquor stores carry a limited
selection of wine and that small wine-makers suffer as a result.
The Internet and mail-order catalogues give consumers access to
virtually any wine or beer that is made.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is pushing legislation in some states that would
allow a limited amount of alcohol, such as a case of wine or beer
per month, to be shipped to individuals. Nineteen states currently
have laws that allow limited alcohol shipments.
</P>
<P>
   On the problem of teenager buyers on the Internet, DeLuca
acknowledged that underage drinking is a ``serious problem,'' but
said ``minors are not purchasing any significant amount of wine or
alcohol by the relatively expensive and slow path of direct
shipments, which leaves a clear trail of delivery records and
credit card information.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., a member of the committee,
urged a cautious approach to regulating Internet purchases of
alcohol, saying the Hatch bill was ``over-kill.''
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Feinstein said she had ``seen precious
few examples of youths on their own initiative'' deciding to obtain
alcohol via the Internet, ``waiting days or weeks for shipment and
managing to be home without their parents at just the crucial time
when it arrives.''
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all the examples of under-age-purchases on the
Internet ``involve youths who were prompted to do so, usually by a
local news organization,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Radonovich noted that there are already remedies available for
violations of liquor laws including revoking the federal permits
that are required to operate a winery or brewery.
</P>
<P>
   The wine industry is more supportive of efforts like one by Rep.
Juanita Millender-McDonald, D-Calif., who wants to require
distributors to clearly label a package as containing alcohol.
Shippers such as United Parcel Service would then be required to
obtain a signature of a person who is age 21 or older to leave a
package at a home or office.
</P>
<P>
   Feinstein said she supports a similar approach.

   NEW YORK _ Nothing in the first few scenes of ``Everybody's
Ruby'' prepares you for the moment when the actress Viola Davis
takes the play and makes it hers. It happens quite stealthily, in
the midst of the kind of speech that you are ready to believe you
have heard a hundred times before in a hundred other dramas
examining the facets of a hundred other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But then Ms. Davis, her face a pitiable blank, her eyes emptied
of illusion, sets about setting you straight. Portraying Ruby
McCollum, a black woman accused of shooting her white lover to
death in a redneck Florida backwater in the early 1950s, Ms. Davis
has the assignment of persuading the audience of the reasonable
irrationality of her attraction to a man who stirs and brutalizes
her, who arouses her with the mere sensation of his ``breath on my
eyelids.'' Yet this affinity is for a man also capable of walking
away from a violent encounter in her house ``smiling as if I'd won
a contest and rape was the prize.''
</P>
<P>
   The actress, nominated for a Tony three years ago for her saucy
portrayal of the object of the leading man's affections in August
Wilson's ``Seven Guitars,'' cuts to the quick with the raw assault
of her riveting account. Her hollow gaze is a window on an awful
surety that it is her lot in life to lose. At every turn of
``Everybody's Ruby,'' which opened Tuesday night at the Joseph Papp
Public Theater, Ms. Davis' impact is indelible; she practically
tattoos the production with her intensity. This ability to
transform the mundane, the expected, into something novel is an
artist's work. Her performance is so proximate, so real, you would
swear you could feel the actress' breath on your own eyelids.
</P>
<P>
   Shots ring out and lightning flashes in the course of
``Everybody's Ruby,'' but no effect in the production is as jolting
as Ms. Davis, whose contribution alone is enough to make Thulani
Davis' play worthwhile. (The actress is no relation to the
playwright.) Though it is far from a perfect work _ it unravels in
the second act without ever making a true tapestry of the complex
network of narrative threads laid out early on _ the writer has
composed an engrossing piece of theater with a manifest compassion
for downtrodden black women of underappreciated courage and
intelligence, women sentenced to discontent and rage by the low
expectations of an unenlightened age.
</P>
<P>
   The play is rangy and ambitious _ 14 actors, many of them
doubling in roles _in its effort to give flesh to the actual 1952
case of Ruby McCollum, convicted of the murder of Dr. C. Leroy
Adams, a white doctor and popular local politician in Live Oak,
Fla. The playwright deftly outlines the dark secrets and shady
alliances rampant in a small racially mixed Southern town in the
years before the civil rights movement took hold. But Thulani
Davis' real agenda here is taking stock of the presence of Zora
Neale Hurston, the celebrated and troubled author who, down on her
luck, took a freelance job with a black Pittsburgh newspaper and
traveled to Live Oak to cover the McCollum trial.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Davis discovers in these real events, in the crossed rutted
paths of McCollum and Hurston, an unusual kinship. Hurston, as
warmly rendered by Phylicia Rashad, understands instinctively,
perhaps because of the vicissitudes of her own personal and
professional life, that the slaying is a crime of infinitely more
subtlety than the town lets on. In making Hurston a missionary for
the truth, the playwright exposes a parallel complexity in the
community's social patterns, its unspoken rules and undercurrents
of nastiness; its respect for power, regardless of skin color, and
its surprising tolerance of the outrageous acts of its leading
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   So many acts and themes are grappled with, though, from the
gambling subculture overseen by Ruby's husband, Sam (Bill Nunn), to
the tempestuous relationship between Zora and the white reporter
(Tuck Milligan) she recruits to help her with the story, to the
elusive appetites of the doctor (Beau Gravitte), that plot nuances
are obscured by the reams of information. (As the story becomes
more and more preoccupied with Zora, it becomes less and less
interesting.) The director, Kenny Leon, artistic director of the
Alliance Theater in Atlanta, clarifies things to some degree with a
spare and handsome production and a cast filled with such expert
and thoroughly credible supporting players as Crystal Fox, Bernie
McInerney, Raynor Scheine, Chuck Patterson and Ron Cephas Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Sturge's mood-enhancing lighting design and Dwight Andrews'
evocative original music create an emphatic tone without ever
drawing too much attention to themselves. Marjorie Bradley
Kellogg's set, however, reflects some of the confusing drift in the
text: When a character describes a bullet hole in the floor of a
doctor's office in which she is standing but sticks her hand into
brown Florida soil, something is a bit off.
</P>
<P>
   But the lapses seem insignificant whenever Ms. Davis is onstage.
There is a lovely sequence at the end of the play when Ruby allows
Zora, posing as a hairdresser, into her cell. The jailer may be
fooled but Ruby isn't, and as she allows Zora to brush out her hair
and apply some lipstick, Ruby reveals the depth of her sorrow,
forged by destiny and compounded by desire. ``He had ruined my
life, and I wanted him anyway,'' Ms. Davis says, at her most
tragic, and most beautiful.

FLORIDA'S SENIOR WORKFORCE LURES NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARGARET ANN MIILLE   
 Herald-Tribune (Sarasota, Fla.)   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   VENICE, Fla. _ The expansive Nielsen Media Research operation
here is busy closing the books on one of four major TV viewer
sampling periods, which ended last week.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite office for the New York-based corporate giant
collects and edits 375,000 weekly diaries kept by TV watchers in
210 local markets nationwide. In 44 of the largest ones, meters are
also installed in viewers' television sets.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the deadline looms, the mood hardly seems harried within
the 42,000-square-foot building. It resembles a hushed library,
with row upon row of editors entering the data into computers.
</P>
<P>
   The work is systematic and demands precision, conducted by two
shifts of mostly senior citizens who will input 8.32 million
entries this sweeps period alone, detailing who watched which
program in 15-minute increments during four weeks beginning Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Venice may seem an unlikely setting for an operation of such
scale, given its distance from the big cities and the fact that
many private employers in southwest Florida lament the scarcity of
qualified workers.
</P>
<P>
   But Nielsen's Venice Manager Gary Bentley said that the local
high retiree population is precisely what lured the media research
firm here 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   He said that seniors generally demonstrate a strong work ethic
and enjoy the flexibility offered by the cyclical sweeps, totaling
about 40 workweeks annually.
</P>
<P>
   The present site is Nielsen's third in Venice. Bentley said that
the company moved to the present $6-million building, set on seven
acres, in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
   All but 18 of the 756 employees technically work part time. The
term is clearly relative. Two ``temporary'' workers two weeks ago
celebrated their 25-year work anniversaries with Nielsen in
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   During its seven annual sweeps _ major ones in February, May,
July and November, and minor ones in January, March and October _
workers here input 36.2 million computer entries gleaned from 1.33
million diaries representing more than 30 million hours of TV
viewing.
</P>
<P>
   The TV viewing diaries are specific, giving the time, channel
and names of the station, program and viewer.
</P>
<P>
   Many diaries arrive incomplete. The main task of editors is to
interpret entries so they result in accurate station crediting.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everybody followed those directions, it would be easy,''
Bentley said. ``They all interpret those instructions
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Of particular interest to client stations, networks, advertisers
and cable stations are the back pages of diaries reserved for
comments.
</P>
<P>
   Many are left blank. But Jim Wrightson, who first retired in
1986 and now oversees several of the local editing teams, said that
the most prevalent written comment is that shows today have too
much sex and violence.
</P>
<P>
   Wrightson, 71, said that he has gained a keener appreciation of
TV programming since working at Nielsen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has increased my knowledge of what other people watch,'' he
said. ``I see something other people are watching, and I check it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Computerization has greatly improved and accelerated the editing
process. Before July 1994, tools consisted of piles of pens, paper
and TV guides.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen Media Research began as part of A.C. Nielsen Co., which
was founded in 1923 by Arthur C. Nielsen Sr. It became one of the
first firms to measure audience size for the rapidly developing
radio broadcasting and advertising industries, and has remained the
official national measurement service for television for more than
40 years.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen provides ratings for nearly every program seen on TV.
</P>
<P>
   Listed on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol
NMR, Nielsen last month announced that its 1998 pro forma earnings
rose 20.2 percent over the previous year to $48.8 million, or 82
cents per diluted share, a 15.5 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
   Those who yearn to become a Nielsen TV family should not hold
their breath _ or lose heart. Accepting volunteers, who receive $1
for their efforts, would skew the numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen chooses you.

JULIAN LENNON HAS A NEW ALBUM AND NO KIND WORDS FOR YOKO ONO 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By BILL DeYOUNG   
 THE GAINESVILLE (FLA.) SUN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's never been easy being Julian Lennon. The son of the world's
most beloved pop musician, Julian tried to carve a career for
himself in the early 1980s, only to find that everybody _ the
media, the fans, the world at large _ couldn't stop making
comparisons to his father.
</P>
<P>
   The nose, the voice, the droll Liverpudlian humor _ it was as if
John Lennon hadn't really died in that hail of bullets, and was
still writing songs and making music.
</P>
<P>
   Julian endured it because his first two singles, ``Valotte'' and
``Too Late For Goodbyes,'' were big hits, and the money and
attention were just fine for a young man barely in his 20s.
</P>
<P>
   But it started going sour quickly. ``I felt used and abused and
disrespected in many, many ways,'' says the now 35-year-old
singer-songwriter in a phone interview. ``And I recognized what
many people's perceptions of me were, which was more of a joke than
anything else. Not being taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Lennon didn't help things by living the high life, very
publicly, in Los Angeles. Alcohol and cocaine nearly killed him
before it was all over, and after his fourth album, in 1991, he
left Los Angeles and bought out his stagnating record deal.
</P>
<P>
   He moved to northern Italy, into a lake villa. ``Since entering
the business at age 20, it had been nothing but music or the music
industry,'' he says. ``That left no time to figure out who I was,
outside of the industry. So it was a good time for reflection.''
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, Julian Lennon, inheritor of the
great Beatle legacy, disappeared. ``I actually lived and breathed
as an adult, which was the most wonderful thing,'' he explains. ``I
had a chance to catch up on people I'd sort of brushed to the side
during my mad years. To travel without working for a change, so I
had the chance to appreciate the places I was going to.''
</P>
<P>
   He took up painting and photography, and worked hard at his
first love, cooking. Eventually, slowly, he began writing songs
again.
</P>
<P>
   Lennon is back with the best music he's ever made. Released two
weeks ago, the album ``Photograph Smile'' was self-composed,
self-produced and is being marketed through his own new record
label _ the result, he says, of too many shady business deals and
two-sided contracts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say `You grew up around the industry, you must have had
some advice,' '' he says. ``Well, no. Dad walked out the door when
I was 5 and I maybe saw him a handful of times before he passed
away. I grew up on a farm in North Wales, amongst many other
places. I was nowhere near the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   John Lennon left Cynthia Powell, his Liverpool-born wife, in
1968, when he took up with Yoko Ono. Little Julian _ he was the
inspiration for his father's songs ``Lucy in the Sky With
Diamonds'' and ``Good Night,'' as well as Paul McCartney's ``Hey
Jude'' _ thought of his mother's second husband, Roberto Bassanini,
as his father. He barely knew the former Beatle.
</P>
<P>
   Just before he was murdered in 1980, John Lennon gave several
interviews in which he said Julian had been ``born out of a bottle
of whiskey on a Saturday night,'' and that they were slowly,
arduously working on a long-distance father-son relationship.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the elder Lennon had a son, Sean, with Ono, whom he
doted on. Sean was the favored son.
</P>
<P>
   Although the world may never know the real John Lennon, says
Julian, he thinks he's got a good handle on it. ``Look, Mum grew up
with him, went to art college with him, got married and had me with
him,'' he says, ``so she knew him before and during what was going
on. So as far as the real man underneath all of that stuff, she's
got a pretty clear understanding. She's always been very grounded
and very honest and very truthful in anything she's ever had to say
about Dad. And she's never wanted to harm or hurt anybody else,
it's just pure honesty on the table.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it came to the settlement, when they were finally
splitting up, the only thing Mum asked for _ so many people have
said `Why didn't your mother go for his balls?' _ all she wanted
was enough for me to go through school, food and clothes. She
didn't want anything for herself, the reason being: She loved this
man. She did not love his money, or the celebrity, or anything that
surrounded that. She fell in love with this man.''
</P>
<P>
   In the original divorce settlement, Cynthia was awarded around
$6,000 in annual child-care for Julian; he received a trust fund of
approximately $120,000 when he turned 25.
</P>
<P>
   In Lennon's will, Ono was named executor of an estate estimated
at more than $600 million. Two years ago, Julian settled with Ono _
with whom he'd never had an easy relationship _ for around $50
million.
</P>
<P>
   He's been given none of his father's possessions, and last year
bought some of them _ including guitars, song lyrics and the black
Afghan coat John wore in ``Magical Mystery Tour'' _ at an auction
house.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yoko has everything,'' Lennon says. ``She has the rights, she
has the name, she has all his belongings, she has absolutely
everything. Which I find disgusting, but there's nothing I can do
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we all look at him as the supposed intelligent man that he
was, and he was a man who talked about love and peace and fairness
in life, then he certainly didn't represent that within his own
family.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   Today, his venom is reserved exclusively for Ono. His sleeves
are rolled up, he says, and he's ready to take her on.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as history is concerned, it's Yoko and Sean and Dad are
the Lennon family. And that was it. I know for a fact she's tried
to squash my career in Europe _ and had a great effect on it, as a
matter of fact. I know of many things she's done to me, and to Mum,
and I'm not gonna put up with it any more. Because I don't owe her
anything. And I'm certainly not gonna bow down. Because I have
truth and honesty on my side, and factual information about some of
her wheelings and dealings. Which is not pretty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't entirely know what people's perspective about Yoko is,
but it's certainly gonna change over the next year, without a
doubt.'' Lennon says he will discuss his position in the media,
every chance that he's offered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Photograph Smile'' was released last summer in Europe, on the
same day that the debut album, by Sean Lennon, now 22, arrived in
record stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have copies of letters she's written, hand signed, to some
of the largest music magazines in Europe,'' Lennon explains.
``Saying that Sean should be seen as the genius son of John Lennon,
and that Julian should be seen as the used, wasted, drink-and-drug
useless son that didn't have anything to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the degree that if this was not complied, literally she
would buy up all the copies of this publication, or she would bury
the editor and owner of the magazine. Literally. And this is on
paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lennon says, he and his stepbrother get along
well. ``Sean doesn't even know about half of this stuff. I don't
want to tell him face to face. He's got to learn for himself what's
going on, because it is his mother ... .That's a difficult one for
me, and I certainly don't want to put a wall up between us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, she doesn't have her own life. She meddled in
Dad's and now she's meddling in Sean's. And I certainly don't want
her to meddle in mine a.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A wrong-way warm front moved from northeast to southwest across
the Canadian Maritimes on Tuesday, indicating an unusual weather
pattern over northeastern North America. With a high-pressure
system east of Newfoundland blocking the advance of the
low-pressure system over the Gulf of Maine, relatively mild ocean
air pinwheeled completely around the offshore low and then headed
west into Canada. Wednesday, accumulating snows and patchy ice will
fall across the upper St. Lawrence River Valley and parts of
northeast Maine as the unusual warm front presses slowly
southwestward.
</P>
<P>
   With the blocking high disrupting the normal eastward
progression of weather systems across Canada, the steering winds of
the jet stream will be diverted over the southern two-thirds of the
contiguous states. In northern California and Oregon, coastal rains
and mountain snows will develop as a Pacific disturbance is steered
inland. Precipitation will be generally light to moderate, owing to
a lack of moisture. This disturbance will move southeastward and
may pose a formidable threat to the East late in the week if it
develops into a major storm.
</P>
<P>
   Snow will accumulate across parts of northeast Wyoming and
western South Dakota early in the day as a weakening jet stream
disturbance combines with moist winds from the southeast. Four
inches of snow or more are possible in the Black Hills.
</P>
<P>
   A few flurries and patchy drizzle across the northern Middle
Atlantic States will mark the wake of a low-pressure system moving
out to sea.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Twin-City Snow
</P>
<P>
   Twelve and one-half inches of snow were measured at Minneapolis
on Monday, establishing a new record snowfall for the date and
raising the city's winter's snowfall to 53 inches. The average
winter snowfall is approximately 48 inches. On average, March is
the snowiest month at Minneapolis, with the city typically
positioned on the northern fringe of the range of moisture from the
Gulf of Mexico. Most of the snow that falls in cold Minneapolis is
fluffy, ``dry'' snow, with the typical water content of snowflakes
being relatively low. Such dry snow is ideal for winter-sport
recreation. &QL;

MARILYN MONROE'S HALF-SISTER REMEMBERS JOE DIMAGGIO

   GAINESVILLE, Fla. _ Joe DiMaggio's sister-in-law, a Gainesville
resident since 1951, guarded her memories of the baseball icon who
died Monday, saying she didn't think he'd approve of her being too
open about their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked, but I don't think Joe would want me to say anything
about that,'' Berniece Miracle, Marilyn Monroe's half-sister, said
softly when asked if she and DiMaggio had stayed in touch over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Miracle, as staunch a defender of her privacy as DiMaggio was of
his, did reveal that she's certain the love between Marilyn and Joe
continued long after their 10-month marriage in 1954 ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe was the love of her life, and she would have remarried him
if she had lived,'' she said. ``I'm sure of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miracle said she considered DiMaggio ``a wonderful man'' who
``was always my favorite brother-in-law.'' She'll never forget his
help after Marilyn Monroe's death in 1962, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always appreciated Joe's helping me with my sister's
funeral in California,'' said Miracle, 79, who retired in 1974 from
the University of Florida, where she worked as an accountant and
bookkeeper. ``I'm very, very sad about him passing away.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``My Sister Marilyn: A Memoir of Marilyn Monroe'' (Algonquin
Books, 1994), Miracle and her daughter, Mona Rae Miracle, touch on
the romance, marriage and breakup of Monroe and DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public loves the match between these two poor kids who
grew up to become a baseball hero and America's favorite blonde,''
the two women wrote. The union couldn't withstand the incessant
glare of the limelight and the demands of Monroe's career, the
authors write. But their love, Berniece Miracle is certain, did
survive.

`SHOW ME A HERO': A CITY DIVIDED BY A JUDGE'S DESEGREGATION ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (Book notes are at end of review)  
 (af)  
 Patricia J. Williams, a professor at Columbia Law School, is the
author of ``Seeing a Color-Blind Future.''  
 By PATRICIA J. WILLIAMS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In 1992 the journalist Lisa Belkin was living in Westchester in
the first home she had ever owned. When the City of Yonkers, only
10 minutes down the road, was ordered by a federal judge to build
low-income housing in middle-class neighborhoods, Ms. Belkin found
herself drawn to the battle brewing her backyard. The result was
``Show Me a Hero.''
</P>
<P>
   While the near-riotous resistance to desegregation that
culminated with the judge's order had festered for nearly a decade
before this final resolution, Yonkers had had a much longer history
of intentional segregation. Virtually all of its black and poor
citizens had been shunted into densely populated high-rise housing
projects on the west side of town.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belkin, a former reporter for The New York Times who is now
a contributing writer to The New York Times Magazine, begins her
story by introducing a young Dominican mother named Alma Febles, a
candidate for the court-ordered housing, in whom she sees
``mirrored'' her own yearning for the sanctity of home.
</P>
<P>
   A mirror she may be, but it is ``the muddled impurity'' of Ms.
Belkin's concern that becomes the central tension of this book: ``I
believed in the right of this woman to have her home. But what if
bulldozers were to clear a site for that home in the trees so close
to my own house?''
</P>
<P>
   With the lines thus drawn, there is not much to distinguish the
Yonkers case from similar standoffs in cities around the nation,
but for two factors. First, the city council members, backed by
their noisy east side constituents, seemed unusually willing to
bankrupt the city in the effort to prevent the court order from
taking effect. And second, the style of low-income housing finally
built has become the model for public housing nationally: i.e.,
``scatter-site'' homes, or small clusters of low-rise town houses
designed to blend into stable neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Thus ``Show Me a Hero'' takes on the dimension of a cautionary
tale for what may happen in cities everywhere. Only the patient and
the stalwart adapt and survive in the Yonkers debacle, and in the
end there are no heroes of any race or ethnicity, just an exhausted
truce.
</P>
<P>
   The book owes much stylistically, as Ms. Belkin acknowledges, to
authors like Alex Kotlowitz, Nicholas Lemann and Andrew Hacker,
whose best sellers have challenged whites to wake up to the
humanity of people of color and to the costs to themselves of
stigmatizing others.
</P>
<P>
   But like many works in this genre there is something
fundamentally troubling about the positing of black and brown
people as those who are perpetually ``discovered'' to be ``just
like'' everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   A white woman is shocked to find that homes in the projects are
``so clean.'' An architect experiences the impatient apprehension
of ``one towering white man surrounded by six black women.'' A
community organizer expects ``outrage'' from black people who have
been taunted with racial insults but is surprised when they quietly
move on.
</P>
<P>
   A self-styled benefactor has to be taught that ``low income'' is
not a synonym for ``no income,'' lazy, or unemployed. A white
mother is ``transfixed'' and moved to see a black woman kiss her
son's skinned knees.
</P>
<P>
   And Nick Wasicsko, the idealistic young mayor of Yonkers who
makes the decision to obey the court order, discovers that the
.38-caliber pistol he wore while stumping in the projects he now
needs for visiting ``the safest parts of his city.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the structure is somewhat hackneyed, it is also hopeful.
Most of the central characters are indeed transformed by their
interactions with one another, and Ms. Belkin's skill in the art of
quick-paced suspense makes for engrossing reading.
</P>
<P>
   On balance, one is left with the sense that if this is what it
takes, then ``discover'' away, discover again, discover until there
are no more surprises. One of the greatest strengths of the book is
Ms. Belkin's ability to document not just the large
headline-grabbing events, but the small, grudging, baby steps of
perception that allow for major shifts in attitude.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For example, one is made aware of the staggering amounts of
money the west siders must spend to compensate for the lack of
basic public services in a community where everyone knows ``you
have no other choice.''
</P>
<P>
   Slowly one comes to realize that, while the east side residents
are repeatedly described as ``middle class,'' and the tenants in
the new housing are repeatedly described as ``poor,'' they are all
very close to one another on a short spectrum of anxious, generally
underpaid, working-class citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, slowly one senses how much of the war waged by so many
east siders _ all those years spent screaming and spitting and
sending bullets imprinted with the names of various public
officials _ was a showcase for all of the bad behavior they had
feared west siders would import.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Belkin has a talent for subtly revealing the psychology of
racial projection: One man worries that the mostly black tenants
will need to be taught not to sunbathe in front of their houses.
Another brings his dog to defecate on the new lawns of the town
houses, apparently as an expression of a general east side
sentiment that it is the new tenants whose unclean ways will lower
the property values.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately the tenants turn out to be as peaceful and neat as
any in the surrounding private houses. Nevertheless the property
values are affected. It is ``difficult to sell a home in Yonkers _
anywhere in Yonkers,'' Ms. Belkin notes. The little shifts of
sympathetic connection that she so meticulously documents have not
yet been enough to dispel the galloping racial fear that,
throughout the United States, tends to become self-fulfilling
prophecy.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen whether Yonkers becomes yet another
monument to white flight or whether instead it hunkers down
patiently for the long-term discoveries of real racial
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the book Alma Febles, recently installed in her
bright new home reflects upon the rumor that the city is about to
build more town houses on her street. Mrs. Febles is described as
wishing aloud, ``with no hint of irony,'' that the new construction
is not too close because ``this is such a quiet, pretty block.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a densely enigmatic statement with which to leave the
reader. One is unsure whether Ms. Belkin is using Mrs. Febles to
represent the next generation of bunkered fear of the unknown and
thus to mirror Ms. Belkin's own, self-professed, not-in-my-backyard
anxiety with which the book begins.
</P>
<P>
   But there is another way to hear Mrs. Febles' worry: Another
cluster of new units put right next to an existing cluster of town
houses is already a betrayal of the very notion of ``scatter-site''
housing.
</P>
<P>
   One can only hope that the effort to disperse poor minorities
throughout better-off white communities is not defeated by
resistance to the integrative notion of ``scattering'' itself. One
can only hope, as perhaps Alma Febles does, that high-rise
concentration is not replaced by low-rise sprawl.

 &HT;    MCI accused in racketeering conspiracy
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Federal authorities in Atlanta are investigating an
alleged scheme that defrauded MCI Telecommunications Corp. and
several banks out of more than $30 million, according to court
documents.
</P>
<P>
   So far, federal prosecutors have obtained one guilty plea by a
manager of an MCI financial services group in Atlanta. The manager,
James Wilkie IV, pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and is
cooperating in the investigation. Under his plea agreement, Wilkie
acknowledges he may be liable for paying more than $2 million in
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Late last month three banks, including NationsBank Corp., filed
a civil lawsuit against MCI, alleging a racketeering conspiracy by
the telecommunications giant.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation is similar to ``the focus of our
claim against MCI and others for racketeering activities,'' said
Buddy Parker, the lead lawyer for NationsBank, National Bank of
Canada and the CIT Group of Livingston, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court, accuses MCI of
covering up the fraud after it was discovered. It also said that
MCI should be held liable for the banks' losses _ and forced to pay
punitive damages plus mounting attorneys' fees _ because it is
responsible for alleged fraudulent acts committed by its own
managers.
</P>
<P>
   MCI contends that it, like the banks, is a victim of the alleged
fraud and estimates that it has lost more than $30 million,
according to court filings. The banks say they have suffered losses
of more than $15 million.
</P>
<P>
   MCI denies the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have maintained all along that MCI. . . was the victim in
this situation,'' MCI spokeswoman Jamie DePeau said. ``To that
point, one of the perpetrators has pleaded guilty to wire fraud in
federal court. We feel the case is moving in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the banks' lawsuit, MCI approached Manatee Partners
Ltd., an Atlanta investment firm, about buying the accounts
receivable of several MCI ``resellers'' _ companies that buy excess
space on MCI's network and then sell it to others, including
``1-900'' phone sex lines. Because ``1-900'' accounts are difficult
to collect, they became a cash-flow problem for MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Manatee obtained a line of credit from the three banks to
finance the purchases, the lawsuit says.
</P>
<P>
   But Manatee, which also is named as a defendant in the banks'
lawsuit, diverted money from the loans into offshore bank accounts
in the Cayman Islands and misled the banks about its ability to
repay the loans, the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   In court filings, Manatee has denied any wrongdoing and has
filed its own lawsuit against MCI.
</P>
<P>
   MCI contends the ``perpetrators'' of the fraudulent scheme
include a network of companies specializing in the sale of phone
sex and two former ``middle-level'' MCI employees _ Wilkie and
Walter Pavlo Jr. The two employees altered MCI's books ``to conceal
the resellers' continuing delinquency and the fact that the
proceeds of (MCI's) receivables were being diverted,'' MCI said in
court filings.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlo, who joined MCI in 1992 but no longer works for the
company, worked for the company's Carrier Financial Services unit,
which was responsible for collecting accounts that resellers owed
to MCI. According to MCI court filings, Pavlo helped get lines of
credit from the banks, co-owned offshore accounts and received more
than $500,000 in diverted payments.
</P>
<P>
   Pavlo's attorney, Bruce Morris, said his client engaged in no
criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Morris said MCI's deal with Manatee to collect the receivables
was ``real, legitimate and intended to benefit MCI. And for a time,
it did.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the ``innovative program'' was designed to keep MCI's
bad debt at a minimum. ``There was great pressure within MCI to
accomplish that.'' he said. ``(Pavlo) was introducing a creative
program into the Carrier Finance division.''

 &HT;    BellSouth's big gamble in Brazil: Can its wireless gambit ride
out the economic crisis?By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Considering how bad things have gotten in Brazil, it
has really been pretty good _ at least for BellSouth.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based company, the largest foreign
telecommunications investor in Latin America, has _ with its
Brazilian partners _ poured billions of dollars into purchase of
wireless licenses and construction of networks. They have seen
business news that was agreeable even as the economic reports grew
more grim.
</P>
<P>
   In the past 12 months, the government of Brazil, the region's
largest nation and largest economy, has been racked with crisis,
forced to cashier top officials, lay off tens of thousands of
workers and finally, devalue the country's currency.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, BellSouth went into the wireless business and, within
nine months, had one million subscribers. It took BellSouth's
operations seven years to reach a million subscribers in both
Venezuela and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a very bad year for Brazil,'' said Roberto Peon,
president of the Brazilian wireless unit part-owned by BellSouth.
``It was a great year for us.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has for years been billing international as one-third
of its long-term growth strategy, along with domestic wireless and
local service in the nine southeastern states. In fact, golfer and
BellSouth Chief Executive Duane Ackerman calls the investments in
the nine Latin nations as ``the back nine.''
</P>
<P>
   But like any international investor, BellSouth has seen its
international plan threatened by the currency crisis that started
in the fall of 1997 and was first called the ``Asian Flu.''
BellSouth has only limited presence in Asia _ albeit in the two
largest nations on Earth: India and China. But even those are
low-level efforts aiming far into the future.
</P>
<P>
   Then the currency malady spread last year into Latin America,
casting suspicion on years of Pollyanna projections about rapid
economic growth and renewed political stability. Most ominous, the
region's largest economy seemed to have caught the most serious
version of the bug.
</P>
<P>
   Stakes are high. BellSouth and its partners spent $2.5 billion
to buy the license for Sao Paulo and surrounding area, turf where
about 18 million people live. Shortly after, the consortium ponied
up $512 million more to buy the right to offer wireless in the
nation's six-state northeast region. They promised to spend $950
million building and improving those networks over three years.
</P>
<P>
   Even for a $23 billion-a-year company like BellSouth, that is a
healthy chunk of change. True, BellSouth doesn't carry the whole
burden. It owns about 45 percent of each Brazilian operation,
taking a similar share of profits _ and expenses.
</P>
<P>
   SUBHEAD
</P>
<P>
   The opportunities seemed even more sensational than the costs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview a yer ago in his Sao Paulo office, Luiz de
Oliveira Machado, president of Nortel in Brazil, called Brazil the
world's best market for telecom investment. Dropping a sheet of
paper onto his oak table, he pointed to three intersecting circles.
In one circle, names of countries with fewer than 10 phone lines
for every 100 residents _ where potential is the greatest. In
another circle, countries with populations greater than 50 million
_ where the market is the largest. The third circle named nations
with gross domestic product per person of more than $4,000 _ the
places where many people have the money to buy new service.
</P>
<P>
   Only one name appeared in all three circles: Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   So despite BellSouth's huge outlays, hopes were high. More than
a million people were on waiting lists for telephone service. Many
had given up expecting a wire into the home and would be satisfied
_ and maybe even prefer _ a wireless phone.
</P>
<P>
   But always there were fears. Of economic turmoil undoing demand.
Of recession unnerving delicate political systems.
</P>
<P>
   And turmoil, there has been.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate for Brazil hit a 16-year high in January,
even as the Brazilian currency collapsed to a record low against
the dollar. Meanwhile, interest rates rose as high as 40 percent. A
number of large companies announced layoffs, so the picture is not
likely to brighten soon. Economists say the Brazilian economy will
shrink by 4.1 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   The International Monetary Fund has been preparing a $9 billion
loan as part of its ongoing, $41.5 billion ``rescue'' effort, but
has demanded still more economic restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   When the economic crisis first hit, BellSouth officials said
they hoped mobile phones would stay immune. The theory was that
Brazil was so under-served by telecommunications that phones would
be one of the necessities that consumers would spend on.
</P>
<P>
   SUBHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Yet the year was not so kind for BellSouth's chief rival in
Brazil. Telesp Celular this month reported an earnings drop of 52
percent from earnings for the previous quarter. The company blamed
devaluation and a weakening of consumer demand.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Manuel Romao Mateus, the company president, recently told
Bloomberg News that his ability to meet even existing demand was
damaged by devaluation, which raised prices for imported equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But he also blamed competition from BellSouth _ which has surged
to nearly 50 percent market share _ for keeping him from raising
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Peon doesn't like to talk about his competition, but he
will say he thinks he has a huge advantage. Because BellSouth has
built its network from scratch it doesn't face the costs of
transition from analog to digital _ something that its competition
is grappling with. BellSouth also had the good fortune of doing the
lion's share of its infrastructure improvements before the currency
crisis began in earnest.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the economic malaise, Peon thinks he can customize his
offering to take advantage of the strengths in the economy.
</P>
<P>
   For example, he is emphasizing pre-paid plans. The idea is to
let customers know exactly how much they will spend on their phone
service while still encouraging use of the network. Unlike the
United States, where a wireless customer is charged whenever the
phone is used _ even to receive a call _ in Brazil, the calling
party pays. That means that a user who has run through his or her
pre-paid budget can still leave the phone turned on, hand out the
number, take calls and use BellSouth's network.
</P>
<P>
   Which is just fine with BellSouth, too, since the caller pays
the freight.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest hit BellSouth has taken has been from devaluation.
Expected profits are down, since the debt from BellSouth's
Brazilian investment must be paid back to BellSouth's New
York-based lenders in dollars. But the continuing slide of Brazil's
currency means it will take ever-more revenues from Brazil to make
payments.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth too has seen an erratic supply of phones thanks to
devaluation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The result was I only had the higher priced phones in the
stores for a while,'' Peon said. ``It slowed things down, but I
still made my numbers. We probably lost some sales because
customers wanted the lower priced phones.''
</P>
<P>
   Peon is convinced that the potential in Brazil has barely been
tapped, since customers thus far are only the wealthy and
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Brazil's middle class is proportionately much
smaller than that of the United States, and the rockier the
recession, the more it might shrink. But demographics bode well,
since the hottest consumer demand for wireless is among the young,
Peon said.
</P>
<P>
   More critically, BellSouth has not yet gone after many corporate
accounts.
</P>
<P>
   That delay was partly to serve the huge backlog of people on
waiting lists for phones, and partly to make sure the network was
broad enough to handle business needs, Peon said. ``The corporate
accounts are not inflation-sensitive. But going after corporate
accounts when you don't have good coverage, it's like committing
hara-kari.''
</P>
<P>
   Peon remains persuaded that his business is recession-proof, but
coats his predictions with caution.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody in Brazil can say without a doubt that they are
optimistic, because you do not want to be a complete fool.''

 &HT;    CheckFree stocks ride price roller coasterBy Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Shares of CheckFree took a circular ride in the last
week after Intuit filed suit against the Norcross-based company.
</P>
<P>
   CheckFree stock dropped 8.7 percent Wednesday, the day Intuit
filed suit in California.
</P>
<P>
   The company's shares last Wednesday closed at $35.50, down 8.7
percent. The next day, Thursday, CheckFree shares dropped 11
percent, to close at $31.50. But by the time the market closed on
Tuesday, CheckFree shares had rebounded a total of almost 25
percent to close at the $39.81 1/4 with a gain of $4.56 1/4, or 13
percent, on strong volume. Intuit has a 19.9 percent stake in
CheckFree, so news of its suit stuck the Silicon Valley company
with a $75 million paper loss by the time the market closed
Thursday. Most of that paper loss has since been erased.
</P>
<P>
   Few people have seen the lawsuit. Intuit asked the Superior
Court of Santa Clara County, Calif., to seal the file four hours
after it filed the suit, according to the court clerk's office.
</P>
<P>
   Intuit said it filed suit because CheckFree is not complying
with the terms of an April 1998 agreement. CheckFree said the suit
won't keep it from offering a service that lets customers get and
pay their bills from an Internet portal.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Franco, an analyst with Piper Jaffray in San Francisco,
said the stock price rebounded because the lawsuit is ``much ado
about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco said he has not seen the court filing, but believes it
involves CheckFree's negotiations with America Online to offer
Web-based bill paying and bill presenting, as well as the question
of whether the negotiations infringed on an earlier Intuit
agreement with AOL.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is something they'll work out,'' Franco said. ``It just
might have the effect of dragging out AOL's ability to roll out the
CheckFree service.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco said he did not think CheckFree's distribution deal with
Yahoo!, a high-traffic Internet portal, would be affected by the
Intuit suit since Intuit did not have an earlier agreement with
Yahoo! CheckFree said on Jan. 26 that it had signed a deal with a
major Internet portal, but the company has yet to say which portal.
Avivah Litan, an analyst with the Gartner Group, said it was
Yahoo!.
</P>
<P>
   Franco maintains a 12-month target price on CheckFree stock of
$53. He recommends the stock as a ``strong buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Two analysts lowered their ratings on CheckFree shares on the
heels of the lawsuit: Robert V. Bolen, of J.C. Bradford &AMP; Co., in
Nashville, from ``strong buy'' to ``buy;'' Lehman Brothers' Patrick
M. Burton, from ``neutral'' to ``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   But two other analysts issued ``buy'' ratings this week.
Deutsche Bank Securities analyst James M. Marks initiated coverage
of the company on Tuesday with a ``buy'' rating, and Legg Mason
Wood Walker analyst Pawan K. Malhotra raised his rating on Monday
to ``buy'' from ``outperform.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, CheckFree announced it bought Mobius Group, a financial
planning software company, for about $18 million in stock. Mobius,
which makes money management databases for the financial services
industry, had $6.6 million in revenue in 1998. Mobius, based in
Research Triangle Park, N.C., employs about 70 people.

 &HT;    MindSpring offers cable Net access
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Surf fast or die.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, the Atlanta-based Internet service provider, entered
the fast-paced, high stakes world of cable Internet access this
week by offering service in Montgomery Ala.
</P>
<P>
   It plans to expand that service soon to other southern cities
served by West Point-based Knology, an interactive video, voice and
data services company. MindSpring and Knology are sister companies
with a common investor.
</P>
<P>
   Offering cable modem and other high-speed services is vital to
the survival of ISPs like MindSpring, Earthlink and even America
Online.
</P>
<P>
   Competition is heating up for the traditional dial-up customers.
AT&AMP;T and MCI WorldCom have scored deals with computer makers to
provide Internet service to new computer users. That, combined with
a cable industry determined to aggressively roll out its own
branded high-speed service, doesn't make things easy for
independent ISPs like MindSpring.
</P>
<P>
   The ISPs must find alternative distribution outlets to keep pace
with technology, as well as remain major players in the ISP arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a baby step for MindSpring into the broadband space,''
says Jupiter Communications analyst Abhai Chaki of the Montgomery
rollout. Chaki and other analysts say MindSpring and other ISPs
have a long way to go to make serious inroads in the broadband
world.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring now has a toe-hold in the world of high-speed
Internet access, but it will need more than just a few small
Southern cities to become a major player in the broadband world,
currently locked up by traditional cable and telecommunications
companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Montgomery, MindSpring's Fast Access service will
roll out eventually in Augusta, Columbus, Charleston, S.C, and
Panama City, Fla., once MindSpring's Knology upgrades the equipment
it needs to provide cable access in those cities.
</P>
<P>
   ITC Holdings owns a significant chunk of Knology and owns a part
of Mindspring. Because the two are ``sister companies,'' MindSpring
can offer cable modem Internet access in markets where Knology has
built a cable infrastructure without requiring customers to change
cable TV companies.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's director of Fast Access, Jim Anderson, says as far
as he knows this is the first time an ISP has rolled out cable
modem service without hooking up with a traditional cable company
such as Media One, Time Warner or any of the other major cable
operators.
</P>
<P>
   Cable modem service allows users to access the Internet at
speeds up to 50 times faster than standard dial-up phone
connections.
</P>
<P>
   In Montgomery, the service will cost $39.95 per month with a
one-time installation fee of $149.95, which includes installation
of all equipment and service. The cable modem is available for
lease at $13 per month.
</P>
<P>
   ``MindSpring has no current plans to offer cable modem service
in Atlanta,'' Anderson says. ``We would very much like to, but
don't have the access to the cable infrastructure that we need. So
far, we haven't been able to get that access, like we have with
Knology.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Anderson says the company still eventually hopes to
bring cable modem service into as many households as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had periodic discussions with other third party
providers, and we will talk with anyone who will talk to us about
the cable infrastructure,'' he says. However, cable companies are
not required to open their wires to any other service providers.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring has joined with other ISPs in a lobbying group called
the Open Network Coalition to call upon Washington regulators to
open up cable lines to allow competition from the ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, cable companies such as Tele-Communications Inc. and
others who provide cable modem service do not allow subscribers to
choose an ISP.
</P>
<P>
   A TCI subscriber must use TCI's ISP, the At Home Network.
Similarly, Media One's cable modem subscribers must be Media One
Internet customers. They do not have the option to chose
MindSpring, Earthlink, America Online or any other ISP. Those ISPs
believe the government should force cable companies to share their
lines, as telephone companies must.
</P>
<P>
   But some industry observers see an irony in that position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prior to broadband becoming a reality, MindSpring, AOL and
everybody else said the government shouldn't interfere with how
ISPs do business. They didn't want the government telling them how
to deal with privacy, content and spam,'' Chaki says. ``I see this
as a conflicting message. As soon as someone comes to challenge
their market, they want the government involved. That's disturbing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When (cable modem and DSL high-speed telephone access) reaches
critical mass, it will make sense for the Federal Communications
Commission to come in and regulate,'' Chaki says. He says what
MindSpring and others should do in the meantime is aggregate
customers so they can go to the cable companies with millions of
customers that the cable companies will be more than willing to
bring into the fold.
</P>
<P>
   ``The regulatory business is very risky,'' Chaki says.
``MindSpring doesn't have a clue what it's getting into. The cable
companies and the telecos have had strong, powerful lobbies in
Washington for years. They own their cable and telephone customers.
They're not just going to roll over and die,'' Chaki says. ``It's
going to be difficult going for ISPs in the broadband world.''

 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When you're a reader, you take your memorable
passages where you find them _ sometimes in unexpected, unheralded
places. Read, for example, these words of biblical power from a
commentary on Isaiah's ``shadow of a great rock in a weary land,''
spoken in Kansas in the mid-19th century by a preacher known as
Brother Carper:
</P>
<P>
   ``A scene of unrelieved waste; an ocean made of powder, into
which the curse of angered heaven had ground a portion of earth.
Now and then, a huge rock, like shattered shafts and fallen
monuments in a neglected graveyard, and big enough to be the
tombstone of millions, would lift its mossless sides above the
accumulating sands. No poisonous serpent or venomous beast here
await their prey, for death here has ended his work and dwells amid
silence.''
</P>
<P>
   That description of desolation, intended as a spiritual
metaphor, is a reminder of the wonderfully vivid language that can
be found in religious writing in America over centuries. Now the
Library of America has published ``American Sermons: The Pilgrims
to Martin Luther King Jr.'' This handsome 940-page book includes
about 60 sermons by the likes of John Winthrop, Jonathan Edwards,
Ralph Waldo Emerson, Fulton J. Sheen and many lesser-known
practitioners of the great American tradition of Sunday morning (or
for some, Saturday morning) preaching.
</P>
<P>
   To peruse this work is to become reacquainted with the literary
eloquence of our distant and recent past and to observe what has
happened to rhetoric itself over the centuries. For example, the
book may well demonstrate that the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
was the last of the great traditional American rhetoricians in a
line stretching back to the earliest sermon known to have been
preached on American soil: one by Robert Cushman, visiting Plymouth
Colony in 1621, a year after the arrival of the Mayflower.
</P>
<P>
   For those men who ``looke after great riches, ease, pleasure,
dainties and jollitie in this world ... I would not advise them to
come there, for as yet the country will afford no such matters,''
Cushman says. ``But if there be any who are content to lay out
their estates, spend their time, labors and endeavors for the
benefit of them that shall come after and in desire to further the
Gospell among those poore heathens ... such men I would advise and
encourage to goe, for their ends cannot faile them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a long way from Cushman to King, yet the two seem linked
by the tradition of protest and the search for freedom that are the
main strains of American history.
</P>
<P>
   In both _ Cushman obliquely, King explicitly _ there is the
metaphor of the American promised land, which can be attained if
only men would practice what King called ``a kind of dangerous
unselfishness.''
</P>
<P>
   The last sermon included in the Library of America book is a
famous King sermon delivered during a strike by sanitation workers
in Memphis on April 3, 1968, when he seemed to sense that his death
was near.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to
protest for right,'' he said. He continues with a disquisition on
the preacher's special role: ``Somehow, the preacher must say with
Jesus, `The spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed
me to deal with the problems of the poor.'''
</P>
<P>
   Probably half of the sermons reflect American Puritanism; for
example, sermons of a rather formal and predictable structure that
relate some passage of Scripture to the ``life and manners of men
in a simple and plaine speech.''
</P>
<P>
   Included, for instance, is a sober and scholarly defense of the
death sentence for murderers by Increase Mather, father of what may
have been Colonial America's most influential New England
theologian.
</P>
<P>
   ``For murder is such a crime as does pollute the very land where
it is done,'' Mather said. ``Not only the person that has shed
blood is polluted thereby, but the whole land lieth under pollution
until such time as justice is done upon the murderer.''
</P>
<P>
   While Increase Mather seems lawyerly and judicious, his son
Cotton's sermon ``The Wonders of the Invisible World,'' a sermon
about witches doing the Devil's bidding, appears today to be little
more than eloquent superstition:
</P>
<P>
   ``The Devil, exhibiting himself ordinarily as a small black man,
has decoy'd a fearful knot of proud, froward, ignorant, envious and
malicious creatures to list themselves in his horrid service by
entring their names in a book, by him tendred unto them.'' One of
the most striking statements is Theodore Parker's stinging 1846
protest against the Mexican War, through which the United States
annexed most of today's Southwest.
</P>
<P>
   Parker issues a kind of bill of indictment against war, giving
detailed statistics on its terrible cost in money and materials. At
the center of his sermon is an almost cinematic vision of men who
do not know one another yet engage in ferocious, impersonal
slaughter:
</P>
<P>
   ``There they lie _ the two masses of burning valor _
extinguished, quenched and grimly dead, each covering with his body
the spot he defended with his arms. They had no quarrel; yet they
lie there, slain by a brother's hand.'' Parker continues with a
vivid picture of those who are maimed for life, ``pierced by the
lances and torn with the shot, till scarce anything human is
left.''
</P>
<P>
   More specifically, Parker declares, ``Our invasion of Mexico is
as bad as the partition of Poland in the last century.''
</P>
<P>
   Brother Carper's sermon was published from memory by a Methodist
missionary named J.V. Watson, who transcribed it into a kind of
black dialect, which I have retranscribed into standard English. In
the original transcription, ``of'' becomes ``ob'' and ``is''
becomes ``am,'' as in: ``Brederen, de text am as full ob latter-day
glory as am de sun ob light.'' At a time when many preachers were
railing against the slave power, Carper's statement is entirely
evangelical and nonpolitical. Slavery is not mentioned.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of these sermons have the figurative power of a Brother
Carper or a Henry Ward Beecher. Some are, naturally enough, hokey,
at least as seen in today's irony-laden age. There is a good deal
of soggy moralism here as well. And there are plenty of statements
to be found in this book that would be offensive to one group or
another today.
</P>
<P>
   But taken as a whole, the sermon form is revealed to have
remarkable literary vitality. Influenced by the Bible, tinged by
African and evangelical cadences, the sermons constitute a very
American idiom. One can read these as historical artifacts, which
they are. I found them satisfying as literature.

ALL EYES FOR A PEEK AT KUBRICK'S FINAL FILM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Stanley Kubrick's work, like his life, was shrouded
in mystery and secrecy.
</P>
<P>
   And his final film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' also remains, in many
ways, a source of mystery and secrecy. Kubrick, one of the great
postwar filmmakers _ with classics like ``2001: A Space Odyssey''
and ``A Clockwork Orange'' _ told a friend that it was his best
film.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's death in his sleep Sunday, at 70, came only five days
after the first screening of the movie for Bob Daly and Terry
Semel, the co-chairmen of Warner Brothers, and the film's stars,
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. At Kubrick's request, the screening
in New York took place in such secrecy that the projectionist was
asked to turn away and not watch the film.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy had confirmed that Kubrick died of natural causes.
Among those scheduled to attend the private funeral Friday are
Semel and Daly, as well as Cruise and Ms. Kidman.
</P>
<P>
   Semel said the movie would be released as scheduled July 16.
``The film is totally finished'' except for ``a couple of color
corrections'' and ``some technical things,'' he said. ``What he
showed was his final cut.''
</P>
<P>
   Semel added that Kubrick had selected 90 seconds of a scene to
show Wednesday in Las Vegas to the Showest convention of theater
owners at which studios offer glimpses of their coming movies.
``Eyes Wide Shut,'' a psychosexual drama, is loosely based on
Arthur Schnitzler's 1926 novella ``Dream Story.'' Ms. Kidman and
Cruise play psychiatrists. ``It's the story of a married couple and
their sexual exploits,'' Semel said. ``The part that also blew us
was it's a terrific suspense thriller. It's a wonderful film. It's
a film that's really challenging and is filled with suspense.''
</P>
<P>
   Semel said he last spoke to Kubrick on Saturday morning from his
hotel room in Syracuse, N.Y. ``I said, `Who is this?' and he said,
`Stanley,' and I said, `Stanley, you're my wake-up call,' and we
then spent a fantastic hour on the phone talking about the details
of Showest and the release. He was in the highest spirits, the
greatest mood. I haven't heard Stanley like that in many years. We
were laughing. We were joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was thrilled with the collective reaction all four of us
had to the film. He called an hour later to tell me a joke he had
heard. The good news is he definitely went to sleep that night with
a smile on his face.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Warner Brothers executive, Julian Senior, the senior
vice president for European marketing, said the movie involved two
married psychiatrists whose fantasies intersect with their real
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Senior said that Kubrick called him Saturday afternoon for an
hourlong conversation, and that he told Kubrick that he was
watching a rugby game on television, but the filmmaker began using
baseball analogies. Kubrick, who was born in the Bronx, was a
fervent fan of the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always used baseball terms with me,'' Senior said. ``He
said: `Forget what you're watching. It's time to go to bat on the
movie.' He said that Terry and Bob and Tom and Nicole had seen it
and loved it, and he was thrilled. He said, `Let's do it right.'''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the conversation, Senior recalled, Kubrick said
excitedly, ``It's my best film ever, Julian.''
</P>
<P>
   Semel said he had read the closely guarded script in a London
hotel because Kubrick did not want copies circulated. The film,
made under almost military secrecy, took an unusually long 15
months to shoot.
</P>
<P>
   No director, with the possible exceptions of Steven Spielberg
and Clint Eastwood, had as much control as Kubrick. He did not have
to endure the process in which filmmakers show studio executives
their director's cut, which is often a starting point for further
editing and even filming. There were also no previews to gauge
audience reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he showed the movie, it was his final version,'' said
Semel, who met Kubrick while the director was making ``Barry
Lyndon'' in 1975. He said Kubrick had agreed to make ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' for an R rating. (No one under 17 may attend without an
adult.) The film is believed to have numerous sexual situations,
and there had been reports that it would be given a more
restrictive NC-17 rating, barring all viewers under 17.
</P>
<P>
   But Semel said he expected that the film, which cost about $65
million, would receive an R rating. ``It was not only our deal, it
was what Stanley wanted,'' Semel said. ``He wanted the film to be
available to the masses.''
</P>
<P>
   The work will be the 13th full-length film of Kubrick's 40-year
career, which began in 1953 with a melodrama, ``Fear and Desire,''
and continued with such classics as ``Paths of Glory'' (1957),
``Spartacus'' (1960), ``Lolita'' (1962), ``Dr. Strangelove'' (1964)
and ``Full Metal Jacket'' (1987).
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick moved to England shortly after completing ``Spartacus,''
a big-budget epic starring Kirk Douglas. By several accounts, he
was dismayed by his lack of control in the studio and wanted to
make movies free of interference. In the process, he became as
publicity-shy as J.D. Salinger and Greta Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   But Semel and Senior said that Kubrick kept in touch by fax,
e-mail and phone and read publications on the Internet. He was also
highly informed on movie marketing and distribution and could
discuss the seating capacities of large theaters in the United
States and abroad, Semel said.
</P>
<P>
   Months ago Kubrick and Warner Brothers agreed to release the
film in the United States in July, partly because it was ``a strong
date'' and partly because it would coincide with its release in
Europe, Semel said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say he was reclusive is not true,'' Senior said. ``He
didn't want a photo spread about himself in Hello magazine, but he
was aware of everything going on and especially with what was going
on with his beloved New York Yankees. He loved life, he loved
chess, he loved documentaries. You'd go over to his home and
there'd be John le Carre in his kitchen. He was not reclusive at
all.''

 &HT;    Guillen not ready to rest
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. _ Ozzie Guillen likes to moan about his
age by saying that he's old, ailing and just doesn't have it
anymore. But he leaves the complaints at the clubhouse door.
</P>
<P>
   Especially now. Guillen, the Braves 35-year-old backup
shortstop, is playing like a young man this spring, like a rookie
desperate to make the team. His performance even has caught some of
his teammates by surprise, including fellow Venezuelan Eddie Perez.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `You're signed to a two-year contract; take it
easy,' '' Perez said. ``He's like, `No, no, no, I've got to be
ready. I don't want to take it easy. I've got to go hard, so I can
be ready to play more this year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Before Tuesday's game against the Mets, Guillen was hitting .571
in three games, with four hits in seven at-bats. He has a double, a
triple and five RBIs in three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, I didn't even care about the spring,'' Guillen
said. ``I knew I was going to be the starting shortstop. . . . But
after the experience I had last year, every day is a challenge. You
never know what's going to happen. Every day to me is a big day.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen said he coasted last spring, as he had during springs
with the White Sox. But this year, he recognized the need to
change.
</P>
<P>
   After 13 years as a starter for the White Sox, Guillen, a former
American League rookie of the year and the three-time All-Star and
Gold Glove winner, got his first pink slip. He had signed with the
Baltimore Orioles in January, began the season by going 1 for 16
and was released on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Guillen said. ``After you play for so many
years with one team, you're a star, and then you get released. They
make you think you cannot play this game anymore. It breaks you
down a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves signed him five days later.
</P>
<P>
   Guillen responded by hitting .277, his highest batting average
in four years. He filled in for the injured Walt Weiss and played
in 58 games. During the offseason, Guillen signed a two-year deal
worth $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ozzie saved our rear end last season,'' manager Bobby Cox
said. ``When Walt went down, we were really in trouble. He really
picked up the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Guillen is a talker. And the Braves' young players are
listening.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart,'' Perez said. ``He talks a lot, but he knows what
he's saying.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, just watching him play might be example enough for
other Braves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to leave the game the way I came in, with my head
up,'' Guillen said. ``I know I can still play. The day I can't play
anymore is the day I go home.

 &HT;    CLINTON PRAISES TROOPS FOR HURRICANE EFFORTS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (i) International categories
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras Visiting the troops who participated in
the largest military humanitarian mission since the Berlin Airlift
a half century ago, President Clinton praised them Tuesday for
their efforts in the wake of Hurricane Mitch last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech at Soto Cano Air Force Base, the home of the
Honduran Air Force Academy, Clinton recalled the massive military
operation that rescued thousands of people and began to rebuild the
infrastructure of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane killed more than 8,200 people in Central America.
Another 9,300 have been missing since the end of October and are
considered dead. The total of more than 17,000 deaths would equal
American losses during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that more than 47 million pounds of supplies moved
through Soto Cano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long runway, turned into a lifeline ... (and) restored
faith in the future that nearly washed away,'' he said.
</P>
<P>

between North and South America.''

   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras Visiting the troops who participated in
the largest military humanitarian mission since the Berlin Airlift
a half century ago, President Clinton praised them Tuesday for
their efforts in the wake of Hurricane Mitch last fall.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief speech at Soto Cano Air Force Base, the home of the
Honduran Air Force Academy, Clinton recalled the massive military
operation that rescued thousands of people and began to rebuild the
infrastructure of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane killed more than 8,200 people in Central America.
Another 9,300 have been missing since the end of October and are
considered dead. The total of more than 17,000 deaths would equal
American losses during the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton noted that more than 47 million pounds of supplies moved
through Soto Cano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This long runway, turned into a lifeline ... (and) restored
faith in the future that nearly washed away,'' he said.
</P>

   Later, Clinton visited a bridge linking two sides of

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The other shoe has dropped at the Whitney Museum of
American Art. Five months after a staff shake-up, the museum
recently announced that for the first time in its history, its
Biennial survey of American art, scheduled to open in March 2000,
would be organized by a team of six curators from outside the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   The restructured 2000 Biennial is the latest shot by Maxwell
Anderson, the classicist and former director of the Art Gallery of
Ontario, who has been shaking up the Whitney ever since he took
over as director in early September.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the restructuring reflects his vision of the museum or
is a rabbit being skillfully pulled from a hat just in time remains
to be seen. But questions hang in the air: Can it be done in the
allotted time? Will so many cooks make it bland and characterless?
Is it really a Whitney Biennial if it is farmed out? And how does
the farming out affect the staff, almost all of which must be
involved in the show's final stages?
</P>
<P>
   Since its start in the late 1960s the Biennial has traditionally
been a two-year project overseen by three or four Whitney curators
who visit dozens of studios nationwide to make their choices. From
beginning to end there are delicate negotiations with artists,
dealers and collectors, vast amounts of paperwork and untold
advance planning.
</P>
<P>
   After a high-speed, three-to-four-week installation period the
show fills the entire museum with works in every art medium.
Sometimes artists make works specially for the show, like a
sculpture by Charles Ray, a toy firetruck blown up to life size,
which was installed in front of the Whitney during the 1993
Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   This time the works will be selected by a committee of six art
professionals from six regions, most of whom work full time at
other institutions. They will meet a few times in person, then
communicate through conference calls and on a private Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever organizes the Biennial, it has always been a flawed,
partial and contested sampling of current American art as well as
the Whitney's most prominent identifying characteristic. Basically
a Biennial is almost always on view or being planned at the
Whitney, and this gives the museum a presence unlike any other in
American art. Each new incarnation raises hopes, lets them down and
says something about the state of American art and even more about
the Whitney: what it thinks of American art and is willing to
tolerate as art.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the Biennial has always been mutable, because it
has been constantly buffeted by criticism and changes in the art
landscape. In 1975, responding to perennial complaints that the
show was too New York-centric and market driven, the Whitney
curators selected only artists who lived outside New York or had
never had a solo gallery show in the city. During the tenure of
Anderson's predecessor, David Ross, the 1993, 1995 and 1997
Biennials were overseen by a single Whitney curator who usually
consulted with others at the museum but made the final choices,
resulting in an unusually distinct and personal series of
exhibitions that made no claim to objectivity.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on the new strategy, Anderson said the 2000
Biennial would take a ``fresh approach to the Whitney's signature
tradition'' and would have the benefit of a ``national
perspective.'' In a phone conversation last week, he declined to
say that this Biennial would set a precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am eager to see how this works out, but I'm not prepared to
say that it's part of a larger scheme,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of the 2000 Biennial had dangled in the wind since late
October when Thelma Golden, its organizer, resigned after Anderson
reorganized the staff.
</P>
<P>
   After she left, the show was to be organized by Lisa Phillips, a
veteran of many Biennials, but in December Ms. Phillips resigned to
become director of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.
Although she had been considering jobs outside the museum for some
time, many people inside and outside the Whitney hoped she would
provide continuity as Anderson acclimated himself to the New York
art world.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization, which assigned ``portfolios'' to curators by
medium or artistic period, was widely seen as a flashing exit sign
for Ms. Golden and Elizabeth Sussman, neither of whom received an
assignment.
</P>
<P>
   These two curators were closely associated with Ross and were
identified with the emphasis on political art in the first half of
his seven-year tenure. They were both criticized for exhibitions
that many considered too political, Ms. Golden for the 1994
exhibition ``Black Male: Representations of Masculinity in
Contemporary American Art,'' Ms. Sussman for the 1993 Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   Two other museum officials have resigned since Anderson took
over. Adam Weinberg, the senior curator, left in late October to
become director of the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover,
Mass. In November Constance Wolf, head of the education department,
was named director of the newly established Jewish Museum in San
Francisco. The result has been the biggest shake-up at a major New
York museum in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The buzz in art circles was multidimensional, including
conjecture about replacements for departed curators, possible job
hunting by other members of the Whitney staff, stress levels at the
museum, the advisability of the reorganization and whether there
were divisions on the board.
</P>
<P>
   Early reports that the show would be organized by an outside
panel began to circulate early last month. The question was, who
would be on it?
</P>
<P>
   Anderson admitted that several of his first choices turned him
down _ ``When you want something done, you go to busy people,'' he
said _ and that he had met only half the people who accepted. Even
so, with the announcement he may have regained some control of a
chaotic situation. He has organized a team that, in terms of
resumes and backgrounds, is diverse enough to conceivably put
together a decent Biennial.
</P>
<P>
   With members from California, Texas and Illinois, Anderson's
team represents nearly all regions of the United States, though it
pointedly skips New York City, or at least Manhattan. Ranging in
age from 36 to 56 and including three men and three women, the
panel meets what might be called today's standard of diversity.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The spectrum of professional experience is broad, ranging from
that of Hugh Davies, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art,
San Diego, La Jolla, who organized its current exhibition of
Francis Bacon's Papal portraits, to Valerie Cassel, who is director
of the visiting artist program at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago, where she has organized panels and one exhibition,
``Fierce Cravings: Deconstructing Black Sexuality in Film and
Video.''
</P>
<P>
   The other members are Lawrence Rinder, director of the Institute
for Exhibitions and Public Programs at the California College of
Arts and Crafts in San Francisco and Oakland; Andrea Miller-Keller,
who was until recently a curator of contemporary art at the
Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford, Conn.; Jane Farver, a former
director of exhibitions at the Queens (N.Y.) Museum of Art who has
just been appointed director of the List Visual Arts Center at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Michael Auping, chief
curator at the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this team will have enough time, knowledge and influence
necessary to put together a successful show remains a question; but
here, too, Anderson may be changing the mold. He said the group
would determine the selection process to be used in choosing works
for the Biennial over the next few weeks and that he hoped it would
be by consensus, not by voting.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and the group would meet in person ``at least a
couple of times'' and communicate with conference calls and on
their Web site, which will have images of art, artists'
biographies, a time line of the show's progress and a skeleton of
its catalog. The members of the team will travel in their regions
to the extent they need to.
</P>
<P>
   But selecting artists is not the same as planning a show, much
less getting it in place. This involves selecting specific works,
deciding which and how much space they will have and working
closely with the Whitney's support staff to determine how it will
all be engineered. To try this with people in different parts of
the country who have never worked with the Whitney staff or space,
or with one another, could be a recipe for disaster.
</P>
<P>
   Other problems remain. This format could result in a return to
the more anonymous, by-consensus Biennials of the 1970s and '80s,
when blandness tended to prevail because of horse-trading and deal
making.
</P>
<P>
   The ``national perspective'' notion seems old-fashioned. Whitney
curators have always traveled extensively and talked to local
curators and critics in selecting their shows, taking advantage of
a fairly well-organized curatorial network that already includes
some of the new team members.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 68 artists in the 1997 Biennial, 31 lived outside New
York, and both the 1997 and 1995 Biennials moved toward defining
Americanness in the broadest sense by including artists from Mexico
and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the 2000 Biennial that Ms. Golden had been working
on for nine months before she left the Whitney and whose list she
has said she was just beginning to solidify. Her Biennial would
have been another of the relatively personalized single-curator
exhibitions that Ross instigated, the fourth in a string of
Biennials that have had the distinction of being extremely
different from one another and more memorable than most of their
predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the Whitney was poised to make a bit of history.
When black curators in major museums can be counted on the fingers
of one hand, Ms. Golden was the first black person to be in charge
of a Biennial, which put the Whitney on the forefront of changes
that are occurring throughout the art world. (In October the first
non-European, a Nigerian curator and poet named Okwui Enwezor, was
announced as the artistic director for Documenta XI, to be held in
Kassel, Germany, in 2003.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Golden's Biennial stood a good chance of being more than
just a benchmark in the history of the art world's integration.
Whatever one thought of ``Black Male,'' it was Ms. Golden's first
major exhibition, organized when she was only 26. Her recent,
beautifully installed retrospective of the 1960s figurative painter
Bob Thompson suggested a maturing of her talent as a curator.
Regardless of the quality of the revised 2000 Biennial, it is a
loss that Ms. Golden's efforts will not come to fruition.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is that this Biennial will be in but not of the
Whitney. The Biennial has always represented the Whitney's
curatorial voice. Whether it was done by several curators or by one
or two, it was the work of someone identified with and committed to
the institution. Can it have the same meaning or impact when it is
organized by curators who have no long-term stake in the
institution?
</P>
<P>
   None of this may matter much in the long run except as an
instance of either the Whitney choosing the safer road or its new
director making the changes new directors often make, only faster.
The stopgap Biennial will come and go and probably make people just
as unhappy as Ms. Golden's exhibition would have, but to different
people and for different reasons. In the meantime Anderson finds
himself in the position of a new president with several Supreme
Court positions to fill. The Whitney is changing. For better or
worse remains to be seen.

KHMER ROUGE LEADER TO BE TRIED IN CAMBODIA, PROSECUTOR SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ The Khmer Rouge commander Ta Mok will be
charged under a 1994 law that bans membership in the brutal
communist group and may also face charges of genocide, a Cambodian
prosecutor said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor said that Ta Mok, 72, who is implicated in the
deaths of more than a million people from 1975 to 1979 when the
Khmer Rouge held power, has refused to answer questions until he is
provided a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested on Saturday and is the first Khmer Rouge leader
to face legal proceedings. Three other top figures have been
allowed to ``defect'' to the government since mid-1996 and have
been living freely in Cambodia along with scores of second-level
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Ta Mok intensify the debate over the status
of these other leaders, and Cambodian officials have made
contradictory statements this week over whether they, too, might
face charges and whether a trial might be held in Cambodia or in an
international court.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor, Gen. Sao Sok, said that Ta Mok would be tried in
Cambodia but that it was unclear whether he would be tried by a
civilian or a military court.
</P>
<P>
   A team of three international lawyers has recommended to the
United Nations that as many as 20 to 30 Khmer Rouge figures face
charges in an international court. Most prominent among them, along
with Ta Mok, are Ieng Sary, the former foreign minister who
surrendered in 1996, as well as Khieu Samphan, the former head of
state, and Nuon Chea, a top ideologue, who both surrendered in
December.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Hun Sen has appeared to leave his options open,
both supporting an international tribunal and warning of its
potentially destabilizing consequences.
</P>
<P>
   In televised remarks on Tuesday, he repeated an earlier
assertion that he had given the Khmer Rouge leaders who surrendered
no guarantees of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to reaffirm my point that I have not guaranteed anyone
exemption from responsibility before the law,'' he said. ``I could
not even provide guarantees to my children and my wife that they
are free from charges by the court.''
</P>
<P>
   The chief government spokesman, Khieu Kanharith, suggested on
Tuesday that the prosecution of Ta Mok could lead to charges
against his colleagues. ``This is like a Pandora's box,'' he said.
``Ta Mok could point to this man or that man. Many people could be
implicated.''
</P>
<P>
   But Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong took a different tack, saying
Ta Mok had been captured and was therefore vulnerable to charges,
whereas the other leaders had earned immunity by surrendering and
pledging allegiance to the government.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most foreign analysts argue that the Cambodian court system is
not capable of carrying out fair and procedurally sound trials of
this magnitude.
</P>
<P>
   In their report to the United Nations, the international lawyers
recommended an international court because of the primitive and
politically dependent nature of the Cambodian legal system.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, based in New
York, suggested that Cambodian officials should hold Ta Mok and
other Khmer Rouge leaders in custody while an international
tribunal is being set up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ta Mok will never receive a fair trial in a Cambodian court,
nor is a trial in Cambodia likely to bring out the full truth about
how the Khmer Rouge operated,'' he said. ``The lack of independence
and professionalism of the Cambodian courts is one of the primary
reasons an international tribunal is needed for the Khmer Rouge.''

PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE BAUER ASSAILS BUSH'S COMMENTS ON ABORTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Seeking to strengthen his beachhead on the
Republican right, prospective presidential contender Gary Bauer on
Tuesday criticized recent attempts by Gov. George W. Bush to
soft-pedal abortion as a key GOP issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our party should not simply have a `pro-life tenor' but a
clear commitment to the intrinsic value of every unborn child,''
Bauer, a leading conservative activist and former Reagan
administration official, said in a statement issued by his
presidential exploratory committee.
</P>
<P>
   In a subsequent interview, Bauer said he was responding to a
Bush speech Sunday and interview Monday in which the Texas governor
expressed both his opposition to abortion and reluctance to make
the issue central to a presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think it was extraordinary'' that at the press
conference ``he referred to legislation to end abortion as being
hypothetical,'' Bauer said. ``This is a 26-year debate in a party
that has been unambiguously in favor of such legislation in its
platform since 1976.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how you can be a `compassionate conservative' and
be confused about protecting unborn children,'' Bauer said from his
committee headquarters in Virginia's Washington suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer refused to assign any political motivation to his remarks,
saying, ``I feel strongly enough about it that I couldn't let the
(Bush) comments go uncommented on.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bauer supporters and other Republican analysts said Bush's
comments and Bauer's response could be useful in motivating voters
for whom opposition to abortion is a major reason for their
political involvement.
</P>
<P>
   That may be especially true in states that come early in the
nominating process, including Alaska, Louisiana, Iowa and New
Hampshire. Abortion opponents play a key role in Republican
politics in each of the four.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be the Republican nominee in 2000, you've got to be able to
make in an articulate way the case for the idea that all of our
children are, in fact, protected by the Constitution,'' Bauer said.
``That means being willing to appoint only pro-life judges, to have
an unambiguous pro-life running mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has steered clear of promising either.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has been joined in his refusal to emphasize abortion by
Elizabeth Hanford Dole, the former Republican Cabinet official who
in national polling shares the GOP lead with Bush. Dole, like Bush,
has sidestepped questions about a number of specific policy
positions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the front-runners have been ironically vague about
where they stand on a whole host of very important issues,'' Bauer
said. ``Maybe intentionally. Maybe that's why they're
front-runners, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   ``So any time we can get clarity, I'm certainly going to speak
up if I think that the party is going in a direction different than
the Reagan vision that was so successful for us,'' Bauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Bauer criticized the refusal of the last two Republican
presidential candidates _ Bush's father in 1992 and Dole's husband
in 1996 _ to run strong anti-abortion campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we have learned something from the last two
presidential elections, that we shrink the size of the (Republican)
tent when we seem confused about our pro-life position.''
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares a presidential campaign, the Texas governor has
been careful to include opponents and supporters of abortion
rights. Advocates of both positions were among the leaders of his
exploratory committee announced Sunday, but neither he or the
committee members spoke about abortion until it was raised by
reporters in questions.

FORMER GOV. ALEXANDER MAKES ANOTHER RUN FOR PRESIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ It was Lamar Alexander's turn in the
Republican presidential campaign spotlight Tuesday, but the
reflection of rival George W. Bush's effort could be seen _ or
heard _ anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, the former Tennessee governor and U.S. education
secretary in the White House administration of Bush's father,
formally announced his second try for the presidency with a call
for better schools and lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will be on the side of parents raising children,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who ran for the GOP nomination in 1996 and has been
aiming toward his latest candidacy ever since, took on criticism
that he is old news in the presidential sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people say I've been working awfully hard to prepare for
the job of president,'' he said. ``I can assure you, if I could
find an easier way, I'd do it. But among Republicans in modern
times, only General (Dwight) Eisenhower made it the first time he
tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush and former American Red Cross chief Elizabeth Hanford Dole,
the leading candidates for the GOP nomination in surveys of
Republican voters, will be taking their first shot at the White
House if they go through with plans to declare their candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   Dole is to announce her exploratory committee, a preliminary
step in which a candidate can raise money without formally
declaring, Wednesday in Des Moines, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a gray business suit, Alexander, 58, delivered his
speech to supporters in the State Capitol's Old Supreme Court
chamber. It was a marked departure from 1995, when he launched his
campaign in his hometown of Maryville, Tenn., in the foothills of
the Great Smoky Mountains, wearing his then-trademark red and black
lumberjack shirt and playing the bluegrass song ``Rocky Top'' on a
piano.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Alexander explained, he wanted to emphasize his
experience as a governor _ he served from 1979-1986 _ who helped
improve public schools and attracted foreign investment to the
state. Bush is expected to run by emphasizing his Texas record.
</P>
<P>
   And while Republican-elected officials from across the country
are flocking to Bush's campaign, Alexander's kick-off served as a
reminder that Bush has no monopoly on party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and Tennessee Gov. Don Sundquist
were on hand to express support for Alexander, along with
Alexander's national campaign chairman, former Iowa Gov. Terry
Branstad. The Iowa caucuses early next year will be one of the
first key votes of the nomination race.
</P>
<P>
   Branstad remarked that the winner will be a leader in tune with
the concerns of common people, ``not the person with the most
famous name,'' an apparent reference to the political history
behind the Bush and Dole names.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander has steadfastly criticized Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' theme as ``weasel words'' for shallow thinking. In
his kick-off speech, Alexander vowed to be the kind of candidate
``who knows from the first day in office exactly what they would
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, a former president of the University of Tennessee,
proposed to reduce government control of schools because ``teachers
and principals are suffering under court orders, union rules and
government regulations.'' He favors a national voucher-type program
that would give scholarship money for elementary school students to
attend the private or public school of their family's choice.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government should triple to personal income tax
deduction for each child, to $8,000, and abolish capital gains
taxes and estate taxes, Alexander said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the U.S. military needs strengthening to protect
the nation from terrorism, and that a new branch of the military
should be established to help stop the importation of illegal
drugs. He backed the deployment of a strategic missile defense
system.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when a strong economy and peace have buoyed President
Clinton's performance rating among voters, Alexander painted a dark
picture of the nation under Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, a
former Tennessee senator readying his own presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look behind their magic show and see what has really happened
in the last six years since they took over,'' Alexander said.
``Twelve more countries have jumped over us in high school
graduation rates, taxes are higher, the federal regulation book is
thicker, our national defense is weaker ... dictators thumb their
noses at us; we are more divided than ever by race; and our
standards of right and wrong have sunk to a new low.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, Alexander started his campaign for the 1996
nomination with a declaration that the nation had a ``trouble of
the spirit'' that could only be cured by dismantling federal
programs in favor of letting states make decisions on such issues
as Medicaid, job training and abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander placed third behind Bob Dole and Pat Buchanan in the
key 1996 Republican primary votes in Iowa and New Hampshire. His
campaign ran short of money and momentum afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Starting out in 1994, before Republicans captured the majority
in Congress, Alexander said the antidote for the
Democratic-controlled Congress was to ``cut their pay and send them
home.''
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, he did not advocate a curtailment of the GOP-led
Congress. Instead, he said public education can be improved if we
``send the Washington bureaucrats home, and send their money to the
states, the classrooms and especially to parents.''

FOR EUROPEAN ART WORLD, TWO BIG MILESTONES AND A BIENNALE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
 (bl)  
 By HOLLAND COTTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   In Europe, 1999 is a special year for some celebrated names in
art. Two revered old masters, Anthony van Dyck and Diego Velazquez,
are birthday boys (both born in 1599) and the marvelous textile
designer Anni Albers (1899-1994) is a birthday girl. Major parties
are being thrown for all three. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, French portraitist
extraordinaire, is the focus of a much anticipated traveling
exhibition. And the Venice Biennale, that idiosyncratic monument to
the now slightly dusty ideal of The New in contemporary art, will
sail into view in June.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's a lot more where all this comes from, of course. And
with cheap flights available these days, and seriously warm weather
on the way, a European art trip is just a matter of spare time,
sensible shoes and a shrewd itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will do well to begin a trip in London, and early birds
will enjoy special rewards, among them ``Portraits by Ingres: Image
of an Epoch'' at the National Gallery through April 25.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ingres' sitters were a virtual Who's Who of imperial France in
the Romantic era, from Napoleon I swathed in satin and ermine on
his throne, to the heart-throb handsome painter Francois-Marius
Granet. And his women, with their skimmed-milk skin and boneless
arms, are unforgettable. The portrait of the Vicomtesse
d'Haussonville, on first-time loan from the Frick Collection, is
included in the show, which will sweep on to the National Gallery
of Art in Washington and to the Metropolitan Museum.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of self-portraits, ``Rembrandt by Himself,'' will
take over at the National Gallery from June 9 to Sept. 5. Rembrandt
depicted himself in all moods and seasons, from a punch-drunk young
artist to an older man with a thing for funny hats and a face that
had seen too much. The material in the show may not be news, but
with loans from the Rijksmuseum and Rembrandthuis, no finer
gathering of its kind is likely to be found anywhere. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rembrandt, who collected Indian miniatures, would surely have
loved ``The Arts of the Sikh Kingdoms'' at the Victoria and Albert
Museum Museum (March 25 to July 25). The 19th-century Sikh
maharajas commissioned a wealth of album paintings, embroidered
silks and elaborately cut gems. No Manhattanite, after a glimpse at
these riches, will look at cabdrivers in turbans quite the same way
again. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two of London's biggest spring blockbusters have already played
this side of the Atlantic. The New York Museum of Modern Art's
Jackson Pollock retrospective is spinning its magic at the Tate
Gallery through June 6. And ``Monet in the 20th Century,'' which
broke box office records in Boston last fall, is at the Royal
Academy until April 18. Both reward repeat visits. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A greater lure for some Americans, though, will be hot new
British art, and ``Neurotic Realism: Part One'' at the Saatchi
Gallery provides a chance to see what some of the fuss is about.
The participants are young, extremely watchable, and on view
through March 28. Also worth a look at the Hayward Gallery through
April 11 is the painter Patrick Caulfield, whose tabletop still
lifes and interiors have something of the crisp, bright urbanity
one associates with his contemporary David Hockney.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Hockney himself appears at the Pompidou Center in Paris with a
show of landscapes through April 26, to be followed in June by
another outstanding colorist, Robert Delaunay. Perhaps more
interesting than either is a survey at the Jeu de Paume of the
Japanese avant-garde Gutai Group, which in the 1950s and '60s
generated intensely physical abstract paintings and Dada-inspired
happenings (May 4 to June 27).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paris is also the source of two very different shows of work
from northern Africa. An exhibition titled ``Egyptian Art in the
Age of the Pyramids'' at the Louvre (April 9 to July 12) will
center on spectacular sculpture from the Old Kingdom period, and
will come to the Met later. A historical survey of art from Morocco
is at the Musee des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris from April 14
to July 18. Encompassing objects from prehistoric times to the
present, it could be yet another neo-colonialist folly, but the
bulk of the loans are from Moroccan museums, so there are bound to
be treasures.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Paris visitors will be able to preview another
Met-bound show, ``Cezanne to Van Gogh: The Collection of Doctor
Gachet'' at the Grand Palais (through April 25). Paul-Ferdinand
Gachet (1828-1909) was a physician, an amateur painter and a friend
to leading artists of his day. More important, he was a patron with
ready cash and a superb eye. And although the authorship of some of
the work in his collection has been questioned, there are wonderful
things here.
</P>
<P>
   Royal patronage secured the career of the Flemish painter
Anthony van Dyck, who is being feted by his home city of Antwerp,
Belgium, on the 400th anniversary of his birth. Court artist to
Charles I of England, he both created a type of high society
power-portrait and turned out magnetic religious images. A painting
retrospective at the Koninklijk Museum voor Schone Kunsten in
Antwerp (May 15 to Aug. 15) will be supplemented by exhibitions of
his breathtaking drawings at the Rubenshuis and his prints at the
Museum Plantin-Moretus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Brussels is host to work by a latter-day virtuoso of the
celebrity icon in ``Andy Warhol: A Factory,'' at the Palais des
Beaux-Arts through Sept. 19. Organized by Germano Celant of the
Guggenheim Museum in New York, the show brings together some 700
items to document the prodigious industry of a figure who was, in
the American art world of the 1960's as today, a king of kings.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of kings, another painter-for-hire to the rich and
famous, Diego Velazquez, will be honored in Spain. The Prado in
Madrid has announced that it will open its new Velazquez galleries
this spring, though exactly when is a question. A show of
Velazquez's early work is promised for next fall in Seville, where
he was born, but again, dates have not been firmed up.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim Bilbao will be host to an exhibition of Richard
Serra's sculptures from April 27 to Oct. 17, while another branch
of the multinational museum, far to the north, the Deutsche
Guggenheim Berlin, has scheduled ``Amazons of the Avant-Garde: Six
Russian Artists'' from July 10 to Oct. 3. As the title suggests,
the artists are women _ Liubov Popova and Natalia Goncharova are
the most familiar names _ who worked in the aftermath of the
Revolution, forging an alliance between fine and applied art that
had lasting repercussions. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One artist who felt those repercussions was the Bauhaus weaver
Anni Albers, whose retrospective at the Peggy Guggenheim Collection
in Venice (March 24 to May 24) should be one of this season's quiet
beauties. Also in Venice, Claes Oldenburg and Coosje van Bruggen
will have the run of the Correr Museum and the Salone Napoleonico
from May 22 to Oct. 3 with 200 sculptures, some very large. And the
Venice Biennale opens on June 13 (through Nov. 7.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There's always an anticipatory buzz about who will mastermind
this extravaganza, though the choice is usually stunningly
predictable. The ubiquitous Swiss curator Harald Szeemann is at the
helm this year. The installation artist Ann Hamilton will represent
the United States; Germany has given this ambassadorial role to one
if its genuine leading lights, Rosemarie Trockel. Other curatorial
plans, at least at this writing, remain mysterious.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Which is fine. For art professionals, the Biennale, whether it
causes waves or barely stays afloat, is a place to be, no matter
what. For other American visitors to Europe, Venice itself is
probably the real attraction, and it is sure to look as venerable
and as birthday-fresh as ever this spring and summer.

TANUI, ROBA TO DEFEND BOSTON MARATHON TITLES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Two-time champions Moses Tanui of Kenya and Fatuma Roba
of Ethiopia will be on the starting line April 19 to defend their
Boston Marathon titles, according to the roster of elite athletes
for the 103d running announced Tuesday by race sponsor John
Hancock.
</P>
<P>
   So will 38-year-old Lynn Jennings, the 1992 Olympic bronze
medalist at 10,000 meters from Newmarket, N.H., who will be making
her long-awaited official marathon debut. The three-time World
Cross-Country champion unofficially ran Boston in 1978 when she was
17; had she been a year older and met the age minimum, her
approximate time of 2 hours 46 minutes would have been good for
third place.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings had planned to make her debut last year but, saying she
didn't feel ready, withdrew several weeks before the race.
</P>
<P>
   This time around she seems ready to make the step up in
distance, and has been comfortable enough to share her feelings and
training reports on the Runner's World Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The 33-year-old Tanui, who ran a personal best of 2:07:34 to win
last year, is perhaps best known for ending Cosmas Ndeti's
three-year winning streak in 1996 to go down in history as the
champion of the 100th anniversary race. Roba, meanwhile, will be
looking for her third consecutive Boston win since bursting onto
the international scene by taking the gold medal at the 1996
Olympics as a virtual unknown. If she succeeds, the 25-year-old
Roba will become only the second woman to win three straight since
they were officially allowed to enter in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   The first woman to do so, Uta Pippig, is currently suspended
from competition, pending a hearing by the German federation, for
failing a drug test last spring. Pippig is disputing the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Roba and Jennings, other women to watch include Colleen
de Reuck (personal best 2:26:35), a 35-year-old South African
living in Boulder, Colo., who finished third here in 1997 and
second last fall in Chicago; Catherine Ndereba, a 26-year-old from
Kenya making her marathon debut who last year was ranked the No. 1
road racer in the world by Runner's World; and Yuko Arimori
(2:28:01), who moved to Boulder in 1997 from Japan. Arimori, 32,
has raced little in the US, but is a two-time Olympic marathon
medalist, with a silver in 1992 and a bronze in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The elite men's field, not surprisingly, is dominated by Kenyans
but also features strong runners from South Africa, Mexico, Brazil,
Ethiopia, Ecuador, and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
   Tanui has the title, but many Kenyans would love to wrest it
from him, especially 1998 runner-up Joseph Chebet, reigning New
York champion John Kagwe, and Ondoro Osoro, who ran a 2:06:54 to
win Chicago last October. Osoro's time was the third-fastest of all
time and the fastest debut marathon in history.
</P>
<P>
   Chebet, who also was runner-up in New York last year, won the
first two marathons he entered _ Amsterdam in 1996 and Turin in
1997 _ and reportedly has been training all winter toward his goal
of winning Boston.
</P>
<P>
   That's a goal shared by Jackson Kabiga, who in 1998 became the
first Kenyan to win the Fukuoka Marathon, where he set his personal
best of 2:08:42.
</P>
<P>
   Other Kenyans include Kenneth Cheruiyot, who will be making his
marathon debut, road racing veteran Peter Githuka, 1997 Boston
runner-up Joseph Kamau, talented Sammy Korir (2:08:02), and
marathon newcomer Julius Ondieki.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil, as usual, will have strong representation with Vanderlei
Lima (2:08:31). Boston veteran Andres Espinosa, 36, who was second
here in 1994 when he ran his personal best of 2:07:19, would like
nothing more than to take a Boston win home to Mexico, as would
countryman German Silva, who has contended here the last two years
(sixth, fourth) and has won twice at New York.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomers to big-time marathoning include:
</P>
<P>
   --Ethiopian Ambesse Tolosa, 21, who trains in Japan, won at
Hokkaido last summer (2:10:13) and followed with a sixth at Fukuoka
(2:10:27).
</P>
<P>
   --Peruvians Jose Castillo (2:14:15 at London in 1997) and Miguel
Mallqui (2:11:36 at Chicago in '98).
</P>
<P>
   --South African Abner Chipu, who gave indications that he's
ready for a breakthrough with his performance as the pace-setter
for countryman Gert Thys's 2:06:33 in February's Tokyo Marathon _
the second-fastest marathon ever.
</P>
<P>
   --Franklin Tenorio of Ecuador, who ran a 2:10:22 in his debut
marathon in Rome last year, and whose sister, Martha, has been an
elite Boston runner in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the women's field:
</P>
<P>
   --Renata Paradowska, 28, of Poland, who ran a personal best of
2:27:17 here last year in only her second marathon to finish second
behind Roba.
</P>
<P>
   --Franca Fiacconi, 32, of Italy, a 2:25:17 marathoner who is the
defending New York champion.
</P>
<P>
   --Franziska Rochat-Moser, 32, of Switzerland, the 1997 New York
winner who has run 2:27:44.
</P>
<P>
   --Ludmila Petrova, 30, of Russia (2:30:26).
</P>
<P>
   --Christine McNamara, 33, of Boulder (2:28:18).
</P>
<P>
   --And two young runners from China: 20-year-old Sun Yingjie
(2:25:45) and 21-year-old Ai Dongmei (2:27:30).

<TEXT>
<P>
   For those seeking summer musical delight across the Atlantic,
there is always the danger that the musicians you heard all winter
will be on the plane with you.
</P>
<P>
   If that little bit of home in a foreign place is just the
comfort you are looking for, then by all means don't miss Jessye
Norman and Winton Marsalis in London, or Renee Fleming at the
Schleswig-Holstein Festival. If you couldn't get enough of Garrick
Ohlsson at New York's Lincoln Center this season, he will be at the
International Piano Festival of Roque d'Antheron in France in
mid-August, surrounded by a lot of the old gang: Radu Lupu, Helene
Grimaud, Stephen Hough, Jean Efflam Bavouzet, all of whom have made
recent passes through Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   If you are off to Europe for new and different experiences,
think about two festivals: the one at Aix-en-Provence in France and
the Salzburg Festival in Austria. At both, you will find
concentrated quality and innovation, as well as things less easily
come by at home.
</P>
<P>
   Salzburg offers new productions of Busoni's storied but little
seen ``Doktor Faustus'' with Thomas Hampson (American singers are
everywhere), Luciano Berio's new ``Cronaca del Luogo'' and from the
18th-century ``Les Boreades'' by Rameau. There will be a new ``Don
Giovanni'' and performances of Mussorgsky's ``Khovanshchina,''
Berg's ``Lulu'' and Berlioz's ``Damnation of Faust.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aix festival, with carefully prepared productions played in
delightful courtyard venues, brings new stagings of Monteverdi's
``Incoronazione di Poppea'' and ``Cena Furiosa,'' Offenbach's
``Belle Helene'' and Mozart's ``Magic Flute.''
</P>
<P>
   If you are looking for the isolated exotic event, how about the
Bolshoi Theater's production of ``The Oprichnik'' having its final
performances in Moscow on June 22 and 26? Soviet censors thought
that Tchaikovsky's opera about intrigue at the court of Ivan the
Terrible hit a little too close to home. For this reason, and a few
built-in ones, it has virtually disappeared during this century.
</P>
<P>
   Russianness is flooding Europe in waves. For most of May in
Royal Festival Hall in London, Vladimir Ashkenazy and the
Philharmonia Orchestra take a long look at Rachmaninoff in a
festival titled ``Rachmaninoff Hidden Perspectives.'' All the big
piano favorites will be heard, with Evgeny Kissin, Arcadi Volodos
and Mikhail Pletnev to play them, as will the much loved Second
Symphony. But the real idea is to put the beloved together with
less familiar pieces like the ``The Bells'' and the opera
``Francesca da Rimini.''
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are also invading, of all places, Italy. By the
time Florence's Maggio Musicale has had done with Tchaikovsky's
``Queen of Spades'' in April, the Spoleto Festival will be
preparing for its run of Prokofiev's opera ``War and Peace'' (the
original version) beginning June 25, with seven as yet unspecified
repeat performances to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Familiar Russian faces will present themselves at London's
Barbican Center: the St. Petersburg Philharmonic under Yuri
Temirkanov (June 9 and 11) followed in a few days by another
``Queen of Spades'' and Shostakovich's ``Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk,''
both with the ever-present Kirov Opera under the scarcely avoidable
Valery Gergiev.
</P>
<P>
   You will have to wait until September for the other major theme
event, when the Berliner Festwochen hopes to play every legitimate
note Mahler ever wrote. From Sept. 3 to 29, with only two days off,
the Berlin and Vienna Philharmonics, six other orchestras and
conductors, including Claudio Abbado and Simon Rattle, will cover
much ground and a lot of Weltschmerz. The finale on Sept. 29 is
``Das Lied von der Erde'' with the Berlin, Abbado, Ben Heppner and
Deborah Polaski.
</P>
<P>
   If you like your themes more metaphysical, think about
``Apokalypse,'' this year's title of the Vienna International
Festival, from May 7 until the middle of June. The mysterious
Biblical predictions of catastrophe and salvation will take musical
form in pieces like Franz Schmidt's ``Book of the Seven Seals,''
Schumann's ``Scenes From Goethe's `Faust','' Handel's ``Messiah,''
Haydn's ``Seven Last Words of Christ on the Cross'' and Messiaen's
``Quartet for the End of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   If this whets your appetite for mystery, wait until the middle
of August when the Lucerne Festival in Switzerland addresses the
subject of myths and mythology in music. From Aug. 14 to Sept. 11,
the legends of Faust, ``The Rite of Spring'' and ``Pelleas et
Melisande'' will be considered, as will Othmar Schoeck's opera
``Penthesilea.'' Resident mystics will be two composers from the
East: Frangis Ali-sade, of Azerbaijan, and Giya Kancheli, of
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps you are going to European music festivals for the places
as much as for the music, and so a few familiar faces won't be
bothersome. Indeed, you may have missed Thomas Ades' ``Powder Her
Face'' in Brooklyn or Wolfgang Holzmaier at Alice Tully Hall, or
Alfred Brendel playing the piano and reading his own poetry at
Carnegie Hall; if so, they will all be at Britain's Aldeburgh
Festival June 11-27, with varied events spread around this amiable
seaside town. Fresher for the ears will be Aldeburgh's featured
composer, Per Norgard, as well as a close look at Conlon Nancaroow.
</P>
<P>
   Another target for the sybarite is the Glyndebourne Festival
Opera with its customary intermission pleasures: alfresco picnics
among the sheep, dressed-up audiences and the occasional pretension
(candelabra and butlers).
</P>
<P>
   But Glyndebourne is, as always, serious business, with new
productions of Debussy's ``Pelleas et Melisande'' and Smetana's
``Bartered Bride.'' They will join such revivals as Handel's
``Rodelinda'' and the new Jonathan Dove piece ``Flight.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if you want to sit in one place and see lots of
different operas, think about Munich, where in July you can witness
more than a dozen works from the standard repertory, in performance
just about every night of the month. That's easy on the travel
budget, but oh, those hotel bills! Maybe you can stay with a
friend.

KUBRICK'S FINAL FILM GENERATES JUICY RUMORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stanley Kubrick was putting the finishing touches on his last
film, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' when he died of a heart attack in his
home in Hertfordshire, England, last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The 70-year-old filmmaker, whose penchant for secrecy was
extreme, made his cast and crew swear not to reveal anything about
the film, which is scheduled to be released by Warner Bros. on July
16.
</P>
<P>
   According to a statement from the film's stars, Tom Cruise and
Nicole Kidman, the film is complete except for ``final looping and
mixing.'' That means the movie had passed final edit and the only
tasks remaining were for the actors to dub in a few lines that did
not meet Kubrick's precise specifications and for the soundtrack to
be tweaked.
</P>
<P>
   The film has been screened for two Warner executives, co-CEOs
Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel. ``It is a fantastic and a fitting
close to a tremendous career,'' they said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   What's certain is that the story of a Viennese doctor (Cruise)
and his wife (Kidman), who play out sexual fantasies, will be one
of Kubrick's most controversial. An overexcited Harvey Keitel was
allegedly released from the film because a sexual scene with Kidman
got out of control. He was replaced by actor-director Sydney
Pollack.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a story going around that a trailer for ``Eyes Wide
Shut'' features Kidman's bare breasts and Cruise's bare bottom.
</P>
<P>
   A rumor noted in the British press holds that there are scenes
in which Cruise's character plays a transvestite. According to The
Daily Telegraph, Kidman let slip that Kubrick dealt with her and
Cruise separately. ``When you see the film, you will see why,'' she
reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
   The sexual themes have already caused some ripples at Warner
Bros., where executives are concerned that the film might receive
the dreaded NC-17 rating. Some newspapers refuse to take
advertisements for the rating, and many suburban theaters refuse to
show them. However, no matter what the rating, Warner Bros. is
contractually bound not to alter Kubrick's final cut.

EUROPEAN DANCE'S DIGITAL SUMMER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
 (bl)  
 By JENNIFER DUNNING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the happiest species of tourists traveling through Europe
this summer is likely to be the dance aficionado with an interest
in technology and how it enhances or changes the art. Technology
and dance _ an increasingly popular topic in the United States _
will be examined in festivals in Denmark and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A technological dance tour of Europe should probably start in
Barcelona with ``Merce Cunningham: 50 Years,'' an exhibition with
material on Cunningham's computer and video ``motion capture''
experimentation with Paul Kaiser and Shelley Eshkar. The show will
be at the exquisitely beautiful air-and-light-filled museum
Fundacio Antoni Tapies through April 4, before moving to Portugal
and the Fundacao de Serralves in Porto (Sept. 10 to Nov. 7).
</P>
<P>
   A next stop for dance techies might be Aarhus in Denmark, where
the biennial Dansedage International Dance Festival (May 20 to June
6) will feature performances created or enhanced by digital
technology, and workshops and seminars. Festival companies include
Le Corps Indice from Canada, Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker's troupe
from Belgium, and England's DV8, with the Kaiser-Eshkar video
installation ``Ghostcatching.'' And in Berlin, the international
Korper-tecnik festival (June 4 to July 4) will examine ``the
context of the body in digital times.''
</P>
<P>
   England wins the honors this summer for the most varied dance
menu. The Brighton Festival (May 1 to 23) features new work by
Siobhan Davies, a ``dance on camera'' minifestival and a dance that
unfolds in a landscape of charred wood and melting ice at locations
throughout this seaside city.
</P>
<P>
   The Royal Ballet will present four programs at the historic
Sadler's Wells Theater in London (July 6 to 31), featuring
``Giselle,'' Frederick Ashton's ``Ondine'' and two mixed bills of
mostly recent English choreography.
</P>
<P>
   The Edinburgh Festival (Aug. 15 to Sept. 4) offers Meg Stuart,
the American modern-dance choreographer, and her Damaged Goods
company and the Cullberg Ballet of Sweden in Mats Ek's versions of
``Giselle'' and ``The Sleeping Beauty.''
</P>
<P>
   For folk-dance enthusiasts, morris dancing is in this summer,
with chances to see and do it at festivals in East Sussex,
Scarborough, North Yorkshire, and Swanage, Dorset. In London in
June and July, the City of London Festival and the Docklands
International Festival offer opportunities to see performances at
historic sites, like the Tower of London.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most intriguing festivals promises to be Springdance
99 in Utrecht, the Netherlands (April 13 to 25), which celebrates
both Vaslav Nijinsky's 1913 ballet ``Le Sacre de Printemps'' and
the seminal Judson Church postmodernist dance movement of the 1960s
in New York City. Lisbon's Companhia Nacional de Bailado will
perform the reconstructed Nijinsky ballet, in conjunction with
``Sacred Solos,'' new commissioned works responding to the ballet.
The French Quatuor Knust will present historic Judson projects by
Yvonne Rainer and Steve Paxton. There also will be performances by
the company of Trisha Brown and 18 other groups and soloists.
</P>
<P>
   Several of the summer's most important modern-dance festivals
are in France, at Avignon (July 9 to 31), the Theatre de la Ville
in Paris (through June 26) and in Montpellier. The Montpellier
International Dance Festival (June 25 to July 10) includes
performances indoors and out. Ms. De Keersmaeker is on the bill,
along with Philippe Decoufle, Jose Montalvo, a number of pieces
that incorporate film and video, and an independent dance film
series.
</P>
<P>
   This year's Kuopio Dance Festival (June 30 to July 6) in Kuopio,
Finland, in its 30th year, will feature the Deutsche Oper am Rhein,
Ricardo Franco's Flamenco!!! and Robert North's Fabula Saltica
troupe, as well as Baroque dance and companies from Italy, Israel
and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, summer dance events in the yearlong celebration of
Weimar as the European City of Culture for 1999 include
performances by the Tokyo Ballet (April 3 to 5 and 8 to 10) the
Compania Nacional des Danza, Madrid (April 13, 14, 15, 28 and 29),
and the Bejart Ballet Lausanne (May 14 to 16 and 18 to 20).
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, because of dwindling government support, this may be the
last year for the ambitious, thought-provoking Hammoniale Festival
of Women (June 16 to July 3) in Hamburg. Among the 300 participants
from 25 countries, in all the arts, will be Ea Sola, the
French-Vietnamese choreographer, and the iconic Chandrilekha, from
India.
</P>
<P>
   The honors for the prettiest settings go to festivals in Spain
and Portugal. At the Festival Internacional de Musica y Danza de
Granada 1999 (June 18 to July 4), ballet and modern dance will be
performed outdoors in the gardens of the Alhambra in Granada,
Spain. In Barcelona, the ballet and modern dance attractions at the
Grec 99 festival (June 28 to mid-August) take place primarily
outdoors in the Teatro Grec, and the vast, handsome Mercat des
Flors, a converted flower market. The program includes Catalan
modern dance companies and Alexandre Petrov's Kremlin Ballet
performing ``Tom Sawyer'' and ``Napoleon Bonaparte.''
</P>
<P>
   Romantic dance in a romantic setting can be found in Seteais,
Portugal, at the Noites de Bailado (July 23 to Aug. 29) in the
gardens of the Seteais Hotel-Palace, with performances by the
Scottish Ballet, Danza Contemporanea de Cuba. Ballet de Toscana,
Pennsylvania Ballet and the Hermitage Ballet of Russia.
</P>
<P>
   For those intent on seeing classical ballet or familiar modern
dance in a proscenium theater, a stop at the Royal Theater in
Copenhagen may be in order. The Royal Danish Ballet will be
performing works by Mats Ek, the Swedish modernist, and by Serge
Lifar in April and May. The Tokyo Ballet will offer Maurice
Bejart's reworkings of three Diaghilev classics in early June,
moving on to La Scala in Milan and the Deutsche Oper in Berlin. The
new Peter Schaufuss Ballet Company will perform in Aarhus, Denmark
(Sept. 1 to 3).
</P>
<P>
   In Portugal, the always-exciting Ballet Nacional de Cuba will
perform ``Swan Lake'' at the Coliseu dos Recreios in Lisbon in late
April and early May, followed in late May by the Opera Ballet of
Novosibirsk in ``Giselle.''
</P>
<P>
   The Holland Festival (July 5 to 26) and the Julidans festival
(July 5 to 18), both in Amsterdam, will give modern dance fans a
chance to see what European and Canadian modern-dance
choreographers are up to. There is also the Aarhus Festival in
Denmark (Aug. 27 to Sept. 5), this summer focusing on dance from
central and eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Those who love to dance as well as watch will find a wide range
of folk festivals in theaters, on outdoor stages and in the
streets. Who could resist the Festival Interceltique de Lorient in
the Breton harbor town of Lorient in France (Aug. 6 to 15), for
example, with its Grand Parade of the Celtic Nations and Gathering
of the Flute and Bombarde musicians? Or the exotic-sounding
Jutajaiset International Folklore Festival of Nightless Nights
(June 16 to 20) in Rovaniemi, Finnish Lapland, near the Arctic
Circle.
</P>
<P>
   Sweden will be home to some of the liveliest folk events, among
them the Halsinge Hambo festival (opening July 10) in County
Halsingland, where couples will dance the hambo over 12 hours along
a country road. The Stockholm Water Festival (Aug. 6 to 14) boasts
salsa and African dancing in the city's Palace of Mirrors, and even
a nostalgia disco. There also will be medieval and folk-dancing in
the streets, squares and a 1911 dance hall in the Gotlands
Folkdansfestival (Aug. 15 to 18) on the island of Gotland.
</P>
<P>
   And the teen-agers in the family? Drop them off at the
Hultsfredfestival 1999 (June 17-19) in Hultsfred, where there will
be dancing by disco acts and audiences on seven stages, to the
music of such bands as the Scratch Perverts.

SOCIAL SECURITY NEGOTIATIONS CONCERN TRADITIONAL DEMOCRATIC
CONSTITUENCY 
</HEADLINE>
 (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gearing up for a major battle to preserve Social
Security's guaranteed benefits, organized labor's ostensible
targets are the Republicans in Congress who support reshaping the
retirement system to include private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   But the unions, joined by an array of women's groups, civil
rights organizations and other liberal advocacy groups, are just as
worried about being sold out by the Clinton administration in the
name of bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
   So even though the administration has so far lined up against
making private accounts part of Social Security, the politically
powerful constituency groups on the Democratic Party's left wing
are sending a not-so-subtle message to the White House and Vice
President Al Gore: We saved your bacon by getting out the vote for
you in the 1998 midterm congressional elections, and if you cross
us now on Social Security, it will cost you in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not only do we not want Bill Clinton's legacy to be a bad deal
on Social Security, but excessive eagerness to create that legacy
could hurt Al Gore in the elections in terms of people's
willingness to work for and support him,'' said Roger Hickey,
co-director of the Institute for America's Future, a liberal
advocacy group that helped create a coalition fighting Social
Security privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is the potential for a wrong turn by the
administration,'' Hickey said. ``There is the potential for a
compromise that would undercut the Social Security system.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged that they are in a
balancing act, trying not to alienate their core supporters within
the party but leaving open the door to a bipartisan compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Advisers to both Clinton and Gore said they have learned over
the past six years that accomplishment, even bipartisan
accomplishment, is the best basis for political success. But any
deal this year, Democratic strategists suggested, would almost
certainly require Republicans to give up on establishing private
accounts within Social Security, perhaps in return for the
president agreeing to substantial tax cuts. The burgeoning federal
budget surplus, they said, could provide room to give both sides
enough of what they want to make a deal possible.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, unions and other liberal groups have little concrete
to complain about so far. The proposal Clinton made on Social
Security in his State of the Union address in January matched
almost precisely what labor had been advocating.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton proposed to keep the guaranteed retirement benefit
intact, to address the retirement system's looming financial
problems largely through use of projected budget surpluses, and to
give low- and moderate-income workers incentives to save and invest
through a new class of accounts independent of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   The private accounts advocated by Republicans would come out of
the payroll tax workers and employers pay to finance Social
Security and would in most cases involve a reduction in the
guaranteed retirement benefit provided by the system. The accounts
proposed by Clinton would not touch the payroll tax or alter Social
Security benefits. Instead, they would provide workers an incentive
to save through tax credits and possibly government grants.
</P>
<P>
   Liberals and unions in particular remain concerned that even
Clinton's approach to assuring Social Security's long-term solvency
might ultimately require steps that they vehemently oppose,
including raising the retirement age and reducing cost of living
adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   But the major problem, as many liberals see it, is Clinton's
flexible principles on social issues. Although liberals rallied to
Clinton's side at critical moments in his political and personal
travails over the last year, the president's wanderings across the
ideological spectrum on welfare, health care and the budget have
left them worried that he will sell them out if it is to his
political advantage.
</P>
<P>
   The suspicion burst into the open last week in Congress, when
Rep. Robert Matsui, D-Calif., who is his party's point man on the
issue in the House, worried aloud at a hearing that the
administration could reverse course on Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to Lawrence Summers, the deputy Treasury secretary,
Matsui said that his support for the administration's efforts on
the issue had to be tempered ``lest you pull the rug out from under
me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But the success of liberal groups in helping turn last fall's
congressional elections into a victory for Democrats _ and Gore's
need for their all-out support next year _ has given unions, black
groups, women's organizations and other left-leaning constituencies
what they regard as new leverage with the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the president announced his plan on Social Security, we
were very pleased,'' said Gerald McEntee, the president of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The
president's decision to begin negotiating over Social Security was
partly ``a reaction to the political dynamics of the midterm
election,'' McEntee said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now the question is where we go from here, how much
negotiation takes place,'' McEntee said. ``We would have high hopes
that in the internal debates, Vice President Gore would be standing
for us on this issue. But if there's eventually a Social Security
or Medicare plan that's no good, certainly it would have an effect
in terms of being able to draw out your people for an election.''
</P>
<P>
   His members are already paying close attention. A member of his
Indianapolis local, Shane Brinkman, spent several days last week at
a union seminar near here on what the debate over Social Security
means for labor. Afterward, Brinkman was eager to get back home to
make the case against overhauling the retirement system to include
individual investment accounts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in this information age with e-mail and alphanumeric
pagers and cell phones, but there's nothing better than having
someone in your union, in your shop, give you the facts,'' said
Brinkman, a member of the Indianapolis local of the American
Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ``It's
old-time grass roots politics.''

PEGGY CASS, 74; COMIC TV ACTRESS; WON TONY FOR `MAME'

<P>
   Peggy Cass, a comic actress who appeared in many movies and
Broadway shows, died Monday in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in
New York City. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cass appeared in dozens of films and stage productions, but
is perhaps best known for her role as Agnes Gooch, the secretary in
the stage show ``Mame'' and its movie adaptation ``Auntie Mame.''
She won a Tony Award for the role and was nominated for an Academy
Award.
</P>
<P>
   She was an honest, candid, and witty woman once described in the
Globe as an ``incessant chatterbox'' who ``oozes razzmatazz.'' Her
exuberance made her a natural for TV. She was a panelist on ``To
Tell the Truth'' and was Jack Paar's sidekick on his late-night TV
show.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cass was born in Somerville, Mass. and spent her childhood
and teenage years in nearby Cambridge, where she graduated from
Cambridge Latin School. ``I was in the drama club but they wouldn't
let me act,'' she said in a story published in the Globe on Dec.
26, 1972.
</P>

   She said she always considered herself a Bostonian. ``My roots
are in Boston,'' she said. ``I had my teeth straightened in Boston.
I had my appendix taken out in Boston. What memories.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, she moved to New York City,
where she made the rounds of casting calls with no luck.
Eventually, a press agent friend arranged a date with Clark Gable.
She recited poetry, sang, and danced for him. He told her she was
such a ham, she'd definitely make it. Paar heard about the unlikely
twosome and invited her to talk about the experience on TV. ``I was
so nervous, Paar couldn't shut me up,'' she said in another story
published in the Globe on Sept. 29, 1970. ``I've been talking ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   She got her start in a USO troupe, playing a Russian sniper in
``The Doughgirls'' on a tour of Australia. She made her Broadway
debut in ``Bernadine.'' She also appeared in ``The Front Page,''
``Plaza Suite'' and ``If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Belgium.''
</P>
<P>
   Her one TV series, ``The Hathaways,'' in which she co-starred
with Jack Weston and three chimpanzees, lasted only the 1961-62
season.
</P>
<P>
   Her gravelly voice became her signature. ``Now, I'm sensitive
about that gravel voice of mine,'' she said in 1973. ``Once, while
I was making a picture, clad in slacks, a man jostled me slightly
and said: `Excuse me miss _ or is it mister?' I told him, `You'll
never know!' ''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, Eugene Feeney of New York City.

RJR NABISCO STORY FASCINATES BUSINESS HISTORIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also RJR-NABISCO-BREAKUP, RJR-NABISCO-TERMS,

(mk) 
 By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tuesday's move by RJR Nabisco Holdings Corp. to break up and
spin off its tobacco business is a non-event for consumers. Oreo
cookies, Life Savers candies and Planters peanuts will continue to
roll off Nabisco's production lines and Camel and Winston
cigarettes will come out of the R.J. Reynolds tobacco factories.
</P>
<P>
   But the news is fascinating for Wall Street and business
historians.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco was born in 1985 when R.J. Reynolds Industries
bought Nabisco Brands Inc. for $4.9 billion, one of many giant
diversification moves by American companies in the 1970s and 1980s
that have failed to reward shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as the undoing of another dumb merger,'' said
Thomas Lys, a merger and acquisitions specialist at Northwestern
University's Kellogg School of Management.
</P>
<P>
   But RJR's story included an unusual response to Wall Street's
distaste for the Nabisco merger. RJR followed the lead of hundreds
of smaller companies that had been put in private hands during the
1980s by groups of financiers and insiders who borrowed vast sums
of money to buy out shareholders of publicly traded enterprises.
The leveraged buyout strategy hinged on selling pieces of the
company to reduce the debt piled up in buying it, rapidly
streamlining the rest and then selling shares back to the public at
prices that produced huge profits for the buyout investors.
</P>
<P>
   By October 1988, when F. Ross Johnson, RJR's brash and
high-living chairman and chief executive, joined with investment
bankers from Shearson Lehman Hutton to propose a $75-a-share
buyout, the leverage strategy was already controversial for its
disruptive effect on employees. The ensuing soap opera of greed and
clashing egos, recapped in the best-selling ``Barbarians at the
Gate,'' ended in a $109-a-share, $25 billion buyout organized by
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   It also left Johnson's successors saddled with nearly $19
billion in debt, most of it junk bonds paying punishing interest
rates. It is not clear whether RJR could have dug out from such
burdens and prospered if everything had gone perfectly in the
decade that followed, but it did not.
</P>
<P>
   The 1990s were marred by marketing missteps, including goading
Philip Morris into a cigarette price war, management strife and
recessions in key overseas markets. The company's financial
straitjacket and limited strategic options made it impossible to
hang on to high profile executives like Louis Gerstner Jr. and
Charles Harper, whom Kohlberg Kravis had recruited to lead the
turnaround. And hanging over everything was increasingly expensive
and uncertain tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   When Steven Goldstone became chairman and chief executive in
1996, he said the company was in better shape than other companies
with shares trading at such a low multiple to earnings, but that he
still had ``to demonstrate we're through punishing shareholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's change in course was a final concession that RJR never
quite managed to do that and was unlikely to in its present form,
inherited from the 1980s.

CLINTON OFFERS LITTLE IN AID TO HONDURAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ President Bill Clinton offered messages
of encouragement Tuesday to exhausted Hondurans, who last fall
watched four days of torrential rain wash away decades of economic
and social progress.
</P>
<P>
   ``This disaster has taught us that what happens to one in the
Americas affects us all,'' Clinton told an audience of Hondurans
and American troops gathered in an aircraft hangar. Speaking at the
Enrique Soto Cano Air Force Base on the second day of a four-day
Central America trip, he thanked the US soldiers for their efforts
in helping the Hondurans rebuild, and added in Spanish, ``We are
all Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton did not have much new aid to offer Honduras, the
country most severely hit by Hurricane Mitch. He announced a $56
million expansion of a two-week training program for military
disaster relief and repeated his support of a $956 million
emergency aid package that has stalled as Congress debates how to
finance the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the president's visit carried great symbolic meaning for
the poverty-stricken residents of this country of six million, who
have long considered themselves neglected friends of their North
American ally. Clinton's visit to Honduras was the first since
Ronald Reagan made a brief stop in the northern city of San Pedro
Sula in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having (Clinton) here gives us a message of hope for the
future,'' said Juan Ventura, mayor of Santa Ana, a farming town of
13,000 residents in the central state of La Paz. ``We're optimists,
but we're poor people, and we've been through a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's first stop was at the Soto Cano base, which the United
States built in 1982 and which served as a key training ground for
US-backed rebels against the leftist Nicaraguan government in the
late 1980s. Today, the base houses the Honduran Air Force and is
home to about 500 US troops conducting disaster relief and
anti-narcotics operations.
</P>
<P>
   Honduran President Carlos Flores thanked Clinton for including a
visit to Central America as one of his legacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You come here not when our tears are fresh,'' Flores said,
``but in our new stage of rehabilitation and reconstruction that we
have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the four countries hit hard by Mitch in October, Honduras
suffered the greatest human and structural losses. Six thousand
people died in floods and mudslides and from storm-related disease,
and another 9,000 are still unaccounted for, according to
government figures. Two million people were left homeless.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of moving north through the Caribbean Sea toward Mexico
in late October, as most forecasters had predicted, Mitch stalled
over Central America, pounding the region with as much as 7 feet of
heavy rain. In Honduras, which suffered an estimated $3.4 billion
in storm damage, scores of rivers overflowed, destroying 170
bridges and 70 percent of the roads.
</P>
<P>
   Honduras had received more than $230 million in US aid as of
March 1, and thousands of its nationals who immigrated illegally
into the United States have been temporarily exempted from
deportation to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed his gratitude to the US soldiers who assisted
in the relief operations by transporting supplies, rescuing
stranded victims and rebuilding bridges and roads. He called the
effort one of the largest humanitarian missions by the US military
since the Berlin Airlift 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The president did not address other issues that Central American
leaders call crucial to the region's interests, especially
immigration policy, debt relief, and greater economic trade with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane crippled Honduras's already delicate economy,
based largely on agricultural products such as coffee, beans and
bananas. Because of weak harvests for coffee and other products,
some towns report unemployment rates as high as 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many people give up, and they move to the cities or they try
to get all the way into the United States,'' said Juan Capistran
Benitez, mayor of the central village of Cabanas. ``Sometimes I
don't blame them.''

 &HT;    BellSouth ready to ride the tide of Latin American economics
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The economic winds might be starting to whip Latin
America, but BellSouth plans to ride out the storm.
</P>
<P>
   The company is staying the course, even as the nine nations
where it has multi-billion dollar investments in wireless networks
are buffeted by the global currency turbulence that started in Asia
a year ago. Latin America has come to be increasingly important for
BellSouth. The bet is that the region might suffer a bit now, but
will bounce back quickly with a payoff to those who have gambled on
it. In the meantime, BellSouth's biggest bet is on Brazil, the
hardest hit of all the region's economies _ and the largest.
</P>
<P>
   The company and analysts see international as one-third of
BellSouth's growth strategy, sharing the long-term load with
domestic wireless and local service in the nine southeastern
states. Local service still accounts for the vast majority of
BellSouth revenues, but the pendulum has slowly begun to swing
toward wireless and international. Yet in 1998, BellSouth's
expansion in Latin America seemed somewhat stymied. Once expected
to extend its reach throughout the region, BellSouth for months
hunkered down in the properties it had already purchased, spread
thin in the effort to build out those networks.
</P>
<P>
   During auctions of licenses last year in Brazil, BellSouth's bid
but was conservative enough to come away without a single win. By
the same token, BellSouth has shown no signs of retreat. And as
this year began, officials reaffirmed their interest in expansion.
Last week, BellSouth picked up another wireless license, paying $90
million for the right to offer service across Chile. The company,
which already serves the Chilean capital of Santiago, then
announced plans to invest $100 million to improve its wireless
phone system throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Roddy, chief telecom economist for Deloitte &AMP; Touche, said
global companies should look at their investments as a
``portfolio.'' Like managers of mutual funds, global investors
should make sure not to get caught with one kind of holding. If I
am only in the United States and Latin America, I want some
positioning in Western Europe and in Asia Pacific. I want to be
counterbalancing the risks. Almost like the mentality of having a
ski shop and a swimsuit store.''
</P>
<P>
   Performance of the emerging economies is uncertain. ``Over the
next 10 years, more economic growth will occur outside the United
States and Western Europe and the need for telecommunications
services is huge,'' Roddy said.

 &HT;    BellSouth sells rights to run its cellular towers
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth has agreed to sell most of the rights
governing 1,850 of its cellular telephone towers for $610 million
in cash and stock to a Houston company, the companies announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Castle International, which rents tower usage to cellular
companies, will then lease tower space back to the Atlanta-based
telephone giant for $1,200 a month per tower.
</P>
<P>
   In this deal, though, BellSouth retains actual ownership of the
towers. That's because the company wants to keep a back door
guarantee that the towers, essential to its wireless telephone
service, never go out of service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tower industry is young, and there is some consolidation
going on,'' said BellSouth spokesman Jeff Battcher ``We don't
anticipate getting the towers back except in case of something such
as a bankruptcy.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Crown Castle the right to manage and maintain
BellSouth's towers, which are in every Southeastern state and
Indiana. The number of towers Crown Castle is buying represents a
``sizable chunk'' of BellSouth's wireless tower system, said
Battcher.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Castle also has the right to expand BellSouth's wireless
system, building up to 500 additional towers over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies described Tuesday's deal as a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It releases us from the burden of having to be in the tower
business,'' said Battcher.
</P>
<P>
   In metro Atlanta, it has become increasing difficult to build or
place towers. Suitable sites are either too expensive or
unavailable. In addition, a growing number of residents object to
having the towers as neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   As for Crown Castle, it can resell the space BellSouth isn't
using on the 1,850 towers to other wireless communications
providers. Those providers include AT&AMP;T, Sprint PCS and Nextel
Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's deal grew out of an earlier agreement between Crown
Castle and BellSouth, said Battcher. He explained that, in a test
run, BellSouth sold the management rights of its tower system in
Kentucky to Crown Castle last year.

ROYAL AHOLD BUYING PATHMARK STORES OF NEW JERSEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Continuing rapid consolidation in the $436 billion US grocery
industry, the Dutch parent of Stop &AMP; Shop Cos. said Tuesday it
plans to cement its position as the largest grocer on the East
Coast by purchasing Pathmark Stores Inc. of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Royal Ahold NV said it will pay $1.74 billion, including $1.5
billion in debt, for Pathmark, whose 132 stores had estimated 1998
sales of $3.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Stop &AMP; Shop, which serves southern New England, Ahold
operates chains in New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Northern
Virginia, and the Carolinas.
</P>
<P>
   Adding Pathmark will beef up Ahold's presence in New Jersey and
in the New York City and Long Island markets, said Bob Tobin, chief
executive of Ahold's US operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ahold owns the East Coast,'' said Paul Weitzel, director of
Willard Bishop Consulting, an Illinois firm that advises the
supermarket industry.
</P>
<P>
   If the deal is approved by government regulators, Ahold would
integrate its existing Edwards chain of 67 stores into Pathmark.
</P>
<P>
   The Edwards nameplate, which was once well known in
Massachusetts and Connecticut, would disappear from the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Pathmark once operated stores in Connecticut but retrenched in
New Jersey after a leveraged buyout left it heavily in debt.
</P>
<P>
   Given rapid industry consolidation, the acquisition of Carteret,
N.J.-based Pathmark ``really didn't surprise anyone,'' said Craig
Faucher, editor of Griffin Update, a Rockland newsletter that
follows the food industry.
</P>
<P>
   A look at a supermarket's balance sheet helps explain why the
giants are snapping up smaller players at a rapid pace.
</P>
<P>
   As a percentage of revenues, supermarkets tend to have miniscule
profits _ about 1 to 2 percent on average.
</P>
<P>
   With such narrow margins, supermarket chains need size to hold
down distribution costs and increase their buying power as Wal-Mart
Stores Inc., a $139 billion behemoth, looks to take a greater share
of the US consumer's food dollar away from them.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart seems to have spurred consolidation. Recent deals
include Ohio-based Kroger Co.'s merger with Fred Meyer Inc.;
Idaho-based Albertson's plan to combine with American Stores Co. of
Utah; and Ahold's purchase of Giant of Landover, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Giant along with the purchase of Pathmark
could boost Ahold's annual US revenues from about $16 billion to
$25 billion; that amount could still leave Ahold behind Kroger,
Albertson's, Wal-Mart, and Safeway Inc. in US food sales.
</P>
<P>
   These giants are likely to only get bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strong regional players are being gobbled up by the big
conglomerates,'' said consultant Weitzel. ``In two or three years,
there won't be any left.''

<P>
   Peggy Cass, a comic actress who appeared in many movies and
Broadway shows, died Monday in Memorial Sloan Kettering Hospital in
New York City. She was 74.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cass appeared in dozens of films and stage productions, but
is perhaps best known for her role as Agnes Gooch, the secretary in
the stage show ``Mame'' and its movie adaptation ``Auntie Mame.''
She won a Tony Award for the role and was nominated for an Academy
Award.
</P>
<P>
   She was an honest, candid, and witty woman once described in the
Globe as an ``incessant chatterbox'' who ``oozes razzmatazz.'' Her
exuberance made her a natural for TV. She was a panelist on ``To
Tell the Truth'' and was Jack Paar's sidekick on his late-night TV
show.

   Ms. Cass was born in Somerville, Mass. and spent her childhood
and teenage years in nearby Cambridge, where she graduated from
Cambridge Latin School. ``I was in the drama club but they wouldn't
let me act,'' she said in a story published in the Globe on Dec.
26, 1972.
</P>
<P>
   She said she always considered herself a Bostonian. ``My roots
are in Boston,'' she said. ``I had my teeth straightened in Boston.
I had my appendix taken out in Boston. What memories.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from high school, she moved to New York City,
where she made the rounds of casting calls with no luck.
Eventually, a press agent friend arranged a date with Clark Gable.
She recited poetry, sang, and danced for him. He told her she was
such a ham, she'd definitely make it. Paar heard about the unlikely
twosome and invited her to talk about the experience on TV. ``I was
so nervous, Paar couldn't shut me up,'' she said in another story
published in the Globe on Sept. 29, 1970. ``I've been talking ever
since.''
</P>
<P>
   She got her start in a USO troupe, playing a Russian sniper in
``The Doughgirls'' on a tour of Australia. She made her Broadway
debut in ``Bernadine.'' She also appeared in ``The Front Page,''
``Plaza Suite'' and ``If It's Tuesday, It Must Be Belgium.''
</P>
<P>
   Her one TV series, ``The Hathaways,'' in which she co-starred
with Jack Weston and three chimpanzees, lasted only the 1961-62
season.
</P>
<P>
   Her gravelly voice became her signature. ``Now, I'm sensitive
about that gravel voice of mine,'' she said in 1973. ``Once, while
I was making a picture, clad in slacks, a man jostled me slightly
and said: `Excuse me miss _ or is it mister?' I told him, `You'll
never know!' ''
</P>
<P>
   She leaves her husband, Eugene Feeney of New York City.

 &HT;    Problems will arise but no catastrophe expected, authority
saysBy Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Expect no Y2K cataclysm, but don't write off the
millennium bug as a nonevent, a local authority said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nationally, there's a likelihood of significant governmental
services and utilities problems,'' said Atlanta attorney Paul Arne.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am convinced that virtually every large organization in the
United States is going to experience some Y2K problems,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't mean that they're going to shut down. That
doesn't mean that utilities wont be operating. And at that doesn't
mean there needs to be mass panic.''
</P>
<P>
   Arne learned Tuesday that he has been named to Georgia's
Citizen's Y2K Task Force sponsored by Gov. Roy Barnes and chaired
by Southern Co. head A.W. ``Bill'' Dahlberg.
</P>
<P>
   Given Arne's credentials, the appointment is appropriate.
Nationally, he's on the board of legal advisers of the Bureau of
National Affairs Year 2000 Law Report, a legal publication, and
he's also on the board of legal advisers of the Rx2000 Solutions
Institute, a national health care organization with headquarters in
Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Arne's a board member of the Atlanta Year 2000 Users
Group and an organizer of its common services committee. The latter
consists of top computer technology people from the state's largest
corporations and organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Arne said the citizens group members will meet shortly to
discuss the scope of their new job.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Arne shared his own thoughts about the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Large organizations are going to have some Y2K problems. The
state of Georgia is not an exception.''
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, he said, ``My overall impression is that the
state is aware of the problem and that state government has placed
experienced technology people at the top of its organization.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't heard of any particular problems'' the state is
facing, he said, ``but a number of people have expressed concern
about the payroll system. The state is in the process of converting
its existing system, and the conversion needs to be watched
carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Arne said he's ``been impressed'' by Fulton County's Y2K
efforts, but he thinks ``that there are a lot of local governments
that don't understand the problems and haven't reacted
appropriately.''
</P>
<P>
   He asks if all of these entities have taken an inventory and
assessed it. ``If you have a system that doesn't work, it's obvious
that it has to be fixed. The trick is, determining what doesn't
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Arne mentioned that the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission warned about a year ago there could be Y2K troubles with
certain police wireless systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be willing to bet that not every governmental
organization in the state that has a police department is looking
at this problem,'' he said.

FOUR SLAIN IN SOUTH AFRICA, RAISING FEAR OF MORE VIOLENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE TOWN, South Africa _ Four local officials of a new
political party have been killed in this area in the last 48 hours,
raising fears that the violence that swept the country before the
1994 elections may be repeated before the national elections
scheduled for June.
</P>
<P>
   Bantu Holomisa, the head of the party, the United Democratic
Movement, is flying here Wednesday to ask for a meeting of all
political parties to try to defuse the situation.
</P>
<P>
   The killings came six weeks after the party's No. 3 official was
gunned down in KwaZulu/Natal, setting off a spate of revenge
killings. Holomisa went there too to call for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Although neither side says so, the violence is assumed to be
between the UDM and the governing African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the local branch of the ANC said the party had
``no objection in principle'' to a Cape Town meeting, but said
there might be difficulties convening one quickly. He also played
down the notion of a countrywide war between the parties, saying
some of those killed were also involved in a local dispute over
plans to seize land for housing.
</P>
<P>
   From 1990 to the 1994 elections _ the first in which the
country's black majority was allowed to take part _ thousands of
people died in fighting between the ANC and the Zulu nationalist
Inkatha Freedom Party, which got covert help from the South African
Police.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the two parties have made some headway
toward resolving their differences, but in recent weeks each side
has again accused the other of fomenting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Bad blood developed rapidly between the African National
Congress and the United Democratic Movement. The movement was
founded last year by Holomisa, who was ejected from the congress
for accusing party leaders of accepting bribes, and Roelf Meyer,
the heir apparent of the National Party, who was ousted in a power
struggle.
</P>
<P>
   There were different reports on the identity of the latest
victim, who was found Tuesday in a pool of blood in a field behind
a squatter camp east of the city. A local radio report said a
witness saw a young man follow him through the field, pull out a
gun and shoot him dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the area was full of police officers because of the
earlier violence, no arrest was made.
</P>
<P>
   The movement's general secretary for the Western Cape Province,
Malizole Diko, said the killer had jumped out of a convoy of armed
ANC supporters who had been driving through the black and
mixed-race townships on Tuesday intimidating officials like Diko.
</P>
<P>
   He accused the ANC of plotting assassinations out of frustration
at losing its grip in the area.

 &HT;    Tickets for Cracker Barrel lagging
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Atlanta Motor Speedway president Ed Clark says his
facility has one of the more attractive dates on NASCAR's schedule
for the Nov. 21 NAPA 500, Winston Cup's season finale.
</P>
<P>
   But annually, AMS has faced a tougher challenge selling its
spring race, Sunday's Cracker Barrel Old Country Store 500, the
fourth race on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   With the weather forecast for Atlanta predicting cool
temperatures and a 40 percent chance of rain Sunday, ticket sales
are lagging.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said Tuesday that AMS has sold about 85,000 tickets,
leaving at least 50,000 tickets available. That means ABC's
broadcast will be blacked out in the Atlanta and Macon areas. About
94,000 tickets were sold for the spring race last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're up in (ticket) sales for this race,'' Clark said. ``Not
substantially, but we're up. Generally, we've got pretty good sales
during race week if the forecast is good. But most of the Winston
Cup dates are sold-out in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark says he has approached NASCAR president Bill France Jr.
and chief operating officer Mike Helton about a later race date,
which Clark believes would decrease the chance of inclement
weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to move it,'' Clark said. ``I think they'd like to
help us out. But where are you going to move it, and who's going to
move their date?''
</P>
<P>
   Helton, general manager at the Hampton facility in 1985-86, says
he understands Clark's dilemma. But with the Winston Cup schedule
sandwiching 36 events in 40 weekends, he says, there's little room
for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was running the place 15 years ago, I asked NASCAR if
there was another opportunity for Atlanta's first race,'' Helton
said. ``The answer I got then is the same one I'm giving Ed now. .
. . Certainly, NASCAR would like to come to Atlanta when the sun's
shining and the temperatures are (warmer), but finding the right
slot for it is very difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark said AMS owner Bruton Smith has approached WSB-TV,
Atlanta's ABC affiliate, about lifting the blackout in the past,
but a financial deal never was reached. Under its contract with the
network, AMS has the option of a blackout if the race doesn't sell
out, Clark said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got more of a national appeal with the season finale,''
he said. ``I think this race has got more of a regional appeal.
It's not a sell-out, but it's still the second-largest sporting
event in the state behind the fall race.

A `LURCHING' BOLSHOI STILL THINKS BIG 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Nobody has ever accused the Bolshoi Theater of thinking
small: after all, the word ``bolshoi'' means big, great or grand.
People are trained from childhood to assume, and to assert, not
only that Russia's premier opera and ballet company is bigger than
its best-known rivals and performs more often, but also that it is
simply the best.
</P>
<P>
   For much of the last decade, most everyone knew that was not
true. The theater's ballet company had gone into a serious slump
during the last years of the reign of Yuri Grigorovich, a brilliant
but dictatorial choreographer.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Grigorovich was forced out. Vladimir Vasilyev,
one of the Bolshoi's most famous ballet stars, was named director
of the entire theater, which comprises its ballet and opera
companies as well as its orchestra, and hopes for the restoration
of the Bolshoi's former grandeur rose. But the first years of the
Vasilyev reign have brought more disappointment than triumph, and
among Moscow's loyal Bolshoi fans, there is a sense that maybe its
greatness has become a grand illusion.
</P>
<P>
   But the Bolshoi being the Bolshoi, it still thinks big. Among
its more far-fetched plans is a colossal building project,
supported by UNESCO; if it is ever finished, it could cost almost
$400 million and would shut the main theater for renovation
starting next January. Where the money would come from, however, is
an ever-deepening mystery, as the finances of the Russian
government, the theater's main sponsor, grow ever more precarious.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the Bolshoi's artistic program lack ambition. This year
the ballet company, which because of Russia's financial crisis lost
a private sponsor for the staging of a Maurice Bejart ballet late
last year, is committed to a premiere this spring of George
Balanchine's ``Symphony in C,'' and with only two months to
rehearse some critics worry whether its dancers will be prepared to
make the artistic leap required.
</P>
<P>
   Then in June, for the first time in eight years, both the ballet
and the opera company will go on a four-week tour to London, where
Vasilyev will have his first chance to test his new productions
before a foreign audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to know what has happened post-Grigorovich,'' said
Sir John Tooley, a former director of Covent Garden in London and a
member of the UNESCO-sponsored Bolshoi steering committee. ``This
tour will put the Bolshoi back on show.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not that Bolshoi artists, solo or in groups, have not
traveled the world in recent years. They have, and some argue that
these mini-tours, a way for dancers to augment their small Bolshoi
salaries, have squandered the theater's once-august reputation. Add
to that ``pirate'' tours by artists with only the slimmest
associations with the Bolshoi, and many here, starting with
Vasilyev, say the time has come for the Bolshoi to reassert itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The image of the Bolshoi was badly damaged in recent years,''
Vasilyev said. ``I have deliberately not done big tours because
when we do it, it should be done with a new repertory and a new
level of quality. Now we have arrived at a point when we can show
not only that the Bolshoi has not died, but that the Bolshoi has
climbed to new heights.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone agrees about the new level of quality at the
Bolshoi. With a few exceptions Vasilyev's new productions, of which
there have been at least 17 over three years, have not been warmly
received. Russian critics have been generally unimpressed by new
versions of some of the Bolshoi's classics, or ``calling cards'' as
they are called, and several have wondered, aloud and in print, if
in its frantic search for a new identity the Bolshoi has lost its
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were all convinced that by replacing Grigorovich with
Vasilyev, a great future would open up,'' said Vadim Gayevsky, a
ballet scholar and critic. ``Vasilyev had been abroad; he had a lot
of energy. We thought he could wake up the slumbering kingdom, like
the prince in `Sleeping Beauty.' We were right. He did have a lot
of energy, but he used it to take the ballet backward, not
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The most vehement attacks have been reserved for Vasilyev's
``Swan Lake,'' which, to the horror of many, dispenses with Odile,
the Black Swan, and invents a father-son rivalry for the affections
of the surviving Swan Princess. The new version, reportedly as
unpopular inside the theater as it was with the critics, shares the
spotlight in the Bolshoi repertory with Grigorovich's 1969 version,
a sign, some say, of the theater's split personality.
</P>
<P>
   The theater has tried, so far only tentatively, to incorporate
the classics of Western 20th-century choreography into its
repertory while adding forgotten 19th-century Russian works like
Tchaikovsky's historical opera ``Oprichnik.'' The result, some say,
is neither inspiring nor reassuring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bolshoi keeps lurching from side to side, which is
dangerous because in the end it could lose its foundations,'' said
Yaroslav Sedov, a music and dance critic for the news magazine
Itogi. ``It should do what it does best, which is the grand
spectacle. That is its tradition, and it is a tradition that has
hardly been exhausted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi still plays to virtually sold-out audiences, but
here and abroad there is a sense that the baton has been passed
from it to the Mariinsky Theater (formerly the Kirov) in St.
Petersburg in the latest replay of a rivalry two centuries old.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In Valery Gergiev, the Mariinsky's dynamic director, St.
Petersburg's old imperial theater has found a champion with the
talent and savvy needed to clinch international attention. Even
though Gergiev's forte is not ballet, the Mariinsky troupe has
benefited from his energy and spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every theater should have its ideologue, a leader,'' Gayevsky
said. ``Grigorovich had his ideas; Gergiev has his. Vasilyev is the
artistic director of the Bolshoi: he should be talking about art,
about ideas, but instead he is always talking about money.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia's financial crisis has hit the Bolshoi hard. The theater
still depends heavily on government subsidies, which this year,
like last year, barely cover salaries. A new contract system has
given the theater more flexibility and its dancers, singers and
musicians better protection from the whims of its directors. But
the salaries remain paltry; top soloists earn $200 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi's defenders wince, however, at what they consider an
unfair comparison with the Mariinsky, which they say has been fed
by the Bolshoi's failure to tout itself. ``There is competition
with other Russian theaters that have an interest in lowering the
reputation of the Bolshoi,'' said Aleksei Fadeyechev, a 38-year-old
former dancer and partner to the ballerina Nina Ananiashvili. As
the new ballet director for the Bolshoi, Fadeyechev said, ``The
most important task now is to show the world that we have excellent
artists who can present the Bolshoi as it should be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bolshoi's most audacious plan is rooted inside the company's
great pink temple, which, like the Kremlin, is a symbol of Moscow
and a landmark of Russian culture.
</P>
<P>
   The reconstruction program, announced in December, was actually
begun four years ago with construction of a second Bolshoi theater,
steps away from the main theater's western flank. That project,
half completed, includes a second stage, with seating for 1,000,
compared with the main theater's 2,000; a duplicate rehearsal
stage; dressing rooms; office space; an underground electrical
complex, and a three-story atrium. Altogether, the plan comprises a
second mega-Bolshoi complex of some 650,000 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   The second part of the project calls for the renovation of the
143-year-old theater. The idea is to finish the sister theater by
January so the company will have a place to perform when the main
theater closes for renovation. Afterward, when both theaters are in
use, the new house will be dedicated to more modern, experimental
productions, leaving the main stage for classic works.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a problem. The Bolshoi, like Russia, does not have
the money to fulfill its dreams of grandeur. The federal government
has not allocated the $100 million needed to finish the sister
stage, said Yakov Sarkisov, deputy director of Mospromstroi, the
construction company that is building the sister theater complex.
It has not even paid Mospromstroi the $10 million it owes for work
already completed, he added.
</P>
<P>
   As for the estimated $200 million renovation of the main
theater, not only has the money not been earmarked, but no plans
have been drawn up. Neither Sarkisov nor Vasilyev can describe in
any detail what the renovations will entail or how much they will
cost. ``As long as they can't say that they definitely have the
money, we can't say definitely what it is we want to do,'' Sarkisov
said.
</P>
<P>
   No one doubts that the Bolshoi, like most public buildings in
Russia, is in poor repair. Sir John recalled how the Royal Ballet,
on tour in Russia 10 years ago, decided not to perform at the
Bolshoi because it was deemed unsafe.
</P>
<P>
   Restoring and preserving the Bolshoi, one of the world's
cultural treasures, was an original UNESCO goal in 1993 when the
agency adopted the theater as one of its three flagship projects in
Russia. But UNESCO officials are open about their frustration in
dealing with the Bolshoi bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have building plans; we don't have cost estimates,''
said Horst Godicke, director of UNESCO's program for Central and
Eastern Europe. ``In order to make the project more credible, they
are going to have to introduce some transparency in their budget
planning.''
</P>
<P>
   But what Russia lacks in organization, it sometimes makes up in
last-minute improvisation, which explains how monumental projects
are completed in defiance of mundane considerations like budgets
and timetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes miracles happen,'' Godicke said. ``These are normal
things in Russia. You can't apply Western standards to a country up
to its neck in its own traditions.''

GOING WITH THE 'YO: YO-YOS ARE HOT NOW, BUT HAVE HAD AN UP-AND-DOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   The yo-yo has, ahem, certainly had its ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the plaything is hot _ about 50 million were sold
last year, more than any single year, even during the yo-yo's
heyday in the '60s. That includes some top-of-the-line models that
can go for up to $150. They're so pervasive that a number of local
schools have banned them from campus.
</P>
<P>
   But will they last? In the larger sense, yes _ but for some
perspective, let's take a look at the yo-yo in history.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo is invented, probably in China, although the first
historical mention is in Greece. 500 B.C.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: Philippine hunters hide in trees and use a rock with a
long cord to throw at wild animals; a mistaken belief that this was
the yo-yo's origin attaches a certain ugly stigma to the toy. 16th
century.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo travels from the Orient to Europe, making its
debut with the aristocracy of France, Scotland and England. 1765.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: The French aristocracy is forced to flee France during the
``Reign of Terror,'' taking their yo-yos with them. The yo-yo was
nicknamed ``l'emigrette,'' which means ``leave the country.''
Reportedly, condemned prisoners played with yo-yos to relieve the
considerable stress of walking to the guillotine. 1789.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo makes its theatrical debut in Beaumarchais' play
``The Marriage of Figaro,'' in which a nervous Figaro describes his
``emigrette'' as ``a noble toy, which dispels the fatigue of
thinking.'' 1791.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: The yo-yo accompanies Napoleon and his troops to Waterloo,
where they suffer a crushing defeat. 1815.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo makes its first recorded appearance in America.
1866.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN AND SLEEPING: Nothing significant happens to the yo-yo for
nearly 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   UP: Pedro Flores begins the States' first yo-yo company; Donald
F. Duncan buys it soon after, creating the world's biggest yo-yo
firm. 1928-29.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: Duncan receives a trademark for the word ``yo-yo,''
forcing competitors to use weird appellations such as ``twirler.''
1932.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The Duncan Co. moves to Luck, Wis., which becomes the Yo-Yo
Capital of the World, producing 3,600 yo-yos ``per hour.'' 1946.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: Really, there were a lot of ``ups'' for the next two
decades, so here's where we'll tell you that calling someone a
``yo-yo'' becomes a popular insult.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The Duncan Co. sells a record 45 million yo-yos in a country
with only 40 million kids. 1962.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: Demand is so great, the Duncan can't keep up with
advertising expenses, overtime wages or the legal fees involved in
keeping ``yo-yo'' trademarked. 1962.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The word ``yo-yo'' is liberated from its trademark status by
the Federal Court of Appeals. 1965.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: The Duncan Co. is forced into bankruptcy. 1965.
</P>
<P>
   UP: Flambeau Plastics Co. successfully bids for Duncan, keeping
the name alive. 1965.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: Abbie Hoffman is cited for contempt when he ``walks the
dog'' in an attempt to entertain congressional investigators. 1968.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo makes headlines when it appears at the opening of
the Grand Ole Opry. 1974
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: It makes more headlines by appearing with Richard Nixon.
1974.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo undergoes three decades of technological
innovations. Mid-'70s-present.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: The innovations make yo-yos more expensive.
Mid-1970s-present.
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo travels into space on the space shuttle Discovery
to see how it performs in low gravity. 1985.
</P>
<P>
   DOWN: It won't ``sleep'' in low gravity, making it difficult to
perform many tricks. 1985
</P>
<P>
   UP: The yo-yo returns to space on the space shuttle Atlantis,
and is featured in an educational video including slow-motion
yo-yo-ing.

TEXAS REPUBLICAN SEEKS TO BLOCK U.S. MISSION FUNDS FOR KOSOVO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison unveiled legislation
Tuesday that would prohibit U.S. defense spending on a NATO-led
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo until President Clinton lays out for
Congress the mission and objectives of sending U.S. forces into the
Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is likely to be introduced within the week as an
amendment to an emergency spending bill that would provide nearly
$1 billion in relief aid to help Honduras and Nicaragua rebuild
from the devastation caused by Hurricane Mitch last fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kosovo is a very different situation from Bosnia. I think it's
important that Congress weighs in when we are talking about going
into a sovereign nation,'' the Texas Republican said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to say to the president, you cannot fling U.S.
troops all over the world without, A, coming to Congress, B,
telling us where you want the money to come from and, C, having an
achievable mission and exit strategy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has committed to sending U.S. forces to Kosovo as part
of a NATO peacekeeping mission if the Serbs and ethnic Albanian
rebels agree to a Washington-authored peace plan that would give
the Albanians limited autonomy. Rebel leaders have signaled that
they might accept the terms of the accord, but Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic has refused to sign off on it because it calls
for placing NATO forces in Serbian territory.
</P>
<P>
   The peacekeeping mission was outlined to members of Congress
several weeks ago when Defense Secretary William Cohen testified
before the Senate and House committees responsible for overseeing
the Pentagon. Thought the plan was still being put together, Cohen
suggested that the number of U.S. forces committed to Kosovo could
range from 4,000 to 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   Key Republicans and Democrats on the committees voiced support
at that time for sending U.S. troops to participate in the NATO
mission. But, some lawmakers have begun to object to the idea of
committing any troops under any circumstances to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, has emerged as one of
the strongest critics on the House side of U.S. involvement in any
peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in an op-ed piece Tuesday for the Wall Street Journal,
DeLay said committing U.S. forces to Kosovo would be ``a risky
mistake'' that would set a dangerous precedent for the NATO
alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The proposed Kosovo mission is much more dangerous than the
one in Bosnia,'' DeLay wrote. ``It cannot honestly be called a
peacekeeping mission because there is not even the semblance of a
cease-fire between the battling parties, who refuse to negotiate
directly with one another. No number of soldiers can keep the peace
where none exists.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay also plans to introduce his own legislation this week that
would go much further than Hutchison's. It would prohibit defense
money from being spent to support a peacekeeping mission in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay has long been an opponent of committing U.S. forces abroad
for any other reason than U.S. security. In his Wall Street Journal
piece, he wrote that it was time for America to ``recommit itself
to securing its own defense first before sending troops abroad to
build nations upon foundations of sand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are playing with a scorpion in the Balkans, and it is only
a matter of time before we get stung,'' DeLay wrote.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Smashing the stereotype that viewers of professional
wrestling are all blue-collar, undereducated Neanderthals watching
a macho soap opera, students at some of the nation's most elite
colleges have made a minicult of staging Monday night parties to
watch ``WCW Monday Nitro Live'' on cable.
</P>
<P>
   They contribute hugely to a viewing group that advertisers
covet: young adult males. To help gussy up wrestling's rather
unsavory image and to remind advertisers how popular it is with big
men on campus, the TNT network took its World Championship
Wrestling show on the road to four universities in the last month.
</P>
<P>
   The network, part of the Turner Broadcasting System, as is World
Championship Wrestling itself, asked students to send in videotapes
of their Monday Nitro parties. The winners' parties were televised
on TNT during ``WCW Monday Nitro Live'' bouts.
</P>
<P>
   The four winners (from more than 50 submissions) were Brown
University, the University of California at Berkeley, the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the University of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are schools you might not typically associate a
wrestling crowd with,'' said Joe Uva, president for sales at Turner
Entertainment. ``But it shows you wrestling's popularity with that
young adult audience.'' And, he said, ``It's a terrific way for
advertisers to tap into'' that college audience weekly.
</P>
<P>
   These college guys are the most difficult-to-reach slice of an
audience that makes pro wrestling by far the biggest driving force
in prime-time Nielsen ratings for basic cable.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 25 most-watched shows on cable television in February, 21
were wrestling shows _ either World Wrestling Federation bash-fests
on Monday nights on the USA network, ``WCW Monday Nitro Live'' or a
spinoff called ``WCW Thunder'' (Thursday nights on TBS), with the
top shows drawing about 4.5 million households. (The No. 1 show on
cable in February was a NASCAR race; two movies and the Westminster
Kennel Club dog show rounded out the top 25.)
</P>
<P>
   And wrestling's popularity doesn't stop with college students.
Teen-agers and children are big fans, too, and now Kids WB, the
children's programming branch of the WB network, has scheduled a
wrestling-themed show, ``On the Ropes,'' for its Saturday morning
children's lineup. It features high school wrestlers, so it ought
to be tamer than the cable shows _ presumably.

   TELEVISION LIFE
</P>
<P>
   Peter Tolan, a comedy writer whose credits include both ``The
Larry Sanders Show'' and the top box office movie ``Analyze This,''
has had so much experience dealing with television executives, most
of it bad, that he is writing one sitcom for HBO based on how these
executives do their work (tentatively called ``The Web'') and
another based on a book written by a television executive.
</P>
<P>
   As Tolan put it during the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen,
Colo., last weekend, ``Dealing with television executives is
something I know a lot about, and I have the scars to prove it.''
</P>
<P>
   The second show, to be produced by Tom Hanks' production
company, Playtone, will be based on the satirical business novel
``Lloyd: What Happened?,'' published last year by Crown and written
by Stanley Bing, who also writes a humor column for Fortune
magazine when he isn't spinning the corporate information issued by
CBS. Of course, in that role he has the not-so-hidden identity of
Gil Schwartz, senior vice president for communications at that
network.
</P>
<P>
   Bing said that beyond expressing happiness about his book's
being adapted for television he was ``incredibly flustered'' and
declined to comment further.

   POIROT POPPING UP
</P>
<P>
   The fussbudget detective Hercule Poirot has been a figure of
reruns for some years now, popping up regularly on the A&AMP;E cable
network. The character, as embodied by the British actor David
Suchet, was so popular with American audiences that A&AMP;E has
persuaded Suchet to do a reprise of the role, after a five-year
hiatus.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Suchet will appear in two feature-length Poirot
films, each two hours long and based on an Agatha Christie novel.
Produced by Brian Eastman _ who did the original British ``Poirot''
episodes, which first ran from 1988 to 1994 in Britain and migrated
to the United States on PBS, then A&AMP;E _ the new films will appear
next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Murder of Roger Ackroyd'' and ``Lord Edgware Dies'' are
the two Christie novels being produced as A&AMP;E originals. No word
yet on whether Poirot's secretary, Miss Lemon, his friend Captain
Hastings or their sometime colleague Inspector Japp will appear in
the new movies.

   WITHOUT MONICA
</P>
<P>
   Even though ABC has special access to the newswoman of the sweep
month, Monica Lewinsky (though Barbara Walters could also fit that
description), NBC's ``Nightly News With Tom Brokaw'' came away from
the news competition for February a rather easy winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nightly News'' had the highest rating: 8.6, compared with 8.2
for ABC and 7.6 for CBS (each rating point represents 994,000
homes); the most viewers, 11.35 million, compared with 11.25
million for ABC and 10.2 million for CBS, and the best showing
among the group that advertisers with news programs seek to reach
most: ages 25 to 54.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a consistent pattern; NBC has won nine straight
sweep competitions among that group of viewers.

BIGHOUSE (Paradise Valley, Ariz.) - The priciest home sale in
Arizona history has been concluded. Sports team mogul John McCaw
sells his 10-acre spread on the north side of Camelback Mountain
for $8.3 million. A company called MICI bought it. By CHARLES KELLY
and CATHERINE REAGOR. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MEXICAN-TRUCKS (Nogales, Ariz.) - For safety inspectors at
Arizona's six ports of entry, a recent study only confirmed what
they already knew: Too few big rigs from Mexico are being inspected
at the border, and too few inspected trucks comply with U.S safety
standards. Oh yeah, state inspector Richard Saspe says emphatically
as the Mexican 18 wheelers stream across the scales outside his
plate-glass window, there are more than a few reasons to be worried
about the rigs traversing this country as scheduled under the NAFTA
agreement come Jan. 1. By MARK SHAFFER. Story will move in the
``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARIZONA PARK (Phoenix) - A proposal for a new national park in
southwestern Arizona, backed by scientists, writers and former
federal officials, would combine two current national preserves and
a military testing range into the Sonoran Desert National Park _
``5,000 square miles of silence,'' the organizers say. By SETH
LANDAU. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABBEY-REMEMBERED (Phoenix) - Ten years after his death,
environmentalist/author Edward Abbey is having an increasing impact
on the West. We talk to folks about why Abbey has a lasting appeal.
His books helped spawn the Earth First! movement, and some
associated violence and conspiracy. Today, that movement is
flowering as a non-violent, mainstream effort to protect vast
tracts of wild lands across the continent. By STEVE YOZWIAK. Story
moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ARTPOP (Phoenxi) - Some pop transcends the triviality of the form.
While the Spice Girls or Mary's Danish will eventually disappear,
certain people contain in their very voice the seed of all
humanity: Ray Charles, Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday. A single
note is not only identifiable, but heartbreaking. Others, like the
dancing of Fred Astaire or the guitar notes of BB King, do the
same: They function at the level of high art. By RICHARD NILSEN.
Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
GOODYKOONTZ-COLUMN (Phoenix) - Strutting someday soon on an
international fashion runway: Sarah Alford. Or so she hopes. More
than anything else. Alford, 15, was one of more than 250 girls and
women who showed up at Dillard's at Fashion Square Mall, hoping to
have their faces and features grace an ad for Roxy, a clothing
line. By BILL GOODYKOONTZ. Story moved in the ``L'' category. &QL;

REYNOLDS-MUSIC (Phoenix) - Tim Reynolds, a guitar legend in the
Southeast, is starting to make a name for himself by trekking the
country for the third time on an acoustic tour with pal Dave
Matthews. By KEVIN MURPHY. Story moved in the ``E'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
MCGARVEY-COLUMN (Undated) - During their brief respite at my home,
a Chiapas father and son consumed big bowls of rice and ranchero
beans, 24 smallish corn tortillas, and big salad plates of lettuce,
ripe tomatoes and sliced avocados that I garnished with mayonnaise,
red chile flakes and chopped cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   They also ate a dozen raw jalapenos and peeled four oranges.
They drank nearly a gallon of milk and later snacked on a bag of
microwave popcorn. They were astounded by the microwave. They also
drank a liter of Coca-Cola.
</P>

   Father Ignacio and son Pedro were famished, having subsisted
only on cornmeal gruel during their two-month odyssey north to the
chilly Promised Land from the tropical, revolutionary Mexican state
of Chiapas. By JACK MCGARVEY. Story moved in the ``K'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
EDIT-ORGANS (Phoenix) - A quixotic bid to exempt Arizona from a
national human organ allocation system should make people sick. The
national plan itself could make people sicker.
</P>
<P>
   Both systems prompt shouts of protest. But when the shouting is
done, when all arguments are made about any system of rationing
human body parts, a somber reality sinks in: No matter which system
is in place, patients will die because of a severe shortage of
lifesaving organs.

   OVERLAND PARK, Kan. _ When Alice Errett began operating The
Maids franchise in Johnson County, Kan., she thought getting
customers would be her biggest challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Not even close.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's getting workers. Good workers,'' she soon learned. ``I
never struggled to find customers. The issue from Day One was
finding reliable, dependable, good-natured people to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Most business owners and operators can relate. (ital)I just
can't find good help!(end ital) is the hirers' lament of the '90s.
</P>
<P>
   Continued low unemployment rates _ plus entry into the work
force of former welfare recipients who have no sustained job
histories _ continue to make it hard to fill front-line jobs.
People who take entry-level jobs often need to acquire the most
basic skills, including a work ethic.
</P>
<P>
   But, while many employers moan about the worker dearth, Errett
in the last five years has gone to heroic lengths to solve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't come across another employer who goes out of her way
that much,'' says Tom Sprenkel, job developer for the Kansas
Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services in Kansas City,
Kan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her willingness to go outside her normal routine to contact
pockets of unemployed people is unmatched. You see her at job
fairs, at social service agencies, at community meetings, anywhere
she thinks she might find people who need work.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett emphasizes she is not running a charity. She says she
makes a good living at what she believes is the largest cleaning
service now operating in Johnson County. She expects to gross just
under a million dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
   But dollars and cents are not the full measure of Errett's
success. She thrives because she has:
</P>
<P>
   _ Driven the streets of Kansas City, Kan., stopping in at
community centers and social service agencies to say, ``Hi, I'm
Alice. I'm looking for workers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Created a first-name relationship with state welfare and job
service officials to find job candidates.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forged a public-private partnership with transit officials to
subsidize a bus that picks up her workers in Kansas City, Kan., and

</P>
<P>
   _ Put a full-service kitchen in the office so workers can fix
breakfast or dinner for themselves or their families.

   _ Set up a bilingual library of periodicals and books for her
employees to read. All workplace materials are in Spanish and
English.
</P>
<P>
   _ Become an expert in day care and sick-child care referrals, in
car loans and even bail bond resources.

classes to help workers get along with each other.
</P>
<P>
   _ Paid for her employees' flu shots and vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will do everything in my power to make it possible for the
people who work for me to be healthy and be here,'' says Errett.
</P>
<P>
   Errett is a former Sprint Corp. group manager for product
development who decided in 1994 that she was an entrepreneur at
heart. A financial partner, Glenn Golden, helped her buy The Maids
franchise, and she got off to a decent business start with two
early hires, Andrea Matthes and Ron Schmidt.
</P>
<P>
   Matthes and Schmidt have stayed with the organization and
advanced to run the office, the scheduling, the billing and many of
the day-to-day business details. That leaves Errett ``free'' to do
what she loves: recruiting, training and helping workers prosper.
</P>
<P>
   ``That woman walks on water as far as I'm concerned,'' says Joel
Schroeder, who bought a competing area cleaning service, Lulu &AMP;
Mimi's Housecleaners, last June. ``She heard the panic in my voice
and came right over and sat down with me for about three hours to
share how she handles staffing. We still talk every other week.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder says his goal is to one day operate ``just like
Alice.'' Meanwhile, though, he says he's managing his business by
himself and can't carve out time to do the grass-roots search for
workers that Errett does. Errett has a standard pitch when she
talks to applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I'm getting close to hiring someone, I tell him or her
that `You have to do these three things to work for me:
</P>
<P>
   `Be here. Have a smile for everyone, and that means not coming
in this door with any racism baggage. Clean my way.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Then I say, `Call me back if you can do that.' Some do. Some
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Errett employs about 28 full-time workers and eight
others who work on call. They earn between $6 and $9 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her efforts, turnover remains a problem. She estimates
she's hired about 100 workers in the past 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   She loses about one-third of her trained cleaning team members
in a year. But if she considers those who leave before their
training period is finished, her turnover rate approaches 300
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, my employees come in needing many things. One
thing I learned quickly is that most of them didn't `live'
anywhere. They said they were `staying' places. Most of them move
often, from house to house, sometimes because of family problems,
sometimes because of income problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``That made my resolve stronger to make this office a home away
from home. It also made me resolve to help some of them with
getting mortgages.''
</P>
<P>
   She has built a kitchen, living room and library//computer room
into The Maids office, partly to use as a training ground and
partly as a homey gathering place before and after her workers fan
out to clean customers' homes.
</P>
<P>
   Errett also has helped about a half-dozen employees buy houses.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I do, I tell them to say, `I (ital)live(end ital)
here.' And I tell them to come to me if they have problems with
their mortgages. We will work on their financial problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Helping employees buy houses is an extraordinary step that few
other employers can take. And it certainly wasn't the first
challenge that Errett tackled.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the very beginning, we ran into transportation
problems,'' she recalls. ``The people I interviewed didn't have
cars and there was no public transportation route that could get
them to me.''
</P>
<P>
   For a while, Errett allowed some of The Maids' company cars to
be driven home at night by employees who were responsible for
chauffeuring other employees to and from work.
</P>
<P>
   ``That wasn't successful for a variety of reasons, one of which
was that our vehicles sometimes ended up in places we didn't want
them to be,'' she recalls.

<P>
   ...she recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Then Errett subsidized a commuter van provided through the
Mid-America Regional Council and the Economic Opportunity
Foundation. That program ceased, and Errett next teamed with
Wyandotte and Johnson county public transit officials to get a
dedicated public bus route through the JobLinks program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a little guy. I have no political clout. But today, I
subsidize a full-size Johnson County bus that picks up 15 to 20 of
my people at two locations in Wyandotte County every morning and
drops them off here and here alone,'' Errett beams.
</P>
<P>
   After she got the bus, Errett threw a thank-you luncheon at The
Central Exchange for ``the government bureaucrats who helped make
it happen _ the people who do great work day in and day out and
hardly ever get recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett thought other employers could benefit from her
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here I was, using only about a third of a public bus,'' Errett
relates. ``I figured, why wouldn't other employers want to use the
rest of the seats. I went to the Overland Park Chamber of Commerce,
to other retailers, to some of the fast food places around here,
and I tried to get others to show interest in the bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating to me. I heard a lot of `We don't have
good luck with people from that area' and a variety of other
reasons why they weren't interested. So, at this point, it's my
bus, and I'm absolutely delighted with it because people are not
quitting my jobs because of a transportation problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Providing transportation was only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured that once I got people in the door and solved their
transportation problems that people would say, `Thank you, Alice.'
That's not what I got. I got people coming in every day and asking
for advances on their pay.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett discovered the need to be a financial and family
counselor as well. Partly for that reason, she entered a
partnership with Tom Lawson, a mentor from the Older Kansans
Employment Program, who spends 20 hours a week advising The Maids'
employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``People from disadvantaged backgrounds often have trouble
making good choices about how to manage their money,'' Errett said.
``They get paychecks on Friday and it's gone on Monday. We work
hard to teach money management skills, but when someone truly needs
an advance, I'll give it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett also found a need to provide social and work-ethic
training.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to get an alarm clock when they come to work for
me,'' she says. ``Many have never had one before. We talk about
manners and responsibility. I teach them to clean, yes, but it's
more important that I teach them how to work with others.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, workers quit for no obvious financial or
family-related reason. Errett follows up to find out why.
Previously, she often heard that they didn't like their co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``So now we work extra hard to create compatible teams and
celebrate team successes. We work hard to explain that even on a
team, different workers have different responsibilities, that
everyone doesn't do exactly the same thing. We work hard to teach
them that quality isn't something the supervisor dictates; it's
something that has to be in everyone's heart.''
</P>
<P>
   As an incentive, Errett offers a bonus that adds $5 to team
members' paychecks for each day a cleaning team gets no complaints.
The company gets complaints from only 1 to 2 percent of all jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to build good teams. We look at personality, not
race or ethnicity. We expect everyone to communicate with each
other. That means learning a few phrases of Spanish or listening to
our ESL (English-as-a-second-language) tapes.''
</P>
<P>
   Errett says she's rigorous about using a pre-employment
screening service. She also does random drug screening. Her
cleaning teams are bonded through a third-party fidelity bond. They
don't get to work in paying customers' homes until they've
completed her training.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, she admits, all her efforts fail. But, sometimes,
they succeed wildly.
</P>
<P>
   Errett's favorite success story involves a former welfare
recipient who came to The Maids encumbered by financial and
personal problems. Errett said the woman breezed through The Maids'
training and was a top performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew we were limiting her, that we didn't have anything for
someone of her intelligence and ability,'' Errett says.
</P>
<P>
   Errett made a few referrals. Today, the woman has an income
that's well more than double The Maids' entry wages.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this job, I get to change lives. I see people who have
never been successful at anything before. I teach them how to
clean, and they have a skill that they can be proud of. It may not
be the skill you'd choose, but it's a skill, and they get money for
doing it. They get more money than they ever had before.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Seeking to break his country's isolation, President
Mohammad Khatami of Iran arrived in Italy on Tuesday for a
three-day visit, the first Iranian leader to visit Western Europe
since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's faltering economy badly needs foreign investment, and
Khatami hopes to improve his government's credibility and thus
attract trade and loans. The United States, which still views Iran
as supporting terrorism, has gingerly sought to encourage reform
but has not lifted its trade embargo. Europe has proven far less
diffident.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has taken a lead in seeking economic and political
rapprochement with Iran, and it welcomed Khatami with tight
security and full honors, starting with a greeting at the airport
by Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, a Shiite Muslim cleric, expects to meet with the pope
on Thursday, a meeting the Vatican welcomes as a chance to improve
relations with Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you know, each visit has a means of friendship that is very
important to our country,'' Khatami said on Tuesday after meeting
with President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
   For Italy, diplomacy is tightly entwined with economic
interests. A week ago, the Italian energy group Ente Nazionale
Idrocarburi and the French oil company Elf-Aquitaine signed a
$1-billion contract to develop the Dorood oil field in Iran, a deal
that Washington greeted with dismay.
</P>
<P>
   But Italian officials say their overtures to Khatami, whom they
view as a moderate intent on modernizing Iranian society and
loosening the grip of its fundamentalist clergy, will help the
United States as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not convinced that the United States does not view with
favor our initiative toward Iran,'' Dini said in an interview on
Tuesday. Dini, who accompanied Prime Minister Massimo D'Alema on
his visit to the White House last week, said American officials had
expressed ``great interest'' in Italy's effort to support what he
described as Khatami's ``new course.''
</P>
<P>
   A 1996 U.S. law requires that the administration impose
sanctions on companies or countries that invest more than $20
million in Iran's energy industry. Last May, the administration
established a policy to waive sanctions in certain cases, and it
recently granted a waiver to the French company Total, which signed
a $2-billion deal in 1997 to develop an Iranian gas field. Italy
hopes the State Department will follow that precedent with ENI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Italy of course will be very careful to condemn abuses of
human rights and democracy in Iran,'' Dini said. But he added that
it was in everyone's interest to support modernization in Iran.
``Iran is a big country, and its democracy and stability are
important to the entire Middle East,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami, who was elected 21 months ago, has been immersed in a
power struggle between moderates in the government and hard-line
factions. He got a boost earlier this month when moderate
candidates won control of local councils in the country's first
municipal elections since 1979. But nationally, conservative
clerics still control dominate major institutions, and ultimate
authority lies with the senior religious leader, Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights organizations say that even under Khatami's
presidency, progress has been slow. The State Department's report
on human rights for 1998, which was published last month, agreed.
``Systematic abuses included extrajudicial killings and summary
executions, disappearances, widespread use of torture and other
degrading treatment,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While Khatami had lunch at the presidential palace on Tuesday, a
few miles away more than 3,000 Iranian dissidents and some Italian
opposition figures demonstrated to protest his visit. In Amsterdam,
seven Iranians briefly occupied the Italian Consulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Khatami is not a moderate, even if he said he is,'' said
Perviz Khazai, who was an ambassador under Khomeini and is a leader
in the National Council of Resistance of Iran, an Iranian dissident
group, who helped organize Tuesday's rally in Rome. He cited
assassinations of Iranian dissidents abroad and public executions
and stonings.
</P>
<P>
   Khazai accused Italy of courting Khatami for its own economic
ends. ``They should call a spade a spade and say they want to deal
with this regime because they want oil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   This accusation was echoed by Italian protesters. ``Khatami made
Rome his first visit because Italians are always open to
business,'' said Marco Taradash, an opposition member of
Parliament.

BIG TYPE ONCE MEANT BIG NEWS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (Undated) You sometimes hear that TV and a general withering of
the reading habit are threats to the survival of print journalism.
But the people who say that are dead wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The main danger to newspapers comes from the fact we've already
used up all the big headlines.
</P>
<P>
   A long time ago, as a youngster in the Army, my twin duties were
to lead a platoon of men charged with defending our way of life
against godless communism and to supervise production of the
division's weekly paper.
</P>
<P>
   During my two years of service no godless communists ever showed
themselves in that part of North Carolina, so I ended up devoting a
good share of my time to the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The Paraglide, our sheet was called _ a carryover from the day
when airborne infantrymen might arrive at the battle either by
parachute or by glider.
</P>
<P>
   The paper was a tabloid, and the first thing I was told upon
assuming this heavy responsibility was that the format was
sacrosanct. Each week the bottom half of the front page was to be
filled by one large photograph, the top half by a single screamer
headline.
</P>
<P>
   What was written inside the paper wasn't so important, as long
as the commanding general's name _ a rather goofy name _ was
spelled correctly. But the rule about Page One was inflexible.
</P>
<P>
   As you perhaps know, not much electrifying news occurs on a
military post. And anything that might resemble real news is
forbidden to be circulated. Yet there we were, committed to this
gigantic headline _ two enormous lines of type, each letter 3 or 4
inches tall.
</P>
<P>
   So we just made the best of what we had.
</P>
<P>
   TOWN TATTOO PARLORS
</P>
<P>
   PUT OFF LIMITS
</P>
<P>
   Or,
</P>
<P>
   POST EXCHANGE GETS
</P>
<P>
   NEW SALAD BAR
</P>
<P>
   After a while the glory years were over, and I came back to the
world of civilian journalism, which was governed by greater
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   In those days we had what the editors called a ``scare''
headline. It was one, or at most two columns wide, with letters
maybe a half-inch high. There also was a ``plain scare,'' not much
different except the type was somewhat fainter.
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for anything bigger than a scare, you needed at least
a quadruple homicide, a hotel fire, or a tree down across the
street the publisher drove to work.
</P>
<P>
   The really huge headlines _ banners that ran all the way across
the top of the page _ were held in reserve for declarations of war,
men in orbit, important assassinations, American League pennants
and such.
</P>
<P>
   In the ensuing 40 years there have been changes.
</P>
<P>
   Among the new breed of consultants whose specialty it is to tell
newspapers how to look more dynamic and snazzy, there's a widely
held belief that enormous headlines get readers' glands pumping and
put them in a rage to subscribe.
</P>
<P>
   Almost any day now you pick a newspaper anywhere in the land and
you'd think, from a quick glance at Page One, that space aliens
finally had arrived or California had slid into the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   It makes you wonder what editors would do if, instead of the
usual run of the day's news, they got a call from a famous
astronomer, telephoning from his mountaintop observatory to report
an incoming asteroid roughly the size of Vermont.
</P>
<P>
   Newspapers would be in pretty much the same fix as the poor old
Paraglide _ kind of like a soldier who's fired all his best shots
before the fight begins.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the world might be at hand, but it would be hard to
interest readers in that fact when, only the day before, we'd used
the same size type to notify them of the expanded salad bar.

   LA-SALARIES (Los Angeles) _ Salaries for middle managers and
technicians in Los Angeles County are among the highest in the
nation, according to a survey released Tuesday. Coupled with
national economic reports that concluded that worker production _
and salaries _ increased dramatically, and the future looks
especially bright for Angelenos. According to the salary survey, a

percent more in Los Angeles, or $56,900. By Gregory J. Wilcox.

   MOVIE-TRAILERS (Los Angeles) _ The major studios are finally
bowing to the will of the people: They're turning down the volume
on their trailers. Movie patrons have long complained that the
volume is too high on those previews that come on before the main
attraction. And some theater owners have taken to turning down the
volume on trailers, which is great for getting through a whiz-bang,
special-effects-loaded trailer, but makes dialogue nearly
impossible to hear. But don't expect the volume to be lower the
next time you go to the multiplex; most trailers for the summer are
already in the can. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``f''

   CALIF-THEATER (Los Angeles) _ From the Mexican border to the
Mark Taper Forum here, theater is alive _ and well enough _ in
Southern California, and the stars of film and television are
dabbling in it in ever greater numbers. This season alone, familiar
faces as diverse as Carol Burnett, Annette Bening, Donald
Sutherland, Al Pacino and Molly Ringwald have appeared, or are

of classics, or reworkings of recent New York offerings. By Todd S.

   STAND-ALONE-FILM (Paris) _ After seeing ``I Stand Alone,'' after
meeting its director, Gaspar Noe, 35, one couldn't help but ask:
How could a pleasant young man with a positive view of life make a
film as dark and desperate as this one? Well, Noe might of course
have confessed that he was a secret nihilist, that ``I Stand
Alone'' (``Seul Contre Tous'') was a public form of psychotherapy.
Reassuringly, his answer was more straightforward. ``I can make a
film like this because I feel at ease with myself,'' he said. By
Alan Riding. Photo.

<P>
   ROMANCE-FILM (Rotterdam, the Netherlands) _ If you can't dazzle
them, shock them!'' the adolescent heroine of Catherine Breillat's
1989 film ``36 Fillette'' declares, with a glance at her own daring
decollete. Could that be the French director's motto? Ms. Breillat,
who is 50, is no stranger to scandal. From her first novel, written
when she was 17, to her most recent film, ``Romance,'' her candid
dissections of human sexuality have ignited debate at home and
abroad. ``Romance'' enjoyed a noisy premiere last month at the
International Film Festival here alongside a retrospective of Ms.
Breillat's six previous films. (``Romance'' is being shown as part
of the series ``Rendez-Vous with French Cinema Today'' at the
Walter Reade Theater on Friday and next Sunday and has just been
acquired by Trimark Pictures for an American release.). By Leslie
Camhi.

<P>
   KUBRICK-FILMS (Undated) _ When Stanley Kubrick died a week ago,
he left behind the monolith from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' as the
single most salient image of his career. This (who could forget?)
ws the dark, austere object that arrived in the midst of primitive
ape-men. It drove them into a state of high anxiety as they rallied
around the thing, touched it, recoiled, tried to fathom it, sensed
its intense power without quite grasping what that power might
mean. The arrival of each new mind-blowing Kubrick film was much
the same. By Janet Maslin.

   DLUGOSZEWSKI-DANCE (New York) _ It's not often that someone
starts making dances after turning 60. Lucia Dlugoszewski, who
makes her choreographic debut on March 23 at Playhouse 91, is not a
total neophyte, though. A seasoned composer and musician, she
carried on a creative partnership, and marriage, with the
choreographer Erick Hawkins for more than 40 years. After Hawkins
died, Ms. Dlugoszewski set about staging three pieces outlined in a
notebook he kept at his deathbed. Mikhail Baryshnikov's White Oak
Dance Project performed the first of these posthumous works,
``Journey of a Poet,'' to mixed reviews at the Brooklyn Academy of
Music in 1997. The Hawkins company will present the two others
during its one-week run at Playhouse 91, which wraps up the 92d
Street Y's monthlong Harkness Dance Project. By Christopher
Reardon.

   ARTHUR-MITCHELL-DANCE (New York) _ It is a landmark year for
Arthur Mitchell. In the coming months, he will be celebrating his
50th year in dance, the 30th anniversary of The Dance Theater of
Harlem and his 65th birthday. Dressed in a black silk shirt, black
jacket and black slacks, he makes as striking an impression now as
he did as a principal dancer with the New York City Ballet in the
1950s and 60s. On his bookcase in his office are photographs of
himself with Balanchine, another with Jacqueline Kennedy at the
White House and a more recent shot with President Clinton in 1993,
when Mitchell won the Kennedy Center Honors. By Valerie Gladstone.

feminist shadings, by Eva Le Gallienne, Geraldine Page, Maggie
Smith, Glenda Jackson, Jane Alexander and Dianne Wiest, among
others. ``What Hamlet is to men, Hedda is, in some ways, to
women,'' said Annette Bening, the latest Hedda, who has found the

   MOVIE-TRAILERS (Los Angeles) _ The major studios are finally
bowing to the will of the people: They're turning down the volume

volume is too high on those previews that come on before the main
attraction. And some theater owners have taken to turning down the
volume on trailers, which is great for getting through a whiz-bang,
special-effects-loaded trailer, but makes dialogue nearly
impossible to hear. But don't expect the volume to be lower the
next time you go to the multiplex; most trailers for the summer are
already in the can. By Dave McNary. (Will move in the ``f''

   BEIJING _ Song Pengfei passes his days in a spare 12- by 12-foot
room moving from a bed with a red-checked blanket, to a chair, to a
donated computer. His parents, their lives crammed into the
adjacent sitting room, spend their days worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Shy to begin with, the soft-spoken 17-year-old says his energy
and spirits are just ``so-so.'' He fainted recently on a street
nearby and lay on the ground until an elderly stranger rescued him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost never go out,'' he said longingly. ``I read. I listen
to music. I go on the Internet to learn about AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Song Pengfei is one of a small but growing number of Chinese
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS _ in a country that
is largely unprepared emotionally, financially and medically to
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became infected in February 1998 after a blood
transfusion at a hospital near his poor rural hometown, he has been
kicked out of a school that was afraid to teach him and from
hospitals that refused to treat him. A thin, angular young man who
looks like he stepped out of a Modigliani painting, he has endured
the same biting discrimination that Ryan White encountered in rural
Indiana when he was forced to leave his school in the early 1980's
_ with much the same beatific stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a crucial difference: The Song family knows that
half a world away, American doctors now routinely prescribe an
expensive regimen of pills that can help their son. In fact,
Pengfei is one of a handful of Chinese who have tried the ``AIDS
cocktail,'' with dramatic results. And now, the Songs are
desperately trying to force the hospital that gave him tainted
blood or the government to pay for the pills _ a gargantuan task in
a country where the public health system is in tatters, few have
health insurance, and there are few legal remedies for medical
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to expose this _ and I'm attached to the
country, the Party, the people,'' said Song Xishan, Pengfei's
father, an unemployed factory worker who wears a mask of depression
as he tensely casts spent cigarette butts on to the floor. ``But we
are at a critical juncture _ the medicine we have is about to run
out _ and I have to think about my child.''
</P>
<P>
   China's HIV problem is still relatively small _ only an
estimated 300,000 people have the virus in the entire population of
1.2 billion, according to the Ministry of Health, and most are not
sick. About 9 percent, including Pengfei, contracted the disease
from unscreened blood transfusions; the vast majority are
intravenous drug users, according to Dr. Cao Yunzhen, an
American-trained expert at China's National Center of AIDS
Prevention and Control.
</P>
<P>
   But despite recent prevention efforts, the numbers are rising
quickly. Meanwhile, AIDS specialists are still rare, and
discrimination and public ignorance widespread. China lacks two
crucial ingredients that have improved the status and health of
Americans with HIV _ a community of outspoken advocates and cash.
</P>
<P>
   The Songs' apartment in Beijing is a relentlessly glum place
where hours pass without a glimmer of a smile. Pillows are made
from old clothes found by the roadside. The rent and meals are
donated by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with a minor accident in their rural hometown in
Shanxi province, when Pengfei threw himself down on a couch to
watch television and gashed his thigh on a pair of scissors his
father had left there.
</P>
<P>
   A local doctor gave Pengfei a shot of penicillin and eight
stitches. But 12 days later the area was still swollen, so the
Songs went to a hospital in the nearby city of Linfen; doctors
there said the boy needed minor surgery to clean out the gash.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the surgeon advised, Song should go buy blood, since
Pengfei was mildly anemic and would need a transfusion before the
operation. Instead of using the city blood bank _ which the doctor
said carried ``outdated blood'' _ he offered to introduce the Songs
to a so-called blood boss, a middleman who would find a villager to
donate.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, China outlawed such blood sales, which have long
been a common source of both blood and income in rural communities.
Official blood banks are supposed to screen blood for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Feb. 18, 1998, Song gave the blood boss $40
and Pengfei received 300 cubic centimeters of blood drawn from a
husky 19-year-old surnamed Qi. When Pengfei's simple surgery that
afternoon unexpectedly resulted in near-fatal bleeding, the doctor
instructed Song to buy another liter.

STUDIES POINT TO INCREASE IN FLU VACCINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Broader use of flu vaccine could prevent needless
hospitalizations and deaths among people with chronic illnesses,
and could reduce the chance of health care workers spreading the
potentially dangerous disease to vulnerable patients, two new
studies suggest.
</P>
<P>
   A government panel, meanwhile, is weighing whether to recommend
routine flu shots for larger groups of Americans. One proposal on
the table is to lower the universal vaccination age from 65 to 50.
</P>
<P>
   At present, annual flu vaccination is recommended for people
older than 65, and for people of any age who have certain chronic
diseases, including diabetes, heart, lung or kidney disease, and
HIV infection. These people are at higher risk of complications and
death from flu, which kills 10,000 to 40,000 people a year and
causes 200,000 hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to these groups, annual shots are advised for health
care workers who care for frail patients.
</P>
<P>
   However, flu vaccination rates are low among health care workers
and people under 65 with chronic illnesses, said Dr. W. Paul
Glezen, a preventive medicine specialist at Baylor College of
Medicine in Houston, in an editorial accompanying the new reports
in the Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have poor immunization coverage for people under 65,'' said
Glezen. Rates among health care workers are estimated to range from
16 to 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One of the new studies was carried out among Tennessee women
between ages 15 and 64 enrolled in Medicaid from 1974 to 1993. The
researchers, headed by Dr. Kathleen Maletic Neuzil of the
University of Washington, sought to determine how much death and
illness in this age group is attributable to complications of flu _
and therefore would be preventable, in large part, by routine flu
immunization.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers counted the number of deaths and
hospitalizations that occurred during the flu season from pneumonia
and other lung and heart complications, and compared that figure
with the numbers that occurred outside the flu season.
</P>
<P>
   Women ages 15 to 44 who were high-risk because of chronic
diseases had 23 ``excess'' hospitalizations and deaths (ones that
were blamed on influenza) per 10,000 women. And women 45 to 64 had
58 flu-related hospitalizations and deaths per 10,000 women. A
smaller, but significant, number of hospitalization and deaths
occurred among healthy women in both age groups.
</P>
<P>
   The study results, said Neuzil in an interview, suggest that
extending universal flu shot recommendations down to age 50 ``is
very legitimate'' because it should prevent some of the illness and
deaths. Even the healthy, or low-risk, people should be vaccinated
``because even if they don't end up in the hospital, they may
spread it to high-risk family members,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The second study involved 264 health care professionals, mainly
medical residents, at two Baltimore hospitals who agreed to be
assigned by the flip of a coin to receive a flu shot or a dummy
injection. Their health was monitored over three flu seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The rate of flu infection was 15 percent among the residents who
got placebo shots, but only 2.3 percent among those who got an
actual flu shot each year. The vaccine also reduced the number of
lost work days by 53 percent and the number of days of illness
accompanied by fever by 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Glezen, the Baylor researcher, noted that health professionals
are advised to get flu shots, ``and most of them agree it's a good
idea, but they don't get around to doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Achieving greater flu vaccine compliance, he said, will require
creative ways of making the shots convenient and routine. He
mentioned one innovative program in a Texas city in which
children's immunization records are computerized and when they are
due for another shot, an automated system sends out a letter to the
home and, subsequently, an autodialer calls them and leaves a
recorded message.

BEIJING: another liter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although Pengfei survived _ Song believes the surgeon cut an
artery _ the doctors told the Songs to rush Pengfei by overnight
train to Beijing to consult specialists. The family was much
relieved when experts wielding sophisticated diagnostic equipment
at a military hospital in the capital declared their son would be
fine, Song said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, when orderlies did not take Pengfei to an
important test and doctors failed to report lab results, the family
suspected a problem. And just two weeks later, the doctors abruptly
announced that Pengfei would have to be moved to an infectious
disease hospital; his blood tests had revealed hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Song protested: Why should his son leave the hospital that could
best treat his leg when hepatitis is so commonplace in China? Only
then did the doctors pull him aside: Pengfei had HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard of it,'' said Song. ``I knew that it was a
terrible disease that made you thinner and thinner until you became
a skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, the family's life has been defined by a mad
scramble for money and by massive rejection _ by officials,
friends, colleagues, even doctors and nurses. It started the next
day, when Pengfei was sent to the outpatient department of the
infectious disease hospital for a specialized blood test. When he
returned, the nurses refused to give him a bed in the ward.
Penniless, the Songs slept in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Pengfei was admitted to Beijing's Ditan
Hospital, home to one of China's few specialized HIV programs,
where the Songs quickly exhausted their savings on tests and
treatments. And although Pengfei's leg was healing nicely, his
energy and appetite were succumbing to the virus. Dr. Xu Keyi, an
infectious disease specialist who had trained in the United States,
suggested they try the American medicines _ if the family could
raise $16,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unthinkable sum for the couple, more than most Chinese
earn in a lifetime. By April, the family, out of money, returned to
Linfen, where Song hoped that he could press officials to clarify
how his son had gotten HIV and then get the local health bureau to
help pay for Pengfei's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Their homecoming was a nightmare. Local doctors descended on the
family home to examine Pengfei wearing masks, gowns and gloves.
When they left, they dropped the protective gear in a pile outside
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right away the villagers knew about Pengfei's problem,''
recalled Song.
</P>
<P>
   The school where Pengfei had studied computers and English
refused to let him re-enroll. Hospital nurses would not give him
infusions. The Songs found an old friend, a doctor, to do it. But
when he had to leave town briefly and asked his wife, a nurse, to
fill in, she ran out of the house screaming when she learned the
boy had HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers sent petitions to the local government demanding
that the family be expelled, and the Songs knew it was time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time Song had made some progress: The local public
security bureau disclosed that the blood donor, now in prison for
theft, had tested positive for HIV. With prodding from a lawyer,
the local hospital agreed to give the family $12,500 for drugs and
$2,500 to start a new life in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Pengfei started taking the powerful anti-HIV
medications and within a month his viral load, a measurement of
virus levels in his bloodstream, had dropped from 400,000 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' Song said. ``He was eating, he had energy,
he would walk around.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved into a two-room apartment in southeastern Beijing,
supported at first by the Shanxi provincial government and, when
that money dried up, by donations. A spate of stories in the
Chinese press produced a few gifts, including the computer for
Pengfei.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a hand-to-mouth existence for the Songs, who are
officially rural residents and therefore cannot readily work in
Beijing. And doctors at Ditan Hospital have advised the family that
they will need to raise more than $20,000 within the coming months
to continue Pengfei's treatment after May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Song spends his days tirelessly lobbying for justice and money.
A little black book meticulously documents how on Feb. 1, for
example, he wrote to China's Health Minister, Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin, and Li Ruihuan of the Communist Party Standing
Committee. He has gotten no responses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Linfen say they cannot afford that kind of cash _
more than the annual budget of small hospital in China. But with
the case gaining attention from Chinese reporters, a delegation
from Linfen is in Beijing this week negotiating some compensation.
The officials have advised the Songs to take Pengfei back home for
treatment, where it would be less costly. But the Songs scoff at
returning to a place that so viciously rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   As Pengfei watches his supply of pills dwindle, a curtain of
gloom descends on the apartment. Said his father: ``He has become
so depressed worrying about his medicine.''

THE YO-YO IN POP CULTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Almost anything can worm its way into pop culture, and the yo-yo
is no exception. There's even a famous cellist, Yo-Yo Ma. Here are
some other places where the yo-yo had popped up (and down):
</P>
<P>
   _ The all-time Yo-Yo Man is, of course, Tommy Smothers of the
Smothers Brothers, who would do yo-yo tricks onstage while his
brother Dick narrated.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Yo-Yo'' was a big hit for the Osmond Brothers in the early
'70s.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Holmes and Yoyo'' was a short-lived TV sitcom that ran from
Sept. 25 to Dec. 11, 1976. It starred John Schuck Gregory ``Yoyo''
Yoyonovich, a 427-pound robot who was also a cop.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``I Wanna Be a Cowboy,'' by one-hit wonder '80s band Boys
Don't Cry, contains the line ``yo, yo, yippie-yo-yo.''
</P>
<P>
   _ One of Echo and the Bunnymen's songs is ``Yo-Yo Man.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Yo-Yo, a female rapper who's a protege of Ice Cube, had a hit
in the early '90s with ``You Can't Play With My Yo-Yo.'' (She no
doubt was featured on ``Yo! MTV Raps!'')
</P>
<P>
   _ In ``Ernest Goes to Africa'' (1997), Ernest P. Worrell somehow
winds up with some stolen diamonds, which he makes into a yo-yo.

WITH NEW MAGAZINE, CAROLYN SANDERS TURNS A PAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carolyn Sanders believes in the value of quiet, still moments,
that time she takes each day alone, to get to know who she is and
to tell God those things only he can hear.
</P>
<P>
   As a recently divorced mother of two and the editor and
publisher of Link Magazine, a new publication aimed at
African-American Texans, she says she has much to talk over with
him and will not make a move without consulting him first.
</P>
<P>
   It's what she did when she needed to find a new home for herself
and her two children two years ago after separating from Cowboys
cornerback Deion Sanders. And it's what she did more recently when
she wanted to do something with her life, to make it count.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked the Lord to show me something to do that I would enjoy
and something I could be successful at,'' Sanders said in a
telephone interview recently from her Houston office.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after her talk with God, Sanders was getting her hair
done and met Rose-Mary Tucker, an entertainment promoter, who spoke
of her dream to start a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought this was a sign for me,'' Sanders said. `I didn't
have a journalism degree, but starting a magazine stayed on my
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Today the women _ Tucker as vice president and chief operating
officer and Sanders as the founder, publisher and editor in chief _
head Link Magazine, a slick monthly publication they hope will
connect African-American communities across the state. Link is
available at more than 500 bookstores, airport, grocery chains and
convenience store outlets in Houston, San Antonio and the
Metroplex, and has a circulation of 100,000.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, 33, said that research showed that though there were
black magazines in Houston, none of them circulated beyond the
city's boundary. That, she thought, left a big void that needed to
be filled.
</P>
<P>
   And so with a small business loan, Link Magazine came into
being, and now has a staff of 11 full-time employees.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine debuted in January at 56 pages. The current issue
features an interview with basketball greats Clyde Drexler and
Avery Johnson; Dr. Joye Carter, Houston's first female
African-American medical examiner; and the UniverSoul Circus, an
African-American company owned and operated by Big Top Circus.
Marketing efforts include radio spots in the magazine's target
markets and promotional booths at events such as concerts and a
sports fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said she wanted to create a product that all blacks,
regardless of age, gender and socioeconomic status, could enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are the avenue for the advertisers who want to reach Texas'
$24 billion annual African-American market,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Aadvertisers include Noel Furniture store of Houston, a variety
of minority small businesses and Texas Southern University. No
long-term contracts have been signed yet, though.
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, a San Antonio native who has a bachelor's degree in
psychology and was once executive director and co-owner of Players
Network, a sports entertainment show, said starting a magazine is
in keeping with her desire to provide a service to the black
community.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very spiritual person who puts God first in my life and
cares for others,'' she said. ``That's why in addition to the
magazine, I'm going to start the Prime Life Foundation here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders founded the nonprofit organization in Dallas to help
relieve the economic uncertainty that can make it difficult for
working-class families to stay together. She closed its doors when
she moved from Dallas to Houston two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For now, her time is divided among the magazine, her children _
8-year-old Deiondra and 5-year-old Deion Jr. _ and her church,
Abundant Life Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since coming to Houston, I have a good life,'' she said. ``I'm
at home. I have peace of mind, because I don't dwell on the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders, who divorced her husband in February 1998, said that
she had a very good marriage with the football great in the
beginning, but that they grew apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happen for a reason and you just have to make the best
of the rest of your life,'' she said.

CLINTON PRAISES U.S. TROOPS IN HONDURAS FOR HURRICANE RELIEF
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ President Clinton visited American
troops involved in relief efforts in Honduras on Tuesday in an
effort to dramatize the new security relationship between the
United States and Central America.
</P>
<P>
   No longer are thousands of American soldiers and covert agents
engaged in not-so-secret wars on leftist insurgents, the president
underscored with his appearances with U.S. forces involved in
hurricane-relief projects. American troops in Central America today
are social workers in fatigues, clearing highways, providing
shelter and immunizing children.
</P>
<P>
   The president told the troops here that their job today was
building bridges, physical and metaphorical, between the people of
the United States and the peoples of Central America.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visited the site of the Juan Ramon Molina Bridge in
Tegucigalpa, the Honduran capital, where a 44-year-old span over
the Choluteca River washed away on Oct. 31 in the floods of
Hurricane Mitch. In February, a Marine detachment installed a
230-foot-long steel-panel bridge to reopen a critical commercial
link between Tegucigalpa and its sister city, Comayaguela.
</P>
<P>
   The destructiveness of the floods is evident along the riverbed,
where dozens of structures were smashed by the onrushing waters,
and debris remains scattered high along the banks.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Tuesday, at Soto Cano Air Base, 60 miles from here,
Clinton praised the ``courage, competence and compassion'' of the
500 American military personnel of Joint Task Force Bravo, which is
helping Honduras recover from the hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have shown the people of Central America the true colors
of our men and women in uniform,'' Clinton told the troops, who
interrupted his 15-minute talk eight times with lusty war whoops.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the National Security Council, Michael Hammer,
said the American relief efforts had changed the way Central
Americans look at the United States and its military forces. They
are no longer seen as partners in their governments' repression,
Hammer said, but as sources of aid at a difficult time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, there has been apprehension in the past about the
U.S. military,'' Hammer said. ``But the way we responded
immediately through our military to provide assistance has cast a
new light on the U.S. military, a positive light.''
</P>
<P>
   The president said that the mission, Operation Fuerte Apoyo, or
Strong Support, was one of the largest relief efforts undertaken by
the military since the Berlin Airlift 50 years ago. At its peak,
5,600 American troops were in Honduras, which bore the brunt of the
hurricane rains.
</P>
<P>
   More than 5,600 Hondurans were killed by the storm. An
additional 8,000 are missing; 82,000 houses were destroyed, and 2.1
million of the population of 6 million were displaced.
</P>
<P>
   Although the United States has committed $420 million to relief
efforts, Clinton said, ``I believe the United States should do
more.'' He has proposed an additional $956 million. The request is
hung up in Congress in a dispute over the source of the money.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the Soto Cano audience was Chief Warrant Officer Noble
Calloway, a veteran of 32 years in the Marines, who is deputy
director of civil-military operations for the U.S. forces here. He
supervises troops that are repairing roads, building bridges,
digging wells, providing medical care and delivering food and
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Trained as an infantryman, Calloway said his job now is a
welcome change from the combat that he saw in Vietnam and projects
a better image for the Marine Corps, whose training emphasizes
killing with efficiency and dispatch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I definitely know that end of it,'' said Calloway, who is on a
three-month tour here from his post at the Anacostia Naval Station
in Washington. ``This is, after all those years, totally different.
It's more fulfilling, because you're actually helping people.''
</P>
<P>
   He served in Bosnia, where the residents at first met American
troops with suspicion. He said he had not encountered any
anti-American sentiment in the 37 days he has been here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot nicer to go home and talk about how you helped a
country rebuild,'' Calloway said, ``rather than talk about the
death and destruction you've seen and taken part in.''

LYCOS-USA DEAL WEAKENED AS DIRECTOR QUITS BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The controversial merger between Internet company Lycos Inc. and
USA Networks Inc. is teetering on the brink of ruin, after a key
director quit Lycos's board and launched a vocal attack on terms of
the deal .
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the resignation of David Wetherell could be a
critical turning point in the proposed merger. Lycos could be
forced to renegotiate the deal or seek another merger partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``After further consideration, it is my opinion that the terms
of the USA/Lycos transaction are inadequate for Lycos
shareholders,'' said Wetherell, chief executive of CMGI Inc., an
Andover, Mass. venture capital company that is Lycos's biggest
investor, with a stake of about 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``As such, I am resigning from the Lycos board in order to be
free to explore the best options available to Lycos shareholders,
including the possibility of Lycos remaining independent,'' said
Wetherell.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's certainly a greater chance that the deal is in
trouble, given that the other investors have now found a rallying
point,'' said Ullas Naik, Internet analyst for First Albany Corp.
in Boston. Naik said he knows of a number of institutional
shareholders who are angry about the Lycos-USA transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Lycos stock soared $12 3/8 Tuesday to $96 1/4, as
investors bought shares, hoping for a new, more profitable deal.
CMGI shares declined $5 1/4 to $194 7/16, and USA Networks lost
13/16 to end at $37 11/16..
</P>
<P>
   The deal, announced on Feb. 9, would merge Lycos, of Waltham,
Mass., with a number of USA Networks businesses, including the Home
Shopping Network television network; its related Internet Shopping
Network; Ticketmaster, which sells tickets to major public events ;
and Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, which delivers tickets, as well
as travel and entertainment information, over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   USA Networks chief executive Barry Diller and Bob Davis, chief
executive of Lycos, had hailed the plan as an Internet deal that
would generate $1.2 billion in revenues in its first year. They
also stressed that while other Internet firms don't have the
real-world assets necessary to sell retail goods to millions of
people, the new USA-Lycos company would be able to use the Home
Shopping Network's established product delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   But shareholders were not impressed. They had seen the vast
premiums paid for other Internet companies, such as the $4.56
billion that Yahoo Inc. is paying for GeoCities, a business that
lets people create their own Web pages. CMGI owned a sizable stake
in GeoCities and is expected to net about $1 billion from that
deal.
</P>
<P>
   The USA-Lycos transaction is far different. Shareholders of New
York-based USA Networks will own 56.5 percent to 61.5 percent of
the new company, while Lycos shareholders will get 30 to 35
percent. Lycos investors complained that the deal valued their
shares too cheaply, and felt that they would have gotten a better
deal if Lycos had been acquired by one of the major media companies
that had also been negotiating with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos stock plunged over 30 percent after the deal was
announced. It had reached a high of $137 on Feb. 5, just before the
announcement. Monday, it sank to a low of 83 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   When the deal was announced, Wetherell had backed the deal. But
two days later, CMGI said that it wouldn't back the transaction
given the stock's dramatic drop. Later that day, CMGI moderated its
position but reserved the right to back out of the deal. Tuesday,
Wetherell exercised that right.
</P>
<P>
   CMGI has hired Morgan Stanley to press other shareholders for
changes on the Lycos merger, Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like he's been pounding on the wall, saying
`Listen to me,' and this is the only way he can get more
attention,'' said Michael Goldston, principal of Cambridge Equity
Advisors Inc. in Nashville, Tenn., and an opponent of the current
deal. Goldston's firm owns about 100,000 shares in Lycos and about
65,000 shares in CMGI.
</P>
<P>
   Wetherell's resignation raised the prospect that Lycos might
back out of the USA deal and resume talks with other suitors.
Industry watchers have said that Time Warner Inc., the German media
firm Bertelsmann, and the NBC television network had all expressed
an interest in acquiring the firm.
</P>
<P>
   It's also conceivable that Lycos could seek better terms from
USA Networks. But during a computer industry conference in New York
last week USA Networks' Diller said he had no intention of
renegotiating the terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Diller could not be reached for comment Tuesday. Charles Conn,
chief executive of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, one of the USA
Networks companies involved in the deal, remained hopeful that
something could be worked out. He argued that Wetherell's public
repudiation of the deal might actually prompt investors to take a
closer look. ``Anything that provides some greater attention to the
deal will only help people understand why the deal makes sense,''
Conn said.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' Davis could not be reached for comment. His spokeswoman,
Michelle Perry, said that Davis remained confident that the
transaction would go through.

PANEL DELAYS ACTION ON MEDICARE REFORM PROPOSALS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Unable to reach consensus, a blue-ribbon commission charged with
recommending Medicare reforms has delayed action for a week, hoping
to use the time to pull together a last-minute compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Tuesday illustrates the devilish complexity of
the commission's task: to overhaul Medicare, and to avert the
financial crisis of the federal health insurance program for 39
million elderly and disabled Americans, which could run out of
money as early as 2008.
</P>
<P>
   The closely watched commission is contemplating a package of
far-reaching reforms that includes increasing the eligibility age
from 65 to 67 years; requiring seniors, particularly wealthier
seniors, to pay more for their care; further cutting payments to
hospitals and doctors; and giving private insurance plans a greater
role in caring for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of moving pieces right now,'' said Senator
John Breaux, chairman of the 17-member commission and a Louisiana
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest pieces being debated is how to pay for the
$210-billion annual program, whose tab is expected to grow
dramatically over the next several decades. President Clinton and
some commission members, including Stuart Altman, a professor of
health policy at Brandeis University, are arguing that 15 percent
of the projected federal budget surplus be dedicated to Medicare.
But others on the commission loudly disagree, saying the surplus
should instead finance a tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Senator Bill Frist (R-Tenn) also argued that the use of surplus
funds would give people a false sense of security about the
financial soundness of the Medicare program. ``That takes the
pressure inappropriately off the commission to address the
fundamental challenge of Medicare going bankrupt,'' Frist said.
</P>
<P>
   Another stumbling block is prescription drugs, which is
currently not covered by Medicare. Altman and others are lobbying
for a drug benefit that would be available to all Medicare
beneficiaries, but conservatives on the commission say the cost of
such a broad benefit would be prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
   A third area of conflict is geographic distribution of vast
amounts of Medicare funds, according to Altman. Providers in
Boston, for example, are reimbursed at a higher rate than, say,
Portland, Ore., for the same care. Whether such disparities are
fair is the subject of much debate, Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't seen any numbers on how different areas would be
affected,'' Altman said.
</P>
<P>
   Breaux requires 11 votes to produce a consensus report to
Congress. He has 10 and is frantically juggling to come up with his
last vote. Breaux reportedly said the chances of a compromise are
``50-50,'' but commission members privately say a consensus is
further away than ever.
</P>
<P>
   The commission is expected to meet for a final time next week to
vote on a package of reforms.

 By PATRICK E. TYLER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW ORLEANS _ Whether over grits and eggs at his favorite diner
or before a jury, Wendell Gauthier is so self-effacing that he
would be the first to admit the many malapropisms that pop out of
his mouth, like the time he lamented a cattle investment because so
many cows died of ``amtraks.'' Or the time he characterized another
lawyer's argument as the height of ``epitome.''
</P>
<P>
   His homespun and seemingly guileless demeanor before juries,
something he perfected while teaching high-school math and science
before he went to night law school, has made him famous _ and rich
_ from big jury awards. In February, he stood before a mock jury
practicing how he would ask for $10 million to compensate a seaman
for a ruined kneecap and bad back from an on-the-job accident in
the Gulf of Mexico. The jurors said his argument was so persuasive
he should have asked for $20 million.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, there is nothing guileless about this
up-from-the-country lawyer endowed with a mischievous Cajun charm
and the twangy Francophone drawl of southern Louisiana. Over the
last five years, Gauthier (pronounced goat-CHAY) has organized the
largest ever group of American trial lawyers and led them in a
sustained assault against the tobacco industry for the damage
caused by nicotine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   Though he claims to be neither the smartest nor the richest of
the trial lawyers who have taken on the tobacco industry, he is the
architect and chairman of a growing legal enterprise that is
mounting a similar assault on the gun industry, seeking to force
gun makers to install safety locks on every weapon they sell. Of
the five cities that have sued gun manufacturers this winter for
their alleged culpability in the proliferation of handgun violence,
Gauthier recruited one, New Orleans, and serves as a consultant to
another, Atlanta. A half-dozen other major cities are talking to
Gauthier about joining the fray.
</P>
<P>
   The rise of Gauthier and his colleagues as a national legal
phenomenon is a surprising illustration of the rapidly evolving
business of mass litigation, with its broad syndication of legal
and financial resources and political clout across an industry
better known for flamboyant mavericks. These well-organized
courthouse crusades hold the potential to change laws and make
national policy affecting public welfare on issues where
congressional and legislative action remains blocked by a lack of
consensus, fierce lobbying or political contributions financed by
large corporate interests.
</P>
<P>
   Some business and political leaders fear that trial lawyers
nationwide, armed with billions of dollars in fees earned thus far
from tobacco industry settlements, are out to usurp legislative
prerogatives through class-action lawsuits on a whole range of
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where lobbying has gotten so intense and money has gotten so
great that they can't legislate,'' Gauthier said, ``I think
legislatures need our help.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, 56, and some of his colleagues assert that if their
model of large-scale litigation proves successful, they will expand
it by bringing actions against the chemical industry over the
contamination of drinking water and against the health care
industry over negligence and abuse in managed-care programs.
</P>
<P>
   They have been shopping not just for individual clients but for
state and municipal governments willing to litigate. And they have
shaped their litigation strategies to focus on compelling questions
of public policy; in part, to immunize themselves from charges that
they are merely ambulance-chasing on a grand scale.
</P>
<P>
   Many government doors have opened because American trial lawyers
as a class are a powerhouse of political financing, one of the
largest single sources of money for the Democratic Party. On the
credenza beside his desk, Gauthier has two framed photographs of
himself with President Clinton. He and his family are prolific
campaign contributors. And Gauthier's friendship with Edwin
Edwards, the former Louisiana governor now under indictment in a
mammoth casino payoff investigation, was so close that Gauthier's
own finances were put under a microscope in the federal inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not the millions Gauthier has made representing
victims of plane crashes and hotel fires that makes him choose his
words carefully these days, it is the billions of dollars that
trial lawyers _ though not Gauthier _ have been awarded in the
first wave of tobacco settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Those awards have led some to question whether trial lawyers are
gold-digging at the public-policy trough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has to make money,'' Gauthier said, ``but at some
point it becomes not just for the money. Everybody alive would love
a situation where they could do good things that accomplish public
good and you are applauded for it and you get paid well for it. I
mean, that's great.''
</P>
<P>
   But his critics say that Gauthier is the epitome of greed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did this with tobacco and they will do it with other
industries if they win here,'' said state Rep. Steve Scalise, a
Republican who is running for Congress in Louisiana to fill the
seat being vacated by Rep. Bob Livingston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless we step in and put a stop to it,'' Scalise said, ``they
will keep on attacking industries that are obeying the law because
it is a source of money for the trial lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Scalise has already filed a bill for the coming legislative
session that would effectively immunize the gun industry from the
lawsuit brought by Gauthier's syndicate on behalf of New Orleans
Mayor Marc Morial. Gov. Mike Foster has promised to sign it into
law if it passes. State legislatures in Georgia and Florida have
introduced similar bills.
</P>
<P>
   The National Rifle Association is mobilizing across the country
to counter the wave of litigation against the gun industry underway
here and in Chicago, Atlanta, Miami and Bridgeport, Conn. Lawsuits
are also under consideration in Newark and Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Fineran, a spokesman for the National Association of
Manufacturers in Washington, said, ``The NAM is very concerned
about where this is going to take us. They have started with two
very disfavored industries, tobacco and guns, and we are concerned
that they are just going to keep going and going.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce announced in February that it would
undertake a nationwide campaign to portray trial lawyers as
self-interested exploiters of the court system, seeking, as
Gauthier's group is, to garner huge fees off of issues that should
be considered more rationally by Congress and by state
legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   But Gauthier and his colleagues say they have a role to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Courtrooms and juries are the safety valves in the pressure
cooker of our democracy,'' says Russ Herman, a former president of
the Association of Trial Lawyers of America and a wealthy New
Orleans lawyer who joined Gauthier in both the tobacco and gun
litigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not end-running the legislature,'' said John Coale, a
Washington lawyer who confers with Gauthier every day on group
strategy ``The legislature has failed.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier is the chairman of the Castano Group, a loose
collection of 65 law firms that in 1994 pooled $100,000
contributions from each firm and launched a broad campaign of
litigation against the tobacco industry for damages related to
nicotine addiction. Separately, another group of wealthy trial
lawyers, led by Richard Scruggs, persuaded Mississippi Attorney
General Michael Moore to sue the industry for the state's cost of
treating smoking-related diseases. Scruggs then recruited more than
three dozen states to join that suit, and they hired more than
fifty law firms to represent them in the battle.
</P>
<P>
   Congress and the White House eventually stepped in, hoping for a
huge settlement that would reimburse state medical costs, pay for
smoking-cessation projects and end cigarette marketing intended to
appeal to youth.
</P>
<P>
   A legislative settlement under which the tobacco industry would
have paid out $368 billion for health and education programs
collapsed last summer.
</P>
<P>
   But with so many states suing the industry, the tobacco
companies last fall agreed to a $206 billion settlement with 46
states and five U.S. territories. The money will be paid out over
25 years as reimbursement for states' smoking-related medical
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier is quick to say that he has yet to be paid a nickel
from the tobacco industry because the Castano Group lawsuits in 26
states were not covered by the deal. Those class-action lawsuits
seek damages for smoking addiction and have suffered several
judicial setbacks. A decision in February by the Louisiana Supreme
Court validated Castano's class-action petition, clearing the way
for the first trial on nicotine addiction in April in state court.
</P>
<P>
   Litigating on so many fronts has turned Gauthier into as much
politician as lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   The Castano Group has been forced to develop a lobbying strategy
to explain its goals in Congress, at the White House, in state
legislatures, in the news media and to local chambers of commerce.
It sends lawyers out to make presentations to cities contemplating
litigation against the gun industry, giving each city the option to
attack guns on safety grounds or on grounds that marketing
practices are a public nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Carter, a respected New Orleans political figure who ran
unsuccessfully for mayor in 1994 and who represents the black
political establishment of the city, was recruited by Gauthier to
become one of the group's spokesmen in Washington and, more
recently, to offer Castano's services to big-city mayors interested
in suing the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a good cause for me,'' said Carter, who had a
$400,000 campaign debt when he joined the group. ``But it also has
to have the possibility of making some money.''
</P>
<P>
   Castano's technology department has converted millions of pages
of tobacco and gun industry documents onto compact disks for easy
retrieval and sharing among law firms around the country. The group
even has an Internet site that advertises for addicted smokers
seeking damages and offers a consumer tobacco litigation kit to
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this as way overdue,'' said Ralph Nader, whose Public
Citizen organization has pressed consumer and public safety
campaigns for three decades, often in close cooperation with trial
lawyers. ``All the pre-conditions are there. What is new is the
level of organization between the lawyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, however, seemed a little skeptical that any new model for
large-scale litigation could succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't consistently do this unless they develop a very
powerful legislative lobbying arm,'' he said, adding, ``They can't
work the courts unless they work the legislatures.''
</P>
<P>
   Concern that well-paid trial lawyers are pre-empting legislative
prerogatives is the heart of the matter for some critics.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is support for the effort in gun safety,'' said New
Orleans City Councilman Oliver Thomas, ``but I am also concerned
with people suing everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is lawyers' fees.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers stand to win billions in legal fees by taking on
whole industries on behalf of millions of plaintiffs. Some already
have struck gold in the tobacco litigation.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers who represented the first three states to settle
with the cigarette makers were awarded $8.2 billion in fees in
December, the largest award of fees in history. Though it will be
paid over 25 years, the award, the first of several related to the
tobacco cases, has prompted criticism that trial lawyers are being
compensated far beyond any reasonable assessment of the value of
the time they have invested.
</P>
<P>
   Even Gauthier was somewhat astounded by the scale of the award.
He predicted that if the Castano Group prevailed, the fees would be
far more modest, perhaps several billion dollars spread over 25
years and 65 law firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of us is going to retire as a result of the tobacco
case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Gauthier has often been straightforward in stating
that he is in it for the money, at the same time speaking
passionately against smoking. The Castano Group is named for Peter
Castano, a longtime friend of Gauthier's who died of lung cancer in
1993 after a life addicted to cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The gun litigation began last fall, after Gauthier discovered
that Morial was willing to sue gun manufacturers over the many
accidental shootings and drug-related gun violence that threatened
New Orleans tourism.
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier dispatched his partner, Daniel Abel, to Washington to
sound out the Center to Prevent Handgun Violence on whether it
would join such a lawsuit with an aim to force the industry to
install safety locks on handguns, rifles and shotguns. The center,
whose chairwoman is Sarah Brady, wife of President Ronald Reagan's
bullet-scarred former press secretary, James Brady, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 30, Gauthier, on behalf of the city of New Orleans, sued
Smith and Wesson Corp.; Beretta, U.S.A.; Colts Manufacturing Co.;
Glock Inc., and a number of other manufacturers, for damages caused
by what he contended was unsafe gun design.
</P>
<P>
   The gun manufacturers have challenged the suit on procedural
grounds, seeking to have it removed from state court to federal
court. A hearing is scheduled to resolve the issue March 31.
</P>
<P>
   The next great issue will be managed health care, said Herman,
whose New Orleans law firm has contributed $6 million in time and
resources to the tobacco litigation with Gauthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Congress has an opportunity to do something about it,''
Herman said, ``but if they don't act, my guess is that in five
years you will see a massive lawsuit brought to destroy and
dismember managed care as it currently operates.''
</P>
<P>
   Gauthier, at times, seems reluctant to predict where the crusade
is going.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have I thought about it since we branched into guns? Yes, he
said, posing and answering his own questions. ``Are there other
public issues that in my view merit this type of litigation?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Water,'' he replies. ``We have a problem right now with
chemicals that are flooding into the water supply and an industry
that again just refuses to address the problem and wants to
litigate rather than resolve.''

CONGRESSIONAL REPUBLICANS GRAPPLING WITH SOCIAL SECURITY PROPOSALS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While Congressional Republicans have endorsed
President Clinton's proposal to set aside the bulk of the surplus
to pay for Social Security, they are struggling to fill in the
blanks of a plan to extend the life of the retirement program.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans have been mulling a number of proposals that
would let individuals invest a portion of the Social Security funds
in the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   But they have a number of major decisions to make in the coming
months as they ready their own plans.
</P>
<P>
   They have to decide whether the private investment money should
come from surplus funds, as the president has proposed, or part of
the payroll tax now dedicated to Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   They also must figure out whether the private investment
accounts would be voluntary or whether to eventually phase them in
for all beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   They must deal with what many predict will be high costs of
administering private accounts. And they also must wrestle with how
to pay for the sizable transition costs of moving from the current
system to an investment-based one.
</P>
<P>
   While many Republicans say their plans will protect retirees
from the gyrations of the stock markets by ensuring minimum
benefits, critics say building in that kind of security is
expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guarantees cost money,'' said Henry Aaron, a Social Security
expert at the Brookings Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron warned that letting individuals invest their Social
Security funds in the market is too great a risk for many people
who will eventually have to rely on that income in their old age or
if they become disabled.
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say that even by conservative estimates investing
in the market will generate far greater returns for beneficiaries
than the current system of having the government put the money in
low yielding government securities.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks and months, Republicans are expected to
unveil proposals based on that assumption.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, will once again introduce
an investment-based plan he hopes will become the basis of the
reform effort in that chamber.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm has proposed that 3 percent of wages be devoted to an
investment-based system, from the 12 percent Social Security tax.
</P>
<P>
   The Gramm plan would be mandatory for new workers but voluntary
for everyone else. The senator has proposed that the surplus be
used to pay part of the transition costs of continuing to pay full
benefits to those enrolled in the old system while tax money is
being diverted to private accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, who has teamed up with Senate Budget Chairman Pete
Domenici, R-N.M., predicted his blueprint will address critics'
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe we can develop a fully funded system'' he said. ``
We think we can do it without having to cut Social Security
benefits and without having to raise taxes.''
</P>
<P>
   On the House side, Ways and Means Chairman Rep. Bill Archer,
R-Texas, has been working with Kenneth Kies, the former head of the
Joint Committee on Taxation and now a consultant with Price
Waterhouse accounting firm, to devise a plan.
</P>
<P>
   While Archer aides would not say what may be in that plan, they
said it would not include President Clinton's proposal to let the
government invest a portion of Social Security funds in the stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Critics claim that such an approach would give the government
too much clout in the private sector and would be susceptible to
political meddling. They fear that lawmakers would put pressure on
the system to either invest or divest in certain companies based on
non-financial factors, such as what products they make or where
they operate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's advisers, however, say they would insulate
Social Security from such meddling by creating an independent board
to make the investments.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers also recently
testified that having the government invest the funds would entail
lower overhead costs than individual accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Some estimates have projected that the administrative costs for
individual private market accounts could be as high as 20 percent
of the investment, at least in the early years.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has also proposed a small private investment program,
which would be funded by dipping into 12 percent of the surplus.
The program, called USA Accounts, would be targeted to middle-class
taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   However, the administration has not provided details of those
accounts, saying they will be forthcoming at a later date.
</P>
<P>
   Both the White House and Congressional Republicans are vowing to
work together to devise Social Security reform but so far the only
substantial area of agreement is setting aside the surplus, which
is projected to be $1.8 trillion over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means spokesman Ari Fleischer said that Archer
attempted to set up a meeting with the president earlier this year
but was rebuffed by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chairman was advised by the White House it was
premature,'' Fleischer said.
</P>
<P>
   With only a slim GOP majority in the House, Fleischer said, the
chairman is hoping to devise a plan that will attract conservative
and moderate Democrats.

   When Stanley Kubrick died a week ago, he left behind the
monolith from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' as the single most salient
image of his career. This (who could forget?) was the dark, austere
object that arrived in the midst of primitive ape-men.
</P>
<P>
   It drove them into a state of high anxiety as they rallied
around the thing, touched it, recoiled, tried to fathom it, sensed
its intense power without quite grasping what that power might
mean. The arrival of each new mind-blowing Kubrick film was much
the same.
</P>
<P>
   Kubrick's small (only eight films after 1960) but amazingly
varied body of work was unified not only by bizarre brilliance but
also by its rare ability to disturb. He anticipated, even
prophesied, all manner of assaults on the soul of mankind, and he
gave voice to its most insidious fears, about the corruption of
``vital bodily fluids'' and so much worse.
</P>
<P>
   From the stylized amoral thugs of ``A Clockwork Orange'' (1971)
to the brutalizing military discipline of ``Full Metal Jacket''
(1987) and the rogue technology of ``2001'' (1968), he sensed
profound menace even when he satirized it with that diabolical,
priceless ``Strangelove'' glee.
</P>
<P>
   Though this earned him the reputation of a misanthrope, the
trenchant warnings that he sounded made him a backhanded humanist.
As he once told Gene Siskel, ``You don't have to make Frank Capra
movies to like people.''
</P>
<P>
   So he preferred an eerie formal elegance, a detached and
chill-inducing fascination with detail, to more familiar means of
capturing an audience's attention. Not for him the feel-good mode;
not even feel-bad for the most sobering junctures of his stories.
</P>
<P>
   The Kubrick style was defiantly, mesmerizingly feel-strange,
whether in Thackeray's England by intricate candlelight (``Barry
Lyndon,'' 1975) or amid the quintessential case of cabin fever
(``The Shining,'' 1980).
</P>
<P>
   I'm ashamed to admit that my first response to the news of
Kubrick's death was not sorrow, although his is a devastating loss.
Instead, it was a flash of hope that he had been far enough along
with his film in progress, ``Eyes Wide Shut,'' to leave his full
imprint on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   That is some measure of the anticipation that heralded each rare
surfacing of a Kubrick vision. Each film arrived with its own brave
new world for audiences to explore, its own spell to cast and its
own dark, playful affinity for the cryptic.
</P>
<P>
   These were bona fide event movies, ones that wrought havoc on
the imagination and daringly glimpsed the ineffable. They never
failed to stun, and they were irresistible intellectual catnip for
the viewer.
</P>
<P>
   He delivered these landmark films at a safe, stately distance
from Hollywood whims. ``We can measure Stanley Kubrick's
magnificent, enigmatic retreat,'' the critic David Thomson wrote in
1996, ``by the fact that after 35 years in the English provinces,
with a diminishing flow of work, some of it perilously free from
`genius,' his authority seems none the less.'' And Kubrick noticed
more from this Oz about mass culture than his work ever revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The director Sydney Pollack, who has an acting role in his
friend and colleague's final film, said Kubrick had lately become
fascinated with several Nescafe coffee commercials on English
television, admiring their economy of style and even tinkering with
their editing. ``He had such tremendous curiosity about
everything,'' Pollack said by telephone last week. ``It's very hard
to believe he was 70 years old. There was nothing old about him.
Emotionally, he was a very young man.''
</P>
<P>
   He also was intrigued by the plot conventions of popular fiction
(he liked finding ``good narrative structures buried by bad
writing,'' Pollack said), as someone who sought strong stories but
never wrote original material. Adapting books by authors as varied
as Thackeray, Nabokov and Arthur C. Clarke, he often chose to
reinvent narrative on his own terms, which reached far beyond words
in the ability to conjure mystery.
</P>
<P>
   There are certainly unforgettable lines of dialogue in Kubrick
films (who can forget George C. Scott's ``Strangelove'' general,
Buck Turgidson, acknowledging, of nuclear warfare, ``I don't say we
wouldn't get our hair mussed.''), and unforgettable voices, too
(the soothing duplicity of H.A.L the computer.) But above all, it's
the immaculate otherworldly images that linger.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose perfectionism even entailed re-shooting every
frame of a ``Dr. Strangelove'' print with his Nikon (to make a
pristine version for its 30th anniversary re-release in 1994)
captured the eye as overwhelmingly as he captured the imagination.
His glimpses of the psychic abyss, fierce and devilish as they are,
resemble no one else's.
</P>
<P>
   And neither do his films' rare views of unabashed beauty (as in
the groundbreaking space ballet of ``2001'' and in the droll,
ravishing ``Barry Lyndon'' ).
</P>
<P>
   However different their contexts, these images are part of a
fearless overarching vision. The ``2001'' foretelling of mankind's
antiseptic future and the hatefully jolly ``Clockwork Orange'' rape
are forever linked with the spooky domestic hell of ``The
Shining,'' the military nightmare of ``Full Metal Jacket'' and the
cavernous, much-imitated ``Strangelove'' war room; they are joined
in their chilling anticipation of a cruel, dehumanized world.
</P>
<P>
   If Kubrick told one basic story it was a cautionary tale, laced
with doomsday thoughts but brightened by wild, outrageous humor.
From Jack Nicholson on the ax-wielding rampage to the absurd
torment of James Mason's Humbert Humbert in ``Lolita'' (1962) to
the unfortunate little missile mishap of ``Strangelove,'' he was as
savagely funny as he was conceptually bold.
</P>
<P>
   Among Kubrick's mature films, he never made one _ not even
1960's ``Spartacus'' _ that failed to stagger audiences, one way or
another. And on the evidence of ``Dream Story,'' the
psychologically astute, fiercely erotic Arthur Schnitzler novella
upon which ``Eyes Wide Shut'' is based, he was on the verge of
what, even by Kubrick standards, sounds like extraordinarily daring
work.
</P>
<P>
   But when it arrives, no matter what, its reception must be
bittersweet. Stanley Kubrick is irreplaceable. A truly poetic
imagination is gone.

COURT STRIKES DOWN SAT MEASURE OF STUDENT-ATHLETES' ABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Higher education officials Tuesday defended the need for minimum
academic standards for student athletes, saying that Monday's court
decision striking down minimum admissions scores would return to
the days when colleges and universities admitted athletes who could
build a better team, with little regard to whether those students
could read or write.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court on Monday struck down the minimum SAT scores set
by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for its Division I
schools in 1986, saying the standards discriminated against black
students, who have been shown to perform lower than their white
peers on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested the NCAA find other ways to make sure students were
academically qualified, including perhaps a combination of scores
and grades.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches welcomed the decision _ not because it could allow them
to pull poor academic performers off the bench, they said, but
because the standards had unfairly sidelined promising students.
For many minority and poor students, they said, low scores reflect
poverty, not lack of potential.
</P>
<P>
   But NCAA officials and college presidents who helped set the bar
for the scores reminded the public Tuesday that the rules had been
adopted overwhelmingly by NCAA members, who were horrified at how
college athletic departments were admitting students who had no
chance of academic success. High schools were inflating grades to
win admission for star students, and once in college, many of those
students were being allowed to slide by in gut courses. This might
have helped the team, but only ended up hurting individual students
once their athletic careers ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you return back to the reasons the rule was adopted
overwhelmingly it was to deal with...the exploitation of student
athletes,'' said Kevin Lennon vice president for member service at
the NCAA. ``There's more individuals who because the standards have
been in place have had better success in college because they were
better prepared. The clear point is, the vast majority of students
have been better served by having an eligibility standard.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials recalled the widely-publicized scandals that
prompted the rules, when one student was so ill-prepared he could
not read his college diploma.
</P>
<P>
   While coaches said they welcomed the decision because it would
open up access to disadvantaged students, the decision also set off
a flurry of speculation about its effect on the NCAA basketball
finals, scheduled to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the NCAA operating without any minimum standards for
admission or participation, some speculated that teams could pull
students who had been deemed unqualified under the NCAA standards
off the bench to play in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wethington, president of the University of Kentucky and
chair of the NCAA Executive Committee, said he hoped that wouldn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole situation is too fluid, too undecided, too much at
risk,'' he said, ``and it would be sending absolutely the wrong
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said it would appeal the decision, and also try to come
up with a measure of academic preparedness the court could agree
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other standards that admissions directors will tell
you are more indicative of success in college,'' said Richard
Lapchick, director of the Center for Sport in Society at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo agreed. ``I've
always believed that grade point average and class ranking should
carry the most weight and are a better indicator than test
scores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Davis, the football coach at the University of Miami, said
doing away with minimums based on standardized test scores would
allow students who might not score well to prove that they can
achieve despite their rank on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in who leaves rather than who comes in that's
important,'' he said. ``If you maintain your grades and do your
work, you can get a degree, and that reflects better on a
university than the decision about who they let in before those
students have a chance to prove themselves. It gives athletes an
opportunity to overachieve and cuts down on some of the inequities
in the testing system.''
</P>
<P>
   At FairTest in Cambridge, Mass., which launched the initial
lawsuit, Bob Schaeffer said the NCAA had targeted the wrong people
in setting the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a serious problem over the years, there were very
clearly kids who were being exploited by the system, particularly
minority and low-income students,'' he said. ``But instead of
dealing with the abusers _ the institutions, the coaches, the
administrators, they decided to dump on the next generation of
kids. The rule was discriminatory, the NCAA knew the rule was
discriminatory.''

FRENCH EX-PREMIER ACQUITTED IN HIV-TAINTED BLOOD SCANDAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By CRAIG R. WHITNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ A former prime minister and a member of his Cabinet were
acquitted on Tuesday on charges of criminal negligence and
manslaughter in the deaths of hundreds of people who contracted
AIDS in the mid-1980s from transfusions of tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Laurent Fabius, now speaker of the lower
house of Parliament, and Georgina Dufoix, social affairs minister
in the government that Fabius headed from 1984 to 1986, were
cleared by a specially convened jury of legislators and judges.
</P>
<P>
   Edmond Herve, heath minister under Mrs. Dufoix, was convicted of
two cases of negligence. The court ruled that he should have
ordered untreated blood supplies destroyed as soon as the risk of
their being contaminated with the virus that causes AIDS was known.
</P>
<P>
   But the court imposed no sentence. It could have given Herve up
to five years in prison. But it ruled that the protracted scandal
had deprived him of the right to the presumption of innocence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't have the courage to find me fully innocent,'' Herve,
56, said of the court after the verdict. ``Nor did it have the
courage to convict me really.''
</P>
<P>
   One advocacy group for transfusion victims, the French
Transfusion Association, declared the acquittal of Fabius
``disgraceful'' and the trial ``manipulated and discredited.''
Lower-ranking experts and functionaries had been tried and found
guilty for crimes in the scandal, the group said, but members of
the government were untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politicians are like gangsters,'' a surviving infected victim,
Sylvie Rouy, 35, said. ``Unless you catch them red-handed, you
never get them.''
</P>
<P>
   Herve was found guilty of involuntary injury in Ms. Rouy's case
and of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a 2-year-old
infected by a transfusion given to her mother before the girl's
birth.
</P>
<P>
   That there had been government negligence in screening blood
supplies was never in dispute. But it has taken France more than a
decade to face the question of whether high elected officials
should bear more than political responsibility for their response
to the problem when first confronted with it in the mid-80s.
</P>
<P>
   Holding ministers criminally responsible for official actions
was vigorously disputed. In all, 4,400 people, many hemophiliacs or
others who needed transfusions, contracted AIDS from inadequately
tested blood here from the period when Fabius' Socialist government
was in power. About 40 percent died.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of the dead and others contended that Fabius and his
health officials had deliberately delayed introducing systematic
testing of blood banks for the AIDS virus, even though an American
test developed by Abbott Laboratories was on the market in 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The government, they said, stalled until a French test developed
by Diagnostics Pasteur could be approved for reimbursement by the
state health system.
</P>
<P>
   Fabius vigorously disputed that and testified at the monthlong
trial that he had been unaware of discussions about giving the
French test an edge. He said he had ordered systematic testing as
soon as he was aware that it was available, advancing the date to
Aug. 1, 1985, two months earlier than originally planned.
</P>
<P>
   After the verdict Tuesday, he said, ``The accusations made
against me all these years were shown by the decision to be clearly
unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   Even acquittal, however, left Fabius' political prospects
uncertain. Now 52, he was France's youngest prime minister when he
was named in 1984, and until he was caught up in the scandal, had
been thought a possible candidate for the presidency.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Awkwardness pervaded the trial. Even the prosecution called for
acquitting the three defendants in its summation late last month.
</P>
<P>
   The presiding judge, Christian Le Gunehec, one of three
magistrates in the 15-member court, at one point described the
proceeding as surrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Uneasiness ran across the spectrum Tuesday, from Fabius'
Socialist colleagues to their conservative opponents, whose
legislators outnumbered those from leftist parties on the jury, 7
to 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken as a whole, the health policy of the government of
France from April to September 1985 was catastrophic, as far as the
struggle against the spread of AIDS was concerned,'' the chief
prosecutor, Jean-Francois Burgelin, said. ``Badly informed,
indecisive, pusillanimous, unconscious of the gravity of the
epidemic, those politically responsible for public health did not
rapidly take the measures that could have limited the extent of the
disaster,'' he said in his summation.
</P>
<P>
   But Burgelin concluded that governments always made mistakes.
``Will we one day see the responsible ministers charged before this
court with the deaths of the 2,544 people who have been victims
over the past 30 years of accidents at railroad crossings that
could have been avoided by building bridges, as people are
constantly demanding?'' he asked.

COMMENTARY: A DESIGNATED HERO
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By BOB HERBERT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The streak came to an end in mid-July in Cleveland
beneath the blazing, bluish lights of Municipal Stadium. The crowd
was enormous, 67,468, which at the time was the largest ever to
have seen a night baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio came to the plate four times. He grounded sharply
to deep third base and was thrown out by the terrific Ken Keltner.
He walked. He hit another sharp grounder to third and was thrown
out again by Keltner. In the eighth inning, with the bases loaded,
he hit into a double play. The incredible 56-game hitting streak
was over, but a mythic American hero had been born.
</P>
<P>
   The headlines the next day, July 18, 1941, suggested why. The
sports pages were all about the streak. But an article at the top
of page one in The Times began as follows:

   ``Germany's second offensive against Soviet Russia appeared last
night to have reached its full fury as both sides reported violent
engagements along the entire front. In Berlin, where the High
Command said that the Red Army was desperately throwing its last
reserves into a battle of 9,000,000 men, the official news agency
reported that German forces had taken the key city of Smolensk, on
the road to Moscow.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to that was a headline that said: ``Konoye Forming Cabinet
in Tokyo; Fascist Cast Seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Next to that was a story about the beginning of the second wave
of the military draft in the United States. And below that was a
story about Charles Lindbergh, who, in a letter to President
Franklin Roosevelt, denied having any link to the Axis powers.
</P>
<P>
   It was, to say the least, a harrowing time. Less than five
months after Joe D. went 0 for 3 in Cleveland, the Japanese would
bomb Pearl Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   Joe DiMaggio was tall, handsome, splendidly talented, and a
champion. He was modest and came from a humble background. He was
tough, and yet he was elegant, both on the field and off. He had
class. Americans, still nursing the wounds of the Depression, and
now faced with a World War, could use a guy like Joe. He wasn't a
middle-aged, over-the-hill rascal, like the retired Babe Ruth. And
he wasn't tainted, like Lindbergh.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio carried himself like a hero. A teammate, Vernon
``Lefty'' Gomez, was quoted by the writer Maury Allen as saying:
``He knew what the press and the fans and the kids expected of him,
and he was always trying to live up to that image. That's why he
couldn't be silly in public like I could, or ever be caught without
his shirt buttoned or his shoes shined. He knew he was Joe DiMaggio
and he knew what that meant to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's career, which ran from 1936 to 1951, coincided with
the creation of the colossus that came to be known as postwar
America. He embodied the yearning, the anxieties, the willingness
to struggle endlessly, the unwillingness to accept failure, and the
ultimate resounding triumphs of the men and women of that era. The
great DiMaggio, as a character in Hemingway would call him, became
the designated hero of the colossus, the pre-eminent god of this
secular creation myth.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio played the role to perfection. He was quiet and kept
his defenses up. He never let the real DiMaggio steal a scene from
the idealized hero. He stifled himself. He was aloof, private, at
times reclusive. He smoked three packs of Camels a day. He had
stomach problems. He was human. But when he trotted onto the field
or otherwise appeared in public, he was almost perfect.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired he met and married the goddess of the myth. It
was a mismatch made in heaven. When the marriage ended after only
nine months, Joe was distraught and never really recovered. And
Marilyn was already lost.
</P>
<P>
   As the '50s became the '60s and the '70s and so on, Joe D.
became not the embodiment of the nation's hopes and fears and
triumphs, but of its memories. And after awhile the memories were
only pleasant ones. The frightening headlines have faded and almost
disappeared, replaced by reminiscences of glorious seasons and
simpler times.
</P>
<P>
   The wind blew hard and brutally cold through the South Bronx on
Monday. The flag at Yankee Stadium, snapping in the wind, was
lowered to half-staff. The people who stopped by to pay their
respects didn't have much to say. They knew. The United States
needed a hero and Joe DiMaggio was good enough to oblige. (BOX)

 &HT;    Barr's bill on gun suits draws opposition
 &HT;    By Rebecca Carr
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Georgia Republican Rep. Bob Barr's legislation
banning cities and states from suing gunmakers is creating a
political maelstrom on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, officially unveiled Tuesday, was severely criticized
by lawyers and politicians who say it would take away a fundamental
American right: the right to seek recourse in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's bill is in reaction to lawsuits filed by Atlanta,
Bridgeport, Chicago, Miami-Dade and New Orleans that seek to hold
the gun industry accountable for violent crime on their streets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation is NRA-driven insanity,'' said Sen. Chuck
Schumer (D-N.Y.), pointing out that Georgia is the leading supplier
of guns to out-of-state criminals, according to data kept by the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``Why draft legislation to
protect those who are in the business of arming dangerous
criminals?''
</P>
<P>
   But the bill won support from an array of organizations such as
the Americans for Tax Reform, the National Rifle Association and
the Southern States Police Benevolent Association. In a single day,
two dozen lawmakers signed on, including five Republicans from the
Georgia delegation and three Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If the lawsuits against the gun industry are allowed to
continue, it would set a dangerous precedent for other industries,
said Grover Norquist, head of the taxpayer group. It would mean
that the cities would be allowed to use taxpayer dollars to go
after any industry targeted by trial lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   That was music to Barr's ears.
</P>
<P>
   ``The unholy alliance between trial lawyers, big city mayors and
anti-gun activists is about far more than gun control,'' Barr said.
If the lawsuits are allowed to continue, then it will be a
``Katie-bar-the-door'' situation, said Barr, warning that even the
maker of the Louisville Slugger could face a lawsuit because the
baseball bat has been used to kill people.
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Barbara Boxe (D-Calif.) said she intends to introduce
legislation that would guarantee cities the right to sue gun
manufacturers and distributors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The federal government sends billions of dollars to local
communities to fight crime,'' she said. ``If local governments
believe the fight against crime is being hampered because of a mass
proliferation of guns, I believe it is in the national interest to
allow them to take action in court.''
</P>
<P>
   About 13 states are following Georgia in banning local lawsuits
against gun manufacturers. But Barr, a board member of the NRA,
said a federal law is needed to ensure that gun manufacturers are
treated fairly.
</P>
<P>
   Barr's bill amounts to granting the gun industry special
protection from lawsuits, said Denise Dunleavy, an attorney who won
a $4 million verdict against 15 gun manufacturers last month on
behalf of a shooting victim. ``I think it's an outrage.'' he
said.Rebecca Carr writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,
Atlanta, Ga.

NEW METHOD GIVES EARLY WARNING ABOUT SOLAR FLARES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Solar-Telescope)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe

<P>
   Sometimes the sun blows its stack, sending explosive outbursts
of energy out into space and occasionally right toward Earth. This
can cripple satellites, cause power blackouts, and threaten
astronauts heading into space, but scientists Tuesday reported a
dramatic new find that should help them to see such blasts brewing
a week in advance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a breakthrough discovery in forecasting the largest
explosions in the modern-day solar system,'' said space scientist
George Withbroe.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery came from detailed pictures of the sun's X-ray
emissions, taken by a Japanese-built satellite called Yohkoh, which
revealed that a characteristic S-shaped formation usually appears
on the sun's surface just before these tremendous explosions,
called Coronal Mass Ejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``S marks the spot,'' said Alphonse Sterling of Virginia-based
Computational Physics Inc., who has been working on the project for
the Japanese space science agency ISAS. Whenever these S-shaped
regions appear on the sun, he said, it is ``like a loaded gun that
we know has a high probability of going off.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting explosions unleash as much energy as billions of
nuclear explosions, the scientists said Tuesday at a National
Aeronautics and Space Administration press conference announcing
the discovery.
</P>
<P>
   While such events can occur as often as once or twice a day,
only a small fraction of them are aimed toward Earth, and even
those that do reach us have most of their energy blocked by Earth's
magnetic field so that none reaches the ground in a form that can
directly harm people.
</P>
<P>
   But indirect effects can cause damage, especially as the world
becomes more dependent on electrical power distribution and on
satellites used for communications, navigation, and weather
prediction. A so-called coronal mass ejection ten years ago, for
example, caused a major power blackout in Quebec and temporarily
disrupted some satellites.
</P>
<P>
   That came during the last peak in the sun's 11-year cycle of
activity. The next peak of activity, already starting to build up,
is expected about a year from now.
</P>
<P>
   Astronauts aboard the space shuttle and space stations such as
Mir and the new International Space Station are protected by
Earth's magnetic field. But any astronauts who leave Earth's
environs would be vulnerable to deadly radiation from such solar
outbursts.
</P>
<P>
   During the Apollo moon missions, ``we were lucky that nothing
bad happened,'' said Withbroe, who is NASA's science director for
sun-Earth connections. ``If we go to Mars, we'll have to worry more
than we do now.''
</P>
<P>
   With enough warning, astronauts heading to Mars could simply
ride out the storm by huddling together in a small ``storm cellar''
_ a heavily-shielded compartment inside the spacecraft. But without
such warning, Withbroe said, the radiation from such solar
outbursts ``can be extremely hazardous _ can be deadly, in fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the practical results of the new finding in terms of
enabling better forecasts, it should also help scientists to better
understand how the sun itself works. Many features that can be seen
on the sun's surface, said Richard Canfield, a physicist at Montana
State University, ``are related to events going on deep inside,''
in the same way that volcanos on Earth are related to things going
on deep below.
</P>
<P>
   The S-shaped structures seen on the sun's surface are probably
magnetic field lines emanating from the ``solar dynamo'' at its
center, a swirling mass that theorists believe produces the sun's
intense magnetic field. The S shapes may be places where ``you
twist the magnetic field up like you twist a rubber band, and it's
ready to release,'' said Withbroe.
</P>
<P>
   These distinctive shapes on the surface ``are important because
they give us an indication of the twistedness of the magnetic field
and its likeliness to erupt,'' said Sarah Gibson, a theorist at
Cambridge University in England.
</P>
<P>
   So far, calculations about the amount of energy built up and
expelled by each of these outbursts closely matches calculations
based on theorists' present ideas of the sun's structure, said
David McKenzie of Montana State University. ``It's tending to
confirm a very important, fundamental understanding about the
sun,'' he said. ``It can be developed into a very powerful
prediction tool.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major step forward in understanding these tremendous
storms,'' said Withbroe.

MICROSOFT, OTHERS TO FILE ANTITRUST COMPLAINT AGAINST AIRLINES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
(mk) 
 By MARK HALPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A $14.5 billion giant whose every thundering step shakes the
software industry can be just another money-losing upstart in
electronic commerce, and that makes for an interesting paradox
within Microsoft Corp. While Microsoft the gorilla wrestles the
Justice Department in a landmark antitrust suit, Microsoft the
upstart is asking the same agency to investigate possible antitrust
violations by the nation's airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The company's MSN Expedia is among a group of Web-based travel
agencies that are furious over the airlines' own aggressive online
ticket sales and the slim commissions they pay online agencies. The
group claims that the airlines' practices are keeping most travel
agents off the Web and making business untenable for those who do
venture online.
</P>
<P>
   That, in turn, could eventually drive up fares for consumers by
limiting choice, Microsoft contends.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned things are happening in the marketplace that
are disadvantageous to the online travel agent,'' said Simon
Breakwell, the general manager of Microsoft's travel business unit.
``There are implications for consumer choice, and that would have
implications on price.''
</P>
<P>
   Three travel agency associations representing Microsoft and
other online agents will jointly file an antitrust complaint with
the Justice Department by the end of this month, said Reid Detchon,
executive director of one of the three, the Interactive Travel
Services Association. Microsoft's Breakwell sits on the
association's board and was instrumental in the decision to file.
</P>
<P>
   Joining the association in the complaint will be the American
Society of Travel Agents, of which Microsoft is also a member, and
the Coalition for Travel Industry Parity.
</P>
<P>
   The American Society of Travel Agents' senior vice president for
legal affairs, Paul Ruden, said through a spokeswoman that the
Justice Department filing was ``imminent.'' The society filed its
own complaint in December alleging that airlines were attempting to
control Internet sales.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft apparently sees no contradiction in crossing swords
with the government to protect its monopoly in one industry while
pointing an antitrust finger at a group of heavyweight companies in
another industry. In fact, the group's complaint will be addressed
to Joel Klein, the head of the Justice Department's antitrust
division and the man who masterminded the lawsuit against
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two are entirely unrelated,'' Breakwell said. Suzi LeVine,
Expedia's product manager, added, ``It's just a matter of us being
a part of what is right for consumers and the industry.''
</P>
<P>
   And while Microsoft's general counsel, William Neukom, declined
requests for an interview, a spokesman said the company's
continuing battle with the government ``does not prevent us from
moving forward with our business strategies.''
</P>
<P>
   The travel agency filing is not a suit but a complaint asking
that the government investigate the airlines. At stake is the $29.4
billion that Forrester Research says online consumers will be
paying for airline tickets and other travel products in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   While travel agents sell 80 percent of all airline tickets sold
in the physical world, they sell only 50 percent of all tickets
sold online, said a Forrester analyst, Seema Williams. And even
that share is falling fast. Forrester predicts that online agents'
portion of the Web market will plummet to 25 percent by 2003 as the
airlines step up efforts to sell directly through their own Web
sites.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Most major airlines offer easy-to-use booking procedures on
their sites and entice travelers with Internet-only fare discounts.
For example, US Airways in February offered a Philadelphia-Seattle
round trip for $249. Its 21-day advanced notice rate is $398, and
its full fare is $1,816.
</P>
<P>
   Delta Air Lines threw down a gauntlet earlier this year when it
implemented a $2 surcharge on all flights booked through any means
other than its own Web site. A consumer uproar prompted Delta later
to rescind the fee.
</P>
<P>
   Airlines have been cutting commissions since 1995, forcing many
agents to start charging customers for their services and to
increase their mix of vacation and cruise packages, which earn
higher commission rates. The knife has been particularly sharp for
online agents. Many airlines limit online commissions to $10 for
domestic flights, well below the $50 cap on bookings by agents in
the physical world.
</P>
<P>
   This has added to online travel agencies' red ink. Preview
Travel, the largest publicly held online agency, reported a 1998
loss of $27 million, including a $4.2 million write-down of a
travel-video business, on revenue of $14 million.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's Ms. LeVine would not reveal Expedia's operating
losses, but she described commissions as ``the carrot that gets
pushed further and further away.''
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Jones, president of the Web's most popular travel
agency, Travelocity, called the online commission rates
``penurious,'' claiming that an agency's cost of issuing a ticket
is more than the maximum $10 it earns in commissions. Even so,
Travelocity, a sister company of AMR's American Airlines, is not
joining the complaint. It is owned by Sabre Group, which sells
technology services to other airlines and operates a reservation
systems for travel agents.
</P>
<P>
   Detchon of the Interactive Travel Services Association said
online agents were also concerned about airlines demanding valuable
customer profile information and imposing more stringent conditions
on online agency bookings than they impose on traditional bookings.
For instance, he said, online agents typically can book only four
passengers at a time, whereas traditional agents can book up to
nine at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for American Airlines, UAL's United Airlines and US
Airways declined to comment because they had not yet seen the
proposed complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint will cite an airlines-owned entity called the
Airline Reporting Corp., or ARC, a clearinghouse that helps process
ticket sales. While Kathy Argiropoulos, ARC's vice president and
general counsel, declined to comment on the pending complaint, she
noted that the American Society of Travel Agents lost a complaint
in the early 1990s over ARC rules requiring agents to share sales
data. She also noted that Omega World Travel lost a suit against
ARC and Trans World Airlines over data-sharing policies.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, the society won an $86 million out-of-court
settlement in 1996 after it alleged collusion among airlines in
imposing commission caps.

PEACE TREATY STILL UNSIGNED, GUNFIRE STILL ROCKS KOSOVO

<P>
   BUDAPEST _ Serbs and ethnic Albanians traded gun and mortar fire
in Kosovo Tuesday, while frustrated international mediators
scrambled to get at least one side's signature on a Western-crafted
peace agreement neither the Serbs nor the Albanians like.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have been trying the patience of Western
mediators, who have been repeatedly assured that the Albanian
delegation would sign the peace pact but have yet to see it happen.
Most recently, Albanian officials told a longtime supporter, former
US senator Bob Dole, that they would sign the agreement Sunday.
They didn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, they took the best friend they have in US politics
and messed with him. They embarrassed Bob Dole,'' said a Western
diplomat. If the Albanians continue to delay, ``their support is
just going to evaporate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have enjoyed American diplomatic support
and public empathy because of their suffering in the yearlong
conflict, but their delegation has been divided between moderates,
who are willing to accept political autonomy for the disputed
province, and hard-liners, who insist on full independence. The
last holdout is the Kosovo Liberation Army _ a critical faction
because they are the ones with weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, the Albanians failed to sign the pact at the end
of a first round of peace talks in Rambouillet, France, a slap to
US Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Albright is so admired
by ethnic Albanians in Kosovo that they affectionately call her
``mother.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans are anxious to get an Albanian signature on the
peace deal so they can pressure Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to do the same. Until the Albanians sign, the West cannot
credibly threaten Milosevic with a NATO airstrike _ a threat few
Serbs take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Balkan negotiators Richard Holbrooke and Chris Hill went to
Belgrade Tuesday, and are to meet Wednesday with Milosevic, who
objects to the proposed deployment of 28,000 NATO peacekeeping
troops in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   But the KLA is nervous about the pact, too, since if they
disarm, they would have to rely completely on NATO to protect them,
said Jim Hooper of the Washington, D.C.-based Balkan Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the Albanians really want is to keep the KLA intact in
some form,'' he said. ``They want to remain intact, since they
don't trust the Serbs, and they're not sure they trust NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting escalated Tuesday in Kosovo, in what monitors for the
Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe called a
continuing pattern by both sides to best their positions before
peace talks resume next week in Rambouillet.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both doing it equally. Violations of the cease-fire
have been even-handed,'' said an OSCE spokeswoman, Beatrice
Lacoste.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbs have greatly increased their military presence in
Kosovo, telling international monitors that the buildup is just a
part of their military ``winter exercises.''
</P>
<P>
   The Serb Army Tuesday shelled the town of Kacanik, in what
Lacoste called a ``cleanup operation'' designed to drive out any
remaining KLA forces there. Warfare also continued in the town of
Vucitrn, which has been the site of violence over the past two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbia Media Center in Pristina reported that two Serb
police were killed and three wounded Monday by an anti-tank mine
planted by Albanian ``terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting also erupted along two tenuous borders _ the southern
border of Macedonia, where US troops are stationed, and the western
border with Albania, Lacoste said. An estimated 250 refugees were
forced to flee the area along the southern border as Serb tanks
swept the area.
</P>
<P>
   The western border is particularly volatile, since Albania is
itself unstable, and its prime minister has called for NATO
military action in Kosovo to stop Serb aggression. The north of
Albania is a known base for gun-runners supplying arms to the
Kosovar Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   International workers have been harassed recently, Lacoste said.
The OSCE _ charged with supervising the cease-fire brokered last
year _ has ``not been able to monitor'' recently, because they have
been denied access to some areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the daily violations of the cease-fire, both sides are
picking apart the peace agreement. The KLA has given mixed signals,
suggesting in a statement Tuesday that they would not sign a peace
pact unless they get peace first.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA has had difficulty getting full agreement from all of
its leaders, in part because the army's political leader, Hashim
Thaqi, has been in neighboring Albania for security reasons.
</P>
<P>
   US negotiators are still counting on an eventual approval from
the KLA. The delay ``is standard. It's the same old stuff,'' said
Philip Reeker, spokesman for Hill. ``They said they will sign. Who
knows? Nobody can read their minds.''

   LAGUNA SAN IGNACIO, Mexico _ At nightfall, when the winds die
down and the waters become glassy, sounds like deep sighs come
gliding across this lagoon. They are the echoes of the gray whales
breathing, spouting and diving, carried easily to the beach on the
pure, still air from hundreds of yards offshore.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet as the scene is, this sheltered bay and the lunar
landscape of natural salt flats surrounding it have become the
center of a noisy clash. The fight pits an international
environmental movement against a large conglomerate, the Mitsubishi
Corp. of Japan, which hopes to build a huge salt plant nearby in
partnership with the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   At stake are core goals for both sides. Mitsubishi and Mexico's
Commerce Ministry, which already own another salt plant at a bay up
the coast, are determined to show that they can develop a new
industry without threatening pristine natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   For environmentalists the salt plant is a test of their
collective power to defend a few corners of the earth they regard
as sacred. San Ignacio Lagoon, which cuts into a spectacular
untamed desert on the Pacific Coast of the Baja California
peninsula, provides a rare refuge that gray whales seek each winter
to breed after an odyssey from summer feeding grounds near the
Bering Strait.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so few places left that clearly belong to nature,''
said Jacob Scherr, a director of the Natural Resources Defense
Council, a U.S. group that has been leading the fight against the
salt plant. ``Shouldn't they be truly beyond the reach of human
beings?''
</P>
<P>
   This is no simple case of a multinational corporation caught
ravaging the backlands by intrepid nature lovers. On both sides,
the campaign for San Ignacio is global and sophisticated. Each side
has videos, Web sites, letter-writing campaigns and guided tours to
promote its views. Top scientists have been recruited by each
faction and are divided on the issues.
</P>
<P>
   But then San Ignacio is not just any lagoon. It is part of El
Vizcaino Biosphere Reserve, created by the Mexican government in
1988 as the largest protected natural area in Latin America. In
1994, also on Mexico's initiative, the reserve was declared a U.N.
World Heritage Site, making it one of the few natural areas to come
under the wing of the world organization.
</P>
<P>
   The $100-million salt plant that Mitsubishi and the Mexican
government want to build would cover 62,000 acres of the reserve
and match the existing one, a solar evaporation plant, as the
largest of its kind in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Key decisions in the four-year-old dispute are due to be made
this year. During the summer, the salt company, named Exportadora
de Sal, SA de CV, will publish a two-year study it commissioned, at
a cost of at least $1 million, on the environmental impact of the
proposed plant.
</P>
<P>
   An international committee of scientists appointed by the
Mexican government will decide whether to approve the study. Based
on their conclusions, the environment secretary, Julia Carabias,
will determine whether to give the go-ahead for construction.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, environmentalists petitioned the United Nations to
declare that Mexico was threatening its World Heritage Site by even
considering the plant. A U.N. mission is expected to visit the area
in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi officials acknowledge that they are edgy about the
environmentalists' campaign, which has inundated their offices with
650,000 protest letters and is symbolized by the gray whale, an
unusually affable 45-foot-long marine mammal. The gray whale was
removed only five years ago from the endangered species list.
</P>
<P>
   Mitsubishi owns 49 percent of the salt company and the Mexican
government 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly we don't enjoy being in the spotlight,'' said James
Brumm, an executive vice president of the American subsidiary of
Mitsubishi. ``But the way our people look at it is that we haven't
made a decision to do anything yet except look at the environmental
impact of the proposed project. We have pledged not to go ahead if
it will harm the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Mitsubishi and Mexican executives of the salt company leave
no doubt that they are playing to win. The current plant, in the
town of Guerrero Negro, is aging and cannot be modernized to
achieve large increases in its output. The company, already
supplying 50 percent of Japan's demand for industrial salt,
envisions an exploding market in other Asian countries in coming
decades.
</P>
<P>
   For every complaint that environmentalists have lodged, company
engineers have reshaped the proposed plant's design. Instead of
using enormous diesel-powered wagons to move salt, as is now done
in Guerrero Negro, a conveyor belt will carry it for miles through
the desert to a new port the company will build far from the
lagoon's mouth. Brine, a byproduct that can be lethal to wildlife,
will be diluted and piped out to the sea.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will have nothing to do with the lagoon,'' insisted Juan
Bremer, the director general of the salt company. ``There are no
smokestacks. We're making salt from natural flats that have been
there for a thousand years. When we fill them we make wetlands. We
make life. It even looks beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment it appears that the company has even fought the
environmentalists to a draw on the most conspicuous issue, the
well-being of the whales. Although there was a decline this season,
in previous years the number of gray whales in the bay around the
existing plant has reached new highs.
</P>
<P>
   But the salt company is dogged by a checkered track record. Last
year, Mexican inspectors found 298 batteries littered across the
bottom of the Guerrero Negro bay. Reporters who took the official
tour of the salt plant recently were led past a dead whale beached
near a sea water intake canal, whose presence seemed to be of no
concern to company officials.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement of environmental regulations by the Mexican
government has been abysmal. When 94 sea turtles turned up dead
near Guerrero Negro in 1997, government inspectors first blamed the
company, then changed their minds after company officials
intervened. The sandy road to San Ignacio is lined with mounds of
scallop and hatchet clam shells.
</P>
<P>
   Local fishermen told how outsiders used bribes to buy licenses
to fish for the mollusks, then plundered the entire crop to
extinction in four years.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious problem the company could create in San Ignacio
is beyond anyone's control: the potential proliferation of Homo
sapiens. Today, Guerrero Negro, which was a vacant desert outpost
when the plant was founded in the 1950s, is a shabby company town
of 13,000 people. Although the company keeps its grounds neat, a
trail of plastic bottles and old tires winds from the town center
into the bay.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists acknowledge that they may have overplayed the
whales to draw attention to the risks to the whole area.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see T-shirts that say, `Save the Benthic
Worm,''' said Chris Peterson, a marine mammal specialist who leads
whale-watching trips in San Ignacio Lagoon. But the whales may yet
tip the balance in the debate. The scientists who are examining the
impact on them, which will last well into the next century, are
dealing with many imponderables.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't really know that much about them,'' said David
Gordon, a naturalist who has written a field guide to gray whales.
Experts are not certain, for example, how the whales navigate down
the Pacific Coast or know when they have reached the Baja breeding
lagoons.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is anyone sure why the big grays will sometimes ease up
alongside a skiff full of whale-watchers in San Ignacio Lagoon and
gently lift their eight-foot-long heads out of the water to be
stroked and kissed, an astonishing gesture of peace between
species.
</P>
<P>
   The heart of the argument over San Ignacio is not about facts,
but about something unquantifiable: the mystical appeal of its
uninterrupted desert horizon and harmonious wildlife.
</P>
<P>
   ``When there is a demand for product and you have to develop,
someone can say that any site in the world is unique,'' said Brumm,
the Mitsubishi executive. ``San Ignacio is beautiful, but there is
nothing unique about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Homero Aridjis, the Mexican poet turned environmental activist
who was the first to protest the salt plant plans, disagreed.
``What we are defending,'' he said, ``is the right of this species
to exist in a poetic world, to live in paradise.''

AUDITOR DECRIES ABANDONED PROPERTY RECORD-KEEPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It is stuffed with 82 bank bags, many of which are not
sealed, dozens of envelopes and boxes, four US Postal tubs
overflowing with financial documents, two suitcases, and a filing
cabinet filled with jewelry, savings bonds, Krugerrands, a firearm,
and war medals.
</P>
<P>
   Among the piles, there are 1942 Dutch pennies, a briefcase, 1988
Bruins tickets, and a silver sugar and creamer service.
</P>
<P>
   The items, thrown ``haphazardly'' into the state treasury's
abandoned property vault on Beacon Hill, represent only a fraction
of the millions of dollars' worth of assets that might never be
returned to their rightful owners because of poor record keeping,
according to a scathing report Auditor Joseph DeNucci released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Attorney General Thomas F. Reilly confirmed Tuesday
that his office is expanding its investigation beyond the nearly $9
million allegedly stolen from the treasury's Unpaid Check Fund and
is looking into the related abandoned property account, which at
one point swelled to $90 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, there was no way to determine whether the above
items represented all of the inventory that should have been found
within these containers, because . . . the office did not reconcile
these items upon their receipt,'' the audit said.
</P>
<P>
   Managers of the Abandoned Property Division, which holds
everything from dormant passbook savings accounts to large real
estate parcels, inaccurately documented or did not thoroughly
inventory its assets, the audit found.
</P>
<P>
   The report, mandated by law whenever there is a change in the
administration, comes amid a vigorous investigation into thefts
from the accounts that hold money and other property for people and
companies across the state who may have died or cannot be located.
</P>
<P>
   New Democratic Treasurer Shannon P. O'Brien said ``garbage put
into the system is garbage out,'' suggesting permanent limbo for
some assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the property has real and sentimental value to people
across the Commonwealth,'' she said. She added later: ``We may
never be able to find out who the rightful owners are.''
</P>
<P>
   Her GOP predecessor, Joseph D. Malone, dismissed the audit as
political.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the past eight years, the treasury has been audited
annually by Joe DeNucci's office and by private accounting firms,''
Malone said in a statement. ``The office was found to be in fine
shape. . . . A few bad apples should not be allowed to tarnish that
record.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the audit found systemic problems in the treasury,
particularly with the way the department has handled abandoned
property.
</P>
<P>
   Often, assets were not labeled or itemized, the report said. And
although the treasury is required to publish annual lists of those
with abandoned assets, the advertisements did not include property
from banks, hospitals, and uncashed state checks.
</P>
<P>
   Such omissions are illegal, the auditor said. Further, that
list, which usually appears in major newspapers informing unwitting
owners of their property, was not published in every county, as
required by law.
</P>
<P>
   This year's list, due out within weeks, will be ``problematic''
and incomplete because of the poor records, O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   --Abandoned assets were not liquidated as quickly as the law
requires.
</P>
<P>
   --Abandoned physical property stored within a vault in the state
government's McCormack Building was strewn about in a ``haphazard
and disorganized manner.'' And only two people, former assistant
treasurer Thomas Trimarco and division director Michael Flaherty,
had access to the safe's combination, which had not been changed
over the last eight years. Trimarco resigned during the transition.
Flaherty will be retained, according to Deputy Treasurer Michael
Travaglini.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien said she has not seen the inside of the vault combed by
auditors Jan. 29 but is considering moving the safe. Meanwhile, she
is grappling with ``palettes'' of worthless property.
</P>
<P>
   --Exacerbating the buildup of abandoned goods, Malone held
liquidating auctions only three times during his eight-year tenure,
despite the fact that law allows for annual bidding. One former
abandoned property administrator told auditors that Malone slashed
the staff from 45 to 15, making it difficult to handle all the
property.
</P>
<P>
   --BankBoston, which controlled a portfolio of more than $136
million in abandoned stocks, bonds, cash dividends, and other
abandonded financial property, was not selected by an open bid
process and no written contract existed.
</P>
<P>
   --The treasury did not know how much in fees the state paid
BankBoston to manage the portfolio and, at one point, BankBoston
had not turned over more than $3.4 million in dividends over six
years. Also, the treasury did not notice a $30 million discrepancy
between its own portfolio records and BankBoston's.

 &HT;    Is Chattanooga on a rival track?
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Chattanooga, Tenn. officials expect to break ground in
October on a $43 million conference center they hope will attract
business from Atlanta and other Southern cities within a 200-mile
radius.
</P>
<P>
   The latest in the city's efforts to shore up a once-sagging
downtown, the 210,000-square-foot center will sit on five acres and
have a 200-room hotel, a 30,000-square foot conference facility, a
7,700-square foot ballroom, a 125-seat amphitheater, 12 meeting
rooms and a restaurant and pub. The facility is to open in early
2001, and Chattanooga officials expect to make $2 million in profit
by 2003 and $2.8 million by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had some great success over the past five to six years
in bringing the whole downtown back,'' said Mayor Jon Kensey. ``The
conference center is a great addition. But we can't be satisfied
with what we've done. We've got to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga's downtown, once considered one of the shabbiest in
the Southeast, started its march back toward respectability with
the May 1992 opening of the $45 million Tennessee Aquarium. Within
a few years, an IMAX theater and the Creative Discovery Museum
opened nearby.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown redevelopment efforts continued in October 1997 with
the opening of Finley Stadium, a $28 million project.
</P>
<P>
   The conference center will be financed through a $100 million
bond issue paid by sales taxes collected in a special downtown
district. The rest of the bond money will be used for an expansion
of the nearby 100,000-square-foot Chattanooga and Hamilton County
Convention and Trade Center and construction of the Development
Resource Center, a government complex that will house city and
county permitting and regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga officials are negotiating with the Tennessee Valley
Authority for purchase of the parcel on which the center will be
built. The sale is expected to be final within six to eight weeks,
said Rob Taylor, who is in charge of the project for the city.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor declined to indicate how much the parcel is expected to
cost, but said he expects no glitches because the TVA has been
cooperating with the city since the project's early development
stages.
</P>
<P>
   Chattanooga also is negotiating with Benchmark Hospitality Inc.,
a Texas company, to manage the property once completed. Those
negotiations are expected to be completed in four to six weeks,
Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The conference center, which is being designed by Rabun Hogan
Ota Rasche Architects of Atlanta, will rely on package
meeting-lodging sales for most of its revenue. City officials hope
to attract business from metro Atlanta, Nashville, Birmingham,
Knoxville and Huntsville, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   In scope and size, the facility will resemble such Atlanta area
conference centers as Evergreen at Stone Mountain, the Peachtree
Conference Center in Peachtree City and the Marietta Conference
Center, said Geoff Kirkland, chairman of Charlotte, N.C.-based
Horwath Hospitality Consultants U.S.A.
</P>
<P>
   Kirkland has served as a consultant to the Chattanooga project,
which will differ from most conference centers because of its urban
location. Most other centers have suburban settings and feature
such amenities as golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that our urban location for this is a distinction
and a selling point, not a disadvantage,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   COMPARABLE FACILITIES IN GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Most major cities have convention centers, which are designed to
hold thousands of people at one time. Many of those facilities also
have break-out capabilities to host smaller conferences. Facilities
built exclusively as conference centers have lodging and eating
facilities and are designed to host smaller groups, often
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   _ Evergreen Conference Center, Stone Mountain: 31,000 square
feet of conference facilities; 249 hotel rooms; 35 meeting rooms;
golf course; swimming pool; tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Marietta Conference Center &AMP; Resort: 20,000 square feet of
meeting space; 199 hotel rooms; 300-seat restaurant and 116-seat
pub; 6,500-square-foot ballroom; 18 meeting rooms that seat 10-170
people; golf course; outdoor swimming pool and hot tub; two outdoor
tennis courts.
</P>
<P>
   _ Brasstown Valley Resort, Young Harris: 14,300 square feet of
meeting space; 134 lodging rooms (102-room lodge and eight
four-bedroom cottages); 3,872-square-foot ballroom that can be
converted into four meeting rooms; eight additional meeting rooms;
75-seat amphitheater; swimming pool; four tennis courts; golf
course; hiking trails; bar/lounge and dining room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Savannah Civic Center: 11 meeting rooms; 8,000-seat theater;
1,600-seat banquet facility; 100 conference/classrooms.

THREE MEN, THREE CITIES COMPETE OVER GERMAN THEATER  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, MARCH 14) 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   BERLIN _ Competition can be good for business _ even among
cultural institutions. But in Germany in the last few months, a
rivalry involving three leading men of the theater has revealed the
intensity with which German theaters and German cultural
politicians can vie with one another for headlines, renown and as
large a piece as possible of the country's cultural pie.
</P>
<P>
   German theater is always political, not least in the fact that
the post of theater director is technically a political
appointment. Take the Deutsches Theater in the former East Berlin,
for example, one of the largest theaters for spoken drama in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   It was the stomping-ground of the legendary director Max
Reinhardt and, after World War II, the actor-director Wolfgang
Langhoff, who welcomed Bertolt Brecht and his Berliner Ensemble as
long-term guests.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Wall fell, a theater director was sought to lead the
house through the transition to a united Germany. As a result,
Ulrich Roloff-Momin, the first cultural senator of reunified
Berlin, appointed the stage director Thomas Langhoff to the post.
</P>
<P>
   A citizen of the former East Germany with no political
affiliation and a good reputation in both parts of the country,
Langhoff seemed a perfect choice. He also represented tradition:
not only had he worked at the Deutsches Theater before, but he was
Wolfgang Langhoff's son.
</P>
<P>
   Langhoff had a lot to contend with once he arrived. Financial
constraints imposed by the Berlin Senate lopped some $4 million
from his theater's budget, compelling him to reduce the staff to
350 from 500 and to cut the number of new productions. Although the
Deutsches Theater took the coveted German Theater Critic's Award
for Theater of the Year in 1991-92, the critics have been less
enthusiastic over the last several years.
</P>
<P>
   But the theater remained reasonably well-attended, Langhoff was
popular with his ensemble, and he had announced a new concept for
the house: his plan to bring in new directors _ the French star
director Luc Bondy will come here in 1999-2000 _ and rekindle some
of the excitement the theater has experienced in its long
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the country, wealthy Munich also has an
active theater scene. But where post-reunification Berlin has a
number of major repertory theaters that receive government
subsidies, Munich has only two. Of these, the Munich Kammerspiele
is the undisputed leader, thanks to its director Dieter Dorn, who
in his 21-year tenure has transformed it into one of the top
theaters in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wilson and, yes, Thomas Langhoff have worked there. Dorn
is also well respected in Munich's cultural life because of his own
stagings, both at the Kammerspiele and, for example, at the
Bavarian State Opera, where his ``Cosi fan tutte'' is one of the
theater's strongest productions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite geographical differences, Langhoff and Dorn have a few
things in common. Both are stage directors; both are about the same
age (Langhoff is 60, Dorn 63); and the contracts of both men with
their respective houses were coming up for renewal in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Another leading man on the German theater scene is Frank
Baumbauer, the very successful head of the Deutsches Schauspielhaus
in Hamburg. While he is not a stage director himself, Baumbauer has
a good nose for what is new and hot in theater.
</P>
<P>
   When he arrived in Hamburg, the house was struggling; since
then, it has received the Theater of the Year award three times.
Directors active at the house include the eccentric Swiss
Wunderkind Christoph Marthaler, one of Europe's most popular
tickets at the moment; Jossi Wieler, a specialist in making obscure
texts theatrically viable, who won the Production of the Year award
with his staging here in 1993-94 of a work by Elfriede Jelinek; and
a rising young talent, Matthias Hartmann.
</P>
<P>
   An ultimate sign of the hipness of Baumbauer's theater are the
frequent co-productions with the Salzburg Festival, one of the most
``in'' spots for the German-speaking theater. As of this summer, in
fact, Baumbauer is to take over as director of theater at Salzburg,
a post he will hold at least until 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Baumbauer, in short, is the kind of man cultural politicians in
Germany just love. They find it reassuring that he is not an artist
but someone they can talk business with; and they like the fact
that he brings critics, good artists and buzz to a city, bolstering
its reputation for tourism, and, by extension, the politicians'
jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Adding to Baumbauer's attractiveness in the last few months was
the fact that he was ``available.'' His contract in Hamburg runs
out in 2000 _ tomorrow in theater terms; he will be replaced by Tom
Stromberg, himself a respected man of the theater who built the
Theater am Turm in Frankfurt into a renowned avant-garde space
until it was effectively felled by that city's lack of funds.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that someone like Baumbauer might be free to come to
their cities was particularly exciting to Munich's Cultural Affairs
Officer Julian Nida-Rumelin and to Berlin's Cultural Senator Peter
Radunski. Both men are responsible for culture in cities jealous of
their cultural supremacy in Germany's hitherto decentralized arts
landscape.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Before reunification, Munich, most Germans' favorite metropolis,
liked to be known as the country's ``secret capital.'' Berlin has
begun to threaten that status now, though more often in headlines,
as it verges on becoming the country's actual capital, with the
potential to blossom into the international cultural center it was
before the Nazi era.
</P>
<P>
   Nida-Rumelin, who has been in office in Munich for less than a
year, would therefore like to do something to bring his city back
into the limelight. Radunski, meanwhile, is trying to make sure
that Berlin, which has come under fire for supposedly lacking a
coherent cultural direction, stays in the headlines. He would also
like to generate some positive attention for himself before this
fall's elections.
</P>
<P>
   The politicians moved with surprising swiftness. In January,
within a few days of each other, both Dorn and Langhoff, who had no
reason to believe they had anything less than unequivocal support,
were suddenly informed that their contracts were not going to be
renewed. Distinguished service counted for little against the
prospect of new laurels: Radunski's dismissal of Langhoff took all
of 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was no secret that both posts were being cleared for
Baumbauer. The two cities had approached the director last November
_ coincidentally, within a few days of each other _ to sound him
out about his interest in the posts. Baumbauer's answer had been
that, as both houses in question already had theater directors,
there was no point in approaching him unless a position actually
came free.
</P>
<P>
   After the story broke in January, the round-faced Baumbauer, 53,
continued to grin inscrutably under his mustache in innumerable
newspaper photographs, which proliferated as the situation
escalated. But he initially held back from indicating a preference
for one city over another.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Langhoff held a press conference, and Dorn wrote an
open letter protesting the ``lack of ideas, lack of standards, lack
of vision'' that had led to his being let go. He was supported in
another open letter signed by all 41 members of his ensemble. A lot
of Munich citizens would probably have been happy to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Like any political affair, this one has inspired a spectrum of
opinion. Germans are fond of complaining about the philistinism of
cultural politicians, and the situation has provided plenty of fuel
for their arguments. Yet few Germans are really interested in
changing the system of political subsidy that makes art a political
affair in the first place, though the present situation is
certainly a consequence of that system.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine the level of polemics that would routinely erupt if
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani had the power to appoint the directors of
the Metropolitan Opera and Carnegie Hall in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In Germany, tradition usually wins out in the end. In this
particular case, Baumbauer, who is originally from Munich, where
his mother still lives, turned down the Berlin offer and has opened
negotiations with the City of Munich about heading the
Kammerspiele. Pending Baumbauer's own final decision, the Munich
Senate is expected to decide the issue by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, two of Germany's leading stage directors have
suddenly found themselves looking for work.
</P>
<P>
   In Berlin, Radunski, who would lose face politically if he
rehired Langhoff, is seeking someone else to take over the
Deutsches Theater in 2001. ``The most important thing is that he be
new,'' Radunski says. Pundits have suggested Dieter Dorn as an
ideal candidate: proof that the grass, at least for politicians, is
always greener on the other side of the country.
</P>
<P>
   As for Thomas Langhoff: he will spend the next two years doing
as much as he can before his successor, whoever that may be, takes
over. ``The job of politicians is to give us money and keep their
mouths shut,'' he said.

COURT STRIKES DOWN SAT MEASURE OF STUDENT-ATHLETES' ABILITIES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Higher education officials Tuesday defended the need for minimum
academic standards for student athletes, saying that Monday's court
decision striking down minimum admissions scores would return to
the days when colleges and universities admitted athletes who could
build a better team, with little regard to whether those students
could read or write.
</P>
<P>
   A federal court on Monday struck down the minimum SAT scores set
by the National Collegiate Athletic Association for its Division I
schools in 1986, saying the standards discriminated against black
students, who have been shown to perform lower than their white
peers on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   It suggested the NCAA find other ways to make sure students were
academically qualified, including perhaps a combination of scores
and grades.
</P>
<P>
   Coaches welcomed the decision _ not because it could allow them
to pull poor academic performers off the bench, they said, but
because the standards had unfairly sidelined promising students.
For many minority and poor students, they said, low scores reflect
poverty, not lack of potential.
</P>
<P>
   But NCAA officials and college presidents who helped set the bar
for the scores reminded the public Tuesday that the rules had been
adopted overwhelmingly by NCAA members, who were horrified at how
college athletic departments were admitting students who had no
chance of academic success. High schools were inflating grades to
win admission for star students, and once in college, many of those
students were being allowed to slide by in gut courses. This might
have helped the team, but only ended up hurting individual students
once their athletic careers ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you return back to the reasons the rule was adopted
overwhelmingly it was to deal with...the exploitation of student
athletes,'' said Kevin Lennon vice president for member service at
the NCAA. ``There's more individuals who because the standards have
been in place have had better success in college because they were
better prepared. The clear point is, the vast majority of students
have been better served by having an eligibility standard.''
</P>
<P>
   NCAA officials recalled the widely-publicized scandals that
prompted the rules, when one student was so ill-prepared he could
not read his college diploma.
</P>
<P>
   While coaches said they welcomed the decision because it would
open up access to disadvantaged students, the decision also set off
a flurry of speculation about its effect on the NCAA basketball
finals, scheduled to begin Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   With the NCAA operating without any minimum standards for
admission or participation, some speculated that teams could pull
students who had been deemed unqualified under the NCAA standards
off the bench to play in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Wethington, president of the University of Kentucky and
chair of the NCAA Executive Committee, said he hoped that wouldn't
happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole situation is too fluid, too undecided, too much at
risk,'' he said, ``and it would be sending absolutely the wrong
signal.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA said it would appeal the decision, and also try to come
up with a measure of academic preparedness the court could agree
with.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are other standards that admissions directors will tell
you are more indicative of success in college,'' said Richard
Lapchick, director of the Center for Sport in Society at
Northeastern University.
</P>
<P>
   Boston College athletic director Gene DeFilippo agreed. ``I've
always believed that grade point average and class ranking should
carry the most weight and are a better indicator than test
scores,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Butch Davis, the football coach at the University of Miami, said
doing away with minimums based on standardized test scores would
allow students who might not score well to prove that they can
achieve despite their rank on standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a believer in who leaves rather than who comes in that's
important,'' he said. ``If you maintain your grades and do your
work, you can get a degree, and that reflects better on a
university than the decision about who they let in before those
students have a chance to prove themselves. It gives athletes an
opportunity to overachieve and cuts down on some of the inequities
in the testing system.''
</P>
<P>
   At FairTest in Cambridge, Mass., which launched the initial
lawsuit, Bob Schaeffer said the NCAA had targeted the wrong people
in setting the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a serious problem over the years, there were very
clearly kids who were being exploited by the system, particularly
minority and low-income students,'' he said. ``But instead of
dealing with the abusers _ the institutions, the coaches, the
administrators, they decided to dump on the next generation of
kids. The rule was discriminatory, the NCAA knew the rule was
discriminatory.''

 &HT;    Minimum SAT scores unfair to African-Americans, says judge; NCAA
eligibility on line
 &HT;    By Tony Barnhart
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In February 1998, Terrence Edwards realized a lifelong
dream when he signed to play football at the the University of
Georgia. One of the South's top players, he was looking forward to
following in the footsteps of his brother Robert, a star running
back for the Bulldogs. But Edwards' dream would be painfully
deferred.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a B average at Washington County High School, Edwards
could not make the NCAA's minimum required score of 820 on the
Scholastic Aptitude Test or 68 on the American College Test. As a
result, Edwards did not enroll in college in the fall of 1998 as he
continued to take the test. Finally, on his eighth try, Edwards
made an 840 on the SAT and enrolled at Georgia for the winter
semester of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Edwards looks forward to spring practice and his first
season as a Bulldog. But Edwards also wonders if he'll ever get
over the public stigma of not meeting the NCAA standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's embarrassing,'' he said. ``People in high school know
you're not dumb, but people who don't know you pass judgment on
you. They read in the newspaper you didn't qualify, and people all
over the country automatically think you're dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   The system that affected Edwards so negatively could be
changing. A Philadelphia judge ruled Monday that the NCAA's
requirement for a minimum standardized test score is unfair to
African-Americans and is therefore illegal. If the ruling survives
an appeal by the NCAA, all 302 Division I schools could be on their
own to determine which freshmen are eligible to play college
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling brought mixed reactions throughout the academic and
athletic communities. One side praised the ruling as a victory for
African-American athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the most significant ruling ever in college
athletics,'' said Perry Clark, the head basketball coach at Tulane,
who is black. ``A test score is not a way of measuring your desire,
your heart, your character, because, for a lot of folks, they start
at a disadvantage. You can't put a formula on some people.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, some college administrators are concerned
that, depending on what happens next, the net effect could be bad
for college athletic and academic endeavors.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA has asked U.S. District Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter to
stay his ruling, pending an appeal to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court in
Philadelphia. If Buckwalter refuses, the NCAA will have to scramble
to get a new set of guidelines in place that address the court's
concerns. ``I think this ruling caught a lot of people by surprise,
and we're wondering what's next,'' said Hoke Wilder, Georgia's
assistant athletics director for NCAA compliance. ``Surely, we
won't go back to the old days when there was no standard. Then we
really could have some problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Until 1986, there was not an NCAA-wide standard for athletic
eligibility. As a result there were numerous cases where athletes
with no chance of passing college work were admitted. College
athletics was rocked by a series of stories about star athletes
leaving college unable to read and no where close to a degree.
</P>
<P>
   One of those highly publicized academic scandals took place at
Georgia, where the Jan Kemp case revealed that football players
with SAT scores in the 400s _ out of a maximum 1,600 points _ had
been admitted into the University.
</P>
<P>
   In response to that situation, the NCAA passed Proposition 48 at
its January 1986 convention. Prop 48 required a minimum grade-point
average and standardized test score in order to be eligible to
participate in athletics as a freshman. The NCAA has amended the
policy over the years to its current form, which calls for a 2.5
grade-point average in 13 college-preparatory subjects _ such as
English, math, science _ plus a minimum score on the SAT or ACT.
</P>
<P>
   Since the policies went into effect, some educators and social
scientists have argued that the standardized test requirement
descriminates against African-Americans who, studies have shown,
perform worse on the tests in general than whites do. Georgetown
basketball coach John Thompson, who is black, once boycotted a pair
of basketball games in 1989 to protest the policy.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit which brought about Monday's ruling was filed by
Leatrice Shaw and Tae Kwan Cureton, track-and-field athletes at
Philadelphia's Simon Gratz High in 1996. Shaw had a GPA of 3.5;
Cureton's was 2.8. Both were in the top 10 percent of their class,
but they could not get athletic scholarships because they had not
made the minimum test scores. Buckwalter used the NCAA's own
studies to make his ruling. Those studies showed that the
ineligibility rates, which represent the percentage of athletes who
fail to qualify academically as freshmen, disproportionately hurt
blacks. According to NCAA statistics, 3.7 percent of white athletes
failed to quality as freshmen, while the corresponding number for
African-Americans was 20.6 percent. Among those praising the ruling
Tuesday was Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski. The president of
the National Association of Basketball Coaches, Krzyzewksi long has
said that the minimum test score descriminates against students
from lower socio-economic backgrounds. ``This court ruling will
certainly open a new discussion for creating better legislation for
all youngsters,'' he said. ``I look forward to participating in
those discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, who retired as coach at Georgetown earlier this year,
said he had mixed emotions about the ruling. ``Changes will
obviously come about, but how do you go back and change the kids
this hurt?'' Thompson asked. ``All you can say is, 'Sorry,' and
there's something very very wrong with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's Edwards agrees. ``Basically, the SAT doesn't reflect
how smart a person is, in my opinion,'' he said. ``I know some
people who had 4.0s (as GPAs) in high school who made 700s. I wish
(the ruling) had happened before. It might've save me some
trouble.''

BLACKMUN RECALLED AS COMPASSIONATE JUDGE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Former Supreme Court Justice Harry A. Blackmun, who
died last week, was remembered Tuesday as a compassionate judge and
a loving but often absent father.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Stephen G. Breyer, who succeeded Blackmun on the high
court in 1994, recalled his predecessor as a man of
``conscientious, humane judicial vision'' whose respect for
personal liberty led him to write the landmark, but highly
controversial, Roe vs. Wade decision in 1973 legalizing abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Blackmun's daughter Nancy, speaking at the same memorial
service, said her father's compassion came at a high price. She
described his Minnesota childhood as wrought with family deaths and
financial difficulty, producing lifelong scars that drove him to
work long hours and spend little, though precious, time at home.
</P>
<P>
   First lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and many current and former
justices attended the 2 1/2-hour memorial to Blackmun. The ceremony
at a Methodist church here was held as a winter storm blustered
outside, inspiring some speakers to recall the former justice's
ability to weather adversity.
</P>
<P>
   That adversity often took the form of heated criticism from
opponents of abortion who never forgave Blackmun for writing the
majority opinion in Roe vs. Wade. But Blackmun accepted the
criticism with grace and good humor, Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unpopularity may have displeased him, but it would not shake
him,'' Breyer said. ``He would sometimes read those criticisms
publicly, making it clear that he had considered the criticism, but
still he had to make up his own mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Breyer recalled that Blackmun, who served on the court from 1970
to 1994, once received a highly critical letter in which the writer
asked if the justice would resign. In response, Blackmun wrote,
``Dear Sir, No. Sincerely, Harry A. Blackmun.''
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Blackmun, one of the former justice's three daughters,
praised her father's compassion for the less fortunate. She
recalled that Blackmun had a younger brother who died in early
childhood and a young cousin who died of influenza when Blackmun
was 9 years old.
</P>
<P>
   These experiences fueled Blackmun's sensitivity and drive, his
daughter said. But Nancy Blackmun also remembered fondly stolen
moments with her father, such as when he would sing to his
daughters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cry for him as well as for us,'' she said, expressing her
wish that her father had spent more time at home. ``His were the
most comforting hands to hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Scanning the crowd, which included high-powered Washington
attorneys, Nancy Blackmun urged the audience to learn from her
father's work habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are lots of parents who work too hard,'' she said. ``Try
not to work too hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Author Garrison Keillor, whose folksy stories about Minnesota
helped him forge a bond with the former justice, led the
congregation in singing the Yale University pep song, ``The
Whiffenpoof Song.'' Nancy Blackmun recalled that her father would
often sing the melody about lost lambs who have gone astray.
</P>
<P>
   William McDaniel Jr., who served as a law clerk to Blackmun,
recalled at the memorial service a justice who believed strongly,
and often without fanfare, that the Constitution protects Americans
who are victims of discrimination or mired in poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a man vilified for his beliefs, who never returned
vilification,'' McDaniel said. ``He was a man of the law, who
adhered to a fundamental belief that law must serve the people
whose misery and need brought them to the bar of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. William Holmes, a friend and former pastor of
Blackmun's, said the Constitution and the Bible were ``the two most
important documents'' in the former justice's life. ``What he
brought to both was a creative fidelity marked with humility and
always with a twinkle in his eye,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Antonin Scalia, who was out of town due to an illness in
his family, was the only member of the high court to miss the
memorial service. Byron R. White, the last surviving former
justice, sat with the current justices in the front pew.

CONVERSE GOES THE HIP-HOP ROUTE TO OVERCOME SLUMP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GREGG KRUPA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Converse Inc., meet Master P.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball players are not selling $100 sneakers for your
struggling company anymore. How about trying a hip-hop recording
artist, instead?
</P>
<P>
   Athletic shoe sales have been in the tank, industry-wide, since
at least 1997. Converse's sales in 1998 were down 31.5 percent to
$308.5 million, and the fourth quarter was particularly harsh.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, company officials said it was time to try something
really different.
</P>
<P>
   How about a hip-hop guy who plays basketball and has become
among the most successful entrepreneurs in the country _ earning
$56 million last year according to Fortune Magazine. Master P's
name is suddenly everywhere, from the cover of CDs, to trying out
with the Charlotte Hornets, to representing Heisman Trophy winner
Ricky Williams as an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The North Reading, Mass. company now says it has entered into a
marketing partnership with Master P's No Limit Entertainment, that
will eventually provide for co-branded Converse and No Limit
footwear.
</P>
<P>
   For Bob Williams, president of Burns Sports Celebrity Service, a
Chicago company that links advertisers with athletes for
endorsements, Converse's agreement with Master P means that the
shoe industry is trying to shake off its irrelevant marketing
strategies. ``This demonstrates the point to a far greater degree
than Nike dropping a lot of its athlete endorsers over the past
four or five years,'' Williams said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, it's no secret that athletes are out as endorsers,''
said Peter Land, executive vice president of Edelman Public
Relations Worldwide, who used to preside over marketing for the
NBA. ``And, by and large there is a lot of cross over between
entertainment and sports. That's why Rupert Murdoch bought the Los
Angeles Dodgers. It's why NASCAR has a rock concert every year _ to
reach a new audience. It's why Ally McBeal shows up at a World
Series game _ it's a promotion for Fox.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Converse or Master P _ his real name is Percy Miller,
and he calls himself simply P _ would discuss the terms of the
agreement Tuesday. But industry sources said it is a
multimillion-dollar deal over two to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Converse's immediate benefit? In-store, point-of-sale displays
with P's image and posing his trademark query from lyrics and
albums, ``Who you with?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we feel there has been a big change in the performance
and basketball shoe line,'' said Jim Solomon, Converse's senior
vice president of Marketing and Sales. ``It's no longer the old
rules of hero basketball player selling his hero shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``And we've seen a lot of interplay between music and sports,''
Solomon said. ``We really think that we are catching part of a
trend.''
</P>
<P>
   Master P's immediate benefit?
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed a shoe company that's going to be there,'' P said in
a telephone interview from a hotel in Charlotte, N.C. He said he
will announce later this week that he has joined the Charlotte
Hornets as a player _ adding to the multiple dimensions of a sports
and entertainment renaissance man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just like Nike and Mike,'' he said, referring to Michael
Jordan. ``P, and No Limit and Converse are going to ride this
together and go where no one has gone before, because there truly
are no limits.''
</P>
<P>
   Master P, 28, is a self-made millionaire who is building one of
the most powerful entertainment businesses in the country. Emerging
from New Orleans as a rapper, an actor, a screenwriter and a record
and film producer, he eventually became chief executive officer of
his own company, No Limit Entertainment. He has branched out more
recently to begin representing athletes, including the Boston
Celtics' Ron Mercer as well as Williams, who he lured away from
Boston's Woolf Associates.
</P>
<P>
   For Nelson George, the author of Hip Hop America, the Master P
and Converse agreement is part of an increasing mainstreaming of
hip-hop. While Addidas used the recording artists Run DMC in
commercials in the 1980s, it was the clothing manufacturer Tommy
Hilfiger who really picked up of the marketing in the 1990s, before
Calvin Klein and others followed course, George said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's athletes or entertainers, we're talking about
aspirational marketing,'' said Tom George, senior vice-president at
the marketing behemoth, Advantage International. ``It's about
people, especially young people, aspiring to certain fashion
trends. What is cool is part of that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that makes Converse's products more aspirational, or
cool, is good.''

FRUGAL TRAVELER: AN ORLANDO WEEKEND OF BLOOMS, BIRDS AND TIFFANY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, March 14)  
 (bl)  
 By SARAH FERRELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The snow, sleet and ice that we were hoping to escape delayed
our departure from New York for several hours, but Tom and I
couldn't complain. Unlike many other flights, ours made it to
Florida that Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando had much to recommend it as a quick winter getaway: warm
weather, low air fare, cheap rental cars. I had telephoned Budget
and discovered, to my delight, that the cheapest available rental
vehicle, at a promotional rate of $19.99 a day, was a Ford Ranger
pickup _ spanking new, painted metallic cinnabar, with a locking
cover for the truck bed. In the cab, two comfortable bucket seats
provided an overview of the heavy rush-hour traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Since we intended to avoid downtown Orlando and all things
Disney, I had negotiated a $71.10 room at a Fairfield Inn, a
Marriott economy chain, in the suburb of Winter Park. Our room, No.
137, was nicely, if generically, furnished; the dressing area and
sink were at the back of the bedroom, while the tub-shower
combination and toilet had a little room of their own. A
fair-sized, lighted swimming pool lay just outside the door.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we checked in, it was dark and we were hungry. The
path of least resistance led directly across the highway to a
Denny's, where we checked the menu for regional specialties and
came up with the chicken-fried steak dinner. Two big pieces of meat
apiece, carrots and real mashed potatoes with peppery country gravy
were $5.09; endlessly refillable iced tea, $1.28. We went back to
our room to count our cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   We awoke to bright sunlight and the song of a cardinal.
Breakfast, which came with the room, offered a choice of teas,
coffee, cereals, toast, fresh fruit and individually wrapped
breakfast breads _ very odd, when the bread in question is a bagel.
And orange juice, which, like tea and coffee, was always available
in the lobby. As we ate, we watched televised scenes of frozen
crowds waving to the cameras in New York's Rockefeller Center and
tried not to giggle.
</P>
<P>
   The town of Winter Park is, well, pretty cute. A street of
mostly two-story stucco buildings containing boutiques and
galleries and cafes parallels the park that gives the street its
name, Park Avenue. The park itself is called Central Park, and is
charmingly green, with old live oaks and tiny squirrels, a
decorative fountain and an Amtrak station _ the railroad came
through in 1882, shortly before the city was founded. The town is
surrounded by lakes, and is anchored by Rollins College, a small,
private liberal-arts college founded in 1885.
</P>
<P>
   Admission to the Charles Hosmer Morse Museum of American Art, at
the northern end of the brief commercial district, is usually $3,
but it was temporarily free because the galleries were being
reconstructed to house the chapel that Louis Comfort Tiffany
designed for the 1893 Chicago world's fair. If only a part of the
collection of Tiffany glass and art pottery and jewelry were on
display, we didn't mind. The collection was assembled by Jeannette
McKean and her husband, Hugh McKean, a former fellow at the Tiffany
Foundation who was also a president of Rollins. ( Morse, an early
settler, was her grandfather.)
</P>
<P>
   The glowing favrile glass vases and dragonfly and spider-web
lamps are, of course, glorious, but the windows are a wonder,
especially the three-panel ``Magnolia'' window that was made for
the Tiffany mansion on East 72nd Street in New York. (You can touch
an exhibit of the types of glass that Tiffany developed for his
work, including the semi-opaque ``draped'' glass used to create the
magnolias.) After several passes through the galleries, we were
giddy with color.
</P>
<P>
   We had lunch at a modest vegetarian establishment, the
Powerhouse Cafe, just off the avenue. I had vegetarian grape
leaves, Tom a sandwich of many kinds of veggies in pita bread. We
drank smoothies: Mine was the fairly straightforward berry-cherry
(174 calories); Tom's was 255 calories worth of cosmic crunch _
papaya juice, strawberries, bananas, dates, granola and honey. The
drinks came in pretty tropical pastel shades of coral and lilac.
The bill was less than $15.
</P>
<P>
   We had decided to take the Scenic Boat Tour through three of
Winter Park's lakes, but later in the afternoon, which left us with
some time to kill. None of our guidebooks mentioned Mead Botanical
Garden, but it was on one of our maps, and nearby. It turned out to
be less of an actual garden than a piece of untouched semiswamp,
through which a boardwalk snaked its way. We wandered past sawgrass
and wax myrtle, listening to the palmettos clatter in the wind and
enjoying the boggy smell.
</P>
<P>
   In the hour or so we spent there, we saw only one other person,
a young man seated in silent contemplation at the edge of a stream.
But there was a pileated wookpecker, and monarchs cavorting in the
designated butterfly garden. We felt as if we had discovered a
secret.
</P>
<P>
   The Scenic Boat Tours leave from the foot of Morse Avenue on
Lake Osceola. The tour, which costs $7, takes a little over an
hour, traversing Lakes Osceola, Virginia and Maitland, which are
connected by narrow, shady canals. The boat, which looks like a big
sardine tin on three pontoons, seats 18 on open benches.

 &HT;    Parisians sport ``Michelin Man'' coats
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Suppose the Michelin Man shedded a few pounds and went
Gothic . Then, he'd epitomize the look so prevalantly seen around
Paris, where the style-conscious are currently confronted with a
daily mix of rain, sleet and snow.
</P>
<P>
   On the boulevards and on the Metro, quilted black jackets are
the way to go, it seems. In New York, they're called ``Michelin
Man'' coats. Here, they'd aptly be referred to as
``indispensible.''
</P>
<P>
   They're puffy. They're sporty. And when worn over suits and
smart separates, they look rather chic. Most importantly, they're
practical: the nylon shells repel the cold; the down filling fights
the chill; and the color conceals stains that accompany life in a
city that's fast-paced and congested.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing especially new about quilted down parkas, of
course. Designer, athletic and militaristic versions have been
around for years. Still, there's that certain je ne sais quoi about
the way people dress in Paris that keep this look from appearing
tired.

 &HT;    A trouser taboo serves Ocimar Versolato well
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS, France _ The Brazilian-born designer Ocimar Versolato
made a rather novel proposition with the fall/winter collection he
previewed Tuesday. Imagine: a wardrobe almost devoid of pants. Of
the 71outfits Versolato displayed on his revolving runway, only
three featured pants; and even in those instances, the pants were
partly concealed by jackets and capes.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts, dresses and gowns are the distinctly un-versatile
Versolato's specialty. And for next season's cold-weather wear, he
seems especially focused on luxe fabrics such as mohair, buckskin,
combed wool and cashmere. Unlike most of the New York, Milanese and
Parisian designers whose shows preceded his, Versolato restricted
his color palette to off-white, black, pale pastels and deep blue.
He embellished his otherwise austere designs with high slits,
drawstrings, stencil painting and beading in the shape of long,
thin crosses. Skirts were either hiked to the thigh or dropped to
the floor.
</P>
<P>
   His most noteworthy creations were the knitwear separates that
appeared both plush and sheer. But his decision to outfit models in
knee-high space boots detracted from the collection's air of
elegance.
</P>
<P>
   Few fall/winter shows, seen so far, rival the elegance of the
Hermes collection shown at the flagship store on Monday night.
Somehow, Hermes designer Martine Margiella made sweater-dressing
look remarkably refined.
</P>
<P>
   Reversible cashmere, lambskin and fine tweeds were the main
fabrics employed. The clothes were shown in sedate shades of greys
and browns. Also, in a stark departure from the stick-thin teens
coming down most runways, most of Margiella's models were in the
35-and-older age range.
</P>
<P>
   The 39-outfit collection featured one skirt and five dresses.
These, like all the pants shown, had a loose, loungey silhouette
and closed at the waist with gold-tipped drawstrings. Cushy
turtleneck and cowl neck sweaters were the collection's mainstay.
Buttonless camp shirts tucked into high-waisted pants were a
tantalizing twist. Hermes' outerwear innovation, cashmere stoles
with conveniently-placed pockets, were true delights.
</P>
<P>
   These were styles for the woman who takes life easy. Evidently,
Margiella was in no rush to complete this lovely line for Hermes as
well as his own signature collection. He took his time, and did it
right.

 UNDATED: open benches. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We passed the backs of grand houses and boathouses in every
conceivable style, and admired a landscape of cypress knees, live
oaks, philodendrons and Spanish moss. The guide-narrator gave us
bad jokes and good information, particularly about the fauna. We
did not see the alligators or barred owls that occasionally appear,
but we did see cormorants, and herons blue and white and great and
small, and egrets and a whole tree full of anhingas, those strange
denizens of the Everglades also know as snake birds because they
hunt with only their heads and long, serpentish necks sticking out
of the water.
</P>
<P>
   Back on Park, we window-shopped art glass and jewelry and
European toys for a bit, then settled into the Park Avenue Grill
for dinner. At the bar, Tom, the designated driver, had a virgin
mary, and I had a gimlet. In a fit of false economy, since it was
still happy hour, with $1 off every drink, I had two. The bill, for
drinks and dinner in the skylighted dining room, came to less than
$40: Tom had a huge chunk of prime rib and I had a full dozen giant
coconut-fried prawns _ more than I could eat.
</P>
<P>
   We spent the next day, a Saturday, at the Kennedy Space Center,
a little more than an hour's drive from Orlando. Fast-food urban
sprawl gave way to vicious-looking palmetto scrub and then, as we
approached the center itself, to a truly surreal skyline. There,
gleaming against a huge blue sky, were the seven great boosters
that stand like monoliths in the outdoor Rocket Garden display. For
the first of several times, our jaws dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Entrance to the Space Center is free, but you have to take a bus
through restricted areas to get to the really good stuff. We
decided that the best value for us was the Crew Pass ($19), which
would get us on the bus and allow us to see one of three IMAX
movies. Since I had a book of coupons (widely available) that gave
us $2 off each pass, we paid $17 each.
</P>
<P>
   The bus makes three stops: at the LC 39 observation gantry, at
the International Space Station Center and at the Apollo-Saturn V
Center. Since we had only a day, we chose to devote ourselves to
the last. But the center is also a nature preserve, filled with the
usual (by now) egrets and herons. From the bus, we also spotted a
couple of alligators snoozing beside a drainage ditch. Then
suddenly, the driver pointed out a bald eagle seated on a cement
stanchion. Major jaw-drop. A few yards farther on, an enormous
conical eagles' nest hung in a tree. Golly.
</P>
<P>
   You enter the Apollo-Saturn V Center through a gigantic Flash
Gordonish time lock. After some orientation movies, you pass
through a big metal door and into the firing room, where blinking
lights and audio clips recreate the Apollo 8 launching. Anyone old
enough to remember the moon landing is apt to be awe-struck; we
were. In the next room, hanging horizontally, is a Saturn V
booster; we'd always known they were big, but its length still came
as a surprise. The same gallery has a lot of interactive exhibits
and toys and (what had become of great interest to us) a cafeteria.
We took our hot dogs, fries and lemonades ($10.90 total) out onto a
broad terrace, and watched turkey buzzards circle over yet another
lake.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the Visitor Complex, we chose the IMAX movie ``The Dream
Is Alive,'' with some truly stomach-churning footage of a landing
taken from the nose of a shuttle. We poked around the gift shop and
the Rocket Garden and had a few snacks until it was suddenly time
to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Our route to Winter Park took us along the Beeline Expressway,
the last few miles of which was lined with huge billboards, many in
3-D, for the big-budget attractions that we were ignoring. Traffic
was heavy, and we moved slowly. This stretch, as Tom observed, must
be hell if you have children in the car.
</P>
<P>
   On an earlier stroll along Park Avenue, we had caught a glimpse
of what appeared to be Tiffany glass in La Venezia Cafe. And so it
was, three big panels on loan from the Morse Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Since the cocktail hour had arrived, we settled down at the bar
to admire the shining window that, appropriately, showed grapes on
a trellis, and ordered a couple of what turned out to be expensive
drinks. My gimlet was $6.50, and the designated driver's virgin
mary was a shocking $5.95, more than a whole chicken-fried steak
dinner. But it was probably worth it, since it came with a slab of
carrot, a celery stalk, a large stuffed olive, an onion, lemon and
lime slices and a giant shrimp. ``When we garnish, we  &UR; garnish &LR; ,''
the young woman behind the bar said.
</P>
<P>
   Dinner, served on a patio with louvers opening onto the street,
was of necessity something of an anticlimax, although my lamb with
couscous was fine. (Tom's paella, made with orzo instead of rice,
was less successful.) Still, at $32 for two, not counting drinks,
it wasn't a bad buy. We wished we had left room for dessert, since
the pastry selection looked superb; or perhaps we should have just
stopped in for coffee and cake, as others seemed to be doing.
</P>
<P>
   We had most of a day on Sunday, since we did not have to return
the Ranger until 5 p.m. If I had been disappointed in anything, it
was that we had not seen many flowers, a situation that we decided
to remedy by a visit to the Harry P. Leu Gardens, overlooking Lake
Rowena (Lake Ivanhoe is just up the road) in Orlando proper.
Admission to the gardens is $4, but that day it was free, since it
was the annual Camellia Weekend. Events included a camellia ikebana
workshop and a juried exhibit of camellia blossoms _ several
hundred, singly or in groups, in every possible color and shape.
</P>
<P>
   By official count, the nearly 50 acres of gardens, donated to
the City of Orlando by Harry P. Leu, a local businessman, and his
wife, Mary Jane, contains some 2,200 camellias, planted between
1936 and the early 1960s. Their peak blooming period is from
mid-January to mid-March, and most of them have grown into
substantial trees. Many of them, in full bloom, were veiled in
Spanish moss, as mysterious and magical as anything in the Brothers
Grimm. But camellias are only part, although a large one, of the
gardens. There are, among other things, an orchid house, a rose
garden, a butterfly garden and an enchanting, cool forest of
bamboo, palms and cycads, as well as an overlook on the lake, where
one can spy on herons.

 UNDATED: on herons. 
  &HT;    We found lunch at the Red Rose Cafe, which had been set up
exclusively for the camellia festival to serve sort of
church-bazaar food at church-bazaar prices. A generous ham-and-brie
sandwich was $3, lemonade $1, a homemade lemon-coconut square $1.
We ate on a terrace under a giant live oak, and watched cloud
reflections on the lake. Refreshed and rejoicing in our good luck,
we took another leisurely tour of the gardens, then headed for the
airport. A few drops of rain were falling.

SIDNEY GOTTLIEB, 80, LED CIA'S MIND-CONTROL EXPERIMENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Va., N.Y., Wis., Calif.)  (mk) 
 By TIM WEINER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Sidney Gottlieb, who presided over the CIA's Cold
War efforts to control the human mind and provided the agency
poisons to kill Fidel Castro, died on Sunday in Washington, Va. He
was 80, and had spent his later years caring for dying patients,
trying to run a commune, folk-dancing, consciousness-raising and
fighting lawsuits from survivors of his secret tests.
</P>
<P>
   Friends and enemies alike say Gottlieb was a kind of genius,
striving to explore the frontiers of the human mind for his
country, while searching for religious and spiritual meaning in his
life. But he will always be remembered as the government chemist
who dosed Americans with psychedelics in the name of national
security, the man who brought LSD to the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1950s and early 1960s, the agency gave mind-altering
drugs to hundreds of unsuspecting Americans in an effort to explore
the possibilities of controlling human consciousness. Many of the
human guinea pigs were mental patients, prisoners, drug addicts and
prostitutes _ ``people who could not fight back,'' as one agency
officer put it. In one case, a mental patient in Kentucky was dosed
with LSD continuously for 174 days.
</P>
<P>
   Other experiments involved agency employees, military officers
and college students, who had varying degrees of knowledge about
the tests. In all, the agency conducted 149 separate mind-control
experiments, and as many as 25 involved unwitting subjects.
First-hand testimony, fragmentary government documents and court
records show that at least one participant died, others went mad,
and still others suffered psychological damage after participating
in the project, known as MKUltra. The experiments were useless,
Gottlieb concluded in 1972, shortly before he retired.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA awarded Gottlieb the Distinguished Intelligence Medal
and deliberately destroyed most of the MKUltra records in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   John Gittinger, a CIA psychologist who vetted Gottlieb _ ``one
of the most brilliant men I've ever known'' _ and worked with him
for 22 years, said the agency began the tests because it was
gripped by ``a great fear'' in the Cold War. It was afraid that the
Soviet Union would corner the market on LSD and use it as a
chemical weapon or that China would perfect the black art of
brainwashing, Gittinger said.
</P>
<P>
   The agency and Gottlieb believed the United States had to fight
by any means necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in a World War II mode,'' Gittinger said. ``The war
never really ended for us.''
</P>
<P>
   John Marks, author of the definitive book on the experiments,
``The Search for the `Manchurian Candidate''' (Times Books, 1979),
said Gottlieb was ``unquestionably a patriot, a man of great
ingenuity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gottlieb never did what he did for inhumane reasons,'' Marks
said. ``He thought he was doing exactly what was needed. And in the
context of the time, who would argue? But with his experiments on
unwitting subjects, he clearly violated the Nuremburg standards _
the standards under which, after World War II, we executed Nazi
doctors for crimes against humanity.''
</P>
<P>
   Sidney Gottlieb was born in New York City on Aug. 3, 1918, the
son of Hungarian immigrants. His parents were orthodox Jews, but he
did not embrace the faith, Gittinger said: ``He had had a real
problem to find a spiritual focus, having gone away from
Jewishness,'' and he experimented with everything from agnosticism
to Zen Buddhism all his life.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He left the City College of New York, first for the Arkansas
Polytechnic Institute, then for the University of Wisconsin, where
he graduated, magna cum laude, with a chemistry degree in 1940. He
earned a doctorate in biochemistry from the California Institute of
Technology, where, in 1942, he married Margaret Moore, the daughter
of Presbyterian missionaries who served in India, where she was
born. A clubfoot kept him from military service in World War II,
and he was always bitter that he missed the war, Gittinger said.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb joined the CIA in 1951, although not before telling
Gittinger, his interviewer, that he had been a socialist in his
youth.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, the agency established MKUltra and Gottlieb was
running it. As chief of the agency's technical services division,
he served two decades as the senior scientist presiding over some
of the CIA's darkest secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The first of these were the LSD experiments. Gottlieb was
fascinated by the drug, and, a family friend said, he took it
hundreds of times.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the most curious man I ever knew,'' Gittinger said.
``He was willing to try anything to discover something.''
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb was also involved in the CIA's assassination plots. In
the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, Gottlieb, always under
orders from the director of central intelligence or his chief
spymaster, developed a poison handkerchief to kill an Iraqi
colonel, an array of toxic gifts to be delivered to Fidel Castro,
and a poison dart to kill a leftist leader in the Congo. None of
the plans succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   After he left the CIA, Gottlieb and his wife went to India,
where he ran a leper hospital for 18 months. A lifelong stutterer,
he pursued a master's degree in speech therapy. He bought land with
an old log cabin outside a small Virginia town, Boston, where he
pursued two of his lifelong hobbies _ folk-dancing and
goat-herding.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bought that old house and the land with the idea of setting
up a communal home, with several families living together,'' said
Gittinger, a lifelong friend. At least one other couple stayed for
years.
</P>
<P>
   Gottlieb spent his last years in Washington, Va., a pretty
village in the foothills of the Blue Ridge mountains, working in a
hospice, tending to the dying.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife and four children, Penny Gottlieb
Chesluk, Rachel Gottlieb Samoff, Peter Gottlieb and Steven
Gottlieb. Cleaving to old habits of secrecy, his wife declined to
disclose the cause of Gottlieb's death.

 &HT;    Seniors in uproar after cancellation of weekly bingo game
 &HT;    By Jerry Graham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ Some party pooper with a grudge in Irving set
in motion a series of events that devastated several dozen senior
citizens when a Longview supermarket halted a goodwill gesture.
</P>
<P>
   The Monday morning bingo game for senior citizens will no longer
be played at the Kroger Food Store on W. Marshall Ave.
</P>
<P>
   The winners never expected to become millionaires. After all,
the prizes were coupons for a loaf of bread here, a cup of cottage
cheese there.
</P>
<P>
   Most importantly, it was a chance to socialize, an incentive for
an 80-year-old to get out of bed every Monday, one of the senior
citizens said.
</P>
<P>
   But it also is illegal, a felony crime, no less, because Kroger
does not have a license to run a bingo game. And that is where the
party pooper in Irving comes in.
</P>
<P>
   Billy Atkins of Austin, director of the charitable bingo
division of the Texas Lottery Commission, said the agency received
a complaint that a Kroger store in Irving was running an illegal
bingo game.
</P>
<P>
   He said two or three weeks ago, a lottery investigator notified
the Irving store manager it is illegal to operate a bingo game
without a license.
</P>
<P>
   No charges were filed, the Irving bingo game stopped and Atkins
said he thought that was the end of it. That is, until he got a
call from the Longview News-Journal with questions about why the
Lottery Commission rained on the parade of senior citizens here.
</P>
<P>
   Several senior citizens called the newspaper to complain that
the Lottery Commission had halted the bingo game at the Kroger in
Longview. They were dismayed that their once-a-week excursion to
the bingo tables in the deli section were over.
</P>
<P>
   ``As near as I can tell, we haven't said anything to the store
in Longview,'' Atkins said. ``I think it is Kroger's that sent out
this notification to all their stores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Under the Bingo Enabling Act of Texas, only nonprofit,
charitable organizations are authorized to have a license to
conduct bingo,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The act is strict and says it is irrelevant whether the winner
receives a prize or pays to participate, Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the complaints about unauthorized bingo games are rare.
The last one the commission received was several years ago about a
chain discount store running a similar game for senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like our goal in life is to go out and prevent these
folks from having any fun. But the Bingo Enabling Act is very
strict in its definition of what bingo is and how it is
conducted,'' Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The senior citizens who complained to the Longview News-Journal
did not want to be quoted, fearful that zealots in the Lottery
Commission would shut down every bingo game in area nursing homes
if they were identified.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an exception for games that are conducted in senior
citizens facilities, nursing homes and hospitals. Organizations
like that can apply to us for an exemption. They can be exempted
from licensure if the games are conducted there at the facility for
the enjoyment of the patients,'' Atkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Longview Kroger Manager Terisa Smith said the senior citizens
would gather each Monday morning in the deli section for breakfast.
After eating, they would play cards or dominoes until the one-hour
bingo game started at 8 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had been doing it for years, and we had no idea that we
were doing something illegal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She said the seniors are welcome to continue their Monday
morning routine, minus the bingo game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a problem with them coming up here at all, if
they want to get together, drink coffee and socialize. They can
still do that. I just can't have them doing the bingo anymore and
giving away the prizes that they got,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to abide by the law,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Analyzing X-ray images of transient S-shaped patterns on the
sun, scientists think they have found a reliable way to forecast
powerful solar eruptions that can cause disruptive magnetic storms
in Earth's atmosphere, knock out electrical systems and
communications, and disable orbiting spacecraft.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists reported Tuesday that two years of observations
by the Yohkoh Soft X-Ray Telescope, a Japanese-American-British
satellite, showed a strong correlation between the appearance of S
or inverse S shapes, called sigmoids, and the likelihood of a
violent eruption in that region a few days later.
</P>
<P>
   These eruptions, called coronal mass ejections, are discharges
of hot, electrically charged gas from the sun's outer atmosphere,
presumably caused by interactions of twisted solar magnetic field
lines. They are as powerful as billions of nuclear explosions and
send out blasts of electrified gases at least once a day that, if
pointed in the right direction, can reach Earth in four days. Such
a solar storm two years ago silenced a communications satellite.
</P>
<P>
   In a news conference at the Washington offices of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, solar physicists showed
time-lapse movies from the Yohkoh spacecraft that illustrated the
relationship between the emergence of sigmoids, particularly the
large ones, and subsequent coronal mass ejections. Each sigmoid,
they said, is like a loaded gun with a high probability of going
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have here a tool which we expect will be very useful in
forecasting space weather,'' said Dr. Richard C. Canfield, a
physicist at Montana State University in Bozeman, who was a leader
in interpreting the new findings. He is the principal author of a
report on the research being published next Monday in the journal
Geophysical Research Letters.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, Canfield's group noted that sigmoids in all sizes
showed eruptive signatures but that the noneruptive ones were
almost always small. Yet in even the smallest-size category, the
authors said, ``at least twice as many show eruptive signatures as
don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Another speaker at the news conference, Dr. Sarah Gibson, a
solar physicist at Cambridge University in England, described the
sigmoid phenomenon as ``observable tracers of twisted magnetic
fields, quite possibly some of the field lines lighting up with a
lot of energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David M. Rust, a physicist at the Johns Hopkins University
Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., noted one mystifying and
possibly significant aspect of the phenomenon: the regular S
pattern is the rule in the sun's southern hemisphere, and the
inverse S is the most frequent occurrence in the north.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we are really seeing is telling you something about the
fundamental physics of the sun,'' Rust said, but what that is, he
was not ready to say.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The scientists noted another peculiarity that they did not
understand. If the research showed that S marks the spot of a
likely coronal eruption, they said, other common magnetically
disturbed regions of the sun that have a symmetrical butterfly
shape only rarely lead to eruptions.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent relationship between the sigmoid patterns and the
coronal ejections was first observed by Dr. Hugh S. Hudson and Dr.
Alphonse Sterling, American physicists working at the Institute of
Space and Astronautical Science in Japan, where the X-ray images
transmitted by the Earth-orbiting Yohkoh spacecraft were processed.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of that early finding, Hudson, Canfield and Dr.
David E. McKenzie, also of Montana State, embarked on a detailed
examination of Yohkoh's daily X-ray images _ 50 a day _ over the
course of two years, 1993 and 1997. This established ``the tight
statistical relationship between sigmoids and eruptions,'' Canfield
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The next step, he said, is to transform the correlations into a
more refined predictive tool leading to early warnings of impending
magnetic storms caused by the coronal mass ejections.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get past simple classifications such as `Is it
sigmoidal or not, is the sunspot big or small,' and get to
quantitative measurements that answer `How twisted are the magnetic
fields, how big is the spot,''' Canfield said. ``As well, we want
to know in which direction the coronal mass eruption is going to
go, and how many regions are likely to erupt.''
</P>
<P>
   Rust said it would take several years of observations by other
spacecraft and further study before the new knowledge could be
translated into a reliable forecasting system. The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration is building a solar X-ray imaging
satellite, similar to Yohkoh, to be launched next year.
</P>
<P>
   And NASA is planning a spacecraft mission, Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory, to make three-dimensional observations of
the dynamics of coronal mass eruptions and their surrounding
regions.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal, scientists said, is to be able to include
early warnings of stormy solar weather in space in the same way
meteorologists make long-range forecasts of weather on Earth.

   WEIMAR, Germany _ There are times when Bernd Kauffmann looks a
little worn down. And for good reason: How would you like to be
responsible for staging a world-class cultural program in a small
city whose legacy ranges from Goethe to Buchenwald? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since 1985, the culture ministers from each of the 15 countries
in the European Union have selected a city to be Europe's ``culture
capital'' for a year. This year they selected Weimar, and Kauffmann
is the city's chief organizer behind an extraordinary series of
concerts, plays and art shows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But few cities carry a more searing mix of legacies than this
town of 60,000 residents in the former East German state of
Thuringia. In its golden age during the 18th century, the city
became a magnet for some of Europe's greatest writers and
composers. Its most famous resident was Goethe, whose epic play
``Faust'' immortalized the story of one man's bargain with the
devil. Weimar also attracted the poet Schiller, the composer Franz
Liszt, and Walter Gropius, founder of the revolutionary Bauhaus
school of architecture.
</P>
<P>
   In 1919, the city was the birthplace of Germany's ill-fated
attempt to forge a democratic republic _ an attempt that came
crashing to an end 14 years later when Hitler came to power. Under
Hitler, Weimar became a way station for trains taking Jews and
other prisoners to the death camp at Buchenwald, just five miles
outside town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Buchenwald, where 60,000 people died under Hitler and 8,000 more
during the Russian occupation immediately after World War II, has
been preserved as a museum and memorial to the Holocaust. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All of that is now entwined with this century's other great
turmoil: more than four decades under a communist regime that
finally ended with the fall of the Berlin Wall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, city officials are trying to weave these painful
threads together and reclaim Weimar's heritage. After 40 years of
deterioration under the East German regime, the city's winding
streets and historic buildings have been lovingly restored. Cafes,
bookstores and parks now beckon, while theaters and libraries
attempt to breathe new life into the old culture. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The central focus of the 1999 celebrations will be Goethe's
250th birthday, which falls on Aug. 28 but is being commemorated
all year long. This year also marks Schiller's 240th birthday, the
80th anniversary of the Weimar Republic and the 10th anniversary of
the fall of the Berlin Wall. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The German government has spent more than $700 million in the
past two years fixing up this ancient college town. (In addition to
the school of architecture, there is also a separate Bauhaus
University.) Kauffmann has signed up artists, dance troupes,
orchestras and scholars from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Goethe and Faust will dominate the agenda. The
German National Theater, which has been renovated at a cost of more
than $14 million, will stage Berlioz's opera ``The Damnation of
Faust.'' The German choreographers Ismael Ivo and Marcio Aurelio
are preparing a dance performance called ``Mephisto.'' There will
even be a rap version of ``Faust'' and a multimedia show called
``F(AT)ust: Version 3.0.'' An exhibition of Goethe's drawings will
be on display at Buchenwald. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Kauffmann will also bring in scores of other artists, including
the Dance Theater of Harlem, which will perform in June, followed a
few days later by the American blues singer Taj Mahal and Wynton
Marsalis. Symphony orchestras from Tokyo, Moscow, Tel Aviv,
Budapest and of course Germany will pass through as well. Israeli
and Palestinian musicians will get together in a 10-day workshop
with the hope of forging a permanent orchestra. And in the shadow
of Buchenwald, in what is being called the first joint performance
by a German and an Israeli orchestra, Zubin Mehta will direct a
Mahler concert.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is an impressive lineup. But Weimar remains a small town that
would be poverty-stricken if it weren't getting huge infusions of
money from the federal government in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   When Kauffmann's organization, Weimar 99, announced that it
would start taking orders for tickets to events this summer, the
switchboard was overloaded and thousands of people couldn't even
reach voice-mail recordings. The city received a torrent of bad
publicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected a gradual increase in the demand for tickets, not
the flood of calls right at the very beginning,'' Kauffmann said.
``We don't have enough money to hire all the people we need to
answer telephones. And even if we did, we couldn't do it because
our telephone system can't handle that many lines.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weimar is also being pulled between East and West. Many
residents here grumble that Kauffmann, who comes from Hamburg, is
an arrogant Besserwessi, or West German know-it-all. He recently
remarked, for example, that Weimar was a wonderful place if you
could get out, see the world and then come back. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And some of the 1999 events have not been entirely successful.
An early version of ``Faust'' received poor reviews, and a show
planned by the choreographer Robert Wilson has been postponed
indefinitely for want of an adequate staging area. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, after years of reconstruction, Weimar has regained
much of its old charm. The habit of trying to separate the evil of
Buchenwald from the humanism of Weimar has given way to a growing
consensus that both are part of the heritage.

 &HT;    For Lewis, it's greatness or obscurity
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A former heavyweight champion was sitting adjacent to
a reigning one ringside at a recent boxing card when an autograph
seeker approached. Larry Holmes obliged the fan's request for his
signature, then motioned to the large man next to him and asked the
youth, ``Don't you want his, too?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's that?'' the boy responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox Lewis,'' Holmes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never heard of him,'' said the boy, who turned and walked
away.
</P>
<P>
   That a boxer can maintain such anonymity despite winning an
Olympic gold medal as an amateur, twice holding a title belt as a
pro and banking several million dollars is remarkable _ which is
not to suggest it's a good thing. For the better part of the 1990s,
Lennox Lewis has been boxing's biggest afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as his own trainer, Emanuel Steward, put it, ``If Lennox
loses this fight, he'll just be another guy from England with
dreadlocks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This fight'' is Saturday's heavyweight title unification
against Evander Holyfield, who embraces something with a far
greater shelf life than his WBA and IBF title belts: a significant
place in history. Ring Magazine recently voted Holyfield boxing's
third greatest heavyweight champion behind Muhammad Ali and Joe
Louis. Even those who might debate Holyfield's place in the
all-time rankings won't question his place as the best in this era,
having beaten every other major contender or champion: Mike Tyson,
Riddick Bowe, Michael Moorer, George Foreman, Ray Mercer, Holmes
and, OK, James ``Buster'' Douglas. Of those, Lewis has fought only
Mercer, and won a decision that many felt judges tiltled in the
wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   Even Lewis' two reigns as WBC champion are tainted. In 1993, he
won a decision over Tony Tucker for the vacant title. Bowe had just
beaten Holyfield for the unified crown but renounced the WBC
portion rather than make a mandatory defense against Lewis. The
following year, Lewis lost his ``paper'' title to a glorified club
fighter, Oliver McCall.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Lewis went to court to secure a title shot against
Tyson, but Tyson chose instead to fight Holyfield. Lewis got the
belt, then won his first two defenses when: 1) McCall suffered a
nervous breakdown in the ring and; 2) Henry Akinwande was
disqualified for excessive holding.
</P>
<P>
   Fights against all of the marquee names in the 1990s have
fizzled, either because of Lewis or his would-be opponents,
depending on your point of view and source of income. The only
certainty is Lewis' place among heavyweights will cease being a
mystery Saturday at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my time,'' said Lewis, who was born in London, but
splits his residence between Canada and the U.S. ``There's a reason
for everything and the reasons that I wasn't able to put my stamp
on things before, whether it was politics or whatever, now it has
finally come time to make my mark and create history. This will be
a defining fight for Lennox Lewis.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis created high expectations after beating Bowe for the gold
medal in the 1988 Olympics. But a number of his performances in the
pros have been lackluster, and while he possesses a solid right
hand, there have been few moments when he has displayed any boxing
skills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's never lived up to what I thought he should be,'' said Don
Turner, Holyfield's trainer. ``I just don't believe he's obsessed
about fighting like the real fighters. He is a champion of the
world but to me, he just never really developed.''
</P>
<P>
   Most irritating to Lewis is the suggestion that he is overly
robotic in the ring and rarely fights with any emotion _ sort of
the anti-Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've heard for a long time, especially with the American
media, that Lennox Lewis has no heart,'' Lewis said. ``Where does
that come from? When Evander Holyfield gets hit and he comes back,
he shows heart. Maybe since I don't get hit and don't come back,
that's why they say that. Evander Holyfield doesn't have a monopoly
on hearts.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has talked negatively more about Lewis than any of his
previous foes, in part because Lewis claimed Holyfield had been
ducking him.
</P>
<P>
   ``His fights are not classic,'' Holyfield said.. ``There's no
skills. He just goes in there swinging his arms. He's insecure
because he doesn't think he can get somebody out with his skills
and conditioning. This is the man who calls somebody else
chicken.'' Lewis' purse ($8 million) pales in comparison to
Holyfield's ($20 million) and he is a slight underdog in Las Vegas,
despite being younger, taller and stronger with a 34-1 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad I'm the underdog,'' Lewis said. ``I like the
atmosphere of having something to fight for.''

LAMAR ALEXANDER, RUNNING SINCE '96, MAKES IT OFFICIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (With ALEXANDER-POLITICS-BIO) 
(nk) 
 By RICHARD L. BERKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Repeatedly invoking a cheery mantra that he
would ``bring out the best in America,'' Lamar Alexander formally
declared his candidacy for the Republican presidential nomination
on Tuesday by recalling his achievements as governor of Tennessee
and vowing to restore respect for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander's dogged quest for the White House never ceased after
he pulled out in 1996, a campaign in which he is remembered for
casting himself as a down-home Washington outsider by wearing a
red-and-black plaid shirt. In his announcement speech four years
ago, he tapped out the bluegrass standard, ``Rocky Top,'' on an
electronic keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Alexander had no gimmicks. He wore a dignified dark
suit, and picked the state Capitol as the venue for reintroducing
himself as a businesslike, accomplished leader who brought new jobs
to this state, improved roads and public education.
</P>
<P>
   He ridiculed the scandals of President Clinton directly, saying
``If we are going to bring out the best in America, we need a
president who talks straight and who will listen &UR; . &LR; ''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``A new American century will require a moral
foundation laid by a president who respects the office and respects
those who put him in the office, a president who understands what
makes this nation great and who understands what will keep it that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   His underlying message was more subtle: Republicans should not
rush this early into backing either of the two most popular
contenders, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas or Elizabeth Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time the race is wide open,'' said Alexander, who is 58.
``There is no one whose `turn' it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Although his bearing is mild-mannered, Alexander has not shied
away in recent weeks from lambasting Bush's ``compassionate
conservative'' slogan as ``weasel words.'' He left no doubt that he
is primed for oratorical combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a tea party on the English countryside,'' he said
in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, he never mentioned his rivals' names. Instead he
cited the last Republican hero.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1980, Ronald Reagan asked the American people, `Are you
better off today than you were four years ago?' And most people
said `no,' '' he said. ``My question today is different. It is
about the future and it is this: Will our country be better four
years from now than it is today?''
</P>
<P>
   His fear, Alexander said, was that ``if we continue along the
path of the wizard Clinton and his faithful assistant Gore are
taking us, the answer won't be yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander, who after serving as governor and president of the
University of Tennessee, was Education Secretary under President
Bush, said his three fundamental goals as president would be to
improve public education, to raise family incomes by cutting taxes
and securing the Social Security system, and to strengthen the
military.
</P>
<P>
   While some Republicans dismiss Alexander's candidacy, noting
that his ideas did not catch on the last time, he contended in the
interview that he is in a stronger position now because he
persevered though the process before _ and has painstakingly
assembled perhaps the most potent organizations in the pivotal
early states of New Hampshire and Iowa. (He has spent 121 days in
Iowa since 1996.) He also argues that he can amass more money than
most of the competitors, in part because, as in 1996, he has signed
up one of the most successful fund-raisers in the party, Ted Welch.
</P>
<P>
   Selling himself as perhaps not flashy but certainly more tested
than his rivals, Alexander said he was ``someone who knows from the
first day that he or she is in office exactly what they will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his sturdy campaign structure, Alexander has been
frustrated that his candidacy has been completely eclipsed by Bush
and, to a lesser extent, Ms. Dole. Their prospective bids have
stirred far more anticipation _ and registered far higher in the
polls. And Alexander's capacity to raise as much money as he did
last time is in doubt because Bush has already enlisted several of
his most prodigious fund-raising backers.
</P>
<P>
   ``People shouldn't laugh too much because if Bush fails to live
up to his Mount Everest high expectations, Lamar will have a shot
to upset him,'' said Mike Murphy, who was one of Alexander's top
strategists in 1996 but who has not joined any campaign this year.
``He's going to take a pounding for the next few months. But he's
built to do that. And the real game is at the end of the year.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Struggling to make his case, Alexander relies on scenarios of
what-might-have-happened in 1996: that he finished a respectable
third place in Iowa and New Hampshire, almost nipping ahead of Bob
Dole in the New Hampshire primary. Alexander emerged, briefly, as
the most credible alternative to Dole, but he was unable to survive
a media storm financed by the Dole campaign that condemned his
personal financial dealings.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander explained in an interview that he was well-positioned
to emerge if Bush faltered. ``The next president will be me or Bush
or Vice President Gore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Alexander showed a reporter polling figures not from the current
campaign _ where his support is stuck in the single digits _ but
from March of 1996, which showed that his performance in New
Hampshire catapulted him to third place in a poll in California.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has dwarfed him in endorsements from governors,
Alexander trumpeted the two governors who are backing him and who
introduced him Tuesday: Don Sundquist of Tennessee and Mike
Huckabee of Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he gave top billing Tuesday to his biggest catch, former
Gov. Terry Branstad of Iowa, an influential figure in the state
that traditionally holds the first caucuses. Branstad was not
bashful about contrasting Alexander to his better-known rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Iowans are the first to have the opportunity to make
their choice known for president, I believe it will not be the
person with the most money _ it will not be the person with the
most famous name,'' Branstad said. ``But it will be someone like
us: straight talking, hard-working, somebody that puts quality
education at the top of the agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   While Alexander has abandoned his call for abolishing the
Department of Education _ an applause line in his announcement four
years ago _ he emphasized that his chief concerns were ``parents
raising children'' and freeing teachers and principals who are
``suffocating under union rules, court orders and government
regulations.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many of his competitors, Alexander is not known as a
hard-edged conservative. Instead, he tries to blend his
conservative ideas in an agreeable manner. For example, he said
that when he was governor, he appointed the first black justice to
the state Supreme Court. But as Education Secretary, he said, he
opposed scholarships based solely on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government's helping hand _ affirmative action _ is for
everyone,'' he said. ``Always based on need, never based on race.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Near the end of ``All About Eve,'' Hollywood's
enduring, self-loathing take on the vanities of Broadway, the
scheming anti-heroine accepts an award for her debut performance in
New York's biggest new hit, casts her doe eyes downward and starts
the inexorable process of selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although ... I am going to Hollywood next week to make a
film,'' Anne Baxter breathlessly intones, ``do not think for a
moment that I'm leaving you. How could I? My heart is here, in the
theater, and 3,000 miles are too far away to be from one's heart.
I'll be back to claim it _ and soon. That is, if you
(italics)want(end italics) me back.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, Eve Harrington wouldn't have to worry too much about
her heart _ or her air fare. She could always, as her rival Margo
Channing might say, put a starring role in an L.A. play where her
heart ought to be. From the Mexican border to the Mark Taper Forum
here, theater is alive _ and well enough _ in Southern California,
and the stars of film and television are dabbling in it in ever
greater numbers.
</P>
<P>
   This season alone, familiar faces as diverse as Carol Burnett,
Annette Bening, Donald Sutherland, Al Pacino and Molly Ringwald
have appeared, or are scheduled to do so, on Los Angeles stages, in
new works, revivals of classics, or reworkings of recent New York
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Hatcher has traded her ``Lois and Clark'' notepad on
television for Sally Bowles' garters in the opening of the national
tour of ``Cabaret,'' and Jenna Elfman, the hot star of the series
``Dharma and Greg,'' spends her Saturdays and Sundays in a tiny
theater with Miguel Ferrer, performing in half of ``Visions and
Lovers: Variations on a Theme,'' two one-act musings on
relationships by Milton Katselas, an acting teacher.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, a region that has long been a net exporter of
social trends and pop culture has increasingly added serious
theater to the list of products it ships East. South Coast
Repertory in neighboring Orange County, for example, developed
``Wit'' by Margaret Edson, ``Three Days of Rain'' by Richard
Greenberg and ``Collected Stories'' by Donald Margulies, all plays
that have been seen in New York over the last two seasons, while at
the Taper, the Stephen Sondheim revue ``Putting It Together'' was
put together again last fall in a new form with Ms. Burnett and is
being sent back to Manhattan next season with better reviews than
it got Off Broadway in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there are special challenges for theater here. The
biggest may simply be the competition for attention in a place
where it is neither a major tourist attraction nor an important
commercial presence, where auditoriums are spread around a
sprawling region with chronic traffic problems and little adjacent
after-show night life, where advertising is even more expensive
than in New York, where no local television station has a full-time
theater critic, and where theater coverage in the Sunday Calendar
section of The Los Angeles Times begins on page 30 or 40, miles
behind the movie ads and other listings.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some of the most serious theater in Southern California
is not in Los Angeles at all, but 45 minutes by car at South Coast
Rep in Costa Mesa, or three hours away at the La Jolla Playhouse
and the Old Globe Theater in San Diego, both of which in recent
years have sent a batch of offerings to Broadway, from revivals of
``Damn Yankees'' and ``How to Succeed in Business Without Really
Trying'' to ``Tommy'' by the Who.
</P>
<P>
   A short hop over the Hollywood Hills is the Pasadena Playhouse,
which in its glory days helped train actors like William Holden and
Gene Hackman. The theater reopened more than a decade ago after
being dark for 20 years and now presents new works and revivals.
</P>
<P>
   If geography and movie mania are the biggest obstacles,
producers here say the captive talent pool of the film industry is
the city's single greatest asset in generating theatrical vehicles.
These range from big commercial productions to nonprofit mountings
of experimental, ethnic and gay plays, to a student version of
``Once Upon a Mattress'' at the University of California at Los
Angeles, where an alumna, Ms. Burnett, made her directorial debut
last month in a revival of the musical that made her famous 40
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a movie town, clearly,'' said Gilbert Cates, the
veteran director and stage and film producer. Cates, whose credits
range from the play and film of Robert Anderson's ``I Never Sang
for My Father'' to the annual Academy Awards telecast, and who is
now in his third season as producing director of the Geffen
Playhouse, is presenting Ms. Bening there in ``Hedda Gabler''
(previews begin Sunday night, with an opening scheduled for March
24).
</P>
<P>
   ``But the truth is,'' he said, ``this city is filled with tens
of thousands of actors, writers and directors, and what are they
going to do when they're not making movies? Theater is still the
place where you can do a show.'' Indeed, Cates will be directing
Linda Lavin and Samantha Mathis at the Geffen in ``Collected
Stories'' in May, when Margulies' play completes its circle and
returns to California.
</P>
<P>
   All around town, stages are filled with aspiring stars eager for
exposure and the chance to practice, and established ones happy to
return to their roots and stretch new muscles _ and not just in
legitimate houses. The Groundlings, the comedy troupe that helped
promote performers like Mike Myers, Phil Hartman and Jon Lovitz, is
still going strong.
</P>
<P>
   And most every Sunday night, Jay Leno returns to his origins in
stand-up while testing ``Tonight Show'' monologues at the Comedy
and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Actors from Tim Robbins to Noah Wyle, the boyish heartthrob of
``E.R.,'' have been instrumental in starting or supporting
respected small theater companies in Hollywood. At the same time,
they take advantage of agreements with Actors Equity that allow
union performers to experiment in lower-paying work with nonunion
actors in theaters with 99 seats or less.
</P>
<P>
   In 1981, as a UCLA student, Robbins helped found the Actors'
Gang, a company that performs in a 99-seat theater and on whose
board Ms. Bening sits. Though he now lives on the other coast,
Robbins still supports the troupe and is underwriting its current
production of ``Broadway,'' the 1926 Philip Dunning-George Abbott
melodrama set in speak-easy New York.

GIBBS' KNEE IFFY FOR NIT OPENER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Pepperdine men's basketball team stumbled to
the finish line in the regular season. Fortunately for the Waves,
they have another race to run in the National Invitation
Tournament. Will they be running it on one leg?
</P>
<P>
   When Pepperdine warms up for tonight's first-round NIT game at
Boulder, Colo., the host coaches will be watching Waves sophomore
forward Kelvin Gibbs, who has an infected knee.
</P>
<P>
   Tipoff is scheduled for 6 p.m. at Coors Events Center.
</P>
<P>
   If Gibbs can overcome the injury, the Waves have a chance. If he
can't play, Pepperdine is in deep trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado (17-14) finished the regular season on a roll, winning
six of its past eight. The Buffaloes, ranked No.111 in the RPI,
were first in the Big 12 Conference in scoring and fourth in
rebounding.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine (19-12) lost five of its final eight games and was
sixth in scoring and rebounding in a weaker conference, the West
Coast. Still, the Waves have a higher RPI ranking than CU _ 105.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbs is the Waves' second-leading scorer and top rebounder.
</P>
<P>
   The team left for Boulder on Tuesday morning. On Monday, Waves
coach Lorenzo Romar said he was doubtful Gibbs could play. But
Jennifer Chelton, Pepperdine's head athletic trainer, said on
Monday Gibbs would be able to play.
</P>
<P>
   Romar, who has guided Pepperdine to six, 17 and 19 wins in three
years, will see a familiar face on the Colorado bench. Sophomore
forward Jamahl Mosley was recruited by Romar out of high school in
San Diego. Mosley is CU's fifth-leading scorer (9.6 ppg) and
leading rebounder (6.5).
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted (Mosley),'' Romar said. ``Early on we were in (the
running).''

   When Romar got the call that the Waves were invited to the NIT,
he said he was ``very, very excited.'' Mark Trakh, the Pepperdine
women's coach, wasn't as enthusiastic when he found out the Waves
were in the women's NIT.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves, who play at New Mexico (22-6) on Friday, were
co-champions of the WCC in the regular season and 21-8. They lost
in the WCC Tournament final to St. Mary's.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were a little disappointed,'' Trakh said.
</P>
<P>
   Santa Clara, which shared the regular-season title with
Pepperdine, was given an at-large bid for the women's tournament
despite losing in the semifinals of the WCC Tournament. Trakh said
he wasn't bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally see them taking Santa Clara over us,'' Trakh said.
``They beat Stanford and lost a close game to Colorado State.
You've got to beat top-25, top-50 teams to get in. We only played
one top-25 team (UCLA) and got blown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine's RPI rating is 57th. New Mexico is No. 58.

   A few years ago, as a 19-year-old upstart, Wyle wandered into
the Blank Theater Company to audition for David Mamet's ``Sexual
Perversity in Chicago,'' landed the part of a 29-year-old and is
now the artistic producer and chief fund-raiser for the company,
which was founded nine years ago by Daniel Henning, a New York
transplant. Its latest production is ``Starr Struck: A Musical
Investigation'' into the world of the special Whitewater
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   All this cross-pollination requires special accommodations. For
example, Ms. Elfman and Ferrer split their roles with other actors
and only appear on weekends in their current play, to allow for
their taping schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Film and television work pays the bills for most actors here,
but with the profusion of cable networks and television movies, the
long summer breaks that used to prevail in network television,
leaving stars free for the stage, are getting shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What has changed is that hiatus has virtually totally
disappeared,'' said Gordon Davidson, the artistic director and
producer of the Taper since its founding 32 years ago. The grand
not-so-old man of Los Angeles theater, he first staged plays like
``The Trial of the Catonsville Nine'' by Daniel Berrigan.
</P>
<P>
   One of his most recent, the first installment of ``The Cider
House Rules,'' a two-part epic version of the John Irving novel
performed at the Taper last spring, opens May 6 at the Atlantic
Theater Company in New York.
</P>
<P>
   For the last decade, Davidson has also run the Ahmanson Theater,
the other playhouse at the Music Center of Los Angeles, which books
tours, like Christopher Plummer in ``Barrymore,'' musicals and
special productions, like the concert version of Sondheim's
``Sweeney Todd'' this weekend by the local nonprofit company
Reprise: Broadway's Best in Concert. It celebrates the show's 20th
anniversary and stars Kelsey Grammer and Christine Baranski.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, I heard a comment that I thought I'd never
hear again, but sure enough, I heard it recently,'' Davidson
recalled. ``An agent said, `What if my client gets a job?' I said,
`What do you think I'm offering?'''
</P>
<P>
   Garry Marshall, the producer-director-actor who made his fortune
with situation comedies like ``Happy Days'' and ``The Odd Couple,''
used some of that fortune to open the 99-seat Falcon Theater in
Burbank in late 1997, and it has since presented ``Death of a
Salesman'' starring his old friend Jack Klugman, as well as
children's theater and readings of new works by the likes of Ms.
Bening.
</P>
<P>
   This spring, it will join forces for the second year with the
Blank Theater Company to sponsor a young playwrights festival in
which authors ages 19 and under from around the country are invited
to submit new works, with the winners assigned established
playwrights as mentors.
</P>
<P>
   But Marshall, who says he has had a ``theater addiction'' since
his childhood in the Bronx, knows his adopted hometown well enough
to insist on special architectural features to avoid annoying
disruptions by agents and studio executives.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of big shots don't come for the whole play,'' he said
dryly. ``They come to see their client and leave. So in the
lighting booth, we put about 10 chairs for people to use if they
have to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Many producers say that theater here is better, more lively and
more diverse than popular perception might suggest, and most
grumble to varying degrees about lack of news media coverage and
unevenness of critical scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably as good a theater scene as anywhere outside New
York, except possibly Chicago,'' said Jack Viertel, a former
theater critic for the now-defunct Los Angeles Herald-Examiner and
former dramaturge at the Taper, who is now creative director for
the Jujamcyn theater organization in New York. ``But I don't think
it commands the kinds of newsworthiness in the city that the
theater does in Chicago, which doesn't have another entertainment
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The search for an audience is constant, say producers, with
nonprofit theaters like the Taper and the Geffen depending heavily
on subscription ticket buyers who are disproportionately older,
white, affluent residents of Westside neighborhoods from Beverly
Hills to Brentwood. Or, as Viertel put it, ``groups of four who get
together four times a year.''
</P>
<P>
   Even for large, commercial tours of Broadway musicals, marketing
shows in Los Angeles can be trickier than in Boston or Chicago.
``It's a really hard sell,'' said one Broadway publicist, speaking
on condition of anonymity. ``I put it down partly to a movie
mentality; there, it's all about the opening weekend, and the
excitement dies down pretty quickly. A lot of shows just can't get
the stamina. Even something like `Sunset Boulevard' was very hot
for a time when Glenn Close was in it, but none of the big
commercial properties has proven to be really long running there.''
</P>
<P>
   Theater L.A., the local industry trade group and service
organization, has 159 members that range from large for-profit
chain theaters like the Shubert in Century City to small
nonprofits. Theater L.A. claims there are more live theater
productions in Los Angeles than in any other city in the world, and
estimates there were 200 world premieres here last season.
</P>
<P>
   But that was not enough to keep the group's half-price ticket
sales office _ which operates from a branch of Jerry's Famous Deli
in West Hollywood _ open seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found that the bulk of business was Thursday to Sunday,''
said the group's executive director, Alisa Fishbach, who noted that
estimates of theater attendance are purely anecdotal because no
marketing study has been done in about a decade. The group is
currently trying to raise money to do another.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ms. Fishbach added: ``Personally, I think things are
changing. I've been in the industry here for 15 years, and the
knocks aren't so prevalent anymore. We're getting a little bit more
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   For many actors, of course, the theater remains the ultimate
test of their abilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is that Southern California has the largest talent
pool of actors anywhere in the world, and while they have not
primarily come here to do theater, our experience is that the very
best of them have come from the theater,'' said David Emmes,
co-founder and producing artistic director of South Coast Rep. Now
in its 35th season, the organization has a $7.5 million annual
budget, 65 full-time employees and plans to add a new 300-seat
theater designed by Cesar Pelli.

   ``Theater is the actor's art, whereas film is obviously the
director's, so I think that the really good actor longs to get back
on the stage,'' Emmes added. ``While they would be reluctant to go
out of town, to some other part of the country, they can work at
the Taper or South Coast Rep, sleep in their own beds and keep up
some sense of family life, if they have one, and still keep their
contact with their primary purpose, namely Hollywood.''
</P>
<P>
   For Ferrer, the eldest son of the stage and film actor Jose
Ferrer and the singer Rosemary Clooney, ``Visions and Lovers'' was
his first return to the stage after a decade of work in films and
television, most recently on the NBC sitcom ``Lateline,'' in which
he plays the darkly comic producer of a ``Nightline''-style news
program.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the risk of sounding melodramatic or outright silly, it's
really kind of sparked a genuine artistic reawakening for me,''
said Ferrer, who has tended in film work to be typecast as a bit of
a heavy and leaped at the offer to play a passionate writer for his
old acting teacher, Katselas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Honest to God, I'm a different guy because of this play,''
Ferrer said. ``It's the hardest work I've ever done, and the least
money, but as a result of working on this, I started listening to
music in the car again instead of talk radio, and waking up my wife
in the middle of the night to read her a passage from Walt
Whitman.''
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, as on Broadway, nothing sells a show like a
star, and there is pressure to have a marquee name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suddenly, there's a flurry of stars working on Broadway and
here,'' Davidson said. ``It used to be thought, in the inner circle
of agentry, that it meant the client wasn't doing so well, but I
think that stigma is not the case now.''
</P>
<P>
   Davidson quoted a facetious rule of thumb: audiences at the
750-seat Taper ask ``What's playing?'' while those at the
2,000-seat Ahmanson want to know ``Who's in it?'' But he noted that
early on, the Taper presented stars like Jack Lemmon, and Walter
Matthau and Maureen Stapleton in ``Juno and the Paycock.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has never hurt to have a star,'' Davidson said. ``But there
are plays that are ensemble plays and sometimes you just want an
ensemble.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, in fact, you just want a play. Two of the stars who
will appear at the Taper later this year _ Sutherland, in the
American premiere of ``Enigma Variations'' by the French playwright
Eric-Emmanuel Schmitt, in May and June, and Pacino, directing and
acting in his Los Angeles stage debut in Eugene O'Neill's
``Hughie,'' in June and July _ are replacements for works that did
not pan out.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland will slip into a slot vacated by the writer, director
and performance artist Anna Deavere Smith, whose new play, ``House
Arrest,'' about the American Presidency and the press, originally
seen in Washington in 1997, will now be presented as a
work-in-progress for a shorter run. Pacino, who will be performing
with Paul Benedict, as he did in his production of ``Hughie'' at
Circle in the Square in New York in 1996, will be filling a vacancy
left when Athol Fugard recently decided to stop acting.
</P>
<P>
   The South African playwright had appeared in his memory play
``The Captain's Tiger'' in New York, but did not want to continue
in the role. Davidson decided not to present the play without him.
</P>
<P>
   Most producers here agree that the biggest challenge for local
theaters is to make the leap from the 99-seat union-waiver house to
a mid-size operation that pays a living wage. One that recently did
so is East-West Players in the Asian neighborhood known as Little
Tokyo. The company specializes in Asian-American themes and has
staged a well-received revival of Sondheim's musical ``Pacific
Overtures.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Davidson, who runs the biggest, most established theater
operation in town, is in a constant quest for grants, donors and
new ways to keep the Taper _ with an annual budget of $12.4 million
_ alive. ``It's complex, at times frustrating,'' he said. ``I'm not
one to put down the complications. But it's exciting to be able to
do it.''

EPISCOPAL BISHOPS TO AVOID SEXUALITY ISSUES AT 2000 CONVENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Colo., Calif.) 
 
By RICHARD VARA 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAVASOTA, Texas _ The Episcopal Church's national House of
Bishops concluded a six-day retreat Tuesday agreeing to avoid votes
on controversial gay rights issues such as the blessing of same-sex
unions during the denomination's convention in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   More than 140 bishops, including Presiding Bishop Frank
Griswold, attended the retreat at Camp Allen, the Episcopal Diocese
of Texas' retreat and conference center.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we did not vote on it here, the sense was that we
will not vote up or down on the hot-button sexuality issues at the
General Convention in 2000,'' said Diocese of Texas Bishop Claude
Payne, who hosted the retreat. It was the first time the House of
Bishops had met in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not minimizing the issues,'' he said. ``But there's a new
framework that is: What are we called to do when we identify
Episcopalian?'' Payne has been emphasizing outreach and missions as
the church's primary focus.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions within the 2.2 million-member denomination are building
as the national church's triennial meeting draws near. For nearly
25 years, the denomination has been bitterly divided between
liberals who support the ordination of openly gay candidates for
the priesthood and church blessings for gay unions, and
traditionalists who oppose the actions.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop William Wantland, a leader of American traditionalists,
was guardedly optimistic that a denominational split could be
avoided next year when about 1,500 American Episcopal leaders
gather in Denver.
</P>
<P>
   ``The general consensus was that we needed very thorough
discussions on both sides of the divisive issues, but that we are
not at a point where we can resolve them one way or the other,''
Wantland said.
</P>
<P>
   However, he noted that another meeting of bishops would take
place before the general convention. He said he hopes the bishops'
new sense of unity holds during the September meeting in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Catherine Roskam of New York agreed there was a growing
unity among the church leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The retreat) does not wash away our differences in a
superficial way,'' Roskam said, adding that the bishops were openly
discussing their differences on the issues. ``We are re-examining
everything including the way we do business with each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Chilton Knudsen of Maine said many of her own diocesan
members want a decisive vote at Denver. She said she answers them
that the church's leaders are not ready to make any decisions on
these controversial issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are discovering that up-and-down votes have such dreadful
and dire consequences and that they don't resolve the question they
are purporting to resolve,'' Knudsen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that to continue to pick at it just spreads the
deep pain. The sores are our differences, particularly our
differences about human sexuality. We're leaving it alone for a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue is so divisive that some traditionalists last month
petitioned the world's Anglican bishops for ``protection of
orthodox Anglicans in the United States until the Episcopal Church
of the United States of America is reformed or replaced as a
province of the (Anglican) Communion.'' They want a separate
province composed of conservative U.S. bishops, clergy and parishes
headed by a traditionalist presiding bishop.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionalists argue that U.S. bishops are generally ignoring
the resolution overwhelmingly approved by the world's Anglican
bishops during the once-a-decade Lambeth Conference held in England
last year. It stated that homosexual activity was incompatible with
scripture and noncelibate homosexuals should not be ordained.
</P>
<P>
   Several international Anglican archbishops wrote Griswold on
Feb. 26 expressing disappointment at American criticism of the
Lambeth resolution. Sixty-five U.S. bishops signed a pastoral
letter apologizing for the conference's ``sense of rejection''
toward gays and lesbians immediately after the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, some bishops and dioceses have passed resolutions
rejecting the Lambeth stand. Griswold, who ordained gay candidates
to the priesthood when he was bishop of Chicago, abstained during
the Lambeth vote.
</P>
<P>
   The primates' letter urged him to support the Lambeth stand.
</P>
<P>
   Griswold said Tuesday he would reply to the letter ``in the
fullness of time.'' He said he was talking with other church
leaders and members for an appropriate reply.

GARAGES SAY HIGHER EMISSIONS INSPECTION PAYMENTS NEEDED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Days before the formal unveiling of a new system for
detecting pollution in motor vehicle exhaust, Gov. Paul Cellucci
faces a growing revolt from the service station owners that must
give the emissions tests, with some threatening to boycott the
program if they don't get more money.
</P>
<P>
   The federally mandated tests, scheduled to begin by October,
would require about one in four Massachusetts vehicles each year to
undergo high-tech pollution screening in addition to their annual
safety inspections.
</P>
<P>
   But service station owners are balking at Cellucci's pledge to
keep the combined price of safety and emissions tests under $25 per
vehicle. Station owner advocates, who are scheduled to meet with
top administration officials Thurdsay, say the fee needs to be $35
to $45 to cover the added costs of the new test.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Commonwealth forces upon us a ridiculously low fee,
stations won't sign up in sufficient numbers,'' warned Roger
Montbleau of the New England Service Station and Automotive Repair
Association, in a letter to station owners. ``Irate motorists will
find themselves driving miles from their homes, and waiting in long
lines, to get their vehicles inspected.''
</P>
<P>
   State officials said the stations would make more money under
the new system, but not at drivers' expense. One source said that
millions of dollars diverted from fees collected in the current
inspection program to other state initiatives might be returned to
station owners under the new program.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an understanding that many of these are small
businesses and they need some help. We get it,'' said John Rodman,
assistant secretary of environmental affairs.
</P>
<P>
   The battle with service stations comes just as the state ends a
four year row with the US Environmental Protection Agency over how
to get the most-polluting cars off the road. The EPA has repeatedly
threatened to punish the state if officials didn't improve the
antiquated emissions testing system.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials preferred to fight with the federal
government rather than risk an inspection program that would anger
the public. Fearing long lines and high prices, Gov. William Weld
never implemented a 1996 state law that would have set up 60
centralized centers to inspect all vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan to be unveiled March 19, the 2,100 inspection
stations could continue offering inspections. Vehicles would
require a safety inspection annually, and most would need a 15 to
20 minute emissions test every other year.
</P>
<P>
   However, about 40 percent of the state's 4.1 million motor
vehicles would not have to take the emissions test, either because
they are new, very old, or from a vehicle family known for durable
emissions controls. Over time, as newer, cleaner cars come onto the
roads, up to 60 percent of vehicles could be excused from emissions
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said Tuesday that they were mostly satisfied
with the modified test program, noting it would help Massachusetts
reduce the 20-plus days each summer when the air contains unhealthy
levels of ozone, the main ingredient in smog.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large, the Commonwealth's program is a sound program
that provides substantial air quality benefits for the citizens of
Massachusetts,'' said John DeVillars, EPA regional administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the service stations are the ones who are unhappy. They
note that the current $15 fee for the combined emissions and safety
checks hasn't been raised since 1988 and that other states that
have added high-tech emissions testing, such as Connecticut, hiked
the fee to $40 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all kinds of documentation of why we need more
money,'' said Tom Porter of Porter's Firestone in Arlington, part
of the service station delegation meeting with Cellucci's deputy
chief of staff and Administration and Finance officials Thursday.
If the inspection fee isn't raised to at least $35, ``some guys are
going to say `I'm not going to do it.' ''
</P>
<P>
   State officials say they hope to satisfy the service stations,
but, ultimately, they need only about 1,200 of the 2,100 current
inspection stations for the new program to work.

   Curator  &UR; Baird Jones &LR; ' ``Writerly Art'' show at the Trenton City
Art Museum in Trenton, N.J., includes paintings by  &UR; Allen &LR; 
 &UR; Ginsberg &LR; ,  &UR; Kurt Vonnegut &LR; ,  &UR; Gregory Corso &LR; ,  &UR; William Burroughs &LR; 
and  &UR; Lawrence Ferlinghetti &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Among the Ferlinghetti works is ``The Sea Within Us III,'' a
lithograph typical of writers' art, notes Jones, because it
``includes writing in a banner style.'' Writer-painters ``always
seem to include a phrase or two. ... There is a playful, sexy,
upbeat punch to the painting, and even when Ferlinghetti is
describing a descent into Hades, the art is always fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, who thinks that Dante shared his view of the
descent, is lecturing at the L.A. County Museum of Art on March 17,

appointments have brought an ``interesting realization. ... Gosh,
the president has a schedule like this every single day. I could

`Gee, look at my schedule,' and unlike him I don't even have

   &UR; - Jim Schock &LR;  says he and about 10 other Northern California
screenwriters planned to visit  &UR; Stanley Kubrick &LR;  on his birthday in
2001, ``to pay homage, worship, get drunk, all of the above. Never
once did it occur to us he wouldn't make it.'' Meanwhile,
 &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR;  said Sunday that Kubrick ``gave us complete
environmental experiences that got more, not less, intense the more
you watched his pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post pointed out that Kubrick was not such a fan
of Spielberg's, revealing in a 1987 interview that Kubrick had
turned away from ``The Color Purple'' after 10 minutes ``because it

   Men can now bear children, say British researchers quoted in a

that an embryo could be implanted and nurtured in the abdomen of a
man elicited a range of responses:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tim Hedgley &LR; , chairman of the national fertility association
Issue, said it was good news, and ``you certainly could not stop a
man from doing this in legal terms on the grounds of sex because
that would be discrimination'';  &UR; Mark Watson &LR; , director of the
lesbian and gay rights group Stonewall foresaw gay couples taking
``advantage of it as another way of having children''; and

a distortion of nature.''

   Curator  &UR; Baird Jones &LR; ' ``Writerly Art'' show at the Trenton City
Art Museum in Trenton, N.J., includes paintings by  &UR; Allen &LR; 
 &UR; Ginsberg &LR; ,  &UR; Kurt Vonnegut &LR; ,  &UR; Gregory Corso &LR; ,  &UR; William Burroughs &LR; 
and  &UR; Lawrence Ferlinghetti &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Among the Ferlinghetti works is ``The Sea Within Us III,'' a
lithograph typical of writers' art, notes Jones, because it
``includes writing in a banner style.'' Writer-painters ``always
seem to include a phrase or two. ... There is a playful, sexy,
upbeat punch to the painting, and even when Ferlinghetti is
describing a descent into Hades, the art is always fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferlinghetti, who thinks that Dante shared his view of the
descent, is lecturing at the L.A. County Museum of Art on March 17,
and is represented in San Francisco by  &UR; George Krevsky  &LR; Fine Arts.

`Gee, look at my schedule,' and unlike him I don't even have

once did it occur to us he wouldn't make it.'' Meanwhile,
 &UR; Steven Spielberg &LR;  said Sunday that Kubrick ``gave us complete
environmental experiences that got more, not less, intense the more

   The Washington Post pointed out that Kubrick was not such a fan

   Men can now bear children, say British researchers quoted in a

that an embryo could be implanted and nurtured in the abdomen of a
man elicited a range of responses:
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Tim Hedgley &LR; , chairman of the national fertility association
Issue, said it was good news, and ``you certainly could not stop a
man from doing this in legal terms on the grounds of sex because
that would be discrimination'';  &UR; Mark Watson &LR; , director of the
lesbian and gay rights group Stonewall foresaw gay couples taking
``advantage of it as another way of having children''; and

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A macaw with scarlet and violet plumes soars
across the cover of a book called ``The Story of Colors,'' inviting
children to read a folk tale about Mexican gods who took a gray
world and filled it with brilliant hues.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few surprises, though, in this eye-catching
bilingual children's book just published by a small publisher in El
Paso, Texas, which won a grant from the National Endowment for the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Its author is Subcomandante Marcos, the political mastermind and
military strategist of the Zapatista guerrillas of southern Mexico.
On the inside flap, he appears in a photo with a black ski mask
hiding his face and bullet-laden ammunition belts slung across his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the chairman of the Endowment, William J. Ivey _ who
is working to rebuild the agency after its recent reprieve from a
death sentence issued by congressional Republicans _ abruptly
canceled the grant for the book. Ivey overruled a multilayered,
year-long grant approval process, acting within hours after the
book was brought to his attention by a reporter's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was worried that some of the Endowment's funds might
find their way to the Zapatista rebels, who led an armed uprising
in 1994 against the government of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey's decision stunned the Cinco Puntos Press, a shoestring
operation that had laid out $15,000 to print 5,000 copies of the
book, half of which was to be paid by the Endowment grant. The
books are ready to be distributed and carry the Endowment's logo on
the last page, together with an acknowledgment of ``generous
support'' from the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is spineless,'' said Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor of
books on border issues who runs the publishing company with his
wife and daughter from their home in El Paso. ``This book is
essentially about diversity and tolerance, everything the NEA is
supposed to stand for, and they just don't have the courage to
publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Colors'' reflects a literary, sometimes whimsical
side that has distinguished Subcomandante Marcos, the only
non-Indian among the Zapatistas' highest leaders, from other steely
Latin American guerrilla commanders. (His real name is Rafael
Sebastian Guillen Vicente, and he is a former university graphics
professor.)
</P>
<P>
   In the text, the masked rebel leader describes himself as
lighting up his pipe, one of his hallmarks, and sitting down on a
jungle pathway to hear a tale from an Indian elder named Antonio.
The old man recounts how mythical gods grew bored with the universe
when it was tinted only in grey, and went about inventing colors
one by one. In the end they pin all the colors on the tail feathers
of the macaw.
</P>
<P>
   The bird ``goes strutting about just in case men and women
forget how many colors there are and how many ways of thinking, and
that the world will be happy if all the colors and ways of thinking
have their place,'' the text concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are bright, broad-stroked paintings of gods
with horns and bug-eyes done by Domitila Dominguez, a Mexican
Indian artist.
</P>
<P>
   Spun in the sensuous tradition of Latin storytelling, the tale
includes elements that might be controversial in the mainstream
American children's book market. As the story opens, the text
reads, ``The men and women were sleeping or they were making love,
which is a nice way to become tired and then go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-page illustration shows a reclining naked woman in a
sexual embrace with figure that appears to be a male god.
</P>
<P>
   There are no references to the Zapatistas' cause or their
military tactics, but in a cover blurb, Amy Ray, a member of the
Indigo Girls, a Grammy-winning American song duo, says, ``This
beautiful book reminds us that the Zapatista movement is one of
dignity that emanates from the grassroots of the indigenous people
of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that it is a beautiful book,''
said Byrd, whose press specializes in bilingual children's books.
``A lot of our stories in the United States have been cleaned up
with a politically correct sentiment, and so much detail has been
washed away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I can imagine how someone would rewrite this for an
Anglo audience,'' referring to non-Hispanic Americans. ``There
wouldn't be anybody smoking or making love.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE FOR 6 GRAPHS)
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Colors'' was originally published in Spanish in
1997 by a press in Guadalajara, Mexico called Colectivo Callejero,
which supports the Zapatistas' cause.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said that he provided a copy of the original to the
Endowment when he applied for the grant to translate it in March
1998. His first request, for $30,000 to translate a total of five
books, passed two levels of review at the agency but the funds were
cut back to $15,000. Byrd said he conferred repeatedly with
literature experts at the Endowment when he chose to leave ``The
Story of Colors'' in a revised grant request he presented to
translate only two books.
</P>
<P>
   Cinco Puntos Press (the name means Five Points in Spanish)
received a written notice in February that the funds had been
approved. The only step left was for the agency to send the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey, the Endowment chairman, said that he was not concerned
about the book's contents and had not seen the finished printed
book. When he went over the grant records Monday night, he said, he
became worried about rights payments, which the El Paso press had
contracted to make to the publishing group in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an uncertainty about the ultimate destination of
some part of the funds,'' Ivey said. ``I am very aware about
disbursing taxpayer dollars for Americans' cultural life, and it
became clear to me as chairman that this just wasn't right for the
agency. It was an inappropriate use of government funds.''
</P>
<P>
   An Endowment official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that it is very unusual for the chairman to step in at the
last moment to override the work of several review committees,
including the 26-member National Council on the Arts, which
includes six federal lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said he had made it clear in his grant proposal that no
part of the grant would go to the author, Subcomandante Marcos,
because the guerrilla leader has declared he does not believe in
copyright and formally waived his rights in talks with the Mexican
press. Byrd said that rights would be paid to the Guadalajara Press
for the use of the artwork.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL GRAF FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   When Republicans gained control of the Congress in 1995, they
were frustrated with the Endowment's support for art works they
regarded as offensive and vowed to eliminate the agency. But the
House moderated its views under election year pressures and voted
overwhelmingly in July 1998 to keep the agency alive.

 &HT;    Missionary TECH Team use their computer expertise for a higher
purpose
 &HT;    By Robin Galiano
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGVIEW, Texas _ The neatly separated cubicles, drafting tables
and lots of computers which greet visitors to Missionary TECH
Team's international headquarters in Longview indicate that an
office full of technically-minded folks work there.
</P>
<P>
   But don't let the ``left-brain'' surface fool you. Beneath it
all are some hearts beating with a real passion for the lost. These
are people on a mission.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's designing a brochure for a medical clinic in Haiti
or completing a geographical survey for a church in Russia, MTT
staff members say their technical expertise is just a tool to
accomplish something much bigger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though we're back here drawing lines and gettings cars in
service, providing technical services isn't why we're in
existence,'' founder and president Birne Wiley said. ``We're here
to see people come to Christ as Lord and Savior. We're just using
our technical services to accomplish that. The giftedness of our
people is providing the behind-the-scenes service that
</P>
<P>
   enables the Great Commission to be fulfilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Though each of the staff members could be thriving in well-paid
secular jobs as architects, engineers or graphic artists, they have
chosen to commit themselves to a faith-supported missionary career,
and one for which it's often hard to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   They don't wear pith helmets, after all, and their stories from
the mission field are more likely to be that of surveying a church
building than planting a church among a remote tribe. It can be a
hard sell, and yet each one has managed to raise his or her own
salary from a cadre of financial and prayer supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's because they are faith-supported themselves that the
staff can provide low-cost technical help to those on the ``front
lines'' of mission work _ the churches, Christian camps and
missions agencies who say that MTT's support is essential in
freeing them up to do that for which they were sent.
</P>
<P>
   Now celebrating its 30th year of ministry, MTT has evolved from
what founder Wiley envisioned as a sort of spiritual SWAT team _
``three or four of us going out on emergencies to provide technical
support'' _ to a staff of 16 who complete hundreds of projects each
year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's some departmental highlights:
</P>
<P>
   Facilities planning services: Headed by civil engineer Jim
Foster, the staff has developed an ``exportable'' design package
where an architect and engineer spend a few work-intensive days on
site with a client, conducting interviews, generating a ground map
and developing an architectural program that will fit in with the
site plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest trip we've had has been four days. We've actually
drawn up plans sitting at someone's dining table,'' Foster said.
Jet lag? ``We don't even think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   It's this kind of frugal stewardship that solidifies trust
between MTT staff and clients with financial constraints. Clients
are billed for only a minimal fee, a fraction of what they'd pay
for similar professional services.
</P>
<P>
   Though the division has been without an architect for two years,
several professionals have filled in on projects, providing
schematic designs and color renderings. Then the staff engineers _
structural, mechanical and civil _ step in to complete assignments
with the help of an architectural model builder and landscape
intern.
</P>
<P>
   Among their recent projects: designing a church in Russia and a
facility for a children's ministry in Dominican Republic, and
renovating several churches in Mexico. ``You have to be culturally
sensitive,'' Foster said. ``If you build this gigantic building and
look around and there are no others, it gives the impression that
this is a rich ministry.'' In the Dominican Republic, for instance,
he said staff designed smaller cottage type homes for the children
that fit in well with the area.
</P>
<P>
   Foster says his division stays focused by accepting the
God-given gifts of each staff member. ``We're not be overseas doing
church planting, Bible translation or evangelism, but we help all
these ministries. We can participate through the gift of helps
talked about in 1 Corinthians 12:28.''
</P>
<P>
   Communication services: When MTT was established in 1969, most
requests for media support were for displays, brochures and other
literature. Last year's requests, says manager John Goodding,
included video production and Web site design.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Cox, hired in August as a graphic designer, is now
working full time producing videos. ``We were having to turn people
away with video requests, but with digital video equipment it's now
feasible to do editing on computer. We can now provide
professional-quality videos for clients who would not otherwise
been able to afford it,'' Cox said.
</P>
<P>
   And staffer Jim Collins has set up the first Web page request
for a children's camp ministry, complete with links to a virtual
postcard for parents to communicate with their kids. Graphic
artists Amy Easley and Larry Wiklund now prepare brochures and
logos on computers.
</P>
<P>
   Goodding said his staff can save missionaries time and help them
make wiser use of limited resources. ``Most clients come in with
only a vague idea of what they want,'' he said. ``From their fax or
e-mail suggestions we take them from one point, which is a very
limited scope of their ministry, and take them down the road of
what they can do. What I focus on is, with the amount of time and
resources available, what would help them accomplish their goals?''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has revolutionized the communication process for
clients around the world. MTT's clients can view architectural
drawings or proposed logo designs by logging onto the Web site. And
though some missionaries are inaccessible by mail, they can be
reached through e-mail and can approve their display designs so
that they're ready when they arrive.
</P>
<P>
   The communications staff, like their other MTT colleagues, are
content to work behind the scenes. ``The only by-line we need to
hear is the words of Jesus Christ, 'Well done, thou good and
faithful servant,''' Goodding said.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanical services: One of the most practical ways MTT supports
other ministries is with its fleet of 21 vehicles, which are loaned
to overseas missionaries who are home on furlough. There's no time
limit on vehicle loans, said mechanical services head Ted
Burnfield, and nominal fees cover costs only. Burnfield said it
comes out to less than half a commercial car rental rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no one else who provides this kind of service. When
missionaries bring their family back from the field, they can't
afford to buy and sell a car.''
</P>
<P>
   To maintain the fleet, MTT accepts any kind of car donations.
``Most of our donors have some kind of Christian connection, and
want their dollars to be used for the Lord's work,'' Burnfield
said. ``We take everything, from scrap material to usable vehicle.
We turn them into fleet vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 cars donated to the ministry last year, Burnfield said
four were ready-to-use. Most of the fleet vehicles are minivans or
full-size and mid-size sedans to accomodate missionary families.
</P>
<P>
   Burnfield said he also services staff cars. ``Those are
face-to-face needs I can meet. I get their vehicles fixed and back
to them as fast as I can. They've got a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Women's ministries: Grief specialist Mary Ann Kuechler drove
over 15,000 miles last year to present her popular ``Wisdom for
Widows'' seminar at churches across the country, and has developed
a leader's guide, workbook and a video based on the seminar. She's
ministered to widows at 20 churches, from New York to Seattle, and
began researching grief issues after her
</P>
<P>
   husband died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No. 1 concern I had was that couples, even Christians,
will often drop the widow within a very short time. It's because
they don't want to face the pain of their own grief and loss. We
are taught to avoid pain at all costs, but the only way to go
through it is to face it head on.''
</P>
<P>
   What does grief feel like? ``It's intense pain, fear, anger,
depression. You feel as though your whole life has collapsed. And
there are doubts. Why didn't God stop this? Even when the
relationship was not good, you grieve longer because there's guilt
mixed in.''
</P>
<P>
   Computer services: When he came to MTT four and a half years
ago, computer coordinator Chuck Cox said the staff's 10 computers
had no Internet access or in-house e-mail. ``First I had to
integrate all the Macs and PCs on network, and get them all talking
to one another. Then we moved out onto the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Now computer services maintains some 30-40 units, whether it's
MACs for the graphic artists or PCs for the engineers. Project
requests for MTT often comes through e-mail now instead of mail or
phone calls, he said. And clients can give same day feedback for
projects.
</P>
<P>
   Cox also provides networking support for ministries. ``I'd like
to offer a standardized computer package with installation
instructions and volunteer support links, but we'd need more staff
to implement that.''
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on 30 years of ministry with Missionary TECH Team,
founder Birne Wiley calls it ``a richly rewarding experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have stats on how many churches have been started,
souls saved or numbers discipled, even though we're for these
things. But it's been thrilling to see TECH impact hundreds of
thousands of lives spiritually by partnering with other ministries.
TECH gives people a chance to serve who otherwise would be left out
of the loop.''

 &HT;    Governor wants to spend surplus on schools
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. Bob Taft on Tuesday outlined an
``opportunity agenda'' for Ohioans that calls for spending all of a
state budget surplus _ expected to be at least $400 million _ to
fix school buildings and provide students with the technology
assistance they need to compete in the global economy.
</P>
<P>
   While Taft's plans for Ohio schools dominated his first
State-of-the-State speech, the governor also presented a joint
session of the Legislature with his ideas for economic development,
health care reform, higher education, aid to senior citizens and
spending the billions of dollars Ohio is to receive from the
tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The speech drew some encouraging words from the Ohio Education
Association, but brought cries of ``big government'' from the
fiscally conservative National Taxpayers Union, which would like to
see tax cuts not spending hikes.
</P>
<P>
   Taft's plans for education omitted any mention of Perry County
Judge Linton Lewis Jr.'s' Feb. 26 decision that Ohio's system of
paying for primary and secondary education is unconstitutional.
Taft and Republican legislative leaders have said they will appeal
to the Ohio Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The mood inside the House chamber was warm and fuzzy Tuesday, in
contrast to blistery, snowy weather outside which closed schools
and prevented some legislators, including Rep. Dixie Allen,
D-Dayton, from getting to the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton's Kimberly Brown was one of four citizen-heroes Taft
brought to Columbus for the speech. He saluted Brown, a single
mother with four children, for working her way off welfare to a
nursing job that pays $17 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The usually low-key Taft waved his arms and even pounded the
podium, mindful, he said, of addressing the lawmakers from the spot
where Abraham Lincoln once stood. His wife, Hope, blew a kiss to
the governor and the audience after Taft introduced her and praised
her work in fighting substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   His ``opportunity agenda'' called for ``a future with
opportunity for every child to get a good education in a safe,
secure classroom, opportunity for Ohioans to obtain good jobs at
good wages, opportunity to keep more of their hard-earned money and
opportunity to improve the quality of their daily lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity that drew the most comment after the 37-minute
speech _ interrupted 18 times by applause _ was his proposal for
spending 100 percent of any state budget surplus for school
construction and technological assistance. The surplus would be for
the two-year period that ends next June 30.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be in addition to the $600 million for school
construction Taft will put in his proposed budget for the next two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jeff Jacobson, R-Phillipsburg, was among the Republicans
who approved of using $400 million of the surplus for construction
and technical assistance, but resisted pledging 100 percent of a
surplus that could be much higher than $400 million. Secretary of
State Ken Blackwell, who agreed with Jacobson, said the surplus
could be as high as $900 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some of such a big surplus should be returned to Ohioans as a
tax refund, Jacobson, Blackwell and other Republicans said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some Democrats such as Sen. Rhine McLin of Dayton declined
to support spending 100 percent of a surplus for schools. There are
other pressing needs, such as rebuilding urban areas, McLin said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Milburn, Taft's press secretary, said the governor is
committed to using 100 percent of the surplus, however big it is.
How it would be divided between construction and technical
assistance hasn't been decided, Milburn said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor said he will propose spending more than $13 billion
on primary and secondary schools during the next two years, ``an
all-time record.''
</P>
<P>
   His education proposals included: $10 million in incentive
grants for schools that improve annually on proficiency test
scores, attendance and graduation rates; $25 million to help school
districts with academic problems; expansion of charter schools; $80
million for professional development of teachers and schools
leaders and pay raises of $2,500 for teachers who achieve National
Board Certification.
</P>
<P>
   While taking up nearly half of his speech, the education
proposals failed to impress some of those who side with Judge Lewis
and want Ohio's system for funding schools overhauled to provide
for more equitable funding between rich and poor districts.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those initiatives are fine but they don't get at the
systemic problem, the structural problem, the meat and potatoes
issues. These (initiatives) are frosting on the cake,'' said
William L. Phillis, executive director of the Ohio Coalition for
Equity and Adequacy, the group that successfully challenged the
school funding system.
</P>
<P>
   But Senate President Richard Finan, R-Cincinnati, said the court
case has nothing to do with the state's plans for funding schools.
``(This) shows we're gong to (move) down our path come hell or high
water. What's enough? We've got the formula in place and we're
going to fund the formula.''
</P>
<P>
   While insisting that education is his top priority, Taft told
the legislators schools alone will not guarantee Ohio a top spot in
the national and world economy.
</P>
<P>
   The state must enact electric energy deregulation this year to
remain competitive with neighboring states which could compete for
Ohio jobs with lower rates, he said.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for spending $10 million on Urban Redevelopment
Loans to clean up and reuse ``brownfields'' _ abandoned and
polluted industrial and commercial sites _ in urban areas such as
Dayton. The governor also said development Director Lee Johnson
will head an Urban Revitalization Task Force to develop plans for
rebuilding central cities. The group will report back to Taft in a
year.
</P>
<P>
   On health care, Taft said he will propose tax deductions to help
uninsured Ohioans buy insurance, to encourage all Ohioans to buy
long-term care insurance and to help with excessive medical
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The governor also said he wants to provide health insurance to
an additional 27,000 children in families of the working poor. He
would do this by raising the income eligibility limits from 150
percent of the federal poverty level to 200 percent. For a family
of four, the income limit would go from $24,675 to $32,900.
</P>
<P>
   To assist senior citizens, Taft would increase spending for the
PASSPORT program to allow more than 24,000 older Ohioans to receive
home care and support services.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he will ask the Controlling Board to set up a
separate fund to hold money from the tobacco settlement and will
convene a bipartisan task force to determine how the money should
be spent. The task force will report back to him in 60 days, the
governor said. The top priority, he added, should be reducing the
number of young smokers in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats reacted politely to the speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``The speech was a safe speech,'' said Sen. Ben Espy of
Columbus, the Senate minority leader. ``You couldn't argue with
it.''
</P>
<P>
   What was left out, however, may have been more important than
what was included, Espy said. For example, he said, the $10 million
to clean up urban industrial sites won't go far in Ohio's eight
major metropolitan areas.

<HEADLINE>
DUTCH FOOD RETAILER TO ACQUIRE PATHMARK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Mass., Md.)  (mk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a deal that pushes it further into some of the toughest
American markets, Royal Ahold NV, the scrappy Dutch food retailer,
said Tuesday that it would acquire Pathmark Stores Inc., the
leading chain in metropolitan New York, for $250 million in cash
and the assumption of $1.5 billion in debt.
</P>
<P>
   The Pathmark deal is Ahold's ninth acquisition of an American
chain since it entered the market more than two decades ago with
the purchase of the Bi-Lo chain, which competes in the Carolinas.
Ahold is the leading supermarket operator on the Eastern seaboard
and the fourth-largest chain in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the company's revenues of nearly $30 billion
comes from the United States, where its chains include Stop &AMP; Shop
stores in Boston, Tops in Buffalo and Giant-Landover in the
Washington and Baltimore metropolitan areas, as well as Edwards
supermarkets in New Jersey, New York and Long Island, N.Y., which
it will convert into Pathmark stores. Pathmark, based in Carteret,
N.J., operates 132 stores and has estimated revenues of $3.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   The move gives Ahold a stronger presence in the fiercely
competitive and densely populated metropolitan New York area. In
contrast to many large domestic chains, which have avoided the New
York area because of logistical headaches, including a scarcity of
space for needed new stores, the high cost of real estate and
unionized labor, Ahold has intensified its focus on the metro area
and the entire Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a signature move by Ahold and demonstrates their
commitment to the U.S. and the region,'' said Tom Burnett, director
of Merger Insight, an institutional research firm in New York.
``They are not just taking the easy, low-lying fruit _ they are
going to climb the tree and reach for the apple on the top
branch.''
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers, Ahold's latest expansion is likely to mean better
prices, a wider selection and expanded services in stores that the
company says it will spruce up. Analysts and supermarket industry
experts said Ahold's strategy when entering or expanding into a
territory is to drive down costs by commanding better purchasing
terms from suppliers, using money-saving inventory control
technology and spreading marketing expenses over a larger
geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   The company then tries to attract more shoppers by passing those
savings on with better prices and by offering higher-quality
private label goods and conveniences like in-store dry cleaning and
gas stations in parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have been able to lower prices to consumers and realize
greater profitability through operating synergies primarily in the
areas of information technology, logistics, which would be
warehousing and transportation, and corporate buying of services,''
said Burt Flickinger III, who has been studying regional retail
patterns for three decades and is now managing director of Reach
Marketing, a retail and marketing consulting agency in Westport,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pathmark deal, Ahold said it expected to save $30 million
in costs the first year and $50 million the second.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The acquisition of Pathmark provides Ahold with a large number
of high- quality locations in attractive markets where our position
left room for improvement,'' said Bob Tobin, president and chief
executive of Ahold USA.
</P>
<P>
   In following a strategy of aggressive growth in the United
States, Ahold has sought to capitalize on a stable and robust
market whose consumers it understands. ``Obviously when you are an
international company, the money follows where the opportunities
are, and currently the returns in the U.S. are somewhat
favorable,'' Tobin said. ``Secondly, we've had great success in the
U.S., so we're comfortable with our investment there.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pathmark deal is subject to regulatory approval. Management
said it might have to divest some stores to avoid potential
antitrust issues.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the the transaction, Ahold will pay $250 million
for all the capital stock of SMG-II Holdings Corp., which controls
Pathmark through a subsidiary, Supermarket General Holdings Corp.
The price also includes the preferred stock of the subsidiary.
Ahold will make a tender offer of $38.25 per share for all of the
publicly traded preferred stock.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Pathmark competitors, including Grand Union,
A&AMP;P and American Stores Co., would almost certainly feel the
pressure when Ahold took over Pathmark. ``Everyone will have to
raise their game a little bit because Pathmark should be a more
efficient, better operator under the ownership of Ahold,'' said
David Shriver, an analyst in London who follows the company for
Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that Pathmark was sagging under massive debt that
it incurred when it was taken private in 1987 by an investment
group headed by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Because heavy interest payments
burned up much of its cash, ``Pathmark was four or five years
behind its capital expenditure plan to build new stores and remodel
existing stores,'' said Flickinger of Reach Marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Under new ownership, said James Donald, Pathmark's chief
executive, who will continue to serve in that capacity for Ahold,
the chain can ``step up our services in the local communities and
improve the company's results.''

 &HT;    Congressmen propose privitized pensions
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Socking away money for retirement in private
accounts would be easier for most workers under a bill proposed
Tuesday by U.S. Rep. Rob Portman of Cincinnati, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Portman, a Republican, serves on the tax-writing House Ways and
Means Committee and he introduced the bill with Maryland Democrat
Ben Cardin as an essential counterpart to the one job on everyone's
political agenda this year: revamping Social Security so it will
last through the retirement of Baby Boomers.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Saving Social Security) is good and we all support that,''
Portman said when unveiling the private pension bill. ``But we need
to go beyond that.''
</P>
<P>
   Citing national statistics that show personal saving in America
at its lowest rate since 1933, Portman and Cardin are offering a
bill designed to encourage the creation of private pension funds,
particularly for workers in small businesses that are least likely
to offer company plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face a major retirement challenge in this country today,''
Portman said.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would make the following changes in existing pension
laws:
</P>
<P>
   Increase permitted employee contributions to 401(k) plans from
$10,000 in a year to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
   Increase the total combined contribution of employee and
employer in 401(k) account from $30,000 to $45,000.
</P>
<P>
   Create a ``catch-up'' provision for workers 50 and older by
permitting them an additional $5,000 in tax-deferred savings each
year to compensate for years, such as during child rearing, when
their incomes might have dipped.
</P>
<P>
   Allow workers to more easily roll savings from one tax-deferred
plan, such as a 401(k), into another when they change jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Portman estimates that the changes would cost between $5 billion
and $7 billion over five years in lost tax revenue to the federal
government, but he and the bill's advocates argue that the extra
money in savings would further fuel economic growth that would
generate tax revenues.
</P>
<P>
   One such supporter of the bill is Ohio's Rep. John Boehner,
(R-West Chester), chairman of the Employer-Employee Relations
subcommittee of the House Education and Workforce Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pension reform is a critical issue for our nation's
increasingly mobile workforce, and it spans the generation gap,''
Boehner said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is contemplating similar legislation, but a final
version has not yet been introduced. Also, last month Vice
President Al Gore unveiled the administration's take on how best to
reform pension laws.
</P>
<P>
   The White House proposal is more expansive than what Portman and
Cardin are offering. It advocates the creation of tax credits to
encourage small business owners to offer pension plans. Portman and
Cardin simply want to remove rules that prohibit small business
owners from participating in the pension plans they offer
employees.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also advocates creating Universal Savings
Accounts, which would be free-standing retirement accounts not
linked to employers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those proposals are very costly,'' Cardin said flatly. ``Our
proposal is very modest. We don't need to be part of a budget
resolution. . .'' to enact these changes.

 STUDY FINDS LITTLE RISK FROM PBCs 
 (rk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The largest ever study of occupational exposure to
toxic PCB chemicals has found no significant increase in cancer
deaths among workers who were exposed on the job.
</P>
<P>
   The study was financed by the General Electric Co., which faces
potential liabilities of hundreds of millions of dollars for
cleaning up waters that are contaminated by PCBs. It is being
published on Wednesday in the Journal of Occupational and
Environmental Medicine, a peer-reviewed journal.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals are complex mixtures that were widely used by
industry as insulation in electrical capacitors and transformers
from the 1930s to 1977, when their production was banned because of
a suspected link to cancer. PCBs persist for decades in the
environment, and can be taken up by fish and other organisms. They
are also suspected of causing other health problems.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the exposed workers in this study had high levels of
the chemicals in their blood, their rate of cancer deaths was not
high. Previous studies had found extra cancer deaths after PCB
exposure. (The study did not address noncancer problems associated
with PCBs.)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the largest cohort of male and female workers exposed
to PCBs,'' the study says. ``The lack of any significant elevations
in the site-specific cancer mortality of the production workers
adds important information about human health effects of PCBs.''
</P>
<P>
   The science of assessing the risks of PCBs and other toxic
chemicals is among the trickiest tasks for regulators. This was not
the first time that the cancer risks of PCBs, the focus of intense
regulatory review over the years, have been played down by
scientific studies. The Environmental Protection Agency has
previously reduced the factors it uses to estimate PCB cancer
risks.
</P>
<P>
   The study focused on more than 7,000 men and women who worked
from 1946 to 1976 in two General Electric factories in upstate New
York, following their medical histories for an average of 31 years
and comparing the causes of death of the 1,195 who have died to
national and regional averages.
</P>
<P>
   The study found that 353 workers died of cancer, while 400
people would be expected to die of cancer in a statistically
similar sample.
</P>
<P>
   The study's lead author was Dr. Renate Kimbrough, of the
Institute for Evaluating Health Risks, a Washington-based nonprofit
research organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``The findings of this study are consistent with a belief that
cancer risks from exposure to PCBs have been overstated,'' said Dr.
John A. Moore, president of the institute. He is a former official
of the EPA and the National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric has fought a vigorous campaign to prevent the
federal government from requiring it to dredge sediments in waters
contaminated by PCBs. It has frequently cited scientific studies
that it says show no link between exposure to the chemicals and
cancer in humans.

STUDENT ACUSED IN DATE RAPE CASE THROWN OUT OF HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Capping a day of angry protests from students, Harvard
College faculty voted Tuesday to dismiss a student accused of rape,
despite an effort by some professors to reduce the punishment
because, they said, the sex had been largely consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The college stated its decision in the starkest of terms, trying
to deflect student complaints that the nation's oldest college does
not take rape seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no circumstances foreseen today under which this
student will be readmitted,'' said a college statement after the
vote, which noted the dismissal came with a wide margin of the 250
voting. ``Dismissal is the strongest sanction that has been voted
in modern times for disciplining a student.''
</P>
<P>
   While many students protesting outside the faculty vote,
welcomed the decision, the victim of the rape continued to argue
that her assailant should have been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that someone can cheat on a paper or an
(admissions) application and be expelled, but a student can rape me
and not be expelled,'' she said. ``Given the options at today's
faculty meeting, I was happy that they chose dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, expulsion is the toughest sanction at Harvard _ the
equivalent of the death penalty _ because it allows no chance for
readmission. Dismissal, by contrast, offers the extremely remote
possibility that a student can be readmitted if there is new
exonorating evidence and the entire faculty readmits. But Harvard
characterizes dismissal as effectively expulsion, or ``life
imprisonment,'' and says it is essentially the same as expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty who had proposed the lesser punishment, which would
have required the student to withdraw but allowed him to reapply to
Harvard within five years, said they based their proposal on the
statements the two students involved had given to the campus
disciplinary board, made up of faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty group said that in those statements, which were not
released to students, the two involved acknowledged they had been
drinking, and had spent several hours in bed together before the
young man penetrated the young woman. The dissenting faculty, two
women and three men on the elected faculty council, suggested the
young woman had granted a degree of consent. She, they argued,
should accept some responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman rejected that notion, saying it was merely
violating her once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `no' repeatedly,'' she said. ``I was shocked that
anyone could have seen those statements and not duly noted that
both he and I wrote in our statements...that I had repeatedly said
`no' to his advances.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened in early April, but campus outrage about
it flared only recently because of an interview the woman granted
to a campus weekly, in which she said the college administration
had been unhelpful after the rape.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted women's groups on campus to suggest Harvard
belittles concerns about rape _ a charge only worsened by the
proposal by faculty members to lessen the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, when the faculty met inside University
Hall to vote on the case, there were pink posters papering campus:
``Are you outraged that Harvard doesn't expel convicted rapists?''
Students dressed in winter clothing chanted ``Stop rape'' as they
marched in front of Memorial Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   As the faculty neared a vote inside, about 40 students began a
candlelight vigil, holding signs reading, ``Rape happens at
Harvard,'' a direct rebuttal to one administrator who students said
last year had suggested in a private comment that Harvard students
were too intelligent to commit such heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenting faculty group said the young man had been
subjected to a witch hunt, and worried that political correctness _
a fear of being seen as ``blaming the victim'' _ would prompt the
college to give him a worse punishment than he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The professors seeking a lesser penalty said the students'
statements described an evening that began with drinking. The two
spent several hours in bed together, with some sexual interaction,
but not intercourse. At the end of the evening, the young man
penetrated the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The man's lawyer, James L. Sultan, said that when the young
woman was upset, the young man wrote her a letter taking
responsibility for what happened. He repeated that responsibility
in a conversation later, Sultan said, because he did not want his
friend to feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Administrative Board, Harvard's disciplinary council,
the young man again took responsibility for intercourse, agreeing
he had penetrated her against her will.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended the student be dismissed. The young woman
wanted him expelled and when he was not, took the case to Middlesex
court. The young man pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault
and battery, which Sultan characterized as ``unwanted sexual
touching.'' He was given 18 months house arrest at his home in
Wisconsin, and five years probation. The charge of rape was not
considered, and will not be unless he violates probation.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she did not press the rape case because she
wanted to get on with her life; Sultan said had the charge been
considered in court, he would have raised questions about whether
the sex had been consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The undergraduate faculty _ 650 potential votes _ was supposed
to consider the board's recommendation to dismiss the student in
October, but there was so much dissension over the appropriate
penalty that the motion was tabled. Several faculty suggested the
case was only ``technically rape.'' It was an error in judgment,
they said, but not a violent crime, and should not merit the same
punishment as a violent rape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the five faculty members proposed the alternate
punishment, noting that Harvard policy allows a variety of
punishments for sexual assault and rape. According to the handbook,
those guilty of rape are subject to a range of ``severe
penalties...including expulsion or a requirement to withdraw from
the campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan's lawyer says his client has no interest in returning to
Harvard, not least because he would have to register as a sex
offender if he returned to Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he understood the faculty opposition to
dismissal. ``I think reasonable people can have some difference of
opinion about what's an appropriate sanction,'' Sultan said. ``As a
practical matter, here is a kid who had a very promising career.
His life at Harvard is over. The consequences are enormous and
incredibly devastating. He's paying an extremely high price for a
mistake in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan accused the young woman of publicizing the incident _
however anonymously _ to further embarrass his client.

<P>
   ``It's sheer vindictiveness, under the guise of some sort of a
great reform movement,'' he said, ``That's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, the young woman replied: ``People have forgotten how
much my life has been ruined. I not only was the victim of a
violent crime, but it's a real challenge to speak out about these
things. I don't do it lightly. I'm doing it for the other rape
victims on this campus who for many reasons can't speak out. I was
willing to endure this firestorm because i thought it was worth it,
not because of some petty complaint.''

 &HT;    Lexis-Nexis buys legal information company
 &HT;    (ATTENTION: Ohio, Washington state editors)
 &HT;    By Jim Bohman
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Lexis-Nexis, a Miami (Ohio) Twp.-based law
database and news retrieval service, has purchased CD Law Inc., a
publisher of CD-ROM and Internet-based legal research information
for Washington State.
</P>
<P>
   Terms of the cash acquisition were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   CD Law Inc. provides Washington state case law, statutes,
regulations and other information to attorneys and courts. Included
are the Revised Code of Washington, the Washington Administrative
Code, the Washington State Register and Attorney General opinions,
a variety of administrative law materials plus municipal and county
codes.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Durman, general manager and vice president of
publishing for Lexis-Nexis, said Lexis-Nexis will link its coverage
of Washington case law, reaching back to 1889, with CD Law, CD-ROM
and Web services. Included in the package will be Shepard's
citations Service and federal materials such as the United States
Code Services.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Brown, chief executive of Matthew Bender Inc., another
recent Lexis-Nexis acquisition, said the CD Law purchase continues
to flesh out a strategy of identifying publishing businesses large
and small that add value to the customer base.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll buy 'em if we can,'' Brown said. Brown is a board member
of Lexis-Nexis Group responsible for non-online legal businesses
including Matthew Bender Inc. and Lexis Law Publishing
</P>
<P>
   He said CD Law provides a range of material similar to those
sold by the Lexis Law Publishing business in Charlottesville, Va.,
which includes state codes, regulations and case law.
</P>
<P>
   There are only a few remaining independent publishers operating
on a limited scale in a single state, Brown explained. ``Some are
mom-and-pop Web publishers and others, like Anderson in Cincinnati,
are jolly well established good companies.'' He said Lexis-Nexis
often has licensing arrangements to obtain the services of selected
small companies.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said the Lexis-Nexis strategy involves acquisitions as
appropriate. ``But it equally involves partnering and licensing
with all and sundry in the legal and associated worlds to provide
the right kind of information for our legal and related
communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexis-Nexis is a division of Reed Elsevier Inc., an Anglo-Dutch
publishing and information business with annual revenues topping $5
billion.

 &HT;    Proposal could have Ohioans shopping for electricity
 &HT;    By Laura A. Bischoff
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Ohio residents will be able to chose where they
buy their electricity beginning Jan. 1, 2001, if state lawmakers
adopt a proposal introduced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The long-awaited, much-debated electricity deregulation plan was
unveiled Tuesday in Columbus. It left many people trying to
decipher the 21-page proposal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more complicated than we thought it would be,'' said Rob
Tongren of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel. ``We're still trying to
figure it out and we were part of the group that wrote the damn
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Even state Rep. Priscilla Mead, R-Upper Arlington, who is
sponsoring the legislation, said she cannot explain all the details
of the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Dayton Power &AMP; Light officials declined comment, saying they are
reviewing the complex proposal.
</P>
<P>
   The plan describes how competition will be introduced into
Ohio's $11 billion electric industry, which has been served by
regulated monopolies for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Deregulation is expected to drive down the cost of electricity,
saving residential customers an average of $17 a month, consumer
groups say.
</P>
<P>
   How the savings will be passed on remains to be worked out, in
light of several complex issues:
</P>
<P>
   How existing utilities can recover ``stranded costs'' _ big
investments they made in nuclear power plants and other projects.
</P>
<P>
   How local governments and school districts will recoup lost
property tax revenues
</P>
<P>
   What consumer protection measures will be in place.
</P>
<P>
   How customers will be able to assess an electric company's
environmental friendliness.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deregulation plan:
</P>
<P>
   Electric companies must give customers accurate, understandable
bills, reliable service and descriptions of how to terminate
service. Existing companies must freeze their rates for four to
five years during the transition to a open marketplace. And $33
million will be provided to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio
and the Ohio Consumers' Counsel to educate consumers on the new
system. Existing low-income customer assistance programs will be
consolidated and run by the Ohio Department of Development
beginning Jan. 1, 2001.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal includes ways to make sure competing power
companies do business in the existing monopolies service areas.
First, customers will be given shopping credits to encourage them
to switch to a different power company if they so chose. If after
four or five years, no competing power companies have moved in, the
existing company must auction off parts of its customer base in a
competitive bid. The existing company may bid to keep its own
customers. The auction only applies to companies that also own
generating plants in Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Existing utilities will be allowed to recover their investments
over a four- to five-year period by continuing to charge existing
customers at the regulated rates and by charging customers who pick
a different power company a ``transition fee.''
</P>
<P>
   Customers bills will show how their power is generated _ coal,
nuclear, solar or wind _ and how it compares with other generators
in the region for environmental factors such as smog production.
Kurt Waltzer of the Ohio Environmental Council said ``Just based on
the facts, you can chose cleaner power if you want to...We liken it
to a nutrition label on a cereal box.'' Energy efficiency programs
will be continued, administered by the state, and funded by a
surcharge on customer bills.
</P>
<P>
   The way utility companies' equipment is taxed will be changed.
Utilities currently are taxed at 88 percent of market value of
their personal property while other companies are taxed at 25
percent. The proposal would reduce the tax rate on generating
equipment to 25 percent and on production equipment to 50 percent.
That will mean less money in property tax. As a replacement, a tax
based on the kilowatt-hours distributed by companies will be levied
beginning May 1, 2001. That tax will likely be passed on to
consumers. The revenue will be passed on by the state to local
governments and school districts to make sure they don't lose or
gain money in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said consumers will have to do their homework to figure out
the best deal once the new system gets underway.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said the proposal is being written into bill form now and
she expects hearings to begin before House and Senate committees
within two weeks. The proposal is expected to draw controversy,
lots of changes and probably follow-up legislation to iron out
wrinkles, she said.
</P>
<P>
   State legislators and Gov. Bob Taft have dubbed electricity
deregulation a top issue and something Ohio must do if it wants to
compete among neighboring states for economic development projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``To improve our ability to attract and retain the good jobs of
the 21st century ... Ohio needs a competitive market for
electricity,'' Taft said in his state of the state address Tuesday.
``But time is running out. Most of our neighbor states have acted
and improved their ability to compete for our jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio is behind several other states, including Pennsylvania,
that have gotten deregulation underway.
</P>
<P>
   Mead said ``I think competition is great for Ohio and it's great
for the utilities too. They are asking for deregulation. It's the
right move but it is a very, very difficult one.''

STUDENT ACCUSED IN DATE RAPE CASE THROWN OUT OF HARVARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Capping a day of angry protests from students, Harvard
College faculty voted Tuesday to dismiss a student accused of rape,
despite an effort by some professors to reduce the punishment
because, they said, the sex had been largely consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The college stated its decision in the starkest of terms, trying
to deflect student complaints that the nation's oldest college does
not take rape seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no circumstances foreseen today under which this
student will be readmitted,'' said a college statement after the
vote, which noted the dismissal came with a wide margin of the 250
voting. ``Dismissal is the strongest sanction that has been voted
in modern times for disciplining a student.''
</P>
<P>
   While many students protesting outside the faculty vote,
welcomed the decision, the victim of the rape continued to argue
that her assailant should have been expelled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bothers me that someone can cheat on a paper or an
(admissions) application and be expelled, but a student can rape me
and not be expelled,'' she said. ``Given the options at today's
faculty meeting, I was happy that they chose dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, expulsion is the toughest sanction at Harvard _ the
equivalent of the death penalty _ because it allows no chance for
readmission. Dismissal, by contrast, offers the extremely remote
possibility that a student can be readmitted if there is new
exonorating evidence and the entire faculty readmits. But Harvard
characterizes dismissal as effectively expulsion, or ``life
imprisonment,'' and says it is essentially the same as expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty who had proposed the lesser punishment, which would
have required the student to withdraw but allowed him to reapply to
Harvard within five years, said they based their proposal on the
statements the two students involved had given to the campus
disciplinary board, made up of faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty group said that in those statements, which were not
released to students, the two involved acknowledged they had been
drinking, and had spent several hours in bed together before the
young man penetrated the young woman. The dissenting faculty, two
women and three men on the elected faculty council, suggested the
young woman had granted a degree of consent. She, they argued,
should accept some responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The young woman rejected that notion, saying it was merely
violating her once more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said `no' repeatedly,'' she said. ``I was shocked that
anyone could have seen those statements and not duly noted that
both he and I wrote in our statements...that I had repeatedly said
`no' to his advances.''
</P>
<P>
   The incident happened in early April, but campus outrage about
it flared only recently because of an interview the woman granted
to a campus weekly, in which she said the college administration
had been unhelpful after the rape.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted women's groups on campus to suggest Harvard
belittles concerns about rape _ a charge only worsened by the
proposal by faculty members to lessen the punishment.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday afternoon, when the faculty met inside University
Hall to vote on the case, there were pink posters papering campus:
``Are you outraged that Harvard doesn't expel convicted rapists?''
Students dressed in winter clothing chanted ``Stop rape'' as they
marched in front of Memorial Chapel.
</P>
<P>
   As the faculty neared a vote inside, about 40 students began a
candlelight vigil, holding signs reading, ``Rape happens at
Harvard,'' a direct rebuttal to one administrator who students said
last year had suggested in a private comment that Harvard students
were too intelligent to commit such heinous crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But the dissenting faculty group said the young man had been
subjected to a witch hunt, and worried that political correctness _
a fear of being seen as ``blaming the victim'' _ would prompt the
college to give him a worse punishment than he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   The professors seeking a lesser penalty said the students'
statements described an evening that began with drinking. The two
spent several hours in bed together, with some sexual interaction,
but not intercourse. At the end of the evening, the young man
penetrated the woman.
</P>
<P>
   The man's lawyer, James L. Sultan, said that when the young
woman was upset, the young man wrote her a letter taking
responsibility for what happened. He repeated that responsibility
in a conversation later, Sultan said, because he did not want his
friend to feel bad.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Administrative Board, Harvard's disciplinary council,
the young man again took responsibility for intercourse, agreeing
he had penetrated her against her will.
</P>
<P>
   The board recommended the student be dismissed. The young woman
wanted him expelled and when he was not, took the case to Middlesex
court. The young man pleaded guilty to a charge of indecent assault
and battery, which Sultan characterized as ``unwanted sexual
touching.'' He was given 18 months house arrest at his home in
Wisconsin, and five years probation. The charge of rape was not
considered, and will not be unless he violates probation.
</P>
<P>
   The woman said she did not press the rape case because she
wanted to get on with her life; Sultan said had the charge been
considered in court, he would have raised questions about whether
the sex had been consensual.
</P>
<P>
   The undergraduate faculty _ 650 potential votes _ was supposed
to consider the board's recommendation to dismiss the student in
October, but there was so much dissension over the appropriate
penalty that the motion was tabled. Several faculty suggested the
case was only ``technically rape.'' It was an error in judgment,
they said, but not a violent crime, and should not merit the same
punishment as a violent rape.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the five faculty members proposed the alternate
punishment, noting that Harvard policy allows a variety of
punishments for sexual assault and rape. According to the handbook,
those guilty of rape are subject to a range of ``severe
penalties...including expulsion or a requirement to withdraw from
the campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan's lawyer says his client has no interest in returning to
Harvard, not least because he would have to register as a sex
offender if he returned to Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, he understood the faculty opposition to
dismissal. ``I think reasonable people can have some difference of
opinion about what's an appropriate sanction,'' Sultan said. ``As a
practical matter, here is a kid who had a very promising career.
His life at Harvard is over. The consequences are enormous and
incredibly devastating. He's paying an extremely high price for a
mistake in judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Sultan accused the young woman of publicizing the incident _
however anonymously _ to further embarrass his client.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sheer vindictiveness, under the guise of some sort of a
great reform movement,'' he said, ``That's a shame.''
</P>
<P>
   To that, the young woman replied: ``People have forgotten how
much my life has been ruined. I not only was the victim of a
violent crime, but it's a real challenge to speak out about these
things. I don't do it lightly. I'm doing it for the other rape
victims on this campus who for many reasons can't speak out. I was
willing to endure this firestorm because i thought it was worth it,
not because of some petty complaint.''

SUPPORT IS PLEDGED FOR REPUBLICAN BUDGET
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Republicans pledged support on Tuesday for the
budget outline worked out last week by their leaders, but
acknowledged that turning the plan into legislation would be
fraught with political risks and difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   After separate briefings on the plan, House and Senate
Republicans said they expected to adopt a tax and spending
guideline in the next several weeks that would set aside all money
generated by the Social Security system, increase spending for the
military and education, cut taxes and remain within the tight
spending limits in current budget law.
</P>
<P>
   Eager to present a united front as they head into another season
of battles with the Clinton administration over fiscal priorities,
Republicans said they were willing to put aside their long-running
internal divisions and to suspend for now their doubts about the
plan's political viability.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans appear to have resigned themselves to limiting the
size of their proposed tax cut for next year to a much smaller
level than they had initially envisioned. But several influential
Republicans said that the party would ultimately have to confront
the hard choices their plan would force on them, most notably its
requirement for deep cuts in domestic programs outside the Pentagon
and education to remain within the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, the head of the Senate
Appropriations Committee, said that there was little will in the
Senate for cuts in nonmilitary spending but a strong desire for an
increase in Pentagon spending. As a result, Stevens said, the
appropriations committees, which draw up the bills that finance
specific programs, would inevitably come under heavy pressure to
break the spending caps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can live with them,'' he said, referring to the caps. ``But
I'm not sure Congress can take the actions necessary to live within
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens and other Republicans said they wanted to avoid a replay
of last year, when Congress and the administration agreed on a
spending plan during a flurry of last-minute negotiations that got
around the spending limits by designating $20 billion in
expenditures as ``emergencies'' that are not subject to normal
budget rules.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the Republican whip, said: ``To
stay within the caps will require fiscal discipline. We broke that
discipline last year.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican plan, which has been endorsed by the party's
leaders in both the House and the Senate, is an effort to claim the
high ground in this year's budget battle by promising to go further
than President Clinton in saving projected federal budget surpluses
for Social Security and preserving fiscal discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The plan will be the basis for the budget resolution, a
nonbinding measure that guides the appropriations and tax-writing
committees in both chambers. Because it is not legislation, the
budget resolution cannot be vetoed by the president, although White
House officials have already attacked the plan for requiring deep
cuts in domestic spending and for not earmarking part of the
projected budget surplus to shore up Medicare.
</P>
<P>
   Budget politics this year are particularly complicated, in part
because they are caught up in the related question of how to shore
up Social Security and in part because of the eagerness in both
parties to position themselves for the 2000 elections.
</P>
<P>
   But if the ideological divide between Republicans and Democrats
appears especially deep this year, the size of the projected budget
surpluses could provide a useful bridge.
</P>
<P>
   This is because the strength of the economy seems likely to make
the surplus even bigger than projected for the next year or two.
Members of both parties said the prospects for a compromise
improved with each increase in the pool of money available to them,
in much the same way that the 1997 bipartisan budget agreement was
built on the improving fiscal outlook.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The potential for a larger-than-expected surplus is already
playing into Republican plans. Rep. John R. Kasich, R-Ohio, who
heads the House Budget Committee, told House Republicans on Tuesday
that he expected next year's tax cut to be $10 billion to $15
billion.
</P>
<P>
   But Kasich later told reporters that if the Congressional Budget
Office increased its estimate of next year's surplus in coming
months, the size of the tax cut could expand. Sen. Trent Lott of
Mississippi, the majority leader, said the tax cut next year could
be as much as $25 billion, and would grow rapidly in subsequent
years as the non-Social Security budget surplus increased.
</P>
<P>
   The budget wrangling also continued to ensnare a $1.9-billion
supplemental spending bill that includes disaster relief aid for
Central American countries hit by Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
   The White House has proposed paying for the spending by dipping
into this year's surplus, all of which comes from Social Security.
But Republicans insisted again Tuesday that the aid be paid for by
offsetting spending cuts in programs including welfare and food
stamps, a condition the White House has rejected.

PRESIDENT OF LABORERS UNION CLEARED OF MOB TIES, FINED $100,000 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An in-house hearing officer Tuesday cleared Arthur Coia,
president of the Laborers union, of associating with members of
organized crime, but fined him $100,000 for buying a $450,000
Ferrari with help from a supplier to the union.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was immediately attacked by the Justice Department as
flawed and by conservative groups who said the investigation by
union-appointed officials, to which the department had agreed, was
half-hearted because Coia is friendly with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After a three-year investigation, Peter Vaira, the hearing
officer, who used to be U.S. Attorney in Philadelphia, found that
there was not enough evidence to prove charges that Coia associated
with a New England mob boss and that he appointed a known mob
associate to an important union position.
</P>
<P>
   In his 108-page ruling, Vaira ruled against Coia on only one of
16 charges, finding that he was guilty of a conflict of interest
and of receiving improper financial benefits when a Rhode Island
car-leasing company helped him finance the purchase of the Ferrari.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials said that the U.S. Attorney in Boston was
investigating the transaction, in which Coia bought the car while
the car-leasing company held the title, letting Coia avoid more
than $40,000 in luxury taxes on the vehicle. This also enabled Coia
to resell the limited edition car three years later as a new
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The union's in-house prosecution of Coia has faced repeated
attacks from Republican officials because the Clinton
administration in 1995 dropped a planned civil racketeering suit
against the Laborers, long considered one of the nation's most
corrupt unions, and instead allowed the union to investigate
itself. Republicans have repeatedly maintained that Coia has
benefited from a sweetheart deal because the Laborers union has
donated millions of dollars to the Democratic Party in recent years
and because Coia and the president are so friendly that they have
swapped golf clubs as gifts.
</P>
<P>
   Until Tuesday, Justice Department officials repeatedly defended
the in-house investigation, saying it was a model because it saved
the government money and manpower.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Justice Department officials issued an unusually
strong criticism of Vaira's ruling. In a joint statement, James K.
Robinson, assistant attorney general for the department's criminal
division, and Scott R. Lassar, the U.S. Attorney in Chicago _ which
conducted the original eight-year civil racketeering investigation
_ said they believed ``the opinion contains serious factual and
legal errors'' for clearing Coia of mob ties.
</P>
<P>
   The two officials said while they believed the case ``was
thoroughly investigated'' and ``vigorously prosecuted,'' they would
urge Robert Luskin, the union prosecutor who brought the charges
before Vaira, to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's lawyer, Howard Gutman, welcomed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence demonstrated overwhelmingly that Arthur Coia has
never been controlled by the mob and that the mob actually despises
Arthur,'' Gutman said.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Coia said that while the investigative process
``may have been personally painful, it was necessary to preserve
the integrity of our reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Boehm, director of the National Legal and Policy Center,
a conservative research group, called the ruling a ``slap on the
wrist'' that shows the Justice Department was wrong to put its
faith in the idea that the union could reform itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department needs to admit its mistake, take over the union
and institute real reforms _ especially ousting Coia,'' Boehm said.
</P>
<P>
   Coia's union, the Laborers International Union of North America,
claims to have 750,000 members, most of them construction workers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The central charges in the case asserted that Coia violated
union rules by associating with mobsters. Specifically, Luskin
asserted that Coia associated with Raymond Patriarca Jr., head of
New England's powerful Patriarca crime family.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors have long said that Coia's late father,
Arthur E. Coia, who headed the Laborers union in Rhode Island, was
a close associate of Patriarca's late father, Raymond Patriarca
Sr., a legendary New England crime boss.
</P>
<P>
   Coia acknowledged knowing the younger Patriarca, saying they met
when they were planning the defense in a case, later dismissed, in
which, Coia, his father and the elder Patriarca were charged with
racketeering. But Luskin charged that Coia had repeatedly met with
the younger Patriarca after that case was dismissed, noting that
Patriarca had sought to breed his Rottweiler with dogs from Coia's
prize-winning kennel.
</P>
<P>
   Vaira noted that the two key witnesses Luskin used did not
provide the definitive evidence that he had indicated they would.
Thomas Hillary, an unofficial stepson of the elder Patriarca,
failed to link Coia meaningfully with Patriarca, Vaira said, while
he found that Nino Cucinotta, the younger Patriarca's driver who
testified that Coia and Patriarca met frequently, was not a
credible witness.
</P>
<P>
   As for the Rottweiler breeding, Vaira found that this did not
constitute the type of association prohibited by union rules.
</P>
<P>
   But Vaira lashed into Coia's buying the Ferrari with the help of
Viking Oldsmobile, which leased cars to the union and was run by a
long-time friend. Even though Vaira said Coia did not receive a
kickback and lost money when he sold the car for $380,000, Vaira
said Coia violated union rules by engaging in a conflict of
interest in buying the car.
</P>
<P>
   Coia purchased the car by providing some cash and trading in two
Ferraris as a down payment and using a $300,000 loan that Viking
made available.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was offered the unique opportunity to make a large profit
and receive favorable terms on the purchase of the vehicle,'' Vaira
wrote. ``The conflict of interest in this matter occurred at the
highest level of the union.''

 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For months, shareholders of RJR Nabisco Holdings have
besieged the company with requests to spin off the Nabisco food
operations. They urged the company to create a nontobacco entity
that would be able to rise above the depressed valuation of what
should be one of the world's premier consumer-product companies.
</P>
<P>
   No can do, Steven Goldstone, RJR's chairman, answered
repeatedly. The parent company's liabilities from years of tobacco
litigation were too sticky to allow the businesses to be separated.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out investors had the wrong target in their sights.
</P>
<P>
   Barely a month after he said a spinoff of Nabisco was
impracticable, Goldstone announced Tuesday that RJR Nabisco instead
would sell its international tobacco business, use the proceeds to
reduce debt, and split off not the food company but its domestic
tobacco business, to be known once again as R.J. Reynolds tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   By spinning off the American tobacco company and letting it
trade separately from the remaining food company, Goldstone said he
intended to give shareholders a good portion of what they wanted:
separate companies with a clear delineation between the cigarette
operations and the cookie and biscuit business.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, however, were not impressed. After jumping sharply in
early trading, shares of RJR Nabisco Holdings finished the day up
only 12.5 cents, at $28.75. Investors essentially deemed the
per-share value created by the separation of the two businesses to
be worth less than the price of a single cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone was so discouraged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an ingenious idea with a lot of hypotheticals attached,''
said David Dreman, the chairman of Dreman Value Management, who
owns shares of RJR Nabisco. ``If it works, it adds enormously to
shareholder value.''
</P>
<P>
   But the remaining questions about the tobacco-related
liabilities of the parent company, he added, ``are probably why the
market isn't all that enthused about the deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The tepid reaction also reflects the uncertainty around a deal
whose details will not be announced until the sale of the foreign
tobacco operations is completed, probably not until next month at
the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   For all the initial skepticism, the announcement does provide a
somewhat brightened outlook for shareholders of both the parent RJR
Nabisco and for investors in the class A shares of Nabisco
Holdings, the publicly traded food subsidiary whose shares are
80-percent owned by RJR.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, the sale of the overseas tobacco business will
give RJR a big wad of cash to pay off debt. Since its contentious
leveraged buyout in 1989, RJR Nabisco has labored under a heavy
debt load that has squashed the company's investment potential by
dragging down earnings and limiting its financial flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   In a conference call with analysts Tuesday, RJR officials said
the new tobacco company would begin life with only about $1 billion
in debt and $7 billion in equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are taking almost all of the debt out of a very highly
leveraged company,'' Dreman said. With a debt-to-equity ratio of
only 14 percent, the Reynolds tobacco company's balance sheet would
be substantially stronger than most of the companies whose shares
are part of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index, in which the
average debt load is about equal to shareholders' equity.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the tobacco company should pay an attractive
dividend. On Tuesday, RJR Nabisco Holdings declared its regular
quarterly dividend of 51.25 cents a share, which gives its shares
an annual dividend yield of about 7 percent _ far above the 1.25
percent dividend yield of the S&AMP;P 500. The tobacco business is
expected to pay a similar dividend after the company splits,
financial analysts said Tuesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Nabisco food operations, meanwhile, have struggled recently
with restructurings and big changes in distribution. But that
company too might prosper as it gets out from under some of the
parent company's distractions and, later this year, begins to see
anticipated improvements in profit margins from recent overhauls of
its sales and marketing ranks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a company that has very powerful brands and a strong
market position,'' said Michael Kassen, co-manager of the Neuberger
&AMP; Berman Partners fund, which holds the food company's class A
shares. ``It's a real fixer-upper. With a reasonable time horizon,
I think the company can do much better. We're only in the second or
third inning of that ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nabisco sales force has been reorganized in more than half
the markets around the country and the remaining areas should
complete overhauls by the end of the year. That should help the
company defend its turf against competitors, which have been
attacking many of the company's best-known brands.
</P>
<P>
   But the company continues to rely heavily on discounts and
promotions to maintain sales, a practice that has squeezed profit
margins. Revenues from continuing food businesses were $8.1 billion
last year, flat with the previous year's results. Overall, RJR's
food business actually shrank slightly last year because it sold
some operations. This year, analysts expect the food company's
sales to grow about 3 percent and the company to earn about $1.30 a
share, up from $1.21 last year.
</P>
<P>
   With the Nabisco foods unit taking a slow path toward recovery,
some investors are still hoping that the parent will consider
selling the business in the next year or two, or do something else
to lift the prices of the shares of the separately traded
companies.
</P>
<P>
   The values of the two companies in the stock market diverge in
odd ways. And the spread between the value of the parent company's
investment in the Nabisco Holdings subsidiary and the parent
company's own stock price widened even more Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Nabisco Holdings, the food subsidiary, closed at
$44.9375, up 31.25 cents. RJR Nabisco's 80 percent investment in
the food subsidiary, therefore, should be worth about $29.58 a
share to the parent company's shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   But with RJR Nabisco's share price closing at $28.75, less than
the value of its investment in the food company alone, investors _
despite Tuesday's announcement _ were still putting a negative
value on the tobacco operations. Once the tobacco company starts
trading, of course, that will not be the case; financial analysts
said they expected the tobacco company's shares to trade for at
least several dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   The low value still being assigned to tobacco reflects, at least
in part, the feeling among many investors that Tuesday's
restructuring announcement did not lift all of the uncertainty from
RJR Nabisco's future. Lawyers in tobacco-liability lawsuits may
well challenge the deal, and few investment professionals were
willing to predict the outcome of those battles.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company was responding to pressure to improve shareholder
returns,'' said Brian Rogers, manager of the T. Rowe Price
Equity-Income fund, a shareholder in the parent company. ``That is
a welcome move. But we're going to have to see how this thing
evolves.''

WASHINGTON HIT WITH SURPRISE SNOWSTORM

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After sweeping a thousand miles from the Upper
Midwest, a late-winter snowstorm roared into the East on Tuesday,
surprising many people, especially those in the Washington area,
where a mild winter had lulled residents into complacency and where
shoots from tulip bulbs are already five inches high.
</P>
<P>
   Dewey Walston, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service
station in suburban Virginia, said that 6 to 10 inches had fallen
by this evening in the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   He said that people should not be surprised by such a big storm
less than two weeks before the first day of spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the biggest snowstorms have come in the month of
March,'' Walston said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the case in the Washington area, he said, because
winters are usually cold enough for snow but there is not enough
moisture in the air to produce it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get warm, moist air when spring starts to approach,''
Walston said. ``That's what happened today. Moisture came in from
the gulf.''
</P>
<P>
   The storm began far to the west, dumping 16 inches of snow in
the Minneapolis-St. Paul area on Monday, The Associated Press
reported, and moved eastward bringing 10 inches of snow to Indiana
and Ohio and making as much as a foot possible by Wednesday in the
West Virginia mountains. Snow also extended into Delaware, Michigan
and Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, the weather service had issued a warning that
heavy snow could hit the mountains of western Maryland. By 4 a.m.
Tuesday, the warning had been broadened to include the Washington
area, and by 7 a.m. the snow started falling. That led federal
agencies to allow their employees to leave early, and schools
closed.
</P>
<P>
   Tara Hamilton, the spokesman for both Washington Reagan National
Airport and Dulles International Airport, said: ``It's been a rough
day for air travelers.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the day, she said, flights into the airports were
disrupted because snow had kept planes on the ground in upstate New
York, Boston, Chicago and other places in the Midwest. ``Then we've
had nonstop snow throughout the day,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   At least 50 percent of the flights at the Washington airports
were canceled during the day, with the number rising to 70 percent
by Tuesday evening, much higher than the 25 percent cancellation
rate in the usually snowier Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a much smaller storm but it has proven
not to be,'' Ms. Hamilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why this was, Andy Woodock, another meteorologist in
suburban Virginia, said: ``There's a band of air that's just not
moving. It just snowed and snowed and snowed instead of moving
on.''
</P>
<P>
   In Frostburg, Md., John Kunis, the manager of a Domino's Pizza
store, said the snow had slowed, but not stopped, his deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We normally run a 20-minute estimated delivery time,'' he
said. ``Now we're running a 35. But we're still out there fighting
it, kind of like the Postal Service.''

POLITICAL BATTLE IN WASHINGTON: WHAT TO REVEAL ON CHINA ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (wg) 
 By JEFF GERTH 
and ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and congressional
Republicans are wrangling over how much information to make public
about China's acquisition of some of the most sensitive American
military technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a bipartisan committee unanimously approved a
voluminous report concluding that China had harmed national
security over the last 20 years by stealing American nuclear
secrets and acquiring other American technology. Since then, the
committee and the White House have been quietly negotiating how
much of the report could be released publicly. Both agree that some
of the report should be released, but they have not agreed on what
specifically can be made public.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent weeks the discussions have become increasingly
tense as they entered a crucial stage. They are now taking on a
more partisan tone and the issue is providing ammunition to critics
of President Clinton's China policy in the days leading up to
important talks between Beijing and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The special committee goes out of business at the end of the
month. A few days later China's premier is scheduled to come to
Washington for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican member of the panel, Curt Weldon of Pennsylvania,
said in an interview Tuesday: ``They're trying to spin this thing
to get the best play for themselves and avoid further
embarrassment. They want to drag it out as long as long as they
can. I'm so mad I can't see straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., gave a
more restrained assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are debating whether we can state what we found,'' he said.
The risk , he added, is that the panel's secret findings would be
lost in the layers of the declassification process.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel, who asked not to be identified, said
they believe the administration's efforts to keep some information
secret is based on legitimate concerns of protecting
intelligence-gathering methods.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic member also said that recent press accounts about
the Cox Committee's findings had affected the negotiations,
creating the possibility that the administration ``might be a
little more willing to declassify.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House denied the Republican accusations, noting it met
the committee's March 1 deadline to submit the administration's
classification concerns, and continued to cooperate with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working in good faith to help the committee declassify
as much of the report as possible, consistent with the intelligence
community's requirement to protect its sources and methods,'' said
P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the administration had suggested how the panel
could rewrite portions of the highly classified report to make it
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, details of the Cox Committee's work, including
the determination by U.S. officials that China stole nuclear
secrets from an American weapons laboratory, have surfaced. On
Monday, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
was dismissed for security breaches after he was questioned by the
FBI in connection with the suspected theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   Other Clinton administration officials also addressed the issue
Tuesday. The White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart said that
President Clinton supported the energy secretary's decision to
dismiss the scientist.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore, asked in a CNN interview about
allegations that the administration had been lax in pursuing
security breaches at the weapons labs, said: ``That happened during
the previous administration. That happened back in the 1980s. And
as soon as the investigation identified targets of that
investigation, then the law enforcement community handled that very
aggressively, and it resulted in a presidential directive that
completely changed the security procedures in the weapons labs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is negotiating with the
administration over how much information it can make public in
connection with its inquiry into Chinese contributions to the 1996
election campaign and the transfer of satellite technology to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
suggested that the Senate might consider contempt charges against
administration officials if they do not cooperate sufficiently with
the committee. He did not specify the target of contempt charges or
explain his legal reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Lott told reporters Tuesday that he ``assumed a major portion''
of the House panel's report would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Without a compromise, there could be a constitutional clash
between Congress and the White House because both the
administration and the House have the power to declassify
information. Typically, the administration works out a compromise
in consultation with various agencies and Congress, the process now
under way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In these cases, broad findings and conclusions are released, but
precise details are kept secret in order to protect
intelligence-gathering sources and methods or ongoing law
enforcement investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the administration will even finish its
review before the panel's charter expires, according to an
administration official at one of the agencies being asked to
review the report.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the committee uncovered the evidence of Chinese theft
of American nuclear secrets. Democrats say they feared the
Republicans would disclose that evidence before the election. But
their fears proved unfounded. The committee filed its huge report
at the end of the year and went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the new Congress convened and gave the committee 90
more days to produce a declassified report in collaboration with
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The review is being coordinated within the administration by the
President's National Security Council. NSC officials farmed out the
report to various agencies for a word by word review, but only
after the report was screened by the Justice Department to protect
ongoing law enforcement investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the NSC leading the fight with the other agencies
weighing in,'' said one House staff member. ``The Energy Department
is worried about the stuff at the labs. The intelligence community
is worried about disclosing their sources and methods. And the FBI
and the Justice Department are concerned about on-going criminal
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the White House released a redacted version of the
committee's recommendations but with little input from the
committee, members said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Cox and the panel's ranking Democrat, Norman
Dicks, of Washington, sent a letter to President Clinton requesting
a meeting to discuss the report. The White House has not yet
replied to their letter.

   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The American envoy Richard Holbrooke
arrived here on Tuesday, warning that that Yugoslavia and the West
were on a ``collision course'' over Kosovo that could bring NATO
intervention. At the same time, Yugoslav authorities announced that
they had issued arrest warrants for eight Kosovo rebel leaders,
including three taking part in the peace talks.

<P>
   Arrest warrants were already out on the leaders of the
separatist guerrilla movement, and Tuesday's announcement was
interpreted as a gesture of defiance to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavy fighting was reported from the separatist
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is scheduled to meet with Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, on Wednesday in an effort to advance a peace
accord for Kosov, told reporters shortly after his arrival on
Tuesday: `` ``We are only a few days away from a tragedy of even
greater dimensions than what has occurred already. We might be on a
collision course here between Yugoslavia and the western
authorities, including NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened air strikes if no agreement is reached to
end the year-long fighting in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was making the visit at the request of Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to try to bring the two warring sides
closer before international mediated peace talks resume in France
on March 15. Negotiations broke up inconclusively after 17 days
last month.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not come to dictate to the Serbs. ''We are here
to help resolve a long-standing problem between the Serbs and the
Albanians in Kosovo,'' he said. ``We come in peace, but the threat
of war, of greater war, is ever present.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are still far apart and throwing up last-minute
obstacles. On Tuesday, Serbian forces pushed deeper into the region
along the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   They drove rebel fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army out of
the hill village of Ivaja, capturing the commanding heights over
the main road to the border, a vital artery for the government.
There was also cannon fire reported in northern Kosovo as Serbian
units shelled the area west of the town of Vucitrn.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army offensive has been proceeding for the two weeks
since the peace talks broke up, despite the presence of
international monitors, who are overseeing a cease-fire signed last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities also announced that they had issued arrest
warrants for eight leading members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
including three delegates to the peace talks. The men were wanted
for murder, kidnapping and attacks on Belgrade's military and
police personnel, the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement appeared to be a calculated
signal to the West, and to the United States in particular, since
an invitation was extended to members of the KLA to visit
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the wanted list are Hashim Thaci and Jakup
Krasniqi, who took leading roles in the negotiations in France and
have frequently met with Western diplomats and mediators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a reaction to the invitation for them to go to
Washington,'' said one American official close to the talks. He
described Belgrade's attitude as, ``If you can do that, see what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. mediator for the talks, Christopher Hill, said the
arrest warrants were not new but admitted the announcement would
not help efforts to seal an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have frustrated mediators by their slowness
to sign the autonomy plan as drafted by the Contact Group. Despite
promises to sign within days, they have yet to do so. KLA members
have raised last-minute doubts about the plan for disarmament in
the agreement and the presence of Russian troops in the
international peace-keeping force intended to enforce a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA news agency reported a new condition on Tuesday, that
the Serbian forces should cease all military operations in Kosovo
before they sign.
</P>
<P>
   Their reluctance to sign has been portrayed by Western officials
as weakening the case against Belgrade and leaves Holbrooke with
little ammunition for his meeting with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke personally negotiated a cease-fire agreement with
Milosevic last October in which Serbian forces were to withdraw and
international monitors under the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe would move in to oversee the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence abated at first, the monitors have been
unable to prevent a new escalation since December, including
killings in Racak, where 45 ethnic Albanians were taken out and
shot by Serbian police units.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke acknowledged that the original agreement had
limitations and emphasized that a new agreement was necessary. The
October agreement was not between the Yugoslav authorities and the
Kosovo Albanians, but rather between Holbrooke and Milosevic. It
also had no adequate enforcement mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now under negotiation grants significant autonomy
to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and envisages a 28,000-member
NATO-led peace-keeping force to enforce the agreement. Milosevic
has, however, repeatedly refused to countenance any international
military force in Kosovo, arguing that it was an infringement on
Yugoslav sovereignty..

 (af)  
 By ALAN RIDING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ After seeing ``I Stand Alone,'' after meeting its
director, Gaspar Noe, 35, one couldn't help but ask: How could a
pleasant young man with a positive view of life make a film as dark
and desperate as this one?
</P>
<P>
   Well, Noe might of course have confessed that he was a secret
nihilist, that ``I Stand Alone'' (``Seul Contre Tous'') was a
public form of psychotherapy. Reassuringly, his answer was more
straightforward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make a film like this because I feel at ease with
myself,'' he said. ``I was raised in a comfortable household with
adorable parents who gave me nothing but love, and this allows me
to make a film about depression that in the end is very
combative.''
</P>
<P>
   An Argentine-born Frenchman, Noe was talking in a cafe beside
one of the two Paris theaters where his movie is playing. On
Wednesday it opens in New York for a two-week run at the Film
Forum. ``I Stand Alone'' is his first feature film, but in fact it
picks up where his award-winning 1991 short, ``Carne,'' left off in
its portrayal of an ill-starred Paris butcher of horse meat, again
played by the burly Philippe Nahon.
</P>
<P>
   The new film stands on its own, but to explain why its central
character is about to move still closer to the edge, Noe opens with
a series of stills, accompanied by the butcher's raspy voiceover,
recapitulating the story so far:
</P>
<P>
   The butcher has achieved his dream of opening his own shop when
he meets a factory worker who becomes pregnant and then abandons
him, leaving their mute daughter for him to raise. When the girl
reaches puberty, she is frightened by her first menstruation and
rushes to her father's shop. Seeing blood on her dress and
imagining she has been raped, he stabs an innocent passer-by.
</P>
<P>
   After serving time in jail, with his daughter now
institutionalized, he finds work as a barman and promptly seduces
the owner's wife. Then, when she becomes pregnant, they decide to
start a new life in Lille.
</P>
<P>
   ``I Stand Alone'' finds the butcher living in the crammed
apartment of his mistress' mother, growing ever more depressed as
he struggles to find work. ``You have to smile to be a butcher,''
he is told when he applies for a job in the meat section of a Lille
supermarket. He cannot and is ordered to leave.
</P>
<P>
   At home, the walls close in on him as his mistress baits him for
watching television. One night he explodes in anger, attacking her
and pummeling her swollen stomach. He grabs his pistol and
hitchhikes to Paris, never looking back.
</P>
<P>
   He still imagines that hope is somewhere to be found. He checks
into the very hotel room where his daughter was conceived and again
looks for work without success. He tries to borrow money from old
friends, but they, too, are down at heel or simply tightfisted.
</P>
<P>
   As his anger mounts, he is freshly humiliated: he gets into an
argument in a bar and is forced to leave by a shotgun-waving owner.
When a gay meat supplier turns him down for yet another job because
of his jail record, he swears revenge. He has three bullets in his
pistol and he plans to use them.
</P>
<P>
   Recounted in this way (without revealing its ending), the story
seems to be that of a middle-aged man driven to despair by
unemployment, rejection and lack of love. What gives the film its
extraordinary intensity, though, is the stream-of-consciousness
voice-over that records the butcher's descent into hate for the
world and disgust with himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are always alone, alone when you're born, alone when you
die, alone, always alone,'' the butcher's mind tells him at one
point. ``The older you get, the lonelier you are, alone with a few
memories that life steadily destroys. Life is like a tunnel.
Everyone has his little tunnel. But at the end of the tunnel, there
is no light. There is nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing the movie as ``devastating'' after it was shown at
last fall's New York Film Festival, Stephen Holden wrote in The New
York Times that `` `I Stand Alone' probes as relentlessly into the
psychology of nihilism as any movie has ever attempted.''
</P>
<P>
   Noe reinforces this message in the way he has shot and cut the
film (he was the film's cameraman as well as its screenwriter,
director, producer and co-editor), using close-up images of
violence and hard-core pornography followed by sudden camera
movements accompanied by amplified gunshots that heighten the
tension. Interspersed, he has one-word tabloid headlines, like
``Morality'' and ``Justice,'' as well as a ``Warning'' _ giving
audiences time to leave the theater _ before the film's denouement.
</P>
<P>
   Nahon's performance has deservedly won praise, not least because
Noe's endless difficulties in raising money for the movie meant
that the 30 days of filming were spread over almost three years.
For ``Carne,'' the actor learned how to handle and cut meat; for
``I Stand Alone,'' it was more a question of entering into a state
of mind. But he said he was unfazed by the interruptions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaspar would call up and say, `We're shooting tomorrow because
I have found money for some film stock,''' said Nahon, who is 60.
``We'd meet and work out if we were shooting before or after the
last scene we did. He'd say, `Action!' and I was inside the
character. It wasn't difficult. You see people like that every day
everywhere. Homeless people. At 50, no one can find a job. If
you've spent a few days in jail, it's worse. You're finished.''
</P>
<P>
   Although ``I Stand Alone'' is essentially a psychological study,
not political commentary, some French critics have seen it as an
indictment of contemporary France and, indirectly, of a French
movie industry that until recently has been dominated by comedies,
historical costume dramas and intimate love stories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The important thing is not that France at the end of the 20th
century can be as sordid, ugly and pitiless as that,'' Le Monde's
film critic, Jean-Michel Frodon, wrote of Noe's movie. ``It can be.
But since movies tend all too often to forget this, one that points
this out is to be welcomed.''
</P>
<P>
   That this film was ever made is itself surprising. Neo-realism
may be making a comeback here, as witnessed by Mathieu Kassovitz's
``Hate,'' Bruno Dumont's ``Life of Jesus,'' Erick Zonca's
``Dreamlife of Angels'' and Bertrand Tavernier's still-unreleased
``Life Begins Today,'' but Noe's screenplay proved too realistic to
win the backing of any French television company. And since this is
the first step toward making a film here, he was on his own.
</P>
<P>
   It did not help that Noe was not part of the Paris movie world.
He attended a Paris film school, L'Ecole Lumiere, but he said that
until he made ``Carne'' he was more interested in amusing himself
than in working. And it was thanks to ``Carne'' that he eventually
won support to make another 40-minute movie from the short-films
division of the pay-TV channel, Canal Plus.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, it was almost two years before the French designer,
Agnes B., provided him with the funds to make a feature-length
film.
</P>
<P>
   ``The television people said to me, `Why don't you come with a
real project, a real police thriller, with real producers, real
actors?''' Noe recalled. ``The people who read screenplays are
employees worried about losing their jobs if they approve something
too explosive. They prefer to give money to an established director
even if he makes a flop. Anyway, I worked once or twice as an
assistant director on big productions and they're not for me. They
resemble the Normandy landings more than a work of art. I like to
work with a small team, without makeup, with little decor, where
you can improvise, you can invent scenes on location.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps inevitably, ``I Stand Alone'' has been compared with
Martin Scorsese's ``Taxi Driver,'' but Noe also speaks admiringly
of numerous other directors, among them Luis Bunuel, Elia Kazan,
Sam Peckinpah, Roberto Rosselini, Vittorio de Sica and Pier Paolo
Pasolini.
</P>
<P>
   And for his next film, he said, he would like to follow in the
footsteps of Nagisa Oshima's erotic 1976 classic, ``In the Realm of
the Senses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to make a film that shows people making love
without it being pornographic, like `In the Realm of the Senses,'
but perhaps less morbid,'' he said. ``I'd like to show a love story
where people make love from time to time, but where the camera does
not then turn to the fireplace. You can show a lot about people's
psychology in the way they make love.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the young director was asked, does he like to shock?
</P>
<P>
   ``My film does not set out to shock,'' he said. ``I think that
in English the word `shock' is more negative than in French. In
French, it means more `to disturb.' I don't think you should remove
things that stir the emotions. If something disturbing leads
somewhere else, why not? You know, perhaps strangely, no one has
said that the violence in `I Stand Alone' is gratuitous violence.
All I have done is filter out the positive side of life. I have
left the butcher with nothing more than the negative power of his
existence.''

<P>
   Where's Carl Icahn?
</P>
<P>
   Icahn, the financier who has made not one but two attempts to
shake up RJR Nabisco Holdings over the last four years, was
strangely quiet Tuesday despite recent threats of a proxy battle to
force the company to split up its food and tobacco businesses.
</P>
<P>
   He had raised his stake in RJR Nabisco to 7.7 percent recently
from 5.6 percent in late December. But traders suggested Tuesday
that he was in a selling mood and could have been part of the
reason RJR Nabisco's stock dropped sharply from an the day's high
of $31 to close at $28.75, up 12.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In recent Securities and Exchange Commission filings, Icahn
disclosed that he and his affiliates had bought an additional 3.6
million shares for prices ranging from $25.94 to $27.87, increasing
the total to 25 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago he was on the phone with investors seeking
support for his proxy battle as well as seeking candidates for the
board, traders and investors said. He faces a deadline on Friday
for filing his slate of candidates for election to the board in
May. But one investor who spoke on the condition of anonymity said
Icahn was having limited success and might nominate himself.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn and his affiliated companies had said they were planning
to seek board seats if RJR Nabisco did not split its food and
tobacco businesses. The announcement the company made Tuesday may
help placate Icahn, who for years has been agitating for a
like-minded plan.
</P>
<P>
   But no one knows exactly what Icahn intends to do, and he will
by no means remain silent, analysts said. He recently sued a New
York law firm for $3.5 million, saying it violated an agreement to
help him pursue his proxy fight.
</P>
<P>
   Icahn did not return phone calls Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco, for its part, is hoping investors will be pleased
with its plan. Executives close to RJR Nabisco said company
officials were concerned that noise from Icahn's camp could have
hurt the company's chances of getting the best price possible for
the international operations in the last days of their two-year
auction process.
</P>
<P>
   They also contended that Icahn did not force them to act and
that they had been considering splitting off the domestic tobacco
business.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven F. Goldstone, RJR Nabisco's chief executive, is not
assuming that Tuesday's development will make Icahn go away.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said to an analyst group recently, when I hear the song
of the first robin in spring I always know I'm going to hear the
lyrics of Carl Icahn,'' Goldstone said.

CIENFUEGOS PREPARED TO SIT OUT SEASON, AGENT SAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ In what looks like a lousy game of chess
between Major League Soccer and Mauricio Cienfuegos, the Los
Angeles Galaxy could be the big loser.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos, a three-time MLS all-star, has been a holdout since
training camp began last month and is prepared to sit out the
season, his agent said.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy's main gate attraction and assists leader in the
team's first three seasons, Cienfuegos remains in El Salvador with
fellow holdout Raul Diaz Arce of San Jose. Cienfuegos has not
resolved a contract dispute that began when he hired agent Corey
Clemetson.
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson, who represents Diaz Arce as well, believes that other
marquee foreign players are paid well over what the MLS league
maximum.
</P>
<P>
   Cienfuegos stands to make $103,000 this season. Clemetson says
he believes the league maximum to be $250,000. That amount is
disputed by MLS officials, however.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Cienfuegos met with Ivan Gazidis and other league
officials to discuss his contract. Gazidis, the executive vice
president of player relations for MLS, said Cienfuegos was offered
a raise, but Clemetson called the offer ``insulting.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemetson says Cienfuegos, 31, is looking for a contract well
above $250,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their (MLS) offer was $30,000 to $40,000 more than what he
(Cienfuegos) was getting, and that's ridiculous,'' Clemetson said.
``These guys left El Salvador and came to talk in good faith about
working out these (contract) differences and they were totally
insulted by their (MLS) offers.
</P>
<P>
   ``These players aren't stupid; they're prepared for the long
haul (of holding out). If the offers continue to be where they're
at, he (Cienfuegos) won't sit out the whole season but could make
an announcement that he will never play in MLS again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at that point where he'll never play again, but if
something doesn't work out in the next couple weeks, it could,''
Clemetson said.
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis, who has taken over league contract negotiations for
Sunil Gulati (fired earlier this month), says Cienfuegos and Diaz
Arce are not improving their position by not reporting to camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``The advice he's (Cienfuegos) receiving from his agent is that
he will improve his negotiating position if he holds out,'' Gazidis
said. ``We're prepared to make a better offer, but we're not about
to sign a new piece of paper while he's refusing to honor the
existing piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have no choice but to let this go the whole season, then
it's very unfortunate. He has two years left on his contract and by
not showing up he would be essentially throwing away the rest of
his career.''
</P>
<P>
   Gazidis also said Clemetson's numbers are way off. First, he
says, the league maximum is in the $230,000 range; second, he says
no player is earning more than the league maximum, although signing
bonuses cloud the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot variables that go into these contracts and
signing bonuses are one of them, which in turn increases the
overall value of the deal.'' Gazidis said. ``The numbers aren't as
cut and dried as he (Clemetson makes them appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Jorge) Campos, for example, makes a lot of money in Mexico
when he's not here. He's a player in high demand because of his
market value.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Mauricio's case, he hasn't had any offers overseas. If he's
really in demand, we need to see the interest. If he wants to make
more money, he could play year-round like the others. We would be
willing to work out a loan arrangement if he can show the interest
is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano, in charge of player
personnel decisions for the team, is left with only one foreign
starter on his team -- Welton.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Hermosillo won't return for a couple of months while he
finishes his season in Mexico. MLS sold defensive midfielder Martin
Machon to a Mexican club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing I can do; I can't even set any deadlines,''
said Zambrano. ``It's out of my hands. The problem with single
entity is that these things are handled through the league; we have
no way of working things our ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, if Cienfuegos decides to hold out and the league
decides to punish Cienfuegos by not trading his rights to another
league or terminating his contract (which is highly likely), the
Galaxy is a big loser because it can't seek a foreign replacement.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are prepared to play the season without Mauricio,''
Zambrano said. ``That's just the reality. What can I do? I can't
worry about it. I learned a long time ago that you can't worry
about things that are out of your hands.''

 Genentech Drug Close To Seeking FDA's OK  &HT;       
 By Tom Abate 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Genentech Inc. is one step away from seeking Food and Drug
Administration approval to sell a new drug designed to dissolve
blood clots with a single injection.
</P>
<P>
   The company released a study yesterday showing that its new drug
candidate, TNK, was as effective as its current clot-buster,
Activase, for treating people who had already suffered a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the two drugs was given to 8,500 heart attack patients.
One month later, more than 93 percent of the patients given either
drug survived. Before clot-busters came along, the one-month
survival rate would have been more like 90 percent, Genentech said.
</P>
<P>
   The Phase III or final-stage study was designed specifically to
show that TNK was as effective as Activase, which is administered
in a 90-minute intravenous infusion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on yesterday's positive results, analysts said Genentech
must quickly seek FDA approval to start selling TNK, because
Activase, which accounts for a roughly a fifth of its revenues, is
losing sales. Activase slipped from $260.7 million in 1997 sales to
$213 million in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Newer clot-busters, like Retavase made by Centocor Inc. of
Pennsylvania, are winning ground against Activase because they are
more convenient, according to analyst Meirav Chovav, who follows
Genentech for Salomon Smith Barney. Retavase is given to patients
in two injections.
</P>
<P>
   With the single-shot TNK, ``Genentech has stolen (Centocor's)
thunder,'' Chovav said.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Stump, Genentech vice president for clinical trials, said
his firm would soon ask for FDA permission to sell TNK as a heart
attack treatment.
</P>
<P>
   But even if the FDA gives Genentech the quick approval it
expects, TNK could face competition from a rival single-shot
clot-buster. At the same scientific meeting in New Orleans where
Genentech presented its test results, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co.
showed off positive Phase III results for nPA, another single-shot
drug designed to dissolve blood clots.
</P>
<P>
   In its study of 15,000 heart patients, Bristol-Myers compared
nPA to Genentech's Activase and reported that nPA was effective as
the current Genentech drug in preventing death or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Genentech slipped 6 cents to close at $81.44.

 PeopleSoft Looking for New Leader  &HT;       
 By Jon Swartz 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
PeopleSoft Inc., whose meteoric growth stalled last year, said
yesterday it is searching for someone to succeed founder David
Duffield as president and possibly chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield, 58, would continue as chairman, but might turn over
his CEO title to lure a star, sources said.
</P>
<P>
   The 6,600-person maker of business-management software said
Duffield will set PeopleSoft's long-term strategy while the new
executive will oversee day-to-day operations.
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft has hired an unnamed executive recruiting firm to
look for outside candidates and is also considering internal ones,
a company spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Duffield could not be reached for comment. The spokesman said
Duffield has been ``looking several months for someone with a
strong operations background.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, PeopleSoft earned $143.2 million on sales of $1.3
billion. The year before, it earned $139.8 million on sales of
$815.6 million. In recent quarters, however, its growth rate has
tapered off.
</P>
<P>
   The company has been hurt by competition from heavyweights
Oracle Corp. and SAP AG, slumping markets in Asia and Latin
America, and its own struggle to integrate several acquisitions.
Compounding matters, PeopleSoft's sales of software to fix the Year
2000 computer problem have fallen short of expectations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A dramatic series of unfortunate events hit them all at
once,'' said analyst Eric Upin of BancBoston Robertson Stephens in
San Francisco. ``The wheels have come off their rapid growth. The
good times are over.''
</P>
<P>
   PeopleSoft's shares have fallen two-thirds from a 52-week high
of $55.94 in April. The stock inched up 31 cents, to $18.94, in
Nasdaq trading yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   The company cut jobs for the first time in January, when it laid
off 430 people. It also formed a new division, &UR;  &LR; called Momentum
Business Applications, to &UR;  &LR; develop software applications.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Duffield would be one of several top PeopleSoft executives to
change jobs recently.
</P>
<P>
   Chief Financial Officer Ronald Codd resigned in January to head
Momentum, and Albert Duffield, the chairman's brother, last week
said he will retire as PeopleSoft's senior vice president of sales
and marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said David Duffield's decision to diminish his role at
PeopleSoft was influenced partly by his growing interests outside
the company. He has adopted several children and last summer the
animal-rights activist started a $200 million ``no-kill'' project
for cats and dogs at shelters throughout the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of PEOPLESO () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Duffield's personal net worth, based largely on his PeopleSoft
stock, is estimated at more than $1.5 billion.

REPUBLICAN SEEKING TO BAN SUITS AGAINST GUN MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ga., Fla., Conn., Calif., Ill., Mo., La.)  (nk) 
 By LIZETTE ALVAREZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Opening a second front in the latest battle to
protect the gun industry, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., introduced
legislation Tuesday that would block the lawsuits filed by cities
against gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Barr, a board member of the National Rifle Association, the
country's largest gun lobbying organization, said that federal
legislation was needed to preserve free enterprise and stymie
get-rich schemes by trial lawyers. The bill would bar lawsuits that
seek to hold gun manufacturers and dealers liable when someone
commits a crime with one of their weapons, provided that the
firearm is legal and not defective and that the customer is not a
known criminal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these lawsuits are allowed to proceed it will really be
`Katie bar the door' because there will be no industry in America
that will be safe from these abusive and predatory lawsuits,'' Barr
said.
</P>
<P>
   With cities in a legal standoff against gun manufacturers, the
longtime struggle over gun control and the rights of gun owners has
been infused with energy and importance on Capitol Hill this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy by local governments to recover damages has
stoked the Democrats' campaign to crack down on firearms after
having failed to get any gun-control legislation passed since the
Republicans took control of Congress in 1994. In the past two weeks
alone, the Democrats have introduced three separate bills and more
are expected.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said she planned to
counteract Barr's bill by introducing legislation that would
guarantee cities the right to sue gun manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If local governments believe the fight against crime is being
hampered because of a mass proliferation of guns, I believe it is
in the national interest to allow them to take action in court,''
Boxer said.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday morning, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, Boxer's fellow
California Democrat, laid out her own legislation to close a
loophole that permits the import of high-capacity ammunition clips
for assault weapons that cannot be manufactured in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats have introduced legislation, including a bill
that would require the federal government to regulate the design,
manufacture and distribution of guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``The activity on the city level is sending a signal to
everybody in Capitol Hill that people really do care about this,''
Feinstein said. ``And that this totally unregulated,
produce-anything, sell-anything, kill-as-many-people sort of
attitude is just not acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, sensing a serious threat this time, have moved
swiftly to try to protect the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by law-enforcement and gun lobbyists, Barr held up a
wooden Louisville Slugger bat at a news conference to warn of the
domino effect. Once trial lawyers sue one industry for liability of
this sort, he said, the strategy will be used against other
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   These bats, Barr intoned, ``are used in the commission of
crimes, with some frequency unfortunately. Should the manufacturers
of Louisville sluggers, already reeling under changes in their
industry, be subject to devastating, abusive lawsuits because their
lawful products, none defectively manufactured, are abused by
criminals? Obviously not.''
</P>
<P>
   His bill, Barr emphasized, would not shield manufacturers from
lawsuits for selling defective firearms or selling guns to known
criminals.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would serve as a stopgap for lobbyists who have
been furiously working with state legislatures to halt the spate of
lawsuits. Using the tobacco industry lawsuits as a model, five
cities have sued the gun industry: Atlanta, Bridgeport, Conn.,
Chicago, Miami and New Orleans. Others, including St. Louis, are
considering doing the same.
</P>
<P>
   The cities seek to recover expenses from violent gun crimes,
including law-enforcement and hospital costs. Most of the cities
also argue that the gun industry is negligent for not including
more safety features.
</P>
<P>
   Gun lobbyists have taken note of a ruling last month in federal
District Court in Brooklyn. In a lawsuit filed by private citizens,
a jury held nine of 25 gun manufacturers liable for three shootings
that involved illegally obtained handguns.
</P>
<P>
   So far, only Georgia has passed a state law to block a lawsuit,
Atlanta's in this case, although legislation is being considered in
at least 12 states. The Florida Legislature is considering a bill
that would make it a felony for a local official to file a lawsuit
against the gun industry.
</P>
<P>
   But tackling the offensive state-by-state is expensive and
time-consuming. Barr's bill, if it passes, would accomplish the
same feat all at once. Its prospects are still uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   But it puts Republican lawmakers in a bit of a philosophical
bind: With this bill, Republicans could wind up defending a law
that undermines local governments. Do Republicans defend local
governments or the gun industry?
</P>
<P>
   Barr said the decision is simple: they will defend the status
quo. ``There is nothing more conservative than maintaining the
status quo,'' he said.

 Net Gaming Firm Makes Right Moves  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Erick Hachenburg was late for a key company meeting, but the
executive couldn't pull himself away from a far more urgent task: a
game of online solitaire on his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait, I have to finish this,'' said Hachenburg, the CEO of
Total Entertainment Network, as he moved his cursor over a six of
hearts and studied his options. A company vice president politely
urged him to hurry.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Hachenburg's fixation on the card game was understandable.
After all, it was his decision to switch the company's focus from
online shoot-em-up games for hard-core players to low-tech games
like solitaire and chess. The move opened a broader market and
helped revive the San Francisco firm in just one year.
</P>
<P>
   Through a series of exclusive deals, Ten has become the company
that runs online parlor games for Netscape Netcenter, Alta Vista,
Cnet, Excite, GeoCities, Infoseek, Prodigy and WebCrawler.
</P>
<P>
   Ten also has lined up deals with Lycos, onetime rival game
service Heat.Net and Internet cable services AtHome and Road
Runner. And in what some game-industry observers called a major
coup, Ten sewed up a deal this month with the Station, an Internet
game site run by a division of Sony Corp.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly all of its 1.5 million new registered members signed
up in the past six months, Ten has made a remarkable comeback for a
3-year-old startup that game industry analysts thought was on the
verge of shutting down in late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were dead in the water,'' said David Cole, executive
editor of the industry magazine Game Intelligence of San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Ten's struggles illustrate the promise and pitfalls of the
fast-moving and highly competitive Internet gaming industry.
Forrester Research predicts that industry revenues will grow from
just $277 million in 1998 to $2 billion by 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Adaptability was Ten's key &LR;   &LR; to survival.
</P>
<P>
   The privately held company's original game plan was to sell
monthly subscriptions to hard-core fans who wanted to play popular
computer fantasy or shoot-em games like Duke Nukem or Quake with
others through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   While those hard-core gamers were passionate, there were not
enough of them to generate sufficient revenues for Ten to survive.
Its subscriptions peaked at about 25,000.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Ten stubbornly held onto the subscription-revenue model,
competitors like MPath Interactive in Mountain View switched to
offering free games supported by advertising. Redwood City's
SegaSoft also launched a free gaming site called Heat.Net.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of TEN10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  In another blow, Ten originally planned to license PC games for
play online. But before long, the PC gamemakers themselves began
offering their own online versions, cutting Ten out of the picture.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Ten had to scale back operations and lay off about
36 workers in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Seema Williams of Forrester Research said she was
``horribly pessimistic'' about Ten's chances for survival through
1998 and that she believed the company would be forced to sell
itself to a competitor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; At that point, Ten adopted a slightly different strategy. It
launched a Professional Gamers League _ a series of continuing
tournaments that attracted hard-core online game enthusiasts and
much-needed revenue from corporate sponsorships. Using that same
approach, Ten later started its NASCAR Racing Online Series.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This moves appealed to Ten's original audience of hard-core
gamers and lined up about $3 million in sponsorship money.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hachenburg and his management team knew the PGL had to
reach beyond hard-core gamers. ``We figured we had to do something
different,'' said Hachenburg, who replaced Ten's original CEO, Jack
Heistand, in December 1997. ``When you're facing life or death, it
forces you into doing something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   So Hachenburg helped devise a new business plan that featured
online versions of familiar, time-tested games like spades, hearts,
chess, crossword puzzles and Jumble. Ten was following a trend that
showed that fans of those games were the fastest-growing segment of
online gamers.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Ten moved to broaden its audience by offering these
parlor games on a ``Family Games Network'' to as many Internet
sites as it could sign up.
</P>
<P>
   Hachenburg had to sell this unique but unproven strategy to
Ten's investors, which include Kleiner Perkins Caulfield and Byers,
Ameritech, the Carlyle Group and Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent the better part of December 1997 and January 1998
convincing existing investors to support the company and its new
business plan,'' Hachenburg said.
</P>
<P>
   His efforts paid off. By February 1998, Ten had lined up an
additional $8 million in financing to give Ten time and money ``to
reposition the business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 2 of TEN10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  With some elbow room to operate, Ten started to line up exclusive
agreements with Internet portals, starting with Excite last May.
</P>
<P>
   Under these agreements, Ten's computers host free parlor games,
without players having to leave the Internet site they initially
visit.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the competition can start as soon as the player
clicks the Ten logo on the Netcenter Web site. Meanwhile, the other
player may be logged to Cnet.
</P>
<P>
   During the game, the player on Netcenter will see that Web
site's advertising. The same is true for the Cnet player.
</P>
<P>
   Advertising revenues are split 50-50 &UR;  &LR; between Ten and the
Internet sites. Hachenburg said the Ten player tends to remain
online for 60 minutes, providing the sort of staying power, or
``stickiness,'' that Internet sites and advertisers highly desire.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Kraus, senior vice-president and co-founder of Internet
directory Excite Inc., said the format works. ``Excite lives and
dies by its ability to attract and retain customers,'' he noted.
``We use gaming to build loyalty''.
</P>
<P>
   For Ten, the demographics of parlor game players is much broader
than hard-core gamers, who tend to be 90 percent male and mostly
under the age of 24. The company says about 52 percent of its
parlor game players are women, 64 percent of whom are between 18
and 49.
</P>
<P>
   That profile is important to a site like the Station, which is
picking up Ten's parlor games. The online game site offers its 2.5
million registered users the Internet version of TV classics such
as ``Jeopardy,'' ``Wheel of Fortune'' and, coming soon, ``The
Dating Game.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Ten has a good slate of games that will benefit our program
slate,'' said Lisa Simpson, president of Sony Online Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Since adopting the Family Games Network idea, Ten's game playing
audience has grown dramatically, though it still is below
competitors like MPath and Microsoft's Internet Gaming Zone, each
of which have 2 million or more registered players.
</P>
<P>
   Ten spokesman Garth Chouteau said the peak number of players
online at any one time has nearly doubled from 4,500 in early
December to 9,500 this month. That compares with 20,000 peak users
on Yahoo's game site.
</P>
<P>
   The jump in players has been enough for Ten to attract at least
20 new advertisers, including Intel Corp. and Disney.com. And
there's the ``Pepsi One Casual Lounge,'' a cardroom with the
beverage giant's logo emblazoned on the backs of the virtual
playing cards.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 3 of TEN10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Although Hachenburg declined to reveal specifics, he said the
company expects revenues to double in the next two years and hopes
to finally turn a profit late next year. Advertising from parlor
games should account for about 75 percent of the Ten's revenue
stream by next year.
</P>
<P>
   On the whole, the online game industry still is not mature
enough to be profitable, said Forrester analyst Seema Williams. One
of Ten's original competitors, Dwango, another subscriber-based
online game service based in Houston, folded its cards last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's too early to tell whether the mass-market approach
will work in the long run, Ten's prognosis is at least better than
before, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that is happening is that more (players)
continue to come online,'' Williams said. ```Once they play (online
games), they tend to bring friends and family, and it turns
somewhat habitual.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten, which has corralled the most-popular Internet portals
except Yahoo and MSN, which run their own games, is now targeting
smaller sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``Market share is everything,'' said George Jones,
editor-in-chief of Computer Gaming World magazine in San Francisco.
``What they're doing is brilliant. They've done a great job of
reinventing themselves.''

 MCI Appeals FCC Ruling That Calls to the Net Are Long-Distance  &HT;       
 By Deborah Solomon 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
MCI WorldCom Corp. is challenging the Federal Communication
Commission's ruling that says calls to the Internet are
long-distance instead of local.
</P>
<P>
   Last month's ruling could prevent Baby Bell competitors such as
MCI from collecting hundreds of millions of dollars from regional
phone companies like Pacific Bell. &UR;  &LR; The decision also could lead to
higher costs for consumers who use the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   MCI filed an appeal of the ruling late Monday with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, arguing that the
FCC's decision should be overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the decision is arbitrary and capricious,'' said
Peter Lucht, a spokesman for MCI. ``We've expressed concerns for a
while that classifying dial-up calls to the Internet as interstate
could possibly lead to higher costs for Internet service providers
and, in turn, for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Other companies also are expected to appeal the FCC's decision.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's ruling exempts local phone companies, such as
Pacific Bell, from paying hefty fees to competitors such as MCI.
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 Telecommunications Act, local phone companies are
obligated to pay one another for completing competitors' local
calls. For example, if a Pac Bell customer calls a business that
uses MCI for local phone service, Pac Bell pays MCI for
``terminating'' the call.
</P>
<P>
   The fee, called ``reciprocal compensation,'' is supposed to help
phone companies maintain their networks so that they are capable of
receiving calls from other phone providers.
</P>
<P>
   Many competing local phone companies, such as MCI, provide phone
service to Internet service providers. Because the traffic to ISPs
is one way _ from the caller to the ISP _ the incumbent local phone
companies have been paying millions of dollars to their competitors
for terminating those calls.
</P>
<P>
   But the same rules don't apply to long-distance calls, so the
FCC's decision could prevent companies like MCI from collecting
money from incumbent local phone companies.
</P>
<P>
   Without that revenue, some companies could be forced to pass
along the costs to ISPs. Critics of the FCC's decision fear that
ISPs then could pass along the costs to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Lucht said MCI considers the decision unfair and wants a court
to take a look at the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We receive a lot of money from reciprocal compensation. ... We
want this decision to be reviewed,'' Lucht said.

 Tech Giants Betting on Leader of Linux  &HT;       
 By David Einstein 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Four more technology powers have taken minority stakes in Red Hat
Software, bolstering the company's position as the leading purveyor
of the Linux operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The investments by IBM, Compaq Computer, Novell and Oracle,
which were announced yesterday, come on top of similar investments
in Red Hat by Intel and Netscape Communications (before it was
acquired by America Online). The amounts were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   All the heavyweight investors are betting that Linux, which is
freely available on the World Wide Web, eventually will pose a
challenge to Microsoft's Windows NT to run servers and
workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's ease-of-use and reliability already have attracted more
than 10 million users worldwide, and it was the fastest-growing
operating system for computer networks last year, according to
International Data Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Red Hat, based in Research Triangle, N.C., has
capitalized on the Linux craze by selling a packaged version of the
software and by backing up the product with service and support _
benefits that don't usually come with free software.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the challenges that Linux has had to address has been
credibility in the corporate environment,'' said analyst Chris
LeTocq of Dataquest. ``What Red Hat is selling is the idea that
they will be on the other end of the phone when a company needs
service.''
</P>
<P>
   The phenomenal success of Linux, and Red Hat's leadership in the
new market, have prompted a number of technology giants to embrace
its technology. Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Compaq and Dell all have said
they will ship Red Hat Linux with their PCs and workstations.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the investments announced yesterday could extend
Red Hat's market lead over Caldera Systems, based in Orem, Utah,
Germany's SuSE and other private firms that sell Linux packages.
</P>
<P>
   ``Red Hat will become the premiere flavor of Linux,'' said Jon
Oltsik of Forrester Research, adding that ``this puts Caldera in a
really bad position of becoming a second-tier version of Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Young, co-founder and chief executive of Red Hat, said
the company was happy to have Compaq, IBM, Novell and Oracle as
equity partners ``because of their leadership positions in the
computing industry. Their support of Red Hat is a broad endorsement
of the (free software) model that is changing the entire software
industry and driving the rapid adoption of Linux.''
</P>
<P>
   Although its most visible target is Windows NT, Linux also
competes with forms of the Unix operating system made by companies
such as IBM and HP. In fact, said Oltsik, only Sun Microsystems'
version of Unix, called Solaris, may be strong enough to fend off
Linux.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sun is in good position, but everyone else is pretty much
behind the eight ball,'' he said.

LEWIS TO GET BIG CHANCE TO PROVE HIMSELF SATURDAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT MORALES  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   No heart.
</P>
<P>
   That is what the critics say about Lennox Lewis. Always have.
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, there appears to be no reason for such
criticism. Lewis is 34-1 with 27 knockouts. He has made four
defenses of the WBC title he won back from Oliver McCall in
February of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Yet somehow he gets blamed for others' unwillingness to fight
him.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Lewis' fault that Riddick Bowe gave up his WBC
heavyweight belt in 1992 rather than fight him.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't Lewis' fault that in 1996 Mike Tyson paid Lewis, the
mandatory challenger to Frank Bruno for the WBC title, $4 million
to step aside so he could fight Bruno. After beating Bruno, Tyson
vacated the belt rather than fight Lewis. Instead, Tyson fought the
much weaker Bruce Seldon for the WBA title.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis has always wanted the ultimate heavyweight championship
bout, the kind that proves points and defines careers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday at Madison Square Garden, Lewis finally will get
what his trainer, Emanuel Steward, says will be his one big
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   In challenging WBA and IBF champion Evander Holyfield, Lewis
will get the chance to show his courage and anything else it might
take to place him atop that pedestal of boxing eminence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find it amusing in one sense and I find it offensive in
another sense,'' Lewis said. ``How dare anybody question my heart?
I have never shown anybody I don't have heart. You have to have
heart in the first place to step into the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evander Holyfield does not have the monopoly on heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he has been unable to find the career-defining fight
until now, Lewis has shown his mettle. On Halloween night, 1992,
the 21-0 Lewis faced the hard-hitting Razor Ruddock, who was
heavily favored.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis knocked out Ruddock in the second round. The winner was
supposed to get a shot at the winner of the Bowe-Holyfield fight,
which was held just two weeks later. Bowe won, then relinquished
the belt.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the fight that proved Lewis' heart most was his
grueling 10-round decision over Ray Mercer in 1996 at Madison
Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis took punishment; his face was battered and swollen. But he
won the later rounds in courageous fashion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that fight was living proof that Lennox Lewis has
heart,'' Lewis' promoter, Dino Duva, said. ``Ray Mercer fought the
fight of his life that night.''
</P>
<P>
   Longtime trainer/commentator Gil Clancy believes Lewis has
heart, but hasn't utilized it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he hired Emanuel Steward, who is a fine trainer, to be
his trainer a couple of years ago, it looked like he would become
one of the best heavyweight champions in a long time,'' Clancy
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I've told Lennox, `You haven't improved one iota. You are
the same Lennox Lewis you always were.' I think that kind of got
him riled.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lewis: ``They ought to call him `Gil Can't-see.' He has
never even seen me train.''
</P>
<P>
   Steward has not exactly been overwhelmingly positive in
assessing Lewis, either. He calls both Holyfield and Lewis
inconsistent in title bouts, but adds ``tentative'' to Lewis'
weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lennox is more of a distant fighter; he uses his strength
better,'' said Steward when asked to compare Lewis to Bowe, who is
also 6-foot-5 and defeated Holyfield twice. ``But Lennox has had
his tentativeness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will Lennox come out tentatively, like he did against (Zeljko)
Mavrovic (in a distance-going title defense last September)? Or
will he come out aggressive like he did against (Andrew) Golota (in
a first-round knockout in October 1997)?''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that, Steward expects his man to knock out Holyfield,
perhaps by the fifth round. The emotions that are running through
each fighter as the bout approaches will make Lewis show his
aggressiveness from the start, Steward said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 33, had better, Steward said, because he will probably
never get an opportunity like this again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how anyone can be as hungry as Lennox Lewis at
this time,'' Steward said. ``Evander Holyfield has been in a lot of
big fights. This is (Lewis') whole career right here, as far as I'm
concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has been trying so hard to get a major fight, but after
this, this is it. There are no other big fights. He is going into
this with his eyes wide open. He knows he needs to win this fight
if he is going to be considered among the great heavyweights.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been asking a lot of questions, studying a lot of film.
So he's doing everything he can.''
</P>
<P>
   In short, it's Lewis' time. So says the Brit with the heart in
question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, I think this is my time,'' Lewis said. ``The
rwAqon I wasn't able to put my stamp on (the heavyweight division)
before, whether it was politics or whatever, this is my time to put
my stamp on it for this decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public has been waiting for this unification and it's
going to help me prove that I'm the best heavyweight on the
planet.''

 (Editors: Note ``underscore'' in Web address should be
replaced  with keystroke)   Column: Good, Bad Tax News For Startups 
 &HT;       
 By Peter Sinton  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; Question: &LR;  What tax breaks are available to someone starting a
business? There are a lot of costs before any revenue rolls in.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Answer: &LR;  The good news is that you may qualify for significant
deductions for startup expenses. The bad news is that it's a
cumbersome process and that you can't write off the costs all at
once.
</P>
<P>
   Startup costs, including what you pay to investigate creating or
purchasing a business, are called ``capital expenses.'' The
California Society of CPAs says you may elect to amortize these
startup costs over a period of 60 months, commencing the month the
business begins, if they meet the following tests:
</P>
<P>
   _The costs would be deductible if they were paid or incurred by
an existing business in the same field.
</P>
<P>
   _They are paid or incurred before you actually begin business
operations.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Internal Revenue Service, legitimate expenses
include: surveys of potential markets; analyses of available
facilities, labor and supplies; travel and other necessary costs to
secure distributors, supplies or customers; advertisements for the
opening of the business; salaries and wages for employees who are
being trained; and fees for consultant and professional services.
</P>
<P>
   Let's say, for example, you are starting a catering business
with startup expenses totaling $12,000. After landing your first
catering job in July, you can amortize all previous expenses and
begin deducting $200 per month for five years ($12,000 divided by
60 months). That means during the first year of business, you can
deduct $1,200 (July through December) and $2,400 for the following
first full year of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Note: If you want to amortize your startup expenses, you must
elect to do so by the tax return due date (including extensions)
for the year your business actively begins. If you wait another
year, you're out of luck. ``You do it right or lose it,'' said CPA
Craig Malmgren of Oakland's Lautze &AMP; Lautze Accountancy Corp.
``There's no safety net.''
</P>
<P>
   To qualify for the deduction, you must include a description of
the expenses, the amounts, the dates they were incurred, the month
in which the business began and the number of months in the
amortization period. Sole proprietors, partners and
limited-liability company members claim these deductions on IRS
Form 4562, Depreciation and Amortization.
</P>
<P>
   If you sell or otherwise dump your business before the end of
the amortization period, the startup costs that you have not yet
deducted may be deducted to the extent that they qualify as a
business loss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  However, if you never actually opened for business, the rules
are different. You must divide startup costs into two categories.
Those costs associated with market analysis or preliminary
investigation become personal expenses and are not deductible if
you are not organized as a corporation. Other startup expenses may
be deducted as a business loss in the year that your attempt to go
into business fails.

   Self-Employment Taxes
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am retired, age 67, and last year earned $1,700 for two
weeks' work as a consultant. As a self-employed person, must I pay
taxes on my consulting work?
</P>
<P>
   A: Alas, you must. If you are self-employed and have more than
$400 earned income, you owe self-employment tax. ``The
self-employment tax is really Social Security and Medicare tax for
the self-employed,'' says CPA Sharon Kreider of Sunnyvale. If you
work for someone else, you pay 7.65 percent and your employer pays
a matching amount. If you are self-employed, you pay both amounts,
or 15.3 percent of net income.
</P>
<P>
   You will need to file the $1,700 of income on your Schedule C as
well as Form SE, where you compute the self-employment tax. (The
Social Security tax is 12.4 percent of profits up to $65,400. The
2.9 percent Medicare tax applies to all profits.)
</P>
<P>
   If your total income is more than $8,000, excluding Social
Security benefits, then you also will have to pay federal income
tax. (If you do have to pay income tax, half of the self-employment
tax you pay can be deducted from taxable income.)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; TAX FORMS: &LR;  Here are toll-free phone numbers and Web sites
where you can send for or download current federal and California
tax forms and schedules:
</P>
<P>
   _Internal Revenue Service _ (800) 829-3676;

<P>
   _California Board of Equalization _ (800) 400-7115;
 &LR; www.boe.ca.gov/boelist.htm &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There also are plenty of business startup books and tax guides
that come with business and tax forms, either printed or on
CD-ROMs. Make sure these are current. Two big publishers are IDG
Books Worldwide and its ``Dummies'' titles ( &LR; www.dummies.com &LR; ) and
Nolo Press ( &LR; www.nolo.com &LR; ).

reduction to 31 cents per mile won't occur until after March 31.

 Microsoft, U.S. Deal May Be Possible  &HT;       
 By Benny Evangelista 
 &HT;     c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
The pretrial settlement of an antitrust suit between Intel Corp.
and the government fueled reports yesterday that Microsoft Corp.
and the U.S. Justice Department are negotiating a settlement of
their own.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Seattle Times, quoting unnamed sources close to the
negotiations, said Microsoft and Justice officials were talking
about a possible agreement to end the government's landmark
antitrust suit against the software firm. But later in the day,
Reuters quoted a government lawyer saying there were no talks going
on.
</P>
<P>
   Both Microsoft and the Justice Department declined to comment on
reports that they had renewed talks about a settlement that would
end the antitrust trial that began last October. The trial, now in
recess before each side calls rebuttal witnesses, is set to resume
April 12.
</P>
<P>
   But Caroline Boren, a Microsoft spokeswoman, said the company
remains open to government proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government hasn't made any good-faith attempts to settle
this in any matter that wouldn't violate the fundamental principles
of the marketplace, such as Microsoft's right to continue
innovating new products,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Experts said that even if Microsoft and the government are
indeed talking during the recess, there is little chance of a full
settlement, given the complexity of the issues and the fact that
the trial is nearing completion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can bet the house that some discussions are taking
place,'' said Hillard Sterling, a Chicago antitrust attorney.
``During a trial, parties don't ignore each other during a long
recess, particularly when external developments suggest the
reasonableness of settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he said a partial settlement on some minor issues was
possible, Sterling did not expect an accord on the major issues of
the government's case that Microsoft abused its monopoly powers to
stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of MICROSOF (5428 ) &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  ``Both sides have gone too far along in this passionate, divisive
battle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Intel averted an antitrust trial that was scheduled to start
yesterday by agreeing to a proposed settlement with the Federal
Trade Commission. Terms of the settlement won't be disclosed until
FTC commissioners approve it, which may take two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Dwight Davis of Summit Research said Microsoft might
agree to a settlement that would, for example, prevent it from
forcing exclusive contracts on computer-makers like Compaq. The
government has tried to prove Microsoft used strong-arm tactics on
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   But Microsoft would not agree to a settlement that would force a
breakup of the Redmond, Wash., company or one that would open
Windows software code to developers, Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Balderston, an analyst with Zona Research Inc. in Redwood
City, has a novel theory on the case. He speculated that
Microsoft's ``apparent nonchalance'' in handling the case is a ploy
to force the government to split it up into different companies
that could focus on specific markets, like Internet content and
consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's defense, which many legal analysts contend the
company bungled with poor videotape presentations and conflicting
testimony, may actually indicate the company's interest in a forced
breakup, Balderston said.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft stock rose $2.81 to close at $161.81.

<P>
   Despite RJR Nabisco's move to separate its food and tobacco
operations, hundreds of smoking-related lawsuits will likely
continue to cast a cloud over both businesses for years, legal
experts said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Legal responsibility for cigarette-related lawsuits against the
company in the international arena will shift to Japan Tobacco,
which agreed to pay $8 billion for RJR Nabisco's overseas tobacco
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But a slightly more complex picture exists for tobacco lawsuits
filed against the R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the nation's
second-biggest cigarette maker, by smokers and others in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Most legal experts said Tuesday that they thought that simply
separating the company's tobacco and food operations would not
insulate the food company from judgments in cases brought by
smokers that the free-standing tobacco company did not have the
financial resources to satisfy.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Leach, a bankruptcy lawyer in Washington, said that in
such cases, a plaintiff would probably try to enforce the judgment
against Nabisco Group Holdings, the new holding company that will
retain an 80 percent interest in the food company.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for me to imagine that the effort would not be
made,'' Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   John Coale, a lawyer in Washington who is involved in tobacco
lawsuits brought against the cigarette maker, said that while he
had not studied the new arrangement, he did not foresee any
problems with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all past conduct and pending litigation, they are not off
the hook,'' Coale said. ``We would try to put Humpty Dumpty back
together again and then we would collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Nabisco Group Holdings would not be responsible for actions
taken by the cigarette company that lead to lawsuits after the
spinoff, some legal experts said.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, legal responsibility for the actions of a company or
any injuries its products create cannot be evaded simply be selling
that company or spinning it off. And a company can commit fraud by
shielding its assets from legal judgments against its operations.
</P>
<P>
   Still, RJR Nabisco Holdings has fought to remove itself from
lawsuits filed against R.J. Reynolds, which makes brands like
Winston and Salem. And companies that produce both cigarettes and
other products have long wrestled with the question of how to
separate their tobacco-related operations and the liabilities they
represent.
</P>
<P>
   As early as 1993, officials of Philip Morris Cos., fearing that
an onslaught of tobacco litigation might force it into bankruptcy,
studied the issue of isolating their domestic tobacco operations,
according to an internal company memo produced during the recent
round of state lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In that memo, Murray Bring, a top company official, wrote that
one of the company's goals was to isolate its domestic tobacco
operation so that legal claims against it could not be collected
from other Philip Morris operations, including Kraft Foods, Miller
Brewing and even Philip Morris' foreign tobacco unit.
</P>
<P>
   One way to seal off liabilities, he wrote, would be to
reincorporate Philip Morris overseas, but he noted that such a
move, which did not occur, might be viewed as fraud.

WEN HO LEE: THIS MAN IS THE TALK OF LOS ALAMOS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With CHINA-NUKE) 
(sw) 
 By JAMES BROOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ALAMOS, New Mexico _ To his next-door neighbors of 20 years,
Wen Ho Lee is a generous man who shares plums from his backyard
orchard and brings over steaming plates of Peking duck on
Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   To a nuclear weapons scientist familiar with his work, ``Lee was
a behind-the-barn scientist,'' who was ``never out front
interfacing with the public or the government.''
</P>
<P>
   But to the FBI, Lee is the prime suspect in a damaging spy case,
one that federal investigators say helped China leapfrog a
generation of nuclear weapons research and develop lighter, more
powerful bombs that can be launched from submarines or placed in
groups on land-based missiles.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Energy Secretary Bill Richardson fired Lee from the
Los Alamos National Laboratory for security breaches. He has not
been charged with any crime, but on Tuesday the allegations cast a
shadow over Barcelona Avenue, the quiet suburban street where Lee
and his wife, Sylvia, built their house more than 20 years ago.
With photographers staking out the house on Tuesday, hoping to snap
pictures of the couple, the Lees hired a Los Angeles lawyer,
refused to answer their doorbell, and disconnected their phone. The
Lees' two children, Alberta and Tse Chung, who work in scientific
fields in Ohio and North Carolina, did not return calls left on
Tuesday at their work places.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is either a very, very good actor, or he is not your man,''
Don Marshall, a lab worker, said, staunchly defending his longtime
neighbor as reporters gathered.
</P>
<P>
   Jean Marshall, his wife, added: ``There was talk around the lab
today. Who is it? Who is it? I just can't believe it is him.''
</P>
<P>
   As other neighbors and lab workers spoke in Lee's defense, their
words seemed to reveal the ambiguities of the post Cold War era,
when international scientific cooperation is the mantra, and
enemies are cloudy.
</P>
<P>
   Built as a forbidden city to develop the atom bomb during World
War II, this government town was closed to the public until 1957.
Sentry boxes guarded the sole entrance, a two-lane road that
climbed to an isolated, 7,400- foot plateau. After the bomb was
used on Japan, Los Alamos became a mirror of the Soviet Union's
secret atomic cities, banning private land ownership until 1962.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember hearing about a scientist in the 1950s, who used to
take paper and pencils home from the lab to his kids,'' recalled
Bill Redmond, a Republican who represented this district in
Congress until his defeat last fall. ``One day, a government moving
van rolled up to his door, and they asked him, `where do you want
to go?' ''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, as Tuesday morning's newspapers carried front page
headlines about the spy charges, breakfast tables at the Holiday
Inn on Trinity Avenue were occupied by members of a Russian
delegation, their plastic visitors' badges clipped to their suit
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought China was part of the club now,'' a nuclear
scientist in Washington said of changing perceptions of friends and
enemies. ``It could be this guy was a little ahead of his time, or
he could be a bona fide spy.''
</P>
<P>
   On Barcelona Avenue, there is the same confusion. ``The security
is always tight in terms of someone trying to sneak in from the
outside, but once you get in they give classes on nuclear weapon
design,'' said Bill Partain, a nuclear engineer, who worked until
recently at the laboratory with Mrs. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, two other Taiwan-born scientists of Lee's
generation lost their jobs after federal investigators suspected
that they had passed secrets from the laboratory here to Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Lee was born in Taiwan in 1939, near the end of half a century
of Japanese rule of the island. His neighbor, Marshall, said, ``He
said he could remember the Japanese occupation of the island.''
</P>
<P>
   After Lee earned his bachelor of science degree in engineering
from Taiwan Provincial Cheng Kung University in 1963, he joined a
flow of Taiwan's college graduates seeking higher technical
education in the the United States. In the spring of 1965, he
enrolled at Texas A&AMP;M University, earning his master's degree in
engineering in 1966 and his doctorate in 1970.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a pretty good hard worker,'' recalled C.F.
Kettleborough, a Texas A&AMP;M mechanical engineering professor.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors recall that the Lees moved here in the late 1970s.
During their years in New Mexico, the Lees put their two children
through college, and managed to buy two houses in an Albuquerque
suburb's investment properties.
</P>
<P>
   At the 44-square-mile laboratory here, Lee gradually moved into
more sensitive areas. One scientist in Washington who is familiar
with Lee's work said that in the late 1980s, he began working in
the area of nuclear weapons design that looks at the triggering
mechanism of thermonuclear bombs.how the primary bomb triggers the
secondary, thermonuclear, bomb. This scientist said, ``He was a
classic staff scientist, not in management, quietly working away.''
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors remember the couple visiting Beijing in 1985. They
were active in the Los Alamos Chinese Cultural Association, a small
social group made up largely of immigrants from Taiwan that holds
Chinese celebrations and teaches Chinese character writing to
children at the library.

 &HT;    Reality short of Olympic promise
 &HT;    By Melissa Turner
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A little-known public charity founded by Billy Payne
more than a decade ago is shouldering a huge responsibility _
carrying on Atlanta's Olympic legacy. But the Georgia Amateur
Athletics Foundation is a long way from fulfilling its mission.
</P>
<P>
   Although the nonprofit foundation's stated tax-exempt purpose is
to support amateur sports, in the 2 1/2 years since the Games
ended, it has given grants of $10,000 each to two youth golf
programs. At the same time, the foundation spent nearly $1 million
to buy the personal memorabilia of its chairman _ Payne _
presumably for an Olympic museum the foundation intends to build.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic legacy for the Games has basically been nil, and
that has really been unfortunate,'' said Dennis Berkholtz, a former
Olympian and president of the national team handball federation,
which relocated to Atlanta after the Games in hopes of benefitting
from that legacy.
</P>
<P>
   A foundation-sponsored community development program that would
pump $1 million provided by the U.S. Olympic Committee into Olympic
sports programs for local youth has not begun.
</P>
<P>
   And the GAAF's vision for an Olympic museum has yet to come into
focus, although it has assembled a vast collection of memorabilia
and archived documents that remain behind closed doors at the
Atlanta History Center. A temporary exhibition was opened to the
public in 1997, but there are no plans for additional showings.
</P>
<P>
   Far from shining light on Atlanta's Olympic experience, the
foundation at present is vigorously trying to shelter itself from
an ongoing Olympic bidding scandal.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has emerged to link Atlanta's bid campaign to
bribery allegations that have debased the Salt Lake City 2002
Olympics bid effort. But the foundation has been in the news for
refusing to open its bid records to the public even as an
International Olympic Committee investigation widened to include
all recent bid cities.
</P>
<P>
   Payne contends that GAAF has ``an admirable record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It has hosted sporting events and given grants for a multiple
number of years,'' he said. ``The process was interrupted when the
bid was accepted. Now that everybody has got a second wind, we are
going to pick it back up.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Salt Lake scandal erupted last fall, the GAAF
kept a low and private profile.
</P>
<P>
   The organization, created by real estate attorney Payne in 1987,
is the brainchild of the people who brought the Olympics to town.
Its board of directors still includes the Atlanta Nine, private
citizens who circled the globe extending Southern hospitality to
the IOC.
</P>
<P>
   The stated purpose was to establish amateur athletic
competitions in Georgia, but the foundation's primary role was as a
vehicle for public contributions to lobby for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation took in about $12 million in cash, value-in-kind
contributions and licensed merchandise sales.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years of the bid campaign, GAAF co-hosted
international swim meets, volleyball tournaments and road races. It
launched the Olympic Day in the Schools program to build awareness
of the Games and to demonstrate to the USOC and the IOC that
Atlanta _ heretofore known for pro sports _ supported amateur
athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily, everything GAAF did was related to the bid,'' said
foundation president Ralph Jernigan Jr.
</P>
<P>
   When Atlanta won the Games in 1990, Payne formed the Atlanta
Committee for the Olympic Games and appointed his foundation
colleagues as officers and board members of the new organizing
committee. The foundation turned over much of the money it had left
in the bank to ACOG _ in the form of a $1.3 million loan _ to
launch operations.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next six years, the foundation's primary beneficiaries
were ACOG and Payne, who remained its chairman while also president
and chief executive of ACOG. The foundation's tax returns indicate
several substantial grants to the organizing committee. Some were
cash advances that came back to GAAF after the Games. Others were
transfers of cash from GAAF's Children's Olympic ticket fund that
provided seats to competitions for kids with special needs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the foundation loaned Payne $500,000 at a 6 percent
annual interest rate. Payne had quit his job when he launched his
bid effort and had secured a personal loan from a private source to
cover his expenses. The foundation's loan allowed Payne to pay off
the debt.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation did make grants to a number of organizations,
including the Boys &AMP; Girls Clubs, the Atlanta Project, a Techwood
Outreach basketball program and the Martin Luther King Jr. Center.
Jernigan acknowledged: ``We were not out publicizing the fact we
had a foundation trying to help youth sports. We were just
responding if somebody came to us.'' But in the months before the
Games, the foundation's board began to visualize its future,
Jernigan said. ``We began to realize if there was going to be any
ongoing legacy after the Games, GAAF was going to be the
organization to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Years before, Payne pledged to leave an amateur sports legacy
for inner-city youth. Originally, ACOG had projected a substantial
financial surplus, a portion of which would go to build soccer
fields and handball courts. But the budget tightened as the Games
drew near and organizers said after closing the books that the well
was dry. The USOC stepped in by announcing that it would contribute
$1 million to launch an Olympic sports program for local kids. The
GAAF would be its local partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think GAAF is the right partner, especially being the
legacy organization for the Olympic Games,'' said Maureen Stone,
the USOC program manager in Atlanta. ``The commitment is there from
the leadership to make this a successful program and resources are
there in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   While that program will encourage coaches, volunteers and
children to get more involved with Olympic sports such as team
handball, judo, canoeing and kayaking, it has not gotten out of the
starting blocks. Stalled by legal wrangling over liability issues
for two years, the committee is waiting for the foundation to sign
off on the paperwork, a USOC official said. When the Community
Olympic Development Program is launched this year, it will pale in
comparison to the one birthed after the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles, the last previous U.S. city to host the Games.
</P>
<P>
   The Amateur Athletics Foundation, a model for GAAF, was created
in 1985 and funded with $90 million in surplus revenues in Los
Angeles. The foundation has granted more than $57 million to help
build an aquatics center, teach 100,000 children how to swim,
introduce thousands more to sports such as cycling and beach
volleyball and turn out more than 600 certified coaches through its
clinics.
</P>
<P>
   With its relative lack of funds or support from any governmental
entity, the GAAF could never hope to foster a similar sports
legacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an Atlanta resident, I would selfishly have liked to see a
strong amateur sports movement and to have used the Olympics as a
springboard to do that,'' said Atlanta resident Dwight Bell, a USOC
board member. ``But clearly there has to be a commitment by some
organization to go after it and support it and coordinate it and be
a lighning rod for that activity.''
</P>
<P>
   GAAF was supposed to be that lightning rod. But it has yet to
generate any electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, the foundation had no staff. In January 1998,
it hired a part-time executive director, Linda Stephenson, a former
ACOG employee. Many of its directors and officers have been busy
closing down operations at ACOG. ``Most of us have been at this
eight or nine years,'' Jernigan explained. ``We had to take a
breather.''
</P>
<P>
   The foundation's number is not listed in the phone book, and it
operates temporarily out of a cubicle in sparse space still leased
in the near-empty Inforum by ACOG. When the board gets together,
it's usually in a member's living room or conference room at the
member's business office.
</P>
<P>
   The foundation has $4.5 million in assets _ $3 million in cash
returned by ACOG at the end of the Games and Payne's memorabilia,
which it values at $1.5 million. It still is not actively seeking
contributions or soliciting grant applications from sports
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Games, GAAF has given away no money, save the $10,000
golf program grants last fall to the East Lake Community Foundation
for its Junior Academy and the Friends of John A. White Park for
First Tee for inner-city kids.
</P>
<P>
   Both programs were connected to Payne or his board members.
Payne chaired the recent PGA Tour Championship at East Lake Golf
Club. His college friend, Jimmy Gabrielson, heads the First Tee
program. Two GAAF board members sit on the John A. White Park
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me and a lot of people that their objective is get
the museum built, and that's a legacy, but that's not a legacy for
kids and sports,'' lamented Berkholtz.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is a priority for GAAF and its executive director.
Stephenson has spent countless hours working on the Olympic
collection with the History Center. She helped put together the
center's ``Let the Memories Begin'' exhibition while still on
ACOG's payroll in 1997. Last year, she launched an ``oral history''
program seeking athletes, officials, volunteers and the public to
put their Olympic memories on videotape. Along with History Center
curator Don Mooney, she developed an Olympic display at the
Teaching Museum South, a special learning center for Fulton County
school children.
</P>
<P>
   A feasibility study for a permanent museum suggests making ``The
Olympic Experience'' a major downtown destination. But, in the
midst of the Salt Lake scandal, officials believe now is hardly the
time to launch a fund-raising campaign for about $30 million to
build the facility.
</P>
<P>
   This year, Stephenson is producing a commemorative brochure on
the Games. ``When people come to Atlanta and they want to know
about the Olympics, it's difficult for them to see something,'' she
said. Payne defended the foundation's emphasis on preservation.
</P>
<P>
   ``GAAF has spent thousands of hours beginning the process of
looking into the memorabilia and records,'' he said. ``We have
spent thousands of hours on the museum feasibility study. Those are
fundamental and appropriate undertakings and ones that we are proud
of.'' The largest financial undertaking since the Games is GAAF's
$975,000 purchase of Payne's Olympic memorabilia collection in
1997. That purchase allowed Payne to pay off his loan to the
foundation and still receive about $370,000 in cash. The foundation
considers Payne's memorabilia an essential part of any museum
collection. But while the sports activists don't begrudge the
foundation their drive for an Olympic museum, many agree with
Atlantan Steve Kearney, president of USA Badminton.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've already got a beautiful (Centennial Olympic) park, and
I'm glad we've got it. But what is that going to do for the
sports?'' he said. ``I'd also like to have a gym I could play in
and teach kids in. The athletes are the legacy.''

 &HT;    Collectors: Payne price was `inflated'
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Olympic memorabilia collectors and dealers worldwide
marvel at the price Billy Payne fetched for his Atlanta mementos,
which have been valued at $1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot imagine what's in the collection of Mr. Payne that
can be so expensive,'' said Bernhard Winter, an auctioneer from
Dusseldorf, Germany, who specializes in Olympic items.
</P>
<P>
   Payne, who was president and chief executive officer of the
Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, received $975,000 for his
memorabilia from the Georgia Amateur Athletics Foundation and
credit for a noncash contribution of $528,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Olympics chief said he could not remember all the
items in his collection but did cite the commemorative torch he
carried in Greece, an engraved brick from Centennial Olympic Park,
signed posters, ``tons of photographs'' and gifts he received for
making speeches.
</P>
<P>
   GAAF President Ralph Jernigan Jr. said he could not identify the
items and that he had never seen an itemized appraisal. He said he
thinks one exists but would not make it public. Jernigan earlier
said the collection is contained in about a dozen boxes. The
material is destined for an Olympics museum proposed for Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Ingrid O'Neil, a Colorado Springs, Colo., auctioneer and
authority on Olympic material, acknowledged that she appraised
Payne's collection but declined to say what it contained or how
much it appraised for.
</P>
<P>
   So what could add up to $1.5 million in those boxes?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been at this a long time, and I haven't got that kind of
money (invested in a collection),'' said Don Bigsby, president of
the Olympic Collectors Club, based in Schenectady, N.Y. He has
hundreds of valuable items, including a winner's medal from almost
every Games.
</P>
<P>
   Collector Alan Polsky of Los Angeles said, ``This stuff must be
rare and one-of-a-kind.'' And fellow collector Jon Becker said the
amount paid by the GAAF ``seems to be an inflated price.''
</P>
<P>
   Winter, the German auctioneer, said that if Payne's torch is no
different in design from the 13,000 others produced, then it is not
worth more than the typical price of $1,500 paid by collectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a special thing if it's the only one,'' Winter said.
Polsky said some collectors would pay a premium of perhaps $500 for
an item because Payne received it personally. But ``I don't think
it would make it priceless because it came from the local former
head of the Olympic committee,'' Polsky said. ``It's not (Olympic
founder Baron Pierre) de Coubertin's torch.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, a personal award given by a foreign country to Los
Angeles Olympics chief Peter Ueberroth was purchased recently for
$150.
</P>
<P>
   Payne says he is offended that anyone would question the
appraised value of his collection or the transaction with the
foundation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a private and confidential transaction,'' he said.
``There was no attempt to hide anything on this issue. The people
who brought the Games to Atlanta are not dishonorable
people.''Karen Rosen writes for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution,

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Faced with the twin burdens of debt and the
persistent threat of lawsuits over smoking, RJR Nabisco announced
Tuesday that it was splitting its food and tobacco businesses and
selling its foreign tobacco company to a Japanese buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The moves will let the company pay down most of its debt and
effectively remove itself from the tobacco business in hopes of
appeasing shareholders. But the changes unravel one of the biggest
mergers and most fought-over leveraged buyouts of the 1980s, one
that became a symbol of the decade's excesses.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, eager to raise the company's share price, RJR Nabisco's
management announced a plan to take the company private for $17
billion. That move attracted other would-be owners, including the
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts investment firm, which ultimately bid the
price up to $30 billion. The entire deal relied on junk bonds,
which left the company with a mountain of debt. The saga inspired a
best-seller, ``Barbarians at the Gate,'' which also became a
television movie. In early 1991, KKR sold stock in the company back
to the public to reduce its debt.
</P>
<P>
   But with the changes announced Tuesday, Steven F. Goldstone, the
chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco, acknowledged that
mixing the maker of Oreos and Nilla Wafers with the maker of
Winston cigarettes had not worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for these businesses to be under the same
roof,'' he said. ``They are very different enterprises, with
different problems, different challenges and different investor
groups.'' People should have ``the opportunity to choose whether
they want to invest in a tobacco company or a food company,'' he
added, acknowledging the ``tobacco taint'' that many analysts have
described at Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic tobacco will become a separate company, which will be
responsible for any smoking-related claims in the United States.
The holding company will continue to own the food business and
could be liable for claims if the domestic tobacco company goes
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The international tobacco division, perennially smaller and
weaker than its rivals, is being sold to Japan Tobacco, which is
controlled by the government, for $8 billion, considered a hefty
price by even the most optimistic stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts are intended to bolster what has been a chronically
depressed stock price. Wall Street responded cautiously, sending
RJR's share price up a mere 75 cents to close at $29.375, although
it initially rose nearly $2 a share following the early-morning
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Philip Morris also rose slightly, by 62.5 cents, with
some investors betting it would separate its tobacco and food
operations as well. A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company
had decided against that option in 1994 and had not changed its
mind.
</P>
<P>
   RJR's foreign sale, which is expected to be completed by
mid-May, will shore up the domestic tobacco company, which will be
known as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. Most of the $5 billion in after-tax
proceeds from the sale will be used to pay down that company's
debt, now about $6 billion, said Marc Cohen, who follows stocks of
tobacco companies for Goldman, Sachs. ``It will then have a very
conservatively managed and strong financial position,'' he said,
calling the spinoff ``a very bold move.''
</P>
<P>
   Current investors in RJR Nabisco will also receive one share of
the tobacco company for each share they own in a transaction that
will be tax free to shareholders and the company.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco will remain a holding company, with its sole asset
the 80.6 percent of Nabisco that it now owns. Since it will no
longer own any part of the tobacco company, it will be renamed
Nabisco Group Holdings. Most of its 90 or so employees at its
headquarters in New York will be laid off. A few corporate officers
of Nabisco Group Holdings will have similar titles at Nabisco.

 NEW YORK: at Nabisco.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in smoking lawsuits would be able to sue the holding
company, several experts said Tuesday, should the tobacco company
be unable to meet its obligations. But with a reduced debt load,
the free-standing tobacco company will be in a stronger financial
position.
</P>
<P>
   John Coale, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who is involved in
lawsuits against R.J. Reynolds, said he did not foresee the new
corporate structure interfering with his cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all past conduct and present litigation, they are not off
the hook,'' he said. ``We would try to put Humpty Dumpty together
again and then we would collect.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstone noted that the original plan had failed.
``Unfortunately, it didn't work out that way,'' he said. ``Then
you've got to try something else.''
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco holds 80.6 percent of Nabisco's shares, and the
remainder of the stock is held by the public. While the public's
shares were trading at $45 yesterday, the stock price of RJR
Nabisco was less than $30. When the tobacco companies are spun off
and sold, Cohen predicted, shares in RJR should rise closer to $45.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Icahn, the corporate takeover specialist who has repeatedly
bought and sold big stakes in RJR, re-entered the picture this
winter and threatened to nominate his own board of directors by
this Friday if the company did not spin off the food unit. Pressure
from Icahn was not a motivating factor, Goldstone said. ``It would
be Carl's third attempt up the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lawsuits brought by the Attorneys General of dozens of
states were resolved last year in a $206 billion industry
settlement, Goldstone said, his priority was ``finding a home'' for
the international tobacco business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a value for our shareholders that was high
enough to fix the balance sheet of our tobacco business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco agreed to pay a 33 percent premium for the
international tobacco division, which had been valued at about $6
billion. Japan Tobacco's chief long-term strategist, Yasushi
Shingai, said in an interview that he did not feel the price was
too high. ``These are very strong and prestigious brands, and there
is a lot of potential to grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, Japan Tobacco will vault from the fifth-biggest
to the third-biggest global cigarette maker and gain a presence in
Western Europe and Russia, among other markets. Its revenues last
year were $27.2 billion, and its holdings include pharmaceuticals
and food as well as tobacco products. It also controls Japan's
largest vending-machine company, a key asset in a country where
many consumer products are sold that way. Formed in 1985 after
privatization, Japan Tobacco owns Japan's biggest-selling cigarette
brand, Mild Seven, and makes Marlboro cigarettes locally for Philip
Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company was concerned about liability from
smokers' lawsuits, Shingai replied: ``We have three pending
litigations, but the law system and the culture are very different
than in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation yesterday about a possible sequel to
the story, particularly if Nabisco becomes a takeover target again.
``Somebody like Philip Morris may find them appetizing,'' said Gary
M. Black, who tracks tobacco stocks for Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co.

 &HT;    Pro-life activists support Bush's parental notification bill
 &HT;    By Scott S. Greenberger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The anti-abortion lawmakers and activists who
gathered on the Capitol steps Tuesday wanted to make one thing
clear: They weren't there to ban abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not here today to argue Roe versus Wade. Like it or
not, it's the law of the land,'' said Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower
Mound.
</P>
<P>
   Instead Nelson, Sen. Chris Harris, R-Arlington, and
representatives of the Texas Christian Coalition and the Texas
Right to Life Committee supported bills that would require parental
notification or consent before doctors perform abortions on minors.
The Senate Human Services Committee is scheduled to consider
several notification and consent bills today.
</P>
<P>
   The comments echoed recent remarks by Gov. George W. Bush _
remarks that have spurred some religious conservatives to attack
Bush's stance as lukewarm. Bush, who is almost certainly running
for president, said Monday that he is a ``pro-life person'' but
wouldn't push a constitutional amendment banning abortion because
most Americans aren't ready to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Bush said, the focus should be on attainable goals such
as parental notification and consent bills.
</P>
<P>
   The activists on the Capitol steps pointedly refrained from
criticizing Bush's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're here to discuss parental notification legislation. We
haven't discussed anything further during the legislative session
with the governor,'' said Chuck Anderson of the Texas Christian
Coalition.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson noted that at the state level, abortion opponents can't
go much further than consent and notification bills.
</P>
<P>
   ``The courts say that women should have legal access to
abortion, and there's nothing that I can do about that as a state
senator. I'm trumped by a higher authority,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   GOP presidential candidate Gary Bauer acknowledged that Bush
can't go further on the state level _ but he expects more from him
if he is elected president.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's's answer was the answer of a politician, not
someone who wants the party of Lincoln and Reagan to be unambiguous
on this issue,'' said Bauer, who promised that as president he'd
appoint only anti-abortion Supreme Court justices and would submit
a constitutional amendment banning abortions within two years.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the Texas notification and consent bills say they
would restore parental rights and reduce the number of teenage
pregnancies and abortions. They also say that the bills would put
abortion on a par with other major medical procedures, which
require parental consent. The bills include a provision allowing
teenagers in abusive families to get consent from a judge instead
of a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill is not about abortion, it's about parenting. Minor
children are not adults _they don't think like adults, they don't
behave like adults and they don't make decisions like adults,''
Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents say girls who are afraid to tell their parents
that they are pregnant will resort to illegal, and dangerous,
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've carefully picked issues that market well to mainstream
public,'' said Kae McLaughlin of the Texas Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League. ``They know the reality of
mandated parental involvement is that young women will seek illegal
abortions.''

MICROSOFT APPEARS UNLIKELY TO SETTLE ITS ANTITRUST CASE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Microsoft antitrust trial broke for a six-week recess
on Feb. 26, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had some parting words
for both sides. He called the lawyers for the government and the
Microsoft Corp. into his chambers and told them to ``use this six
weeks wisely,'' according to a person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   It was a garden-variety judicial admonition, legal experts say,
to urge the two sides to see if they could again try to settle
their dispute. Judges, they say, typically prod litigants to
reconsider the option of settlement at key stages in a case. In the
Microsoft trial, the 12 witnesses for each side have concluded
their testimony.
</P>
<P>
   There are no settlement talks currently under way between
Microsoft and the Justice Department and 19 states suing the
software maker, according to a person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   The Seattle Times reported on Tuesday that the government and
Microsoft were ``exploring ways'' to settle the suit and quoted
Robert Herbold, the chief operating officer of Microsoft, as
saying, ``You never block out the notion of settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Intel Corp. announced a proposed settlement of
its antitrust dispute with the Federal Trade Commission, the
possibility that Microsoft might also settle its case drove its
stock price sharply higher Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   In early trading, Microsoft's stock traded as high as $164.75 a
share, up $5.75 from Monday's close, though it drifted down later
in the day to close at $161.813 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft and the Justice Department did hold settlement talks
in the days before the government and states filed their sweeping
antitrust case against the company last May _ but those talks
quickly broke down when it became clear the two sides were far
apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft and Intel cases, legal experts noted, are very
different. A settlement in one, they added, suggests next to
nothing about the chances of a settlement in the other, even though
both are computer industry powers charged with violating antitrust
laws.
</P>
<P>
   The FTC filed a complaint against Intel contending that the big
chip maker unfairly withheld technical information from three
computer makers as a strong-arm tactic in patent disputes. The
government's case against Microsoft, by contrast, is a sweeping
antitrust suit contending that the software maker repeatedly tried
to stifle competition _ charges Microsoft fiercely denies.
</P>
<P>
   ``A settlement would be far more difficult to reach in the
Microsoft case because the stakes are so much greater and the
distance between the two sides is so much wider than it was in the
Intel case,'' said William Kovacic, a professor at the George
Washington University Law School.
</P>
<P>
   Though not out of the question, settling a case after a trial
has begun is far less common than before testimony begins, as Intel
did. ``Once the two sides have descended into combat, it is far
more difficult,'' said Stephen Axinn, an antitrust litigator at
Axinn, Veltrop &AMP; Harkrider in New York.
</P>
<P>
   What Microsoft might or might not agree to as part of a
settlement is closely related to the debate over the remedies the
government might seek if it wins the case. These range from
prohibiting Microsoft from entering into exclusionary contracts to
splitting up the company.
</P>
<P>
   The government, according to most courtroom observers, will
likely win in Jackson's court after a strong trial performance by
its legal team. ``So it would take a real change in Microsoft's
thinking for it to offer something that the government could accept
as real remedial settlement,'' said one person close to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Another hurdle in reaching a settlement is that any proposal
would have to be acceptable not only to the Justice Department, but
also to the 19 states involved in the case. A few dissenting
states, or even one, could scuttle a settlement proposal, legal
experts say.

PROPOSED PARK WOULD BE BIGGER THAN YELLOWSTONE, GRAND CANYON
COMBINED

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ It's more than 3 million acres of federal land in
southwestern Arizona with no timber, cattle-grazing or mining
rights. Its only official tenant is the Air Force, which uses a
fraction of it.
</P>
<P>
   It's a perfect opportunity, says a group of self-proclaimed
active thinkers, to turn a huge chunk of desert into the premier
desert park in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Broyles, leader of the drive to create a Sonoran Desert
National Park, has put together a group of environmentally minded
professionals to support the cause, which is formally tabbed a
``citizens proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoran Desert National Park supporters, including Interior
Secretary Bruce Babbitt and former Interior Secretary Stewart
Udall, want to combine three areas to create the state's fourth
national park.
</P>
<P>
   Those areas: Organ Pipe National Monument, administered by the
National Park Service; Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge,
overseen by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; and the Barry M.
Goldwater Air Force Range, managed by the Department of Defense.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonoran Desert National Park would be bigger than
Yellowstone and Grand Canyon national parks combined. It would be
open to camping, hiking, hunting and other amenities, which much of
the land offers now.
</P>
<P>
   Making it a park, supporters say, would protect it from illegal
dumping, off-roading and destruction of archaeological sites.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles, a Tucson freelance writer, said he has received a
positive response from the National Park and U.S. Fish and Wildlife
services. Representatives from both agencies said Tuesday they
cannot comment now.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department also said it can't comment on the
proposal, which would change the lease on the Goldwater Range.
Broyles said he believes military officials are interested.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative was first introduced to Congress in 1968 by
Udall, then secretary of the Interior. It was shot down by
President Lyndon Johnson and mostly forgotten after that.
</P>
<P>
   The latest push was made public earlier this week with the
release of a detailed brochure, which called for the process to be
completed within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers have submitted their plans to Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., among other government officials. The creation of a
national park requires the approval of the House, Senate and
president.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason the group reintroduced the plan now is to
coincide with the renewal of the lease of the Goldwater Range, used
by pilots from Phoenix, Tucson and Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Broyles said the lease will expire between December 1999 and
January 2001. His group is asking for a transfer of the lease from
the Defense Department to the National Parks Service.
</P>
<P>
   Parks officials would allow representatives of the military to
stay at the Goldwater Range until they are ready to leave. After
that, the land would be officially part of the proposed park.
</P>
<P>
   The range covers about 1.8 million acres. The group says the Air
Force uses less than 10 percent of the land, mostly for bombing
drills. The Air Force uses all the airspace above the range.
</P>
<P>
   If the plan succeeds, group members say, the 5,000 square &UR; miles
will be better managed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most biologically extravagant desert in North
America,'' said Charles Bowden, a Tucson writer who backs the park.
He said the land would have more resources if backed by National
Park Service coffers.
</P>
<P>
   The three areas are hampered by environmentally harmful
activity, Broyles said, and some archaeological sites have been
trashed, sometimes unwittingly.
</P>
<P>
   Although the formation of a national park would not stop all
such activity, Broyles said, it would give the land more attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I thought (the land) would be magically preserved and I
didn't have to do anything,'' Bowden said, ``then I wouldn't do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The group estimates that less than $1 million is spent annually
for the upkeep of the three areas. Broyles did not know how much
the federal government would spend on upkeep if it becomes a
national park. &QL;

<P>
   WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. _ In the old days, when R.J. Reynolds
Tobacco Co. made a big announcement, civic and business leaders
here where the company started more than 100 years ago met with
Reynolds officials to learn about the news. The announcement
Tuesday reflected the changing times for tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard about it on the radio,'' said Alderman Wanda Merschel,
vice president for branch administration at Lexington State Bank.
``A representative from Reynolds called about 10:30. He had tried
to reach me earlier. My biggest reaction was that I didn't have a
big reaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The news _ that the conglomerate RJR Nabisco was splitting up
its food and tobacco businesses and selling its foreign tobacco
company to the Japanese _ struck a similar note among other
community leaders. John Gates, editorial page editor of The
Winston-Salem Journal, said: ``It was inevitable. It's been in the
works for a long time. We knew it was going to happen.'' David
Ibister, a retired R.J. Reynolds senior vice president and now
business lecturer at Wake Forest University here, added, ``It's not
a huge surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Lyons Gray, a Republican whose family has long been
associated with R.J. Reynolds, spent most of his day on state
tobacco settlement legislation. He said Steven Goldstone, RJR's
chairman, ``had intimated this a month or so ago.'' Recalling his
first job with Reynolds, selling Tempo brand cigarettes in Detroit,
Gray mused: ``It's a great company, and I'm sorry to see it broken
into pieces. It grew dramatically as a domestic tobacco company,
and I hope it will have that same opportunity now.''
</P>
<P>
   His colleague in the state Senate, Hamilton Horton, also a
Republican, said wistfully: ``Tobacco is big, big stuff for us in
Winston-Salem; it used to be the dominant crop and now it's only
about 16 percent of the state's farm income.'' When asked if any of
his fellow legislators talked about the news at lunch, Horton said
flatly, ``No one.''
</P>
<P>
   Maura Payne, vice president for communications at R.J. Reynolds,
had to work late Monday evening because of the impending
announcement, and she came in early Tuesday to start notifying
people. When she went to lunch in the company cafeteria in the
downtown Little Empire State Building headquarters, she found most
of her fellow employees ``pleased to hear the news,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, its a win-win situation,'' she observed. ``The
reaction here has been extremely positive. It clarifies your
decision-making.''
</P>
<P>
   That optimistic view is shared by Gayle Anderson, another former
Reynolds Tobacco employee who is now president of the Greater
Winston-Salem Chamber of Commerce. ``People who have been calling
me have said, `Thank goodness,''' she said. Ms. Anderson
understands the local importance of Reynolds Tobacco, which has a
payroll of 6,500 here. Civic leaders, she said, believe that the
sale and split ``will give the company an opportunity to focus on
their domestic business.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrel Guillory, director of the University of North Carolina
program on Southern politics, media and public life, believes the
sale and split to be ``the kind of corporate restructuring that is
caused by global economic forces that have resulted in a
diminishing of the domestic tobacco industry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as RJR was announcing this restructuring,'' he said, the
state Legislature ``was creating a nonprofit foundation to respond
to the needs of communities that over the next few years will be
weakened by trends that are running against tobacco.''
</P>
<P>
   RJR announced a prospective job reduction of 1,300 in December,
and Ms. Payne said Tuesday's announcement would not mean more job
cuts. To the contrary, she said, ``We may have to increase by a
handful.'' It was unclear what would happen to the 50 to 60
employees who worked for the international division here.

YUGOSLAVIA AND WEST ON `COLLISION COURSE,' ENVOY WARNS

<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The American envoy Richard Holbrooke
arrived here on Tuesday, warning that Yugoslavia and the West were
on a ``collision course'' over Kosovo that could bring NATO
intervention. At the same time, Yugoslav authorities announced that
they had issued arrest warrants for eight Kosovo rebel leaders,
including three taking part in the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Arrest warrants were already out on the leaders of the
separatist guerrilla movement, and Tuesday's announcement was
interpreted as a gesture of defiance to the West.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavy fighting was reported from the separatist
province of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, who is scheduled to meet with Yugoslavia's president,
Slobodan Milosevic, on Wednesday in an effort to advance a peace
accord for Kosovo, told reporters shortly after his arrival on
Tuesday: `` ``We are only a few days away from a tragedy of even
greater dimensions than what has occurred already. We might be on a
collision course here between Yugoslavia and the western
authorities, including NATO.''
</P>
<P>
   NATO has threatened air strikes if no agreement is reached to
end the year-long fighting in the southern Serbian province of
Kosovo, whose population is predominantly ethnic Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was making the visit at the request of Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to try to bring the two warring sides
closer before international mediated peace talks resume in France
on March 15. Negotiations broke up inconclusively after 17 days
last month.
</P>
<P>
   He said he had not come to dictate to the Serbs. ''We are here
to help resolve a long-standing problem between the Serbs and the
Albanians in Kosovo,'' he said. ``We come in peace, but the threat
of war, of greater war, is ever present.''
</P>
<P>
   The two sides are still far apart and throwing up last-minute
obstacles. On Tuesday, Serbian forces pushed deeper into the region
along the Macedonian border.
</P>
<P>
   They drove rebel fighters of the Kosovo Liberation Army out of
the hill village of Ivaja, capturing the commanding heights over
the main road to the border, a vital artery for the government.
There was also cannon fire reported in northern Kosovo as Serbian
units shelled the area west of the town of Vucitrn.
</P>
<P>
   The Serbian army offensive has been proceeding for the two weeks
since the peace talks broke up, despite the presence of
international monitors, who are overseeing a cease-fire signed last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslav authorities also announced that they had issued arrest
warrants for eight leading members of the Kosovo Liberation Army,
including three delegates to the peace talks. The men were wanted
for murder, kidnapping and attacks on Belgrade's military and
police personnel, the Yugoslav Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of the announcement appeared to be a calculated
signal to the West, and to the United States in particular, since
an invitation was extended to members of the KLA to visit
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Among those on the wanted list are Hashim Thaci and Jakup
Krasniqi, who took leading roles in the negotiations in France and
have frequently met with Western diplomats and mediators.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think it is a reaction to the invitation for them to go to
Washington,'' said one American official close to the talks. He
described Belgrade's attitude as, ``If you can do that, see what we
can do.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. mediator for the talks, Christopher Hill, said the
arrest warrants were not new but admitted the announcement would
not help efforts to seal an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The ethnic Albanians have frustrated mediators by their slowness
to sign the autonomy plan as drafted by the Contact Group. Despite
promises to sign within days, they have yet to do so. KLA members
have raised last-minute doubts about the plan for disarmament in
the agreement and the presence of Russian troops in the
international peace-keeping force intended to enforce a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The KLA news agency reported a new condition on Tuesday, that
the Serbian forces should cease all military operations in Kosovo
before they sign.
</P>
<P>
   Their reluctance to sign has been portrayed by Western officials
as weakening the case against Belgrade and leaves Holbrooke with
little ammunition for his meeting with Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke personally negotiated a cease-fire agreement with
Milosevic last October in which Serbian forces were to withdraw and
international monitors under the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe would move in to oversee the cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   While the violence abated at first, the monitors have been
unable to prevent a new escalation since December, including
killings in Racak, where 45 ethnic Albanians were taken out and
shot by Serbian police units.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke acknowledged that the original agreement had
limitations and emphasized that a new agreement was necessary. The
October agreement was not between the Yugoslav authorities and the
Kosovo Albanians, but rather between Holbrooke and Milosevic. It
also had no adequate enforcement mechanism, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement now under negotiation grants significant autonomy
to the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo and envisages a 28,000-member
NATO-led peace-keeping force to enforce the agreement. Milosevic
has, however, repeatedly refused to countenance any international
military force in Kosovo, arguing that it was an infringement on
Yugoslav sovereignty..

DOCTOR INSPIRED TO TRAIN HARD BY CANCER BATTLER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HEATHER GRIPP  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Few things are as godawful as chemotherapy. Eileen
Schwartz thinks of this when her body tells her she can't run any
farther.
</P>
<P>
   She thinks of Kylie Winkelman, her cancer patient, who will meet
her at the finish of Sunday's 14th L.A. Marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``She went further than 26.2 miles,'' says Schwartz, ``she went
to hell and back.''
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, Winkelman, 23, came to Schwartz complaining of
fatigue and back pain. She had cancer and underwent a series of
treatments, including a bone-marrow transplant. Her disease is in
remission.
</P>
<P>
   And when Schwartz, a Glendale physician, finishes the marathon,
she will give her medal of completion to Winkelman.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just impressed me so much because I know how scared she
was and she didn't fall apart, she just kept going,'' Schwartz
said. ``She just did what she needed to do, and I like that kind of
person who is scared but does what they need to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz, 48, is a self-described couch potato. She preached the
importance of exercise to her patients, as any good doctor does,
and finally began to follow her own advice by joining a charitable
organization that raised money through walks and runs.
</P>
<P>
   But Winkelman inspired the ultimate athletic challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always think about her when I'm training,'' Schwartz said.
``When I'm going up a hill and dying, I think, `I'm doing this for
Kylie, I'm doing this for Kylie. When it gets really tough out
there and my legs are burning and my lungs are burning and I'm
going up a really steep hill, I just think this is nothing compared
to a bone-marrow transplant and then I sometimes start to run up
the hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's been a real inspiration to me. What she went through is
so much more compared to what I'm doing. She's always there in my
mind pushing me, whether she knows it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time Schwartz is taking on a challenge
those close to her thought was impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just like when I went to med school and (my family)
said I was too old,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The former artist went back to school when she was 30, attending
UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to challenge myself,'' Schwartz said. ``I like
challenges. I especially like it when somebody tells me I can't do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her co-workers at her Burbank practice were among those
questioning Schwartz's ability to do the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had my doubts,'' said Lynn Parolasa, who listened to
Schwartz complain about the pain every day at work. ``I told her,
`You're going to kill yourself; there's no way.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz will carry a cellular phone Sunday to keep doubting
relatives updated on her progress.
</P>
<P>
   She started training for the marathon five months ago with the
Leukemia Team in Training program, for which she is raising money
through participation in the marathon.
</P>
<P>
   Walking with much speed wasn't easy, but the ability of a woman
17 years her senior kept Schwartz going. Mary Noble was so much
faster than Schwartz, and Schwartz struggled just to keep the woman
in her 60s in sight.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the two became good friends. They train together at
least three times a week. The marathon veteran introduced Schwartz
to hiking _ which both say helped tremendously _ and shared other
tips.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just admired the way I could keep going at my age,'' Noble
said. ``I encouraged her and she kept up with me.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're on your own, the alarm goes off at 5 o'clock and you
just roll over. You don't want to get up and do it, but if you have
someone waiting for you, it's easier. Teamwork; that's how you do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Noble won't run the L.A. Marathon with Schwartz because she
doesn't feel she'd recover in time to participate in another
marathon the following week. Noble plans to meet her friend at the
halfway point _ by which time Schwartz said she'll have long since
shifted from jogging to walking _ and walk back with Schwartz.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz's goal is completing the race regardless of time, but
hopes to break the 7-hour mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very excited,'' Noble said. ``It's such a thrill. It's a
scary feeling, thinking it'll never end, you'll never finish, but
when you do, it's the greatest feeling.''
</P>
<P>
   Excitement more than fear fills Schwartz, who displays a map of
the marathon route on her office door.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel scared at all,'' she said. ``I'm really excited,
I hope I can sleep Saturday night. I think it'll be so thrilling to
finish and have Kylie there.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an institution that runs on comity and
tradition, Sen. John W. Warner has mastered the art of fitting in.
With his impeccably tailored suits, silver-gray hair and
associations with Elizabeth Taylor and Barbara Walters, the
gentleman from Virginia looks, at first glance, like the senator
from central casting.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner's back-slapping bonhomie has not always gotten him
the respect that some colleagues say he really wants. As he assumes
a leadership role as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the
Republican is working to overcome a question that still lingers
among some of his peers: Is John Warner really up to the task?
</P>
<P>
   The 72-year-old World War II veteran and Secretary of the Navy
under President Richard Nixon, has been preparing a long time for
the day when he would take the reins from Sen. Strom Thurmond, the
96-year-old South Carolina Republican who stepped down as chairman
in January.
</P>
<P>
   Now Warner is trying to pump new life and credibility into a
panel whose prestige and relevance have slipped badly since the end
of the Cold War dulled the public's appetite for affairs of state.
And he is wasting no time.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate's first major bill this year, he and Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott of Mississippi rammed through the
biggest military pay and pension increase in nearly two decades.
Warner has reorganized the armed services panel, creating a
subcommittee to focus on terrorism, chemical and biological
weapons, and cyber warfare. By next month, the committee will have
held nearly 50 hearings on subjects from recruiting to national
missile defenses since he took over.
</P>
<P>
   And with his old friend and Senate Republican colleague William
Cohen now running the Pentagon, Warner has forged the closest
relationship in recent memory between an Armed Services chairman
and a defense secretary.
</P>
<P>
   It is a relationship that is already paying dividends for the
administration. Following his rule to ``check politics at the
water's edge'' when it comes to military and foreign policy, Warner
has bucked his party's leaders and backed Clinton's plan to put
4,000 troops into the warring Yugoslav province of Kosovo as part
of the NATO peacekeeping force if a peace accord is reached.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, he held off an interview for 25 minutes while he
fielded phone calls from Secretary of State Madeleine Albright and
President Clinton's national security adviser, Sandy Berger, to
discuss the latest diplomatic wrinkle in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having John out front leading this issue enhanced the
president's ability to make the case,'' said Cohen, who meets
regularly with Warner over breakfast at the Pentagon to hash out
military issues.
</P>
<P>
   Not since Sam Nunn of Georgia held the job when Democrats
controlled the Senate has an Armed Services chairman been so
involved in major foreign policy and national security issues.
``I'd like to be in the camp that constructively comments and, if
necessary, criticizes the administration, taking out the political
element,'' Warner said.
</P>
<P>
   Warner has an almost theatrical courtliness that borders on a
caricature of the Virginia gentleman farmer he once was. It is a
Southern-style formality that his supporters call patrician charm
and his critics call pompous.
</P>
<P>
   He has had to overcome derision from some colleagues and critics
who dismissed him early in his career as a dilettante and later as
an intellectual lightweight. Nixon helped start the snickering when
he once said the Navy secretary job could not be that difficult if
John Warner was doing it.
</P>
<P>
   But Warner's defenders say that what he lacks in innovativeness
or vision, he makes up for in diligence and experience. ``He's as
knowledgeable on national security as anyone,'' said Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., a Vietnam veteran on the committee. ``My God, he's
lived it for the last 30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Last December, before he took over the committee, Warner spent
hours at the Pentagon in briefings. After the first night of air
strikes against Iraq, Warner joined the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
their situation room to review damage-assessment reports. ``John is
willing to work, no question about that,'' said Sen. Ted Stevens,
R-Alaska, who heads the Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The senator draws upon his experience to back up his instincts.
He quit high school at 17 and enlisted in the Navy for the last
months of World War II. At the outbreak of the Korean War, Warner
left law school and joined the Marine Corps as a communications
officer. (He discounts his own military background as
``inconsequential.'')
</P>
<P>
   His office in the Russell Senate Building is a historical
anecdote. On one wall hangs a photograph of his father, a field
surgeon at the Battle of Verdun in World War I, with a great-uncle
who fought in Robert E. Lee's Confederate Army. On an opposite wall
is the 1991 Gulf War resolution, which Warner sponsored and the
Senate passed, 52 to 47.
</P>
<P>
   And yet the doubters persist. Conservatives have accused Warner
of working too closely with Democrats. When the Senate defeated the
nomination of Sen. John G. Tower, R-Texas, to be defense secretary
in 1989, many conservatives blamed Warner for being unduly
cooperative with Nunn's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives were outraged when Warner voted against Robert
Bork's nomination to the Supreme Court in 1987, and when he said
Oliver North was unfit to run for Virginia's Senate seat in 1994.
Warner was one of 10 Republicans to oppose the perjury charge
against Clinton (he voted for the obstruction of justice count).
</P>
<P>
   The senator's supporters say the attacks come largely from
Republicans who resent Warner's independent streak and willingness
to reach across the aisle. ``It's not that he's incapable of being
partisan, but on foreign policy, he'll rise above party politics
and do the right thing,'' said Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., former deputy head of the Veterans
Administration, credits Warner with crucial support to build the
Vietnam Veterans Memorial, and explains the raps this way: ``Warner
is the kind of guy who speaks rather plainly, and when you do that,
you run the risk of saying something some people wish you hadn't
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the sniping, Warner shrugs it off: ``I'm just going
to continue to follow my own objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his 20-year Senate career, that has meant focusing on
military issues, like bigger Pentagon budgets and robust missile
defenses. He has also pumped billions of dollars and thousands of
jobs into his state, and its huge shipbuilding industry, and
insulated Virginia from the devastating losses that hurt many other
once defense-rich states.
</P>
<P>
   Now Warner is trying to help Congress bridge the Cold War era
with today's more uncertain landscape. He supports a Pentagon plan
to appoint a military commander for defense of the continental
United States against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   And with American troops stretched globally thin, Warner worries
about the public's commitment to far-flung military missions. He
even suggests that America's 37,000 troops in South Korea be pared
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to continue to press other nations to dig into their
treasuries and expend the funds to prepare themselves for these
contingencies,'' Warner said, ``and not expect the U.S. always to
come when they dial 911.''

 Column: Vivus Stock Plunge Raises Doubts About Firm's
Staying  Power  By Mark Veverka  
 c. 1999 San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
Vive la Vivus?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of Muse, an also-ran male impotency treatment dwarfed
by the gonzo success of Viagra, knocked a double on Monday after
announcing that it won a patent for a topical cream aimed at
helping women with sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Vivus shareholders _ and I'm trying to resist
the temptation to use colorful double entendre here because this is
a family newspaper _ the one-day rally didn't last very long.
Yesterday, Vivus' shares plunged 19 percent to close at $3.91.
</P>
<P>
   Give the troubled Mountain View medical device company credit
for not calling it quits, but Vivus' attempt to develop a winning
treatment for women is a Hail Mary Pass. There are several other
formidable pharma-companies, including Pfizer of New York and Eli
Lilly of Indiana, that are racing to develop similar treatments for
women.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, we already know how Vivus fared against Pfizer
during their initial battle. Vivus' Muse product for men was
clinically successful and got approved by the Food and Drug
Administration before Pfizer's Viagra, but ultimately, it lost in a
rout, notes pharmaceutical analyst Sergio Traversa of Mehta
Partners, a New York biotechnology and pharmaceutical research
firm.
</P>
<P>
   Oftentimes, being first to market can prove to be a big
advantage for medical device stocks. And for a while, it worked for
Vivus, when its shares hovered near $40 in the first quarter of
1997. The strategy, though, backfired as the much-bigger Pfizer
used the buzz stirred by Muse to build anticipation for Viagra and
to prime its powerful marketing machine, Traversa says.
</P>
<P>
   ``One problem they had was being first, and you can't blame them
for doing that,'' Traversa says.
</P>
<P>
   But the bigger problem was that Muse wasn't very well accepted
by doctors and patients in the first place. Suffice it to say, it
was more awkward to use than Viagra because it required a patient
to inject a tiny pill into his urethra. Viagra, on the other hand,
is a pill that can be discreetly swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   The rest is history. Viagra rocketed to become an international
pop-culture phenomenon while Muse was left in the dust. Now, Vivus
is trying to stay in the game by competing for a treatment for
women.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of STREET10 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  No doubt, while there may not be the same market potential as for
male impotency, there is a lucrative opportunity for a female
treatment, Traversa says.
</P>
<P>
   However, the analyst says Vivus' patent is ``broad'' and not
likely to offer much protection from other companies that try to
use a topically administered cream, Traversa says.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Vivus is taking the same active drug used with
Muse, alprostadil, and is using it as a cream that women can apply
externally. He says several other companies are working with
alprostadil cream applications.

<P>
   But what might be more daunting for Vivus is that other drug
companies are testing oral pills for women, which once again might
prove to be preferable _ as they were with men, he says. Pfizer,
for example, is running a trial for Viagra with women.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ICOS of Seattle has partnered with Lilly to develop
a pill to challenge Viagra that has the potential to offer fewer
side-effects than the current market leader, he says. (ICOS is led
by the first CEO of Amgen, George Rathmann.) And it is expected
that the joint venture also will vie for the female market.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, there's a lot of confusion on how well Viagra will
work with women. British news publications have reported that young
women are buying Viagra on the black market in nightclubs and are
claiming that it improves their sexual performance. Meanwhile,
there have been recent academic studies released in the United
States saying the exact opposite: Viagra does little to offer
relief for female sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, the club-hoppers aren't asking for Muse. Still,
the clamor created by Vivus' announcement on Monday triggered an
explosion in trading volume. The number of shares trading hands
Monday and yesterday was more than 30 times the stock's usual
average.
</P>
<P>
   And judging by the lack of consensus between Vivus bears and
bulls debating the stock's prospects on Internet chat rooms,
current investors might want to steer clear of the volatile stock _
at least until more details of its trials with women are available,
says Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical Technology Stock Letter in
Berkeley.

   ALMA, Colo. _ Early-morning rays illuminated snowcapped peaks of
the Continental Divide as a group of people gathered in front of a
log cabin down in this village, waiting for the 7:15 and clutching
plastic coffee mugs, the universal emblem of a commuter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the view, I love staring out the window,'' Caroline
Grubbe said, settling into her reclining bus seat for the 40-minute
commute over an 11,541-foot mountain pass to her job running a
dentist's office in the ski resort town of Breckenridge. ``I could
never afford to live in Breck, and I love taking the bus to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Westerners have viewed mass transit as something
vaguely synonymous with socialism. But here in the Colorado
Rockies, surging tourism, employment, population and real estate
prices are forging transportation strategies that look positively
European.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last decade, an increasing number of mountain ski
communities have adopted a combination of publicly and privately
operated bus services, weaving a network of ``community bus
routes'' that together now link 20 towns. Since 1989, Total annual
ridership on such routes has tripled to 16 million.
</P>
<P>
   And from Denver westward, congestion on Interstate 70, the ski
areas' Main Street, is prompting Denverites to pack car-pool
parking lots to overflow levels and to pack a Ski Train, bound for
Winter Park, to levels not seen since it started carrying
passengers in 1940.
</P>
<P>
   Even with these dodges, though, Interstate traffic routinely
freezes on the weekends into an alpine version of the Long Island
Expressway, with sport utility vehicles stretching in 25-mile,
bumper-to-bumper lines down from the Continental Divide.
</P>
<P>
   So, with skier traffic up by 20 percent in the last three years,
a state agency is pushing for construction of a high-speed monorail
that would run 160 miles from Denver's new airport through the
Rockies to a string of ski areas, including Vail.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by Swiss voters' approval in a referendum last
November of $20 billion in public spending to improve rail service
in the Alps, Colorado planners believe that the state's voters will
pass a proposal next year to build a multimillion-dollar, 6.5-mile
monorail segment in the mountains that would test both technology
and public acceptance.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the worst times,'' like Sunday nights, ``traffic is to
double in five years,'' said Miller Hudson, executive director of
the Colorado Intermountain Guideway Authority, the agency pushing
for the monorail. ``If the voters reject it, we will just wait
until the misery index increases.''
</P>
<P>
   Already the misery index is rising fast. On Monday mornings,
conversations in Denver center more on Sunday's traffic conditions
than on conditions on the slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's laughable _ it's the most important industry in Colorado,
and it's a mess,'' one skier, Italo Laneri, said the morning after
battling traffic on a day trip to the mountains. ``Think of how
many people don't go because of the traffic.''
</P>
<P>
   With skiers' decisions driven by traffic volume, ski areas are
fighting back with some new tactics:
</P>
<P>
   _ As the days lengthen in March, Colorado's busiest skiing
month, some areas are staying open later, hoping to help skiers
avoid the mountain rush hour.
</P>
<P>
   _ Vail, which gets most of its skiers from outside Colorado,
encourages them to fly into the new Eagle Airport, 50 miles west of
the Interstate's chronic bottlenecks. Already one-third of Vail's
out-of-state skiers arrive at this airport.
</P>
<P>
   _ And this winter Loveland, the ski area closest to Denver,
started selling ``flex passes,'' tickets that allow a buyer to ski
any four-hour segment in a day rather than paying for the entire
day, the manner in which tickets must typically be purchased.
``It's for people who want to avoid peak times on the I-70
corridor,'' said Scott Fortner, director of marketing for Loveland.
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the ski areas are too cautious in responding to
the traffic congestion they create. In general, the resorts are
skeptical of the monorail and offer only lukewarm support to bus
service from Denver. Instead, they lobbied for $1 billion worth of
improvements on the mountain segment of the Interstate, work that
is to start next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ski areas are not advocating any particular solution,''
said Omar Jabara, a political consultant who supports running buses
between Denver, the nation's largest ski market, and the ski areas.
``If people are stuck in traffic on I-70, that means they are
getting to the ski area later. But they are still paying for the
lift ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   A ski-bus fleet, Jabara argues, would be better than a monorail
because it would be far cheaper than the monorail's $5 billion
cost, would not mar the scenery with a 160-mile string of towers
and, unlike the monorail, would not be subject to doubts about its
technology at mountain altitudes.
</P>
<P>
   In retort, Hudson said his monorail would charge less than the
$56 that existing van services demand for the 100-mile ride from
Denver's airport to Vail. Arguing that buses will not relieve the
pressure, he warned, ``In five years, every weekend will be a
problem, and the big holiday weekends will be just horrific.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the gains in bus ridership in the mountain towns to the
west, for the moment the old resistance to buses still reigns in
Denver, where a three-year-old bus service, SkiXpress, carries no
more than several thousand skiers a winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to get people to take the bus _ it's a life-style
thing out here,'' said Deborah Sakaguchi, manager of SkiXpress. She
said riders generally fell into two groups: teen-agers whose
parents will not lend them a car, and ``elderly people who still
want to ski but don't want to drive.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   But in the high country, transit attitudes have changed
radically as escalating real estate prices have forced many resort
workers to become commuters. In Vail, apartment rents are on a par
with those in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   While Breckenridge, Vail and other ski towns draw up plans to
build more worker housing, commuting over the Continental Divide is
expected to be the way of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are all workers, they aren't high-dollar tourists, they
are regular,'' Mike Westover said of his full load of passengers
this morning as he steered his bus around the seven high-altitude
hairpin turns that separate Alma from Breckenridge. ``Most of these
people can't afford to live in Breckenridge.''
</P>
<P>
   The bus service from here to Breckenridge was started this
winter with financing from the Breckenridge Ski Resort and the
Summit Stage, a mass transit system supported by a county sales
tax. With the high country registering Colorado's fastest growth in
mass transit, the Summit Stage has seen its annual ridership jump
to 1.3 million, from 300,000 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Among the converts to bus commuting is Barbara Jacobus, a bank
employee. As Westover eased his bus down Hoosier Pass, taking turns
at 15 miles an hour, Mrs. Jacobus said: ``The first day I drove,
two people spun out and hit each other. I feel much better about
taking the bus than driving.''

 By LAURA M. HOLSON and JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Wall Street has always found creative ways to make
money. But probably no other company over the years has done more
to enrich the coffers of investment bankers than RJR Nabisco. Even
going back to 1985 when R.J. Reynolds first acquired Nabisco Brands
for $4.9 billion _ the fourth-largest deal that year _ bankers
walked away with $19 million in advisory fees, including Morgan
Stanley, Shearson Lehman and Dillon Read.
</P>
<P>
   Not a tiny sum then, especially compared to J.P. Morgan and
Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., which earned about $20 million last year when
Exxon Corp. acquired Mobil Corp. in the largest merger ever. (True,
the chief executives of Exxon and Mobil were the real deal makers
in that transaction.)
</P>
<P>
   But no deal made bankers as notoriously wealthy as Kohlberg
Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co.'s two-month battle for RJR Nabisco in 1988.
Then, almost every bank on Wall Street its their pockets, either by
advising the companies or by financing the loans necessary for the
$25 billion takeover.
</P>
<P>
   According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings, $325
million was paid upfront to about 200 commercial banks for
providing $14.5 billion in financing for the buyout.
</P>
<P>
   Firms aiding Kohlberg Kravis in its successful bid were among
those to benefit the most.
</P>
<P>
   The now defunct Drexel Burnham Lambert reaped $227 million.
Morgan Stanley and Wasserstein, Perella each got $25 million.
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. got $109 million for its role in the financing.
And Kohlberg Kravis itself pocketed $75 million in fees from its
investors.
</P>
<P>
   According to an account in the book ``Barbarians at the Gate,''
the 1989 best seller that chronicled the RJR battle, Richard
Beattie, now chairman of the law firm Simpson Thacher &AMP; Bartlett,
even joked about it. ``It's wonderful to see all these friends of
KKR here tonight,'' he is reported to have said in front of 400
people at the celebratory dinner Henry Kravis threw at the Pierre
Hotel's grand ballroom. ``To think it only took a billion dollars
in fees to get us all together.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers representing RJR Nabisco also fared well. Dillon Read
and Lazard Freres each earned $14 million for advising RJR's board.
And there was plenty of more money to be made, especially with
later financings and corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, in 1995, several investment banks, including
Goldman, Sachs, earned a total of $46.8 million in underwriting
fees in Nabisco Holdings Inc.'s $1.1 billion stock offering,
according to Securities Data Co.
</P>
<P>
   Even Tuesday's sale and subsequent spinoff of the domestic
tobacco unit guarantees bankers fat paychecks for months to come.
RJR Nabisco was loathe to disclose just how much the company paid
Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and lawyers Davis Polk &AMP; Wardwell,
who advised them on the $8 billion sale of the company's
international tobacco business. But merger experts say that they,
along with Salomon Smith Barney, which advised the buyer, Japan
Tobacco, could reap between $30 million and $40 million for that
transaction alone.
</P>
<P>
   And that does not include how much RJR Nabisco will have to pay
bankers who will be responsible for splitting off the domestic
tobacco business later this year. With fees like those in the past,
RJR Nabisco may well earn a place as Wall Street's best customer.

 &HT;    Workers ratify contract, won't strike against Lockheed Martin
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving in (a) General news and (f) Financial categories.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Union workers at Lockheed Martin Corp.'s Marietta
plant ratified a new contract Tuesday, ending a strike threat at
Cobb County's largest private employer.
</P>
<P>
   Machinists union Local 709 said 59 percent of voting members
approved the three-year pact.
</P>
<P>
   The deal covers 4,200 Machinists at the military aircraft plant,
or just under half the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Union members had rejected an initial tentative agreement Feb.
28 by a 68 percent vote, despite an endorsement by Local 709
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A strike deadline was set for 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The company modified its proposal in last-ditch, federally
mediated talks Monday, prompting Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   A union spokesman said the company withdrew a plan to shift some
workers to four-day, 10-hour-a-day workweeks, which opponents said
would be disruptive and could also cut down on overtime. It also
agreed to reduce the number of job classifications that will be
combined in the new pact, a move some workers believe is a
precursor to more job cuts at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offered a compromise on a tougher attendance
policy that angered some workers, the union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrowness of Tuesday's ratification showed many among
the rank-and-file remain unhappy with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Basic economic elements in the contract, including 3 percent
annual pay raises, were unchanged from the first proposal and
apparently were not a key issue in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Susan Miles called the revised
proposal a ``fair contract'' and added the changes ``addressed
specific concerns of the union membership.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement doesn't end the plant's broader problems, which
include delivery delays and slow sales in the C-130J cargo plane
program.
</P>
<P>
   Employment has fallen slowly but steadily in recent years, and
executives have warned it could fall further as they seek to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also leads development of the F-22 fighter.

</P>
<P>
   The deal covers 4,200 Machinists at the military aircraft plant,
or just under half the workforce.
</P>
<P>
   Union members had rejected an initial tentative agreement Feb.
28 by a 68 percent vote, despite an endorsement by Local 709
leaders.
</P>
<P>
   A strike deadline was set for 12:01 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   The company modified its proposal in last-ditch, federally
mediated talks Monday, prompting Tuesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   A union spokesman said the company withdrew a plan to shift some
workers to four-day, 10-hour-a-day workweeks, which opponents said
would be disruptive and could also cut down on overtime. It also
agreed to reduce the number of job classifications that will be
combined in the new pact, a move some workers believe is a
precursor to more job cuts at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company also offered a compromise on a tougher attendance
policy that angered some workers, the union spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrowness of Tuesday's ratification showed many among
the rank-and-file remain unhappy with the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Basic economic elements in the contract, including 3 percent
annual pay raises, were unchanged from the first proposal and
apparently were not a key issue in the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin spokeswoman Susan Miles called the revised
proposal a ``fair contract'' and added the changes ``addressed
specific concerns of the union membership.''
</P>
<P>
   The settlement doesn't end the plant's broader problems, which
include delivery delays and slow sales in the C-130J cargo plane
program.
</P>
<P>
   Employment has fallen slowly but steadily in recent years, and
executives have warned it could fall further as they seek to cut
costs.
</P>
<P>
   The plant also leads development of the F-22 fighter.

POLITICAL BATTLE IN WASHINGTON: WHAT TO REVEAL ON CHINA ARMS 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Subs 1st-6th grafs for new material, rewriting; inserts new 16th
graf) (wg) 
 By JEFF GERTH and ERIC SCHMITT 
  
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and congressional
Republicans are wrangling over how much information to make public
about official findings that China acquired some of the most
sensitive American military technology.
</P>
<P>
   Last December, a bipartisan committee unanimously approved a
voluminous report concluding that China had harmed national
security during the last 20 years by stealing American nuclear
secrets and acquiring other American technology.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the committee and the White House have been quietly
negotiating how much of the report could be released. Both agree
that something should be released, but not on what specifically.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks the discussions have become increasingly tense.
They are now taking on a more partisan tone, and the issue is
providing ammunition to critics of President Clinton's China policy
in the days leading up to important talks between Beijing and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   China has consistently denied any theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   The committee that produced the report is to disband at the end
of the month unless Congress extends its life. A few days later
China's premier is scheduled to come to Washington.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican member of the panel, Rep. Curt Weldon of
Pennsylvania, said in an interview Tuesday: ``They're trying to
spin this thing to get the best play for themselves and avoid
further embarrassment. They want to drag it out as long as long as
they can. I'm so mad I can't see straight.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's chairman, Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., gave a
more restrained assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are debating whether we can state what we found,'' he said.
The risk , he added, is that the panel's secret findings would be
lost in the layers of the declassification process.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on the panel, who asked not to be identified, said
they believe the administration's efforts to keep some information
secret is based on legitimate concerns of protecting
intelligence-gathering methods.
</P>
<P>
   One Democratic member also said that recent press accounts about
the Cox Committee's findings had affected the negotiations,
creating the possibility that the administration ``might be a
little more willing to declassify.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House denied the Republican accusations, noting it met
the committee's March 1 deadline to submit the administration's
classification concerns, and continued to cooperate with lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working in good faith to help the committee declassify
as much of the report as possible, consistent with the intelligence
community's requirement to protect its sources and methods,'' said
P.J. Crowley, a spokesman for the National Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley said the administration had suggested how the panel
could rewrite portions of the highly classified report to make it
available to the public.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, details of the Cox Committee's work, including
the determination by U.S. officials that China stole nuclear
secrets from an American weapons laboratory, have surfaced. On
Monday, a scientist at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico
was dismissed for security breaches after he was questioned by the
FBI in connection with the suspected theft of nuclear secrets.
</P>
<P>
   [In Boston on Tuesday, a federal grand jury indicted Yao Yi, a
Chinese scientist, and Collin Shu, a Canadian, on charges of
conspiracy to violate export control laws by attempting to ship
fiberoptic gyroscopes to China. Yao is being transported to Boston
after his arrest two weeks ago at a scientific conference in San
Diego. The Customs Service contends that the shipments, had they
succeeded, could have helped China improve the accuracy of their
missiles.)
</P>
<P>
   Other Clinton administration officials also addressed the issue
Tuesday. The White House press secretary Joseph Lockhart said that
President Clinton supported the energy secretary's decision to
dismiss the scientist.
</P>
<P>
   And Vice President Al Gore, asked in a CNN interview about
allegations that the administration had been lax in pursuing
security breaches at the weapons labs, said: ``That happened during
the previous administration. That happened back in the 1980s. And
as soon as the investigation identified targets of that
investigation, then the law enforcement community handled that very
aggressively, and it resulted in a presidential directive that
completely changed the security procedures in the weapons labs.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Intelligence Committee is negotiating with the
administration over how much information it can make public in
connection with its inquiry into Chinese contributions to the 1996
election campaign and the transfer of satellite technology to
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, has
suggested that the Senate might consider contempt charges against
administration officials if they do not cooperate sufficiently with
the committee. He did not specify the target of contempt charges or
explain his legal reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Lott told reporters Tuesday that he ``assumed a major portion''
of the House panel's report would be released.
</P>
<P>
   Without a compromise, there could be a constitutional clash
between Congress and the White House because both the
administration and the House have the power to declassify
information. Typically, the administration works out a compromise
in consultation with various agencies and Congress, the process now
under way.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In these cases, broad findings and conclusions are released, but
precise details are kept secret in order to protect
intelligence-gathering sources and methods or ongoing law
enforcement investigations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether the administration will even finish its
review before the panel's charter expires, according to an
administration official at one of the agencies being asked to
review the report.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the committee uncovered the evidence of Chinese theft
of American nuclear secrets. Democrats say they feared the
Republicans would disclose that evidence before the election. But
their fears proved unfounded. The committee filed its huge report
at the end of the year and went out of business.
</P>
<P>
   A week later the new Congress convened and gave the committee 90
more days to produce a declassified report in collaboration with
the administration.
</P>
<P>
   The review is being coordinated within the administration by the
President's National Security Council. NSC officials farmed out the
report to various agencies for a word by word review, but only
after the report was screened by the Justice Department to protect
ongoing law enforcement investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the NSC leading the fight with the other agencies
weighing in,'' said one House staff member. ``The Energy Department
is worried about the stuff at the labs. The intelligence community
is worried about disclosing their sources and methods. And the FBI
and the Justice Department are concerned about on-going criminal
investigations.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the White House released a redacted version of the
committee's recommendations but with little input from the
committee, members said.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Cox and the panel's ranking Democrat, Norman
Dicks, of Washington, sent a letter to President Clinton requesting
a meeting to discuss the report. The White House has not yet
replied to their letter.

QUIJANO ASSIGNED TO GALAXY'S PROJECT-40 LIST

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Major League Soccer assigned Rio Hondo College
standout Marvin Quijano to the Los Angeles Galaxy's Project-40 list
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Quijano, 19, scored 24 goals in 30 games for the Roadrunners
last season. The forward impressed Los Angeles coach Octavio
Zambrano during preseason training.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Galaxy is always interested in finding talented players
who can compete at the professional level,'' Zambrano said. ``The
Project-40 evaluation was designed to identify some of the top
young prospects in the region, and Marvin certainly is a top
prospect.''
</P>
<P>
   A native of El Salvador, Quijano joined the Galaxy in February
after participating in an invitation-only evaluation held at the
Rose Bowl. He has since appeared in five preseason games, scoring
two goals and notching an assist.
</P>
<P>
   Project-40 signees earn the minimum MLS salary and are awarded a
five-year academic package covering tuition by the United States
Soccer Federation.
</P>
<P>
   -- The Galaxy returned from Guadalajara on Sunday after running
its exhibition record to 7-0-2 with a 5-1 victory over Atlas of the
Mexican first division.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the Galaxy suffered its first loss of the season, 2-0,
in an exhibition against the U.S. national team at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked pretty good, actually,'' Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tight match throughout,'' Zambrano said. ``We hit the
post a couple of times. Overall, though, it was just a great test
for us because of their speed of play. We haven't been tested that
much during the preseason, so this game really helped our
preparation.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team is in Southern California preparing for the U.S.
Cup on Thursday (against Guatemala).
</P>
<P>
   -- The Galaxy plays at Cal State Fullerton tonight at 7:30.

FRENCH BANK SEEKS TO BUY 2 BIG RIVALS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Making an unexpected takeover bid that would create the
largest bank in the world, Banque Nationale de Paris SA offered $37
billion in stock on Tuesday night to acquire two of its biggest
French rivals, Societe Generale SA and Paribas SA, which just last
month had agreed to merge.
</P>
<P>
   The French stock market regulator said that Banque Nationale was
offering 15 of its shares for 7 Societe Generale shares, and 11 of
its shares for 8 Paribas shares, to form a banking group with more
than $1 trillion in assets. At that size, Banque Nationale de Paris
would eclipse UBS of Switzerland, now the world's largest bank.
</P>
<P>
   The regulator, the Conseil des Marches Financiers, said that
Banque Nationale would bid for all outstanding shares of both
banks, but that the offer would hinge on its ability to acquire at
least a majority of each bank's shares. It said nothing of possible
cost-cutting or savings if the takeover effort was successful.
</P>
<P>
   The bid would offer a premium of 14 percent over Societe
Generale's closing share price on Tuesday of 145.5 euros, or
$157.14, and a 24 percent premium over the Paribas share price of
85.95 euros.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale shareholder approval is required, the regulator
said, and trading in the stock of all three banks will be suspended
indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes little more than a month after Societe
Generale said it would pay about $18 billion in stock to acquire
Paribas, France's fifth-largest bank. That announcement contributed
to speculation about a possible new wave of mergers and takeovers
in France and across Europe. Also last month, Olivetti SpA, Italy's
No. 2 phone provider, announced a $60-billion hostile bid for the
largest Italian phone company, Telecom Italia.
</P>
<P>
   In Spain, Banco Santander moved in January to solidify its
position as that country's biggest bank by acquiring Banco Central
Hispano for $11.3 billion in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Societe Generale's announced move on Paribas, which would have
formed a group called SG Paribas, was intended to bring together
the two institutions' investment banking businesses and give
Paribas access to Societe Generale's 2,700 retail branches for its
consumer finance and asset management services.
</P>
<P>
   Investors were lukewarm toward that plan, reflecting the view
that such a merger would contribute little to bringing down their
costs, since Societe Generale and Paribas had few overlapping
activities.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of consolidation in France is unlikely to slacken.
Later this year, the Socialist Cabinet of Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin plans to sell its stake in Credit Lyonnais, the
government-owned bank that has lost billions. Lyonnais has sought
out as a future core shareholder Credit Agricole, which has the
largest branch network of any French bank.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Banque Nationale de Paris with Societe Generale
and Paribas would offer considerable room for consolidation and
cost reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Banque Nationale is moving from a position of relative strength.
Last week, it said that its net income in 1998 rose 23 percent, to
1.1 billion euros _ a little more than $1 billion _ as vigorous
French economic growth caused domestic banking income to soar.
Similarly, Societe Generale reported a 15 percent rise in 1998
earnings last month, to 1.07 billion euros, while Paribas reported
earnings largely unchanged from 1997 at 1 billion euros.

AG MAY SEEK LIFE SENTENCE IN TREASURY EMBEZZLEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KURKJIAN AND FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The two former treasury officials who were arrested in
recent weeks for allegedly stealing nearly $9 million in state
funds are facing indictment under a post-Revolutionary War statute
that carries a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources familiar with the investigation, Attorney
General Thomas F. Reilly intends to use the threat of the heavy
sentence to underline the seriousness of the crime and to persuade
the two to tell about other possible wrongdoing in the department.
</P>
<P>
   Absent the use of the 1791 statute, which prohibits embezzlement
from the state treasury by any treasury employee, the two would
likely be charged with embezzlement or larceny of over $50,000,
both of which carry a maximum sentence of five years.
</P>
<P>
   While it is improbable that a judge would impose the maximum
sentence upon conviction, the 1791 law would allow the imposition
of a far stiffer sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The sources said that the investigators believe that of the two
officials arrested, Robert E. Foley, one of the top five deputies
in the state treasurer's office under Joseph D. Malone, has more to
offer them than John F. Trischitta, who supervised the fund that
was allegedly looted for $8.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hold the cards,'' said one investigator. ``Foley is on the
hot seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Foley's lawyer, Gary L. Meyers, said Tuesday that he would move
to have any indictment based on the statute thrown out since he
believes it would be the first time _ at least in the past 100
years _ that the law was used to bring a case. Meyers would not say
whether Foley might be willing to cooperate with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Malone's top deputies, in charge of the treasury's
Cash Management Department, Foley was responsible for keeping track
of the flow of billions of dollars in state revenues. He was also
close to Malone politically, having raised money for Malone's
campaigns for treasurer and governor.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe reported last Friday that Malone had resisted the
entreaties of several co-workers and a top supervisor that Foley be
fired or at least transferred due to allegedly abusive behavior.
Malone instead asked that the employees work out the problem with
Foley.
</P>
<P>
   Malone was traveling Tuesday and could not be reached for
comment. On Saturday, Malone said during a radio interview that he
was not worried that Foley might implicate him in any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people look at the facts they will see the problems
stopping with Mr. Foley and his department,'' Malone said in the
interview on WRKO. ``I have full confidence that when this process
takes its course, no matter what anybody says to try to save their
skin, people will realize that this was a conspiracy between Mr.
Foley and one of his underlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go to bed feeling badly that this incident occurred, but by
no means do I think it will go up any higher,'' Malone said.
</P>
<P>
   Judith L. Lindahl of Boston, Trischitta's lawyer, declined
comment.
</P>
<P>
   Two others have also been arrested in the case, Thomas Ciliberto
of Woonsocket, R.I., and Martin Robbins of Peabody, Mass. According
to the charges, they represented themselves as ``heir finders who
were acting on behalf of individuals or firms who were owed money
from the state's Unpaid Check Fund. In fact, however, the two had
no such clients but acted in concert with Foley and Trischitta to
embezzle the money out of the Fund.''
</P>
<P>
   All four have pleaded innocent to the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have now turned to the formidable task of combing
through the thousands of transactions and documents involving the
Unpaid Check Fund over the last eight years, one source said
Tuesday. That source said Reilly's investigators expect to show far
more money was stolen from the fund by Foley, Trischitta, Robbins,
and Ciliberto but they do not expect others to be charged.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a long process,'' said an investigator. ``We
are recreating literally a thousand or more transactions and trying
to trace them.''
</P>
<P>
   It is uncertain when the indictments will be returned but some
involved in the cases say they could be issued by a Suffolk County
grand jury before the end of the month. The arrests were based on
criminal complaints sought by Reilly's office from Boston Municipal
Court. The four men are due back in municipal court on either March
25 or April 1 for status hearings on their individual cases.

RENO URGES PUTTING BRAKES ON BORDER PATROL BUILDUP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO, Texas _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Tuesday
urged Congress to slow the law enforcement buildup on the
U.S.-Mexico border, warning that a sizable influx of inexperienced
agents could undermine workforce standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Law enforcement experts indicate that it is risky to allow an
agency's overall ratio of inexperienced to experienced agents to
exceed 30 percent,'' Reno told a Senate subcommittee in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``As of July 1998,'' she told the appropriations subcommittee,
``the percentage of Border Patrol agents having two years of
experience or less was almost 39 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   While the Border Patrol has more than doubled to almost 9,000
since 1994 _ and continues to grow _ lawmakers are pressing for an
additional 1,000 agents for next year. The Clinton administration's
reluctance to meet that demand has unleashed a bipartisan attack on
the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is inexcusable for the administration to submit a
budget to Congress that does not include funding for additional
Border Patrol agents,'' U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, an El Paso,
Texas, Democrat and former Border Patrol chief, told a
congressional committee on immigration last month.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's caution comes during a tense time on the 2,000-mile
U.S-Mexico border, where violent incidents involving law
enforcement agents and illegal immigrants are occurring with what
appears to be increasing frequency.
</P>
<P>
   In February, a Border Patrol agent near Eagle Pass, Texas, shot
and wounded an illegal immigrant who threatened him with a gun. And
in January, an illegal immigrant who carried nothing more than a
water jug was shot in the back also near Eagle Pass by Wilbur
Honeycutt, a member of a DEA task force. The immigrant is paralyzed
from the waist down.
</P>
<P>
   Though that shooting did not involve the Border Patrol, critics
blame the incident on Honeycutt's inexperience. A former part-time
police officer in Bandera, Honeycutt came to Eagle Pass with little
border training and had been there for less than a year at the time
of the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Unfamiliarity with the border is also widely seen as having
played a role in the death of Esequiel Hernandez, a West Texas
teen-ager and U.S. citizen who was herding goats when he was
mistakenly shot by a Marine on an anti-narcotics operation in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno's go-slow approach was heavily criticized by Texas
lawmakers, who see the attorney general's caution as a virtual
surrender by the Clinton administration in the battle against
illegal immigration and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This administration has a horrendous record when it comes to
border security,'' said Allan Kay, a spokesman for Lamar Smith, a
San Antonio Republican who chairs the House immigration
subcommittee. ``They're not interested. They've never been
interested.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Reno told the Senate subcommittee, the Clinton
administration has since 1994 added nearly 2,000 immigration
inspectors and deployed ``field-tested effective technologies,'' in
addition to overseeing a 122 percent jump in Border Patrol agents.
She called the border buildup ``unprecedented.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fiscal year 2000 budget request continues this aggressive
effort,'' said Reno, ``but also reflects important management
considerations that can no longer be ignored.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno added, ``The high proportion of new agents makes it
necessary that they be allowed to integrate into the Border Patrol
corps to safeguard the highest standards of law enforcement
professionalism for this new workforce.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reyes told the immigration subcommittee that all five Texas
Border Patrol chiefs told a member of his staff they
``desperately'' need more agents. He said the administration's
rationale for the slow-down is flawed, and that in El Paso, for
example, only 14 percent of the agents have less than two years
experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder who makes those decisions,'' said Reyes. ``It
certainly isn't anyone that knows or understands Border Patrol
operations or requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Though unpopular among lawmakers, Reno's position was met with
some support among the local law enforcement community along the
border. Robert Serna, the district attorney for Maverick County,
which encompasses Eagle Pass, said safety should be the top concern
for illegal immigrants and locals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would agree with the attorney general,'' said Serna. ``You
need to make sure that when you fight a problem the fighting does
not become a problem in itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, immigration advocates applauded the administration's
push for a pause in the border buildup. They say sharp increases in
border enforcement threaten the rights of immigrants while doing
little to stop the seemingly inexorable flow.
</P>
<P>
   ``When officers are not well-trained it's a lot more dangerous
for everybody,'' said Benito Juarez, coordinator for the Houston
Immigration and Refugee Coalition.

BAKER WINS SECOND POLK AWARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Twenty journalists whose work documented corporate
deceit, political impropriety and ethnic bloodletting have been
chosen as recipients of the 1998 George Polk Awards, the awards'
sponsor announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the winners this year are two writers for The New York
Times. Russell Baker, who for 36 years wrote the ``Observer''
column in The Times, won the George Polk Career Award. It was
second Polk Award for Baker, who retired last year. He won the
prize for commentary in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Clifford J. Levy, the Albany, N.Y., bureau chief of The Times,
won the local reporting award for his exploration of political
fund-raising in the state government. His scrutiny of candidates'
donor lists exposed conflicts of interest and led to continuing
criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   This year is the 50th anniversary of the awards, which were
established in memory of George W. Polk, a CBS correspondent who
was killed in 1948 while covering the civil war in Greece. The
awards, which are administered by Long Island University, will be
presented on April 14 at the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Other winners this year included Alix M. Freedman of The Wall
Street Journal, who won the international reporting award for her
investigation of efforts to sterilize women in the Third World,
often without their consent.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, a columnist for The Daily News for more than two
decades, won the commentary award for his writings on New York's
poor and disenfranchised.
</P>
<P>
   The award for foreign reporting went to Tracy Wilkinson of The
Los Angeles Times, who wrote about the struggles between ethnic
Albanian separatists and Serb nationalists in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The other winners are:
</P>
<P>
   Economic Reporting _ Mary Jordan, Keith Richburg and Kevin
Sullivan of The Washington Post, for their eight-part series
illustrating the human toll of the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   National Reporting _ Donald L. Barlett and James B. Steele of
Time magazine for their series on wasteful government subsidies to
corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Book _ Philip Gourevitch, for his account of genocide in ``We
Wish to Inform You that Tomorrow We Will be Killed With Our
Families: Stories from Rwanda'' (Farrar, Straus &AMP; Giroux).
</P>
<P>
   Environmental Reporting _ Gardiner Harris and R.G. Dunlop of The
Louisville Courier-Journal for their investigation into how illegal
practices among coal mine operators lead to the death each year of
1,500 workers from black lung disease.
</P>
<P>
   Radio Reporting _ Amy Goodman and Jeremy Scahill, producers for
Pacifica Radio's ``Democracy Now'' series, for their documentary on
Chevron's role in the murder of two environmentalists in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   Television Reporting _ Brian Ross and Rhonda Schwartz of the ABC
News program ``20/20'' for a report on the labor practices of
American clothing manufacturers in Saipan, a U.S. territory where
sweatshop conditions persist.
</P>
<P>
   Medical Reporting _ Robert Whitaker and Dolores Kong of The
Boston Globe for their series on how mentally ill people are harmed
by federally financed drug trials.
</P>
<P>
   Legal Reporting _ Joe Stephens of The Kansas City Star for a
report that exposed widespread conflicts of interest among federal
judges.

A NEW SONY: THE WALKMAN GOES DIGITAL
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 BY STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sony Corp., one of Japan's truly global companies,
plans to do nothing less than reinvent itself, using a combination
of enduring strength in consumer electronics and emerging high
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In an extensive overhaul announced Tuesday, the company that
introduced the pocket-sized transistor radio, the Walkman tape
player and the Trinitron television screen showed that it wants the
next generation of consumers to know Sony as a leader in networking
_ enabling computers, television sets, pagers, cellular phones and
other electronics products to communicate with each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three years, we have made a lot of effort to move
from being a `box' company to becoming an information technology
company,'' Nobuyuki Idei, Sony's president, said in an interview.
``I think we've had a fair amount of success.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Sony's Vaio laptop computers are receiving high praise,
and an advanced computer chip it introduced last week as part of a
preview of the next-generation Playstation game machine is
generating lots of talk.
</P>
<P>
   The new strategy takes Sony into unexplored territory. Analysts
regard its semiconductor-manufacturing abilities as still unproven.
And Sony's move also puts it in intense competition with other
technology producers, all seeking ways to make their products more
profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Idei conceded that the plans, which will require significant
investment in research and development, could hurt earnings for a
while. ``Short-term profit and investment in networking _ frankly,
I cannot satisfy the two things at once,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Just the investment that Sony has made in developing the new
Playstation computer chip almost insures that it will not profit
from the new machine until well after its introduction, scheduled
sometime before March 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But Idei expressed confidence that the stock market would
recognize the steps announced Tuesday as enhancing the company's
long-term prospects. In fact, Sony's shares climbed almost 9
percent here, and Moody's Investor Service affirmed its Aa3 rating
on some of the company's unsecured debt, citing the latest
developments in its business.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Sony is also taking some more conventional steps to
improve its earnings. The company said it would reduce its staff by
10 percent, or 17,000 workers, over the next three years, and 15 of
its 70 manufacturing plants will be closed. Sony is already in the
process of closing two of its four plants in Malaysia, and Idei
said it would look for similar opportunities in Japan and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Sony is also bringing three publicly traded subsidiaries back
under its wing through a stock swap. Idei said that absorbing the
Sony Chemicals Corp. and Sony Precision Technology made sense
because the two really do little more than supply Sony with
products. He said the decision to fold Sony Music Entertainment
(Japan) back into the mother company made sense because
shareholders did not invest with the idea that it would commit
significant capital to develop computer chips.
</P>
<P>
   As joint owner with Sony of Sony Computer Entertainment, the
entity that developed the Playstation and the new chip for its
successor, the music company was venturing into operations far
afield of its core business. The consolidation will allow Sony to
better allocate capital and workers, Idei said.
</P>
<P>
   Sony contends that such steps, in combination with the new
strategy, will create significant value for stockholders, a reason
rarely offered by Japanese companies for making major shifts. Idei
noted that while Sony's annual revenue exceeded $50 billion, its
market capitalization ranges between $30 billion and $35 billion,
which he said was a sign it was undervalued. ``Take America Online,
for example,'' he said. ``AOL's revenues are a few percent of the
revenues of the Sony Corp., but its market value is probably two
times as much.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Idei said he thought that companies like America Online and
Yahoo had only scratched the surface of what the Internet
potentially offers businesses. ``They are really only content
aggregators or direct marketers,'' he said. ``There's an
opportunity for more complex services.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, there may be demand for a provider of services for
companies seeking to enter electronic commerce, or demand for a
seller of hardware that gives consumers access to online merchants.
</P>
<P>
   The one area of Sony's business unaffected by the new plan was
its American movie and music businesses. Idei said Sony had not yet
decided what to do with them.

ADVERTISING: NBC EXECUTES A NEW STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Becoming the first broadcast network to own a portion of a home
shopping channel, NBC announced Tuesday that it would make a
significant investment in the cable network Value Vision and link
it with the NBC network, the cable channels CNBC and MSNBC, and the
Web site MSNBC.com.
</P>
<P>
   With the move, NBC is positioning itself to deliver products
directly to viewers. The move speaks to NBC's strategy to move away
from the old network economic model, which has always generated
revenue only through advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from declining profits and the loss of viewers to
cable television, the major networks have set out in recent years
to create new revenue streams. NBC has invested heavily in cable
and the Internet and lately has used its broadcast network to
initiate sales of related products like videocassettes and compact
disks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal over time is to turn viewers into buyers and
customers,'' said Thomas Rogers, the president of NBC cable.
</P>
<P>
   The move is likely to mean even more effort to merchandise
products introduced by NBC programs, typified by last month's sales
of a music CD culled from a successful miniseries, ``The 60's.''
``We've made it clear,'' Rogers said, ``that figuring out ways to
drive sales of product through our broadcast platform is a key
ingredient we see in the overall mix as we figure out the
relationship between broadcast, cable and Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers announced that NBC had entered into a strategic alliance
with Value Vision and GE Equity, the equity arm of GE Capital, a
subsidiary of NBC's parent company, General Electric, that will
deliver a 15 percent stake to NBC and GE Equity in exchange for $44
million. (NBC and GE Equity will be able to expand their holdings
to 19.9 percent through warrants. That will increase the price to
$56 million.)
</P>
<P>
   NBC will then try to get Value Vision placed on more cable
systems. Value Vision is a third-tier home-shopping channel. The
two big channels, QVC, which is owned by Comcast, and the Home
Shopping Network, are in 67 million and 53 million homes,
respectively. Value Vision is seen in only 21 million homes, with
only 10.6 million on a full-time basis.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said NBC would be successful because of the leverage it
could bring to bear through its ownership of CNBC and MSNBC. NBC
could ask for distribution increases for Value Vision in exchange
for lowering the fees it charges the cable systems to carry CNBC
and MSNBC.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, Rogers said, is to ``re-brand Value Vision in
conjunction with an Internet portal.'' NBC owns a majority interest
in the portal SNAP, and Rogers said that while he was not ready to
announce a direct link between Value Vision and that portal, ``SNAP
will weigh very heavily in how we put this together.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Value Vision's small size, the chairman of the channel,
Gene McCaffrey, said the company had recorded 30 percent increases
in profits in the last two quarters and that it was projecting a 50
percent increase for the fourth quarter of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said the channel's size would make it easier to re-brand
into an Internet-related enterprise. He also said greater cable
distribution would be made easier by the fact that home shopping
channels, unlike entertainment channels, do not get subscriber fees
from cable operators. Instead they pay cable operators a portion of
the revenue they take in. That makes them much more attractive to
cable operators to add to their existing channel base, Rogers said.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is similar in some respects to the proposed venture put
together by the chairman of USA Networks Inc., Barry Diller, in
which he is seeking to link his Home Shopping Network cable channel
with Lycos, a popular Web portal. The new operation, to be called
the USA Lycos Interactive Networks, which is embroiled in a dispute
among Lycos shareholders, is designed to entertain, inform and sell
things to people online, on television and over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Summing up NBC's strategy in entering into the home shopping
business, Rogers said, ``We are going to be exploring the full
potential of creating e-commerce and Internet opportunities,
driving them off a cable platform.''

FLUOR TO CUT 5,000 JOBS AND REORGANIZE OPERATIONS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ The Fluor Corp., suffering from the Asian
economic crisis and its own bloated cost structure, said Tuesday
that it would cut 5,000 employees, reorganize its operations, and
narrow the range of construction projects it undertakes.
</P>
<P>
   Fluor, the nation's largest engineering and construction
company, said the moves were expected to reduce overhead costs by
$160 million annually but would require a $130 million pretax
charge against earnings in the current quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a cost structure that is unsustainable,'' Philip J.
Carroll, the company's chairman and chief executive, told
shareholders at the annual meeting here Tuesday. He said a
reorganization would have been needed even if business conditions
had been better.
</P>
<P>
   But those conditions continue to deteriorate. The company said
Tuesday that it expected only $6 billion in new construction orders
this year, about half the level of two years ago and less than the
$8 billion it had previously been forecasting for this year.
</P>
<P>
   Fluor said it expected to record net income this fiscal year of
$107 million, or $1.42 a share, after the restructuring charge.
That is less than half the $235 million, or $2.97 a diluted share,
it earned last year on revenues of $13.5 billion. Even excluding
the charge, which amounts to $1.23 a share, expected earnings of
$2.65 a share are below the $2.99 or so that analysts have been
estimating.
</P>
<P>
   Fluor shares closed Tuesday at $34.3125, down $1.75. The shares,
which have traded as high as $52.50 in the last year, are near
their 12-month low of $33.25.
</P>
<P>
   The construction industry has been buffeted by the Asian
financial crisis, which derailed many large projects. The Asian
crisis also helped precipitate a decline in oil prices, slowing
capital spending by oil companies, which are prime Fluor customers.
Fluor's A.T. Massey coal production subsidiary, meanwhile, has been
hurt by weak domestic steel production caused in part by an influx
of cheaper steel from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,000 job cuts amount to about 9 percent of the nearly
57,000 employees the company had at the end of last fiscal year.
The cuts are coming mainly from salaried employees in the
engineering and construction division, and constitute nearly 20
percent of that group. Some 1,000 of the cuts will be in
staff-support positions, which constitute overhead, and 4,000 will
be of people working directly on construction projects. The company
will also close 15 of its roughly 75 offices.
</P>
<P>
   The reorganization bears the stamp of Carroll, who came to Fluor
as chief executive last July after serving as the president of the
Shell Oil Co., the American arm of the Royal/Dutch Shell Group.
Carroll, 61, who had reached Shell's retirement age of 60, replaced
Lester G. McCraw, who resigned as Fluor's chief executive at the
end of 1997 after being diagnosed with bladder cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Under McCraw, Fluor, which is based in Irvine, south of Los
Angeles, expanded into many different types of construction in an
effort to boost its revenues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would have poured your driveway if you wanted us to,''
James O. Rollans, the chief financial officer, said.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the new business was not profitable. Carroll, aiming
to double construction profit margins within five years, said Fluor
would now focus on sectors in which it had a strong expertise and
could command better profits, such as in petrochemicals and mining.
It will phase out construction of office buildings, paper mills and
other low-margin activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The company will also reorganize into four units, each with
profit-and-loss responsibility. They are Fluor Daniel, the
construction division; A.T. Massey, the coal producer; Fluor Global
Services, which combines businesses such as equipment leasing and
temporary staffing that the company sees as fast growing; and
Shared Services, which will sell computing and administrative
services to the other divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Alan L. Boeckmann was promoted to head the construction
division, which accounted for the bulk of revenues and about 40
percent of profits last year. That puts him in contention to
succeed Carroll, who is expected to stay for several more years.
Another contender is John Hopkins, who was named Tuesday to head a
new global business development, sales and marketing group.
</P>
<P>
   Fluor bucked the recent corporate trend of divesting noncore
businesses by deciding to keep the coal division, which
historically has been a strong performer. Carroll said there was
some synergy between coal and construction, but that Fluor would
continue to evaluate whether selling the coal business made sense.
</P>
<P>
   One person close to the company said Fluor believed Massey,
still financially strong, would be able to acquire some weaker
rivals during the current hard times. That would make it more
valuable if it were spun off in future years.

GANNETT'S USA TODAY NAMES NEW EDITOR
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Fla., N.C., Mich.)  (nk) 
 BY SHARON R. KING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a largely unexpected move, Karen Jurgensen, editor of the
editorial page of USA Today, has been named editor of the
publication, the nation's largest newspaper, the paper announced
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   She will replace David Mazzarella, 60, who is retiring. Ms.
Jurgensen, 50, will be replaced by Brian Gallagher, deputy editor
of the editorial page.
</P>
<P>
   The changes will be effective on May 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``USA Today has experienced both significant improvement and
growth under David Mazzarella, and we are grateful for his
contributions,'' said Thomas Curley, the paper's president and
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ms. Jurgensen said that Mazzarella's retirement had
been expected, newspaper industry executives differed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not expected,'' said Bob Giles, executive director of
the Media Studies Center and senior vice president of the Freedom
Forum, a journalism foundation. ``People who are fairly close
watchers of USA Today were fairly surprised,'' said Giles, a former
editor of The Detroit News, which, like USA Today, is owned by the
Gannett Co.
</P>
<P>
   However, the management change is not expected to lead to
widespread changes in the newspaper's direction or coverage, Giles
and others said.
</P>
<P>
   Mazzarella headed USA Today's international operations before
becoming editor in 1994. He joined Gannett in 1976 as international
editor for the Gannett News Service after working for The
Associated Press and as editor of The Rome Daily American. He will
continue as a senior vice president for strategic projects until
his retirement, expected at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Jurgensen joined USA Today in 1982. She became editor of the
editorial page in 1991 after two years as senior editor/days. She
had previously been life section editor, managing editor for cover
articles and senior editor for special projects. As the special
projects editor, she established the newspaper's data base analysis
group and was responsible for polling.
</P>
<P>
   She began her career in 1972 in Charlotte, N.C., and later
worked at The Miami News. USA Today is the nation's top-selling
newspaper, with an average daily circulation of 2.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Since its inception in 1982, when it was dubbed McPaper, ``the
newspaper's reputation has changed dramatically,'' said Rem Rieder,
editor and senior vice president of the American Journalism Review
in College Park, Md. He said that for a long time it was known for
being colorful, but was not regarded as a serious newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The paper is now respected for its coverage of breaking news and
special reports and is considered one of Gannett's largest profit
centers. Executives are considering expanding space for news
coverage and working to attract more women readers. &QL;

EAPPEN TISSUE SAMPLE CAUSES FUROR

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Microscopic brain tissue from eight-month-old Matthew
Eappen was turned over by defense lawyers for Louise Woodward to a
freelance journalist whose report formed the basis for Sunday
night's ``60 Minutes'' broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The journalist, Katie Leishman, gave the sample to Dr. Floyd
Gilles, a California specialist in neuropathology, who after
analyzing it along with other evidence concluded that Matthew died
of strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Leishman's lengthy story of the new findings was rejected for
publication by the New York Times Sunday Magazine, she said
Tuesday, but she was hired by ``60 Minutes'' as a co-producer of
the controversial segment.
</P>
<P>
   The revelation that Leishman was given slides of brain tissue
samples incensed friends of the Eappens, who said it raised
questions about the independence of the research, and was
criticized by medical ethicists Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, there's got to be some kind of ethical limitations to
what a defense attorney can do with evidence they get in a criminal
trial,'' said Matthew McCue, a friend of the Eappens. ``To take a
piece of their child and give it away to a reporter to support
their cause is unconscionable and it's sleazy.''
</P>
<P>
   However, underscoring the murkiness of the issue, even Middlesex
District Attorney Martha Coakley, one of the prosecutors in the
case, said she too would have made the sample available for
investigation by ``somebody we trusted to look at it.''
</P>
<P>
   As debate swirled, the ``60 Minutes'' team vigorously defended
the independence of their report Tuesday and rejected any
suggestions that, in the words of producer Walt Bogdanich, they
were ``stalking horses for the defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilles' theory that the baby could have been strangled up to 48
hours before he died was backed by a colleague, Dr. Marvin Nelson,
who was paid a fee by the defense team as a prospective witness in
1997 but did not testify in Woodward's murder trial. Their theory
conflicted with a jury's verdict that Woodward killed Matthew
Eappen in February 1997 by violently shaking him and slamming his
head against a hard object. Woodward's second-degree murder
conviction was reduced to manslaughter by Judge Hiller B. Zobel,
and she was allowed to return to her home in England.
</P>
<P>
   Now, armed with the ``60 Minutes'' report, defense lawyers have
called for a new probe into Eappen's death. But prosecutors say
there is no new evidence to warrant reopening the case.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Globe has learned that scores of physicians are
preparing an open letter refuting the strangulation theory put
forward on Sunday night's program.
</P>
<P>
   Reached Tuesday evening in the offices of ``60 Minutes,''
Leishman defended her role in providing the brain sample to Gilles
as necessary to fully evaluate the case. She said she sought the
sample from the defense after Coakley told her both sides had
identical samples. ``It was evidence in the case,'' she said,
adding: ``I got a box in the mail. I transported it without opening
it to Dr. Gilles.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is unclear on who owns pathological specimens, but it
has emerged as a ``big time ethical issue,'' according to George J.
Annas, a professor of health law at Boston University's School of
Public Health.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body part and the family has a right to have that
treated with respect,'' Annas said. ``I think it can be kept for
reasonable scientific purposes, but can't be shipped around the
country.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and experts who are given custody of pathological
evidence during a trial don't own the material and should be
required to return it to the medical examiner when the case is
over, Annas said.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team's payment to Nelson was not mentioned in the
``60 Minutes'' broadcast. However, the program did note that
Nelson, the chief of radiology at Children's Hospital in Los
Angeles, had been contacted by the defense team, but had not
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Reporter Mike Wallace Tuesday maintained that the small fee paid
to Nelson by the defense team in 1997 _ which Bogdanich said was
$300 _ did not color Nelson's judgment. As for mentioning the fee
on the broadcast, Wallace said ``it was discussed and felt to be
unnecessary'' because viewers understand that ``when the defense
calls an expert witness, the expert witness gets paid.''
</P>
<P>
   Leishman said the other doctor, Gilles, ``had absolutely no
connection to the defense team.'' Neither Gilles nor Nelson could
be reached Tuesday, but they defended their conclusions at a news
conference in California on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Elaine Whitfield-Sharp, a former member of the Woodward
defense team, said she paid Nelson $700 in September 1997 for
examining CT scans of Matthew. She said he concluded that Matthew
died of an old injury.
</P>
<P>
   Whitfield Sharp also says that she met both Nelson and Gilles in
Feb. 1998 and provided them with a variety of evidence from the
Woodward case. She said she consulted more than 35 medical experts
about the cause of Matthew's death and none of them, including
Gilles or Nelson, suggested he died of strangulation.
</P>
<P>
   Leishman said she has no connection with the defense team or any
other entity involved in the Woodward case. ``I have not been paid
one penny except by `60 Minutes,' '' she said. ``I did this on my
own steam.'' Bogdanich noted that the program sought evidence and
input from both the prosecution and defense teams, and reiterated
that the suggestion of Gilles to analyze the case came from a
prosecution witness. Moreover, he noted, the story concluded that
``the defense and the prosecution got it wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Leishman, while watching the Woodward trial in late
1997, she was struck by ``the polarization of experts.'' So she
undertook her own research.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jan Leestma, associate medical director of the Chicago
Institute of Neurosurgery and Neuropathology, who testified for the
defense at Woodward's trial, said he turned over the microscopic
samples of Matthew's brain tissue to Leishman at a defense lawyer's
request.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, the case was over, but since I'd been retained by the
firm, I didn't want to make trouble or difficulty,'' said Leestma.
``They said there was no reason (not to give Leishman the
samples.)''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Andrew Good, who represents Woodward, said, ``We'd
called for an independent, not associated with either side,
investigation. That can't be done without the scientist in question
looking at the tissue in the case. We provided it to the doctors
through her. There's absolutely nothing wrong with doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   But several observers were troubled by the fact that tissue had
been handed over for a media report.
</P>
<P>
   McCue, the Eappen friend, said the Eappens didn't watch the ``60
Minutes'' broadcast, but were devastated to learn that doctors were
now suggesting that their son was strangled up to two days before
he died. He said they were also unaware that microscopic samples of
Matthew's brain tissue had been provided to the doctors who came up
with this new theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're in the middle of a criminal trial, defense
attorneys are given access to all evidence and privacy rights are
waived in favor of the rights of the defendant,'' McCue said. ``But
it's different when you give that evidence to a reporter without
the consent of a parent. That's disgusting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is part of Matthew that they're just mailing out. It's
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was inappropriate,'' said the Eappens' lawyer,
Fredric Ellis. ``The defense obtained these samples for use in a
criminal case, and that's why I believe it's inappropriate for them
to forward it on to a media source. The law's not clear on this. As
far as I can tell it's an area that hasn't really been addressed,
but it's clearly a disturbing practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Before going to ``60 Minutes'' last summer, Leishman had
submitted a 75-page story outlining her findings to the New York
Times magazine. The magazine rejected the story, according to
Leishman, because it was ``too medical and technical.'' A
spokeswoman for Adam Moss, editor of the New York Times magazine,
said ``We do not comment on why we reject stories.''
</P>
<P>
   On another disputed matter, ``60 Minutes'' spokesman Kevin
Tedesco Tuesday said the program has a tape and a transcript that
confirms it did not take out of context a quote from Dr. Eli
Newberger of Children's Hospital, in which Newberger appeared to
say that the strangulation theory was ``potentially valid.'' A
spokesman for Newberger said the doctor stands by his assertion
that the quote used was in response to a different question.

   BC-OBIT-KUBRICK-NYT (moved on Sunday, Mar. 7)
</P>
<P>
   The obituary of Stanley Kubrick sent by the New York Times News

<P>
   BEIJING _ Song Pengfei passes his days in a spare 12- by 12-foot
room moving from a bed with a red-checked blanket, to a chair, to a
donated computer. His parents, their lives crammed into the
adjacent sitting room, spend their days worrying.
</P>
<P>
   Shy to begin with, the soft-spoken 17-year-old says his energy
and spirits are just ``so-so.'' He fainted recently on a street
nearby and lay on the ground until an elderly stranger rescued him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I almost never go out,'' he said longingly. ``I read. I listen
to music. I go on the Internet to learn about AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Song Pengfei is one of a small but growing number of Chinese
infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS _ in a country that
is largely unprepared emotionally, financially and medically to
deal with them.
</P>
<P>
   Since he became infected in February 1998 after a blood
transfusion at a hospital near his poor rural hometown, he has been
kicked out of a school that was afraid to teach him and from
hospitals that refused to treat him. A thin, angular young man who
looks like he stepped out of a Modigliani painting, he has endured
the same biting discrimination that Ryan White encountered in rural
Indiana when he was forced to leave his school in the early 1980s _
with much the same beatific stoicism.
</P>
<P>
   But there is a crucial difference: The Song family knows that
half a world away, American doctors now routinely prescribe an
expensive regimen of pills that can help their son. In fact,
Pengfei is one of a handful of Chinese who have tried the ``AIDS
cocktail,'' with dramatic results. And now, the Songs are
desperately trying to force the hospital that gave him tainted
blood or the government to pay for the pills _ a gargantuan task in
a country where the public health system is in tatters, few have
health insurance, and there are few legal remedies for medical
malpractice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't want to expose this _ and I'm attached to the
country, the Party, the people,'' said Song Xishan, Pengfei's
father, an unemployed factory worker who wears a mask of depression
as he tensely casts spent cigarette butts on to the floor. ``But we
are at a critical juncture _ the medicine we have is about to run
out _ and I have to think about my child.''
</P>
<P>
   China's HIV problem is still relatively small _ only an
estimated 300,000 people have the virus in the entire population of
1.3 billion, according to the Ministry of Health, and most are not
sick. About 9 percent, including Pengfei, contracted the disease
from unscreened blood transfusions; a great majority are
intravenous drug users, according to Dr. Cao Yunzhen, an
American-trained expert at the National Center of AIDS Prevention
and Control.
</P>
<P>
   But despite recent prevention efforts, the numbers are rising
quickly. Meanwhile, HIV specialists are still rare, and
discrimination and public ignorance widespread.
</P>
<P>
   The Songs' apartment in Beijing is a relentlessly glum place
where hours pass without a glimmer of a smile. Pillows are made
from old clothes found by the roadside. The rent and meals are
donated by neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   It all began with a minor accident in their rural hometown in
Shanxi province, when Pengfei threw himself down on a couch to
watch television and gashed his thigh on a pair of scissors his
father had left there.
</P>
<P>
   A local doctor gave Pengfei a shot of penicillin and eight
stitches. But 12 days later the area was still swollen, so the
Songs went to a hospital in the nearby city of Linfen; doctors
there said the boy needed minor surgery to clean out the gash.
</P>
<P>
   But first, the surgeon advised, Song should go buy blood, since
Pengfei was mildly anemic and would need a transfusion before the
operation. Instead of using the city blood bank _ which the doctor
said carried ``outdated blood'' _ he offered to introduce the Songs
to a so-called blood boss, a middleman who would find a villager to
donate.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, China outlawed such blood sales, which have long
been a common source of both blood and income in rural communities.
Official blood banks are supposed to screen blood for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of Feb. 18, 1998, Song gave the blood boss $40
and Pengfei received 300 cubic centimeters of blood drawn from a
husky 19-year-old surnamed Qi. When Pengfei's simple surgery that
afternoon unexpectedly resulted in near-fatal bleeding, the doctor
instructed Song to buy another liter.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Although Pengfei survived _ Song believes the surgeon cut an
artery _ the doctors told the Songs to rush Pengfei by overnight
train to Beijing to consult specialists. The family was much
relieved when experts wielding sophisticated diagnostic equipment
at a military hospital in the capital declared their son would be
fine, Song said.
</P>
<P>
   But a few days later, when orderlies did not take Pengfei to an
important test and doctors failed to report lab results, the family
suspected a problem. And just two weeks later, the doctors abruptly
announced that Pengfei would have to be moved to an infectious
disease hospital; his blood tests had revealed hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Song protested: Why should his son leave the hospital that could
best treat his leg when hepatitis is so commonplace in China? Only
then did the doctors pull him aside. Within two weeks of his
transfusion _ a short time but not unusually so _ Pengfei had
tested positive for HIV.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard of it,'' said Song. ``I knew that it was a
terrible disease that made you thinner and thinner until you became
a skeleton.''
</P>
<P>
   From that moment on, the family's life has been defined by a mad
scramble for money and by massive rejection _ by officials,
friends, colleagues, even doctors and nurses. It started the next
day, when Pengfei was sent to the outpatient department of the
infectious disease hospital for a specialized blood test. When he
returned, the nurses refused to give him a bed in the ward.
Penniless, the Songs slept in the corridor.
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, Pengfei was admitted to Beijing's Ditan
Hospital, home to one of China's few specialized HIV programs,
where the Songs quickly exhausted their savings on tests and
treatments. And although Pengfei's leg was healing nicely, his
energy and appetite were succumbing to the virus. Dr. Xu Keyi, an
infectious disease specialist who had trained in the United States,
suggested they try the American medicines _ if the family could
raise $16,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unthinkable sum for the couple, more than most Chinese
earn in a lifetime. By April, the family, out of money, returned to
Linfen, where Song hoped that he could press officials to clarify
how his son had gotten HIV and then get the local health bureau to
help pay for Pengfei's medicines.
</P>
<P>
   Their homecoming was a nightmare. Local doctors descended on the
family home to examine Pengfei wearing masks, gowns and gloves.
When they left, they dropped the protective gear in a pile outside
the front door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right away the villagers knew about Pengfei's problem,''
recalled Song.
</P>
<P>
   The school where Pengfei had studied computers and English
refused to let him re-enroll. Hospital nurses would not give him
infusions. The Songs found an old friend, a doctor, to do it. But
when he had to leave town briefly and asked his wife, a nurse, to
fill in, she ran out of the house screaming when she learned the
boy had HIV.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers sent petitions to the local government demanding
that the family be expelled, and the Songs knew it was time to move
on.
</P>
<P>
   But by that time Song had made some progress: The local public
security bureau disclosed that the blood donor, now in prison for
theft, had tested positive for HIV. With prodding from a lawyer,
the local hospital agreed to give the family $12,500 for drugs and
$2,500 to start a new life in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, Pengfei started taking the powerful anti-HIV
medications and within a month his viral load, a measurement of
virus levels in his bloodstream, had dropped from 400,000 to 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was wonderful,'' Song said. ``He was eating, he had energy,
he would walk around.''
</P>
<P>
   They moved into a two-room apartment in southeastern Beijing,
supported at first by the Shanxi provincial government and, when
that money dried up, by donations. A spate of stories in the
Chinese press produced a few gifts, including the computer for
Pengfei.
</P>
<P>
   But it is a hand-to-mouth existence for the Songs, who are
officially rural residents and therefore cannot readily work in
Beijing. And doctors at Ditan Hospital have advised the family that
they will need to raise more than $20,000 within the coming months
to continue Pengfei's treatment after May 5.
</P>
<P>
   Song spends his days tirelessly lobbying for justice and money.
A little black book meticulously documents how on Feb. 1, for
example, he wrote to China's Health Minister, Communist Party
leader Jiang Zemin, and Li Ruihuan of the Communist Party Standing
Committee. He has gotten no responses.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Linfen say they cannot afford that kind of cash _
more than the annual budget of small hospital in China. But with
the case gaining attention from Chinese reporters, a delegation
from Linfen is in Beijing this week negotiating some compensation.
The officials have advised the Songs to take Pengfei back home for
treatment, where it would be less costly. But the Songs scoff at
returning to a place that so viciously rejected them.
</P>
<P>
   As Pengfei watches his supply of pills dwindle, a curtain of
gloom descends on the apartment. Said his father: ``He has become
so depressed worrying about his medicine.''

WASHINGTON MEETING ADDRESSES ALLEGED `RACIAL PROFILING' IN N.J. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A two-year-old federal investigation into
allegations of racial discrimination by the New Jersey State Police
proceeded slowly in its early stages because the police lagged in
forwarding requested information to Washington, a top Justice
Department official told a group of New Jersey lawmakers and black
ministers Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department acknowledged last month that it had been
conducting a civil rights investigation since 1996 into charges
that New Jersey state troopers routinely stopped black and Hispanic
drivers on state highways solely because of their skin color, a
tactic commonly known as racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   In a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Deputy Attorney
General Eric Holder told the ministers, members of Congress and
state legislators that information and documents requested from the
state police trickled in slowly to investigators during the first
14 or 15 months of the inquiry, several people in the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   For reasons he could not explain, the flow of information
improved markedly around March 1998, Holder told the group, people
in the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
   Holder did not accuse the state police of trying to delay or
obstruct the federal investigation. But several people who attended
the meeting did just that afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looked like stonewalling to me,'' said Rep. Robert Andrews,
a Democrat from Haddon Heights. ``The people responsible for this
ought to be asked back in Trenton why the delay.''
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Black Ministers Council and the Black and Latino
Legislative Caucus who attended the session said Tuesday's meeting
made them wonder whether the state police had tried to alter
documents before sending them to the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure the information they got isn't tainted,'' said
state Sen. Wayne Bryant, a Democrat from Camden. ``When you take a
long while to document information, we often wonder, did you sit
down and cook the books?''
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the New Jersey Department of Law and Public Safety
and the State Police Department denied that there had been any
delays in forwarding information to the Justice Department or any
effort to doctor documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``The New Jersey State Police have fully cooperated with the
Justice Department probe since the requests for information started
in 1996,'' said John Hagerty, director of communications for the
department. ``And we will continue to work closely with Justice
Department investigators as they move forward with their review.''
</P>
<P>
   State police officials and Gov. Christie Whitman have contended
that there is no widespread practice of racial profiling by state
troopers. But late last month, Whitman fired the state police
superintendent, Col. Carl Williams, after he suggested in a
newspaper interview that black and Hispanic people were more likely
than members of other racial or ethnic groups to be involved with
marijuana and cocaine traffic.
</P>
<P>
   People in the meeting said Holder told them that he expected the
Justice Department to reach some preliminary decisions about the
investigation in the next few months. If the Justice Department's
civil rights division finds evidence of discriminatory practices,
it can file a federal lawsuit and ask a judge to order the state
police to make changes.
</P>
<P>
   In brief comments to reporters after the meeting, Holder
defended the pace of the investigation, saying: ``We want to make
sure we are being fair to both sides. We go into these things with
an open mind. We don't presume there is in fact a problem. These
things take a long time. It takes a lot of data.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Attorney General Janet Reno said during
testimony before a Senate appropriations subcommittee that the
department considered the New Jersey racial profiling investigation
``one of our highest priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting on Capitol Hill, Holder, a New Jersey native
who is black, told the group a personal story about having his
trunk searched for guns by the state police when he was a college
student.
</P>
<P>
   According to people in the meeting, Holder said he wore his hair
in an Afro at the time and was driving from Howard University in
Washington to visit relatives in Atlantic City. He indicated to the
group that the experience had given him added sensitivity to
complaints about racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was made to feel, as he described it, very uncomfortable
with the incident, and understands only too well what a humiliating
situation it is,'' said Sen. Frank Lautenberg, D-N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Holder declined to elaborate about the incident, other than to
say, ``I didn't think I was doing anything wrong at the time.''

SPORTS COLUMN: MARCH INSANITY, SAD FACTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   March Madness is a catchy, alliterative phrase designed to draw
attention _ pecuniary preferably _ to the National Collegiate
Athletic Association's Division I men's basketball tournament,
which begins Thursday at eight sites around the country. I don't
recall it being called March Madness until a handful of years ago
when it became a big-time attraction on television, having swelled
from a dozen or so teams to 64, a tournament big enough to choke a
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the madness _ which is actually pretty sane for the TV
network, the organizers and the schools, since they stand to make
millions of dollars from it _ is demonstrated by the TV cameras
focusing on some of the brilliant students in the crowd who look as
if they've had buckets of paint, in two and three colors, spilled
on their heads. Added madness is the brassy bands in the arena
playing loud enough to be heard in the next county.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the basketball itself, invariably a wonderful
show. The Cinderella teams, the buzzer beaters, the Clash of
Titans, etc. But for all this, there is a level of suspended
disbelief that is necessary to these nutsy pleasures. Some of the
suspension is that all of these basketball players are also true
students, struggling with their calculus and Economic History of
Mesopotamia, and cramming on a paragraph or two during a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   The sad fact is that college basketball players have lower
graduation rates than most students. And the black basketball
players fare worse than the white basketball players.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest annual survey by the NCAA, compiled last November,
male basketball players continued to graduate at rates far lower
than other students. ``For the eighth consecutive year,'' wrote The
Chronicle of Higher Education, ``the rate of Division I male
basketball players was far below the rate for all male students at
those institutions, which in 1997 was 53 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   The association found that only 41 percent of men's basketball
players who entered college in 1991 had graduated within six years,
down from 45 percent the year before and the second-poorest showing
since the association began its graduation-rate survey.
</P>
<P>
   White male basketball players graduated at a rate of 47 percent
_ their lowest total in the NCAA graduation-rate survey _ compared
with the overall graduation rate for white male students of 56
percent, down by 11 percent from the year before. The graduation
rate of black male players fell from 39 percent in 1996 to 37
percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Emerge, a black-oriented magazine, has a ``Bottom 50'' listing
that names the 50 worst Division I schools in regard to graduation
rates for both African-Americans and whites. And several of this
year's glorious March Madness schools are on it, including James
Madison, Ohio State, Syracuse and Cincinnati, all of whom have
graduated no black players for at least the past five years. And
while the first three of these schools had graduated 67 percent of
the white players, Cincinnati was an equal-opportunity school in
having graduated no white players, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statistics aren't good, and it's a dilemma,'' said Kenneth
A. (Buzz) Shaw, the chancellor of Syracuse University and chairman
of an NCAA group that is studying basketball issues at Division I
colleges. ``We're working on it, and hope to help improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a related issue, a federal District Court in Philadelphia on
Monday discarded the NCAA's minimum test score requirements for
athletic scholarships, saying it ``has an unjustified disparate
impact against African-Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaw said that tests have to be important _ the problem is how
much weight to give them, in relation to high school grades,
classroom competition, courses taken.
</P>
<P>
   What's most important, from this viewpoint, is motivation for
schooling. Too many players want the NBA rather than an MBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, some guys get the idea they only have to
concentrate on basketball because they don't feel a degree will
lead to fame and riches,'' said Steve Milburn, director of academic
services for athletics at Louisville.
</P>
<P>
   And it is a cruel fallacy that only sports scholarships will
lead some out of mean circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Federal and state grants and aids are available to virtually
all high school graduates based on need, regardless of class
standing and admissible to community colleges and beyond,'' Shaw
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, here comes March Madness, that annual assault on the
senses, where for some three weeks, we gaily suspend disbelief, and
then return to sober reality.

DODGERS TO HAVE SEASON OF SHARING?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VIERA, Fla. _ If the Los Angeles Dodgers move their spring
training site to Arizona they may be forced to spend their first
season sharing a ballpark with, of all teams, the San Francisco
Giants.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are contemplating a move from Dodgertown after 51
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is the stadium may not be ready for next spring
training,'' Dodgers director of business development Fred Coons
said.
</P>
<P>
   Coons said an option would be to play spring training home games
at another team's complex, something commonly done in the Cactus
League. The Seattle Mariners and San Diego Padres share a site in
Peoria and the Arizona Diamondbacks and Chicago White Sox split a
complex in Tucson.
</P>
<P>
   While Coons declined to comment on which team would share a
stadium with the Dodgers, a source said the choice was the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the time frame, the proposed $30 million project in
the Scottsdale area would have to be completed in two phases: the
practice fields and construction of the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would practice at Fort McDowell but take the 15- to
20-minute trip to Scottsdale Stadium for games.
</P>
<P>
   Discussions are ongoing between the Dodgers and the Fort
McDowell Indian Community. The Dodgers, who own Dodgertown, are
also talking with Indian River County (Fla.) and the city of Vero
Beach about selling the complex to them and leasing it back.
</P>
<P>
   Young's MRI negative: The MRI done on second baseman Eric
Young's back was negative, but not without incident. Young went to
have the MRI done Monday and was halfway finished when he was told
the clinic was closing and that he would have to come back Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Young has been slowed by back stiffness the past week, but has
resumed hitting and fielding grounders. Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said that barring a setback, Young might play for the first
time Sunday against the St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   A moment of thanks: Before the Dodgers' game against the Florida
Marlins at Space Coast Stadium, left fielder Gary Sheffield was
keeping an eye out for Marlins owner John Henry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to say `Thank you for keeping the team in South
Florida and giving the people there a team to watch,''' said
Sheffield, who was born in Tampa. ``I'm just happy he kept it
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Balks, walks and chalk: Outfielder Jacob Brumfield, who played
in the majors for six seasons, was signed by the Dodgers to a
minor-league contract Monday and played against the Marlins. The
34-year-old spent last season with the Marlins' Triple-A affiliate
in Charlotte.... Four days after joining the minor-league camp,
former Chicago Cubs catcher Rick Wilkins was the starter against
the Marlins and went 0 for 2.... Right-hander Dave Mlicki, fighting
for a spot in the rotation, had his second strong outing. He gave
up one run on three hits in four innings. ``I started throwing the
slider a little bit, which felt pretty good,'' Mlicki said....
Shortstop Jose Vizcaino was walking with a pronounced limp after
getting hit with a ball thrown by Roberto Mejia, but he said he
would be ready to play Thursday.

NISSAN PLANNING TO PAY OFF DEBTS OF SUBSIDIARY 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ Eager to resolve a sticking point in merger
negotiations with DaimlerChrysler AG, the Nissan Motor Co. plans to
announce on Wednesday that it is paying off debts at a troubled
subsidiary, people close to Nissan said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan wants to reach a deal soon because credit rating agencies
have been threatening to lower its rating. Nissan already has the
lowest possible investment-grade rating from Standard &AMP; Poor's. A
further lowering, to junk bond status, would hurt Nissan's ability
to raise money it needs for development of new car models and other
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan, the world's sixth-largest automaker, had been trying for
nearly a year to sell its 39.8 percent stake in the Nissan Diesel
Motor Co., one of the world's largest makers of diesel engines, to
DaimlerChrysler. Those negotiations have included the possibility
that DaimlerChrysler, the world's fifth-largest automaker, might
take a stake in Nissan itself.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as mid-February, DaimlerChrysler's leaders were
saying that no agreement was likely with Nissan for three or four
months. But Robert J. Eaton, DaimlerChrysler's co-chairman, told
The Associated Press at the Geneva International Motor Show Tuesday
that the German-American automaker will likely decide before the
end of this month whether to take a stake in Nissan.
</P>
<P>
   A persistent problem in all of these negotiations has been the
debt of another Nissan subsidiary, Nissan Diesel Sales, in which
Nissan and Nissan Diesel each own 50 percent stakes. Under Japan's
accounting practices, neither Nissan nor Nissan Diesel has had to
include the debts on their balance sheets because neither company
actually controls Nissan Diesel Sales. But this tangle of debt has
complicated negotiations with DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   To remove this obstacle, Nissan and Nissan Diesel will announce
on Wednesday that they will each put 20 billion yen, or about $167
million, into Nissan Diesel Sales; the combined sum of 40 billion
yen in cash will cover most of Nissan Diesel Sales' debts, people
close to Nissan said, adding that they thought that this would make
a sale imminent, at least for Nissan Diesel.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler declined to comment this evening on Nissan's
plan.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler officials have generally been reluctant to move
quickly, trying instead to drive a hard bargain while letting
Nissan's problems worsen. Juergen Schrempp, DaimlerChrysler's
co-chairman, said last month in Chicago that it could take three or
four months to complete a transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The 40 billion yen is a tiny sum compared with Nissan's total
debts, estimated at $20 billion to $35 billion. Many financial
analysts had expressed surprise that any automaker would be
interested in such a heavily indebted partner.

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ A macaw with scarlet and violet plumes soars
across the cover of a book called ``The Story of Colors,'' inviting
children to read a folk tale about Mexican gods who took a gray
world and filled it with brilliant hues.
</P>
<P>
   There are a few surprises, though, in this eye-catching
bilingual children's book just published by a small publisher in El
Paso, Texas, which won a grant from the National Endowment for the
Arts.
</P>
<P>
   Its author is Subcomandante Marcos, the political mastermind and
military strategist of the Zapatista guerrillas of southern Mexico.
On the inside flap, he appears in a photo with a black ski mask
hiding his face and bullet-laden ammunition belts slung across his
chest.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, the chairman of the Endowment, William J. Ivey _ who
is working to rebuild the agency after its recent reprieve from a
death sentence issued by congressional Republicans _ abruptly
canceled the grant for the book. Ivey overruled a multilayered,
year-long grant approval process, acting within hours after the
book was brought to his attention by a reporter's phone call.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was worried that some of the Endowment's funds might
find their way to the Zapatista rebels, who led an armed uprising
in 1994 against the government of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey's decision stunned the Cinco Puntos Press, a shoestring
operation that had laid out $15,000 to print 5,000 copies of the
book, half of which was to be paid by the Endowment grant. The
agency canceled grant funds of about $7,500, which was to have paid
for about half of the printing cost. The books are ready to be
distributed and carry the Endowment's logo on the last page,
together with an acknowledgment of ``generous support'' from the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is spineless,'' said Bobby Byrd, a poet and editor of
books on border issues who runs the publishing company with his
wife and daughter from their home in El Paso. ``This book is
essentially about diversity and tolerance, everything the NEA is
supposed to stand for, and they just don't have the courage to
publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Story of Colors'' reflects a literary, sometimes whimsical
side that has distinguished Subcomandante Marcos, the only
non-Indian among the Zapatistas' highest leaders, from other steely
Latin American guerrilla commanders. (His real name is Rafael
Sebastian Guillen Vicente, and he is a former university graphics
professor.)
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Byrd said he had made clear in his grant proposal that no
part of the grant would go to the author, Subcomandante Marcos,
because the guerrilla leader had declared that he did not believe
in copyright and had formally waived his rights in talks with the
Mexican press. Mr. Byrd said the Guadalajara press would be paid a
small amount for the artwork.
</P>
<P>
   In the text the masked rebel leader describes himself as
lighting up his pipe, one of his hallmarks, and sitting down on a
jungle pathway to hear a tale from an Indian elder named Antonio.
The old man recounts how mythical gods grew bored with the universe
when it was tinted only in grey, and went about inventing colors
one by one. In the end they pin all the colors on the tail feathers
of the macaw.
</P>
<P>
   The bird ``goes strutting about just in case men and women
forget how many colors there are and how many ways of thinking, and
that the world will be happy if all the colors and ways of thinking
have their place,'' the text concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The illustrations are bright, broad-stroked paintings of gods
with horns and bug-eyes done by Domitila Dominguez, a Mexican
Indian artist.
</P>
<P>
   Spun in the sensuous tradition of Latin storytelling, the tale
includes elements that might be controversial in the mainstream
American children's book market. As the story opens, the text
reads, ``The men and women were sleeping or they were making love,
which is a nice way to become tired and then go to sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   The double-page illustration shows a reclining naked woman in a
sexual embrace with figure that appears to be a male god.
</P>
<P>
   There are no references to the Zapatistas' cause or their
military tactics, but in a cover blurb, Amy Ray, a member of the
Indigo Girls, a Grammy-winning American song duo, says, ``This
beautiful book reminds us that the Zapatista movement is one of
dignity that emanates from the grassroots of the indigenous people
of Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing is that it is a beautiful book,''
said Byrd, whose press specializes in bilingual children's books.
``A lot of our stories in the United States have been cleaned up
with a politically correct sentiment, and so much detail has been
washed away.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I can imagine how someone would rewrite this for an
Anglo audience,'' referring to non-Hispanic Americans. ``There
wouldn't be anybody smoking or making love.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The Story of Colors'' was originally published in Spanish in
1997 by a press in Guadalajara, Mexico called Colectivo Callejero,
which supports the Zapatistas' cause.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd said that he provided a copy of the original to the
Endowment when he applied for the grant to translate it in March
1998. His first request, for $30,000 to translate a total of five
books, passed two levels of review at the agency but the funds were
cut back to $15,000. Byrd said he conferred repeatedly with
literature experts at the Endowment when he chose to leave ``The
Story of Colors'' in a revised grant request he presented to
translate only two books.
</P>
<P>
   Cinco Puntos Press (the name means Five Points in Spanish)
received a written notice in February that the funds had been
approved. The only step left was for the agency to send the money.
</P>
<P>
   Ivey, the Endowment chairman, said that he was not concerned
about the book's contents and had not seen the finished printed
book. When he went over the grant records Monday night, he said, he
became worried about rights payments, which the El Paso press had
contracted to make to the publishing group in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an uncertainty about the ultimate destination of
some part of the funds,'' Ivey said. ``I am very aware about
disbursing taxpayer dollars for Americans' cultural life, and it
became clear to me as chairman that this just wasn't right for the
agency. It was an inappropriate use of government funds.''
</P>
<P>
   An Endowment official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity,
said that it is very unusual for the chairman to step in at the
last moment to override the work of several review committees,
including the 26-member National Council on the Arts, which
includes six federal lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   When Republicans gained control of the Congress in 1995, they
were frustrated with the Endowment's support for art works they
regarded as offensive and vowed to eliminate the agency. But the
House moderated its views under election year pressures and voted
overwhelmingly in July 1998 to keep the agency alive.

CLINTON A STEP CLOSER TO GETTING EMERGENCY FUNDS FOR CENTRAL
AMERICA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras _ President Clinton inched closer Tuesday
to securing emergency aid for Central America as he toured the
region devastated by Hurricane Mitch, warmly praising U.S. military
personnel for their rescue and recovery efforts, and promising
closer ties with democracies in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton outlined plans for expanding, at least temporarily, the
U.S. military role in helping with reconstruction of the region's
schools, highways and bridges, and in providing medical aid for
thousands who were left homeless and without safe drinking water
after the storm.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the president acknowledged the need to revise
U.S. immigration laws, but he stopped short of committing to any
changes that would allow more emigres from the economically
troubled region.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be a mistake to openly encourage more people
to come (to the United States) in violation of the laws and
established quotas,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Clinton said, the United States will work with the
governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua to
rebuild their economies to be capable of providing jobs so
residents of the impoverished region would not feel their only hope
is to migrate northward.
</P>
<P>
   Toward that end Clinton is wrestling with Congress over an aid
package worth more than $950 million for the four countries hardest
hit by the hurricane. The package also would postpone for two years
the $600 million in annual interest payments made by Honduras and
Nicaragua, which between them owe $9.9 billion to the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate bill, the president has asked Congress to
temporarily lift trade barriers for nations in Central America and
the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Republican congressional leaders said they were
committed to approving the aid package, which also has money for
U.S. farmers. The major disagreement with the White House is where
the money comes from. Clinton wants to use part of the anticipated
budget surplus. Republicans want to offset the costs with cut in
other programs, such as food stamps and environmental initiatives
favored by the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that the suffering (in Central America) is great and
Congress will make every effort to pass (an aid bill) as soon as
possible,'' Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, chairman of the House
Republican Conference, said Tuesday in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate Appropriations Committee already has approved $977
million in relief aid and House Appropriations Committee Chairman
C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., said his committee would likely complete
work on a similar aid package Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Once the two bills are merged in conference, the full Senate and
House are expected to vote on them by March 26 when Congress begins
a two-week Easter recess.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting with community leaders in Tegucigalpa, Honduras,
Clinton said he wants ``to be sure political considerations in the
United States that have nothing to do with Central America, things
back home, don't hold up consideration'' of the aid package and
free-trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Joe Lockhart called the devastation seen
during the first half of the president's four-day, four-country
tour a ``textbook case for emergency spending.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think we should pit one program against another
program when we have a clear emergency here,'' Lockhart told
reporters. ``We need to get the money freed up and we need to get
it down here where it can be used.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said Congress is insisting on control of the funding, so
that disbursements are made directly to organizations and companies
involved in rebuilding the nations' infrastructure and economy.
Under guidelines set by the House and Senate, the funds would be
administered by the State Department and the U.S. Agency for
International Development.
</P>
<P>
   Young said President Clinton had wanted, in effect, to ``take
the cash'' with him (on his trip) and ``hand it out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make this very clear,'' he said. ``We are not
sending cash to these countries. We have more of an obligation to
the American taxpayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Tuesday, at Honduras' Sato Cano Air Base, Clinton lauded
the hurricane rescue and relief efforts of the 500 Air Force and
Army personnel assigned to the facility, and outlined plans for
expanding their involvement in reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   The pilots and soldiers, whose primary mission is drug
interdiction, are credited with rescuing 1,052 people, including
Honduran President Carlos Roberto Flores Facusse and his wife,
Mary, from rising water when the remnants of Mitch dumped heavy
rain during a five-day period.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the real test came, (you) passed with flying colors,''
Clinton told the troops gathered in a hangar normally used to
shelter Black Hawk helicopters. ``To all who were a part of it, I
thank you for your courage, your confidence, your compassion.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said National Guard and military reservists, who each
year spend two weeks in intensive training, will rotate through
Sato Cano over the next year. Officials said the part-timers would
help dig new high-capacity wells, reconstruct flood-damaged
highways and bridges, build schools and libraries, and provide
medical assistance to more than 70,000 Central Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The hurricane, considered the worst natural disaster to hit the
Americas, and the flooding came at a time when countries in the
region were wrestling with political and social changes following
decades of civil wars, border conflicts and military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Through the 1980s, the U.S. invested billions in military and
economic aid to prevent a communist takeover of the region. U.S.
spending in the region has dropped sharply, with some countries
receiving less than a fourth of previous levels, which makes Japan
and the European Union the biggest financial boosters of the
region.
</P>
<P>
   Reconstruction ``threatens to direct efforts away from further
consolidation of democracy,'' said Peter F. Romero, acting
assistant secretary of state for the western hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Resources that could be used ... to reform judicial systems,,
to build transparent financial sectors, or to ensure equal
opportunity for all, now must meet basic needs.''

GORE TO UNVEIL NEW REGULATIONS AS PART OF AIRLINE PASSENGER RIGHTS
PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Airlines that sell tickets for travel on another
carrier will have to tell passengers in advance the name of the
other airline, under a new Transportation Department regulation
that Vice President Al Gore plans to announce on Wednesday as part
of a ``passenger rights'' package.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule means that when an airline books a passenger on a
commuter line flying under a brand name like United Express or
Delta Connection, the passenger will be told the name of the
smaller airline actually flying the plane. This will let passengers
know that the planes they board are not flown by the companies from
which they bought the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The rule will take effect in 120 days, along with another rule
that will require airlines to tell passengers if a single
``flight'' includes a change of planes at an intermediate stop.
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also announce that the Department of Transportation
will increase the size of the office that handles customer
complaints, Clinton administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The office now has 15 people, and for most of the roughly 9,600
complaints they receive each year, they do little more than
categorize them, analyze them and discuss the trends with the
airlines, said an administration official involved in the new
proposal, who called the office ``pitifully small.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore will also announce that the administration is proposing its
own legislation, with provisions intended to help consumers to
comparison shop among airlines based on their fares and on their
policies for compensating travelers for flight cancellations and
delays, bumping, lost baggage and similar problems. The airlines
would be required to report their policies to the Transportation
Department, which would then post them on the Internet, according
to the proposal.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the administration's proposals overlap two popular
bipartisan bills already introduced. One is sponsored by Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz, chairman of the Commerce Committee, and Sen. Ron
Wyden, D-Ore., who is active on airline issues. The other is
sponsored by Rep. Bud Schuster, R-Pa., chairman of the House
Transportation Committee, and Rep. John D. Dingell, D-Mich.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain-Wyden bill, for example, would make the airlines
disclose how many seats are available for passengers to buy with
frequent flier miles. The administration bill would require the
airlines to disclose, for each of their 500 most popular flights,
how many seats they had sold for frequent flier miles.
</P>
<P>
   Another provision in the administration bill would require the
airlines to hold reservations for 48 hours, allowing a consumer to
price-shop. Currently, airline reservation agents often advise
callers that unless they buy the ticket immediately, the fare is
not guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The administration is also putting before Congress a few
proposals that the Transportation Department could enforce without
legislation, under existing authority. For example, the
administration bill will propose doubling the minimum required
payment per passenger for lost baggage, to $2,500 from $1,250, and
doubling the payment to passengers for ``bumping,'' or denying a
seat to a passenger who has a reservation and shows up at the
appointed hour. The current payments for bumping on domestic
flights are $200 for delays of one to two hours, and $400 for
delays of more than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, airlines often avoid bumping passengers by
soliciting volunteers to give up seats, and the main effect of
raising the limits would be to make the airlines more generous when
they solicit such volunteers, aviation experts say.

CONNECTICUT CHIEFS ASSAIL PLAN TO RECORD RACE OF DRIVERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also NJ-POLICE) 
(mk) 
 By MIKE ALLEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ The Connecticut State Police and police chiefs
from across the state on Tuesday attacked a senior legislator's
plan to require officers to record the race of every motorist they
pull over, saying that questioning drivers could inflame racial
tensions.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Alvin Penn, the co-chairman of the Public Safety
Committee, asserting that black drivers face a much greater chance
than white drivers of being stopped for routine violations, said he
wanted to inhibit the use of racial profiling by police.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal by Penn, a Democrat from Bridgeport, state
troopers and local officers would record 10 facts about every stop,
whether or not a ticket was issued, including the driver's race or
ethnicity, approximate age, and whether or not English was the
driver's primary language. The bill directs that the information be
collected for two years and then analyzed for ``the prevalence of
discriminatory and race-based traffic stops.''
</P>
<P>
   Henry Lee, who as the commissioner of public safety is head of
the state police, said the requirement ``could cause problematic
situations for all law enforcement personnel.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Asking personal information about their ethnic backgrounds or
if English is their primary language can be very insulting,'' he
said in a written statement presented during a committee hearing.
``This may be considered intrusive and offensive to the public and
will not help our public relations issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Lee added that he does not object to the bill's purpose. ``We
believe that racial profiling is clearly illegal, and we will not
condone any practice that has that effect,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying Tuesday, two officials of the Connecticut Police
Chiefs Association sparred testily at times with Penn over his
proposal. ``If you really think that we're a bunch of liars and
bigots out there, why have us collect the stats?'' asked Chief
James Strillacci of the West Hartford Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Strillacci also said the questions could inflame an otherwise
tame encounter. ``A good cop doesn't care about color, unless it's
whether the light is red, yellow or green,'' he said. And Chief
Anthony Salvatore of the Cromwell Police Department said the
measure might deter officers from making routine stops, which is
how police often find people who are wanted for serious crimes.
</P>
<P>
   But Penn, who is black, told the chiefs, who are white, that in
most cases, the race of the driver could be determined visually.
And he said the data on traffic stops were needed in order to
convince ``gentlemen such as yourselves'' that there is a problem
with race-based policing.
</P>
<P>
   Penn said that although he is willing to negotiate the
specifics, he plans to bring the measure to a vote in the next
several weeks. After the hearing, he responded to the argument that
the project would be racially divisive by saying, ``They divide
America already when they pull over people of color and have them
lay out on the sidewalks.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Not long after leaving the community center where she
worked with battered women, a 26-year-old graduate student from
Kansas who had come to New York to become a social worker was
killed Monday night when she was stabbed in the back while walking
home, the police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The victim, Amy Watkins, was attacked less than two blocks from
her apartment in Brooklyn, the police said. Residents of the
neighborhood's brownstones, accustomed to placid evenings in the
quiet residential area, told investigators of hearing two screams,
the first as if in fear, the second in agony.
</P>
<P>
   The police found Ms. Watkins with a kitchen knife in her back,
her body surrounded by fallen groceries. She was taken to a
hospital and pronounced dead an hour after being found.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Ms. Watkins was found with no purse or
identification, leading them to believe that robbery was the
motive. The police said that there were no witnesses to the attack,
and that they did not have a suspect.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins' slaying stunned her friends, her professors at the
Hunter College Graduate School of Social Work in Manhattan and her
colleagues at New Settlement Apartments in the Bronx, where she
worked in the community center three days a week, counseling
battered women and working with children.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Ms. Watkins had organized a community meeting
of parents to discuss poor reading scores at a local elementary
school. Last Oct. 29, she organized a candlelight vigil of 200
women in protest of domestic abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is anything we can learn from this, we can use this
to live our lives every day, very fully,'' said Adam Green, 26, who
had dated Ms. Watkins for four months and also worked at New
Settlement. ``She did. She was doing exactly what she wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday night, Green said he and Ms. Watkins had taken the
subway from the Bronx after the community meeting. Green had dinner
plans with his parents in Manhattan, but Ms. Watkins declined an
invitation to join them.
</P>
<P>
   Disembarking in Brooklyn, Ms. Watkins bought groceries and began
walking home when she was attacked, the police said. Investigators
believe that Ms. Watkins attempted to fight off her assailant, and
residents of the brownstones told of horrible screams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't sound human,'' said one man, who spoke on the
condition of anonymity. ``I thought a cat had gotten run over. I
looked out my window and I didn't see anything, but then someone
rang my doorbell and told us there was a girl lying in the street
with a knife in her back.''
</P>
<P>
   In September, Ms. Watkins had moved to Prospect Heights, which
like so many other Brooklyn neighborhoods has rapidly gentrified in
recent years. But in its brutality and apparent randomness, Ms.
Watkins' slaying is the kind of homicide that has become an
increasing rarity at a time when crime has fallen to historic lows.
</P>
<P>
   Police statistics from the 77th Precinct show that there were
seven homicides in the precinct last year, compared with 34 in
1997, a drop of 79 percent. The only previous homicide this year
was the stabbing death of a 21-year-old man who lived in a public
housing project. There has been no arrest in that attack, but the
police said the two killings did not appear to be related.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always considered the neighborhood safe, so this really
hits home,'' said Calvin Bellerand, who lives next door to Ms.
Watkins' apartment.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Born in Illinois and raised in Topeka, Kan., Ms. Watkins
graduated from the University of Kansas in Lawrence in 1996 with a
degree in social work. While attending the university, she
volunteered at the largest women's shelter in Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Watkins' friend, Abbie Bassin, 26, said they met in Kansas
and spent a college summer volunteering in the Israeli Army. The
pair also traveled to to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey, Ms. Bassin said.
</P>
<P>
   After her graduation, Ms. Watkins worked outside Boston
counseling mentally ill people. She moved to New York to after
being accepted by Hunter College.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a vitality, an incandescent quality about her,'' said
Michael Fabricant, a professor of research and policy at the
school. ``She was very alive, a passionate human being.''
</P>
<P>
   Megan Nolan, her supervisor at New Settlement, said Ms. Watkins
worked most often with a group of battered women, supervising a
weekly Wednesday meeting. Recently, the group had been planning to
paint a mural on a nearby building depicting positive images of
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll still do it,'' said Jack Doyle, the director of New
Settlement. ``In one way or another, it will memorialize Amy.''
</P>
<P>
   Classmates at Hunter gathered Tuesday in Fabricant's office,
mourning Ms. Watkins' death and discussing the possibility of
creating a second mural at the school in her honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She saw the development of the mural as a way for the women to
get to know each other, and for her to get to know them,''
Fabricant said. ``But she was concerned that the mural not be the
beginning and ending of the relationships.''

12 ARRESTED DURING SIT-IN TO PROTEST DIALLO KILLING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A dozen people protesting the killing of Amadou
Diallo were arrested Tuesday after staging a sit-in in front of
Police Headquarters, and organizers vowed to continue with daily
acts of civil disobedience until the police officers involved in
the shooting are arrested.
</P>
<P>
   A group of protesters broke off from a demonstration of about 50
people in front of One Police Plaza shortly after noon, sat down in
front of the building's revolving doors and chanted ``No justice,
no peace!'' After they were warned that they faced arrest if they
did not move, they were placed in plastic handcuffs and led away
one by one.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Al Sharpton led the rally but was not arrested. He
noted that he was arrested at another rally last week and said that
he hoped to have different people arrested each day to prove to the
world that ``it's not just the same people getting arrested every
day.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day, five to 12 people will come to Police Plaza and
nonviolently submit to an arrest to protest the lack of action on
the police who murdered Amadou Diallo,'' he said. ``Why do civil
disobedience? Because we want the world to see this city is willing
to arrest nonviolent protesters but not willing to arrest police
that would shoot an unarmed man 41 times.''
</P>
<P>
   A Bronx grand jury is still hearing evidence about the Feb. 4
shooting; it is charged with deciding whether the four police
officers involved should be charged with a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a youth rally against police brutality, the Diallo
shooting and the Police Department's plan to begin using new
ammunition is scheduled to be held in City Hall Park. The rally,
billed as a ``hip-hop generation march against hollow-point bullets
and police brutality,'' has been advertised extensively on the
radio and in fliers distributed around the city that have exhorted
students to attend the rally instead of school.
</P>
<P>
   But a police officer who spoke on the condition of anonymity
said that he and a number of other officers across the city had
been placed on a special assignment and ordered to look for truants
Wednesday. ``A lot of these kids, if they decide to go, will never
get over the bridge,'' the officer said. Marilyn Mode, a Police
Department spokeswoman, said that the department has no special
anti-truancy efforts planned for Wednesday. ``Our truancy patrols
will be the same as they always are,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Norman Siegel, the executive director of the New York Civil
Liberties Union, said that he would be disturbed if the police made
an effort to keep young people from attending a rally against
police brutality. ``When the Yankees have a celebration, not only
do they not put truancy patrols on the street, but the mayor
encourages people not to go to school,'' he said.

AMTRAK UNVEILS HIGH-SPEED TRAIN TO RUN IN NORTHEAST CORRIDOR

 By THOMAS J. LUECK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Aiming to bring high-speed rail service to Boston by
the start of the new millennium, Amtrak said Tuesday that it would
start rolling out the first of its new 150 mile-an-hour trains by
December.
</P>
<P>
   The new high-speed rail line intends to change commuting habits
along the Northeast corridor from Washington to Boston by competing
head on with air shuttles and interstate highways. But more
important for Amtrak, the high-speed train provides a model for its
rail service across the nation, and is the centerpiece of its hopes
of economic redemption after operating for three decades with
government subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today we are kicking off the revitalization of train service
in America,'' Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, who is the
chairman of Amtrak's board, said at a Manhattan news conference. He
described the new Northeast corridor trains, comparable to the
bullet trains of France and Japan, as the first installment of
high-speed rail service in this country, with his corner of the
Midwest coming next.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are giving notice to our competitors,'' said George D.
Warrington, the president of Amtrak, the National Railroad
Passenger Corp., addressing the more mundane, unresolved question
of whether trains _ even those making the New York-to-Washington
run in two and a half hours _ can compete with discount regional
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   With a phalanx of brand-name politicians on the rostrum _
including the former governors Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts
and Linwood Holton of Virginia, both board members _ the conference
provided a more rounded but still incomplete picture of the
railroad's long-awaited high-speed service.
</P>
<P>
   Central to its plan, Warrington said, are trains that speed from
Pennsylvania Station in Manhattan to South Station in Boston in
three hours, cutting 1 hour and 40 minutes off the time of the
trip.
</P>
<P>
   With new, electrified engines pulling rebuilt Amtrak cars, the
three-hour schedule has been made possible by extensive track work
and electrification from New Haven to Boston, a project that cost
$1.6 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The trains will also be used along the line to Union Station in
Washington, beginning some time before mid-2000. With the new
trains, the trip from Manhattan to Washington will take a half-hour
shorter than the current three-hour trip of Amtrak's Metroliner
express train, which went into service in 1969 after track upgrades
and has a top speed of 125 miles an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Just as critical as their speed, according to transportation
analysts, will be the cost of riding the new trains. The
announcement comes only weeks after several discount regional
airlines disclosed plans to enter the hotly competitive New York
regional market, prompting widespread predictions of lower air
fares, if not an airline price war.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Amtrak refused to say what they would charge for
the high-speed rail trip. Compared with the current differential
between air shuttle and train tickets _ about 40 percent between
New York and Washington, where the Metroliner charges $119 and
full-fare air shuttles cost just under $200 _ Warrington said
high-speed trains would offer a smaller discount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will still have a more attractive fare'' than competing air
shuttles to Washington and Boston from New York, he said. But where
the savings is now closer to 40 percent, he said riders on the
high-speed trains could expect to pay about 30 percent less than
for airline tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak's ticket pricing for high-speed trains could be crucial
to its success. Its executives said Tuesday that it planned to
retain slower, lower-priced service that has always held an appeal
with more budget-conscious travelers or those traveling between
smaller cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market they have to go after is the business traveler who
at the moment wouldn't consider Amtrak unless he is just somebody
who doesn't like to fly,'' said Jeffrey Zupan, a transportation
analyst for the Regional Plan Association in New York.
</P>
<P>
   To attract more riders, Amtrak said it would schedule more
trains along the length of its Northeast corridor, with the biggest
service expansion between Boston and New York City. While declining
to provide detailed schedules, it said it would begin offering 17
round-trip trains between the two cities sometime next year,
compared with nine round trips currently. It declined to say how
many would be high-speed versions making the projected three-hour
run.
</P>
<P>
   Another question left unanswered Tuesday was how many stops the
high-speed trains would make, another complex equation for Amtrak
planners, since every stop increases travel time for those on
board.
</P>
<P>
   Preliminary plans by Amtrak that were released yesterday call
for stops of its high-speed express service in Boston, Providence,
R.I., New Haven, Conn., New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington. But executives of the railroad said it had not been
determined how such heavily used rail hubs as Route 128 outside
Boston, New London and Stamford, Conn., and Trenton would figure
into their plan for high-speed service.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Obviously, not every train is going to stop at every station,
and we are going to have to look at what makes most sense in
consideration of speed and convenience,'' said Barbara J.
Richardson, Amtrak's executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   With such questions remaining until sometime later this year,
Amtrak officials sought Tuesday to emphasize several improvements
in comfort and service that are planned for the new trains, largely
aimed at to business travelers in an era of cellular phones, laptop
computers and increased demands for executive productivity, even on
the road.
</P>
<P>
   Among them, Warrington said, will be electrical outlets next to
every train seat that enable travelers to plug in their laptop
computers. Video monitors in each train's cafe car will provide
news updates, while audio plugs will be provided with headsets for
each rider, with pre-recorded music.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak plans to name the trains Acela (pronounced uh-SELL-uh),
which is a made-up name, not an acronym.

 DiMAGGIO BUILT A LEGEND, THEN TOOK CARE NEVER TO STEP ON IT 
 (rk) 
 By BLAINE HARDEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As Allen Johnson tells it, he was 12 years old and
making his first trip to Yankee Stadium, when he saw Joe DiMaggio
glide silkily under a fly ball in center field. Johnson, who is
black and lives in Harlem, said he could never forget DiMaggio
because his father kept telling him that here was a white man who
combined hustle with absolute cool.
</P>
<P>
   Part of this memory, the chronological part, cannot possibly be
true.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who works in an Au Bon Pain restaurant in midtown, is
now 51 years old. Years before he attended his first game in the
Bronx, DiMaggio had retired and moved back to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   But the essential part _ the mesmerizing allure of a man
committed to craft and to self-restraint _ remains rock-solid true,
so that today Johnson tells his son that if he wants to imitate a
sports hero, forget self-glorifying, motor-mouth superstars and be
calmly superb like DiMaggio.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every step in his life, DiMaggio was what New Yorkers
wanted in a hero,'' said Richard Ben Cramer, who is writing a
biography of the Yankee great, who retired in 1951 and died on
Monday at the age of 84.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the tidal wave of print and electronic remembrance that
was unleashed by DiMaggio's death there lies a remarkable case
study in image management, New York-style.
</P>
<P>
   Students of his career say that DiMaggio, the son of an
immigrant fisherman, had a nearly flawless instinct for dressing
himself up in myths that wowed New Yorkers. He did it the same way
he caught fly balls, without apparent effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anticipation is the heart of both games,'' Cramer said.
``DiMaggio was never a rube. He was very smart and very urban.
Coming out of the Great Depression, he was the immigrant boy who
made it big. Coming back from World War II, he had all the wealth
and power that New York aspired to. When New York saw itself as the
center of the world, he was its paragon of class.''
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio survives his long-ago career, the vagaries of memory
and even his mortality because, in the nearly five decades of his
denouement, he took care not to step on his legend.
</P>
<P>
   ``He polished his image as a player and then guarded it as the
years went along,'' said Roger Angell, the baseball writer for The
New Yorker, who as a boy did see DiMaggio play in Yankee Stadium.
``He wouldn't talk to the writers. You really couldn't get near
him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When he did the TV commercials,'' he continued, referring to
advertisements for Coffee and Bowery Bank, ``they were gravely
done. He did not suffer from overexposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Cramer, who angled for years to talk to DiMaggio for his
biography, finally did get to him. But even then, DiMaggio was much
too shrewd to give away the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was no help. Don't get any ideas,'' Cramer said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a fairy tale mirror, DiMaggio's carefully tended image
encouraged generations of New Yorkers to glimpse what seemed like a
nobler version of themselves and of how they might play the game,
any game.
</P>
<P>
   DiMaggio's enduring legacy _ prideful and self-possessed
excellence _ meshed seamlessly with the temper of New York during
the dominant Yankee years of the 1930s, '40s and '50s. The baseball
club won World Series after World Series as the city dominated the
nation in culture, wealth and high-toned razzle-dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   ``He arrived in 1936 at the moment of the great Yankee years,
and he personified the Yankees and the city more than any other
player,'' Angell said. ``Babe Ruth was himself, but DiMaggio was
the Yankees. The way he played was not exuberant. He did everything
in a restrained and deadly way. He was authoritative in a way that
New York was authoritative. That is when we all thought of
ourselves as very much the center of things.''
</P>
<P>
   During the 13 years that he played for the Yankees, DiMaggio had
an uncanny knack of plugging into the imaginative and emotional
life of New York by standing apart from it, according to Angell. He
took his cool, almost clinically detached, style of baseball with
him as he became a player on the Broadway scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a private public life in a way that would be very
difficult today,'' Angell said. ``He hung out with Broadway people
in Broadway restaurants, but they respected his privacy. He was not
gossiped about and he was not quoted. It was strange. You couldn't
get near him. He had friends.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he moved away after retirement, first to California and
then to the home in Florida where he died, DiMaggio always kept his
hand in the New York image game. He made the commercials, he paid
royal visits to Yankee Stadium (always few enough to be special
events) and he resisted all blandishments to emote about his failed
marriage to Marilyn Monroe.
</P>
<P>
   The end result of this calculated pursuit of privacy amid almost
deafening acclaim was what many people on the streets of New York
described this week as an ``aura.'' It transcended sport, weathered
the long years of retirement and still had enough stroke this week
to move New Yorkers to tears.
</P>
<P>
   John Cortez, 72, who supervises the umpiring staff for a fall
baseball league in Park Slope, Brooklyn, got a choked-up call on
Monday as news spread that the great DiMaggio was gone.
</P>
<P>
   ``My son, who is 42 years old, called up crying when he heard
about it, and he never saw Joe play,'' Cortez said.

 By CONSTANCE L. HAYS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Burdened by debt and the persistent threat of
lawsuits over smoking, RJR Nabisco announced Tuesday that it was
splitting its food and tobacco businesses and selling its foreign
tobacco company to a Japanese buyer.
</P>
<P>
   The moves will effectively remove RJR Nabisco from the tobacco
business, while the money from the sale will reduce its debt. The
actions will also unravel one of the biggest mergers and most
fought-over leveraged buyouts of the 1980s, a battle that became a
symbol of the decade's excesses.
</P>
<P>
   The original merger between R.J. Reynolds and Nabisco in 1985
was intended to enhance the tobacco company's increasingly negative
image. Then in 1988, eager to raise the company's share price, RJR
Nabisco's management announced a plan to buy all the shares held by
outside investors for $17 billion. That move attracted other
would-be owners, including the Kohlberg Kravis Roberts investment
firm, which ultimately bid the price up to $30 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal was financed at high interest rates, leaving a mountain
of debt. The battle for the company and the huge fees it generated
for investment bankers inspired a best seller, ``Barbarians at the
Gate,'' which became a television movie. In early 1991, Kohlberg
Kravis sold stock in the company back to the public.
</P>
<P>
   With the changes announced Tuesday, Steven F. Goldstone, the
chairman and chief executive of RJR Nabisco, acknowledged that
mixing the maker of Oreos and Nilla Wafers with the maker of
Winston cigarettes had not worked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason for these businesses to be under the same
roof,'' he said. ``They are very different enterprises, with
different problems, different challenges and different investor
groups.''
</P>
<P>
   People should have ``the opportunity to choose whether they want
to invest in a tobacco company or a food company,'' he added,
acknowledging the ``tobacco taint'' that many analysts say has
hampered the stock performances of Philip Morris and RJR Nabisco.
</P>
<P>
   Domestic tobacco will become a separate company, which will be
responsible for any smoking-related claims in the United States.
The holding company will continue to own the food business and
could be liable for claims if the domestic tobacco company goes
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The international tobacco division, perennially smaller and
weaker than its rivals, is being sold to Japan Tobacco, which is
controlled by the government, for $8 billion, considered a hefty
price by even the most optimistic stock analysts.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts are intended to bolster what has been a chronically
depressed stock price. An investment in RJR Nabisco in late March
1991 would have shown a loss of 53 percent by the end of last
month, while the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index has appreciated
230 percent in that time and the S&AMP;P index of tobacco stocks has
returned 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded cautiously Tuesday, sending RJR's share
price up a mere 75 cents to close at $29.375, although it had
initially rose nearly $2 a share after the announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in Philip Morris also rose slightly, by 62.5 cents, with
some investors betting it would separate its tobacco and food
operations as well. A spokesman for Philip Morris said the company
had decided against that option in 1994 and had not changed its
mind.
</P>
<P>
   RJR's foreign sale, which is expected to be completed by
mid-May, will shore up the domestic tobacco company, which will be
known as R.J. Reynolds Tobacco.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the $5 billion in after-tax proceeds from the sale will
be used to pay down that company's debt, now about $6 billion, said
Marc Cohen, who follows stocks of tobacco companies for Goldman,
Sachs. ``It will then have a very conservatively managed and strong
financial position,'' he said, calling the spinoff ``a very bold
move.''
</P>
<P>
   Current investors in RJR Nabisco will also receive one share of
the tobacco company for each share they own in a transaction that
will be tax free to shareholders and the company.
</P>
<P>
   RJR Nabisco will remain a holding company, with its sole asset
the 80.6 percent of Nabisco it now owns. No longer owning any part
of the tobacco company, it will be renamed Nabisco Group Holdings.
Most of its 90 or so employees at the New York headquarters will be
laid off.

 NEW YORK: laid off.   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Plaintiffs in smoking lawsuits would be able to sue the holding
company, several experts said Tuesday, should the tobacco company
be unable to meet its obligations. But with a reduced debt load,
the free-standing tobacco company will be in a stronger financial
position.
</P>
<P>
   John Coale, a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who is involved in
lawsuits against R.J. Reynolds, said he did not foresee the new
corporate structure interfering with his cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all past conduct and present litigation, they are not off
the hook,'' he said. ``We would try to put Humpty Dumpty together
again and then we would collect.''
</P>
<P>
   How much potential liability the holding company faces will be
reflected in the stock price. RJR Nabisco now holds 80.6 percent of
Nabisco's shares, and the remainder is held by the public.
</P>
<P>
   While the food operation's shares were trading at $45 Tuesday,
the stock price of RJR Nabisco was less than $30. When the tobacco
companies are spun off and sold, Cohen predicted, shares in RJR
should rise closer to $45.
</P>
<P>
   Carl Icahn, the corporate takeover specialist who has repeatedly
bought and sold big stakes in RJR, re-entered the picture this
winter and threatened to nominate his own board of directors by
this Friday if the company did not spin off the food unit. But
pressure from Icahn was not a motivating factor, Goldstone said.
``It would be Carl's third attempt up the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Once the lawsuits brought by the attorneys general of dozens of
states were resolved last year in a $206 billion industry
settlement, Goldstone said, his priority was ``finding a home'' for
the international tobacco business.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to find a value for our shareholders that was high
enough to fix the balance sheet of our tobacco business,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Japan Tobacco agreed to pay a 33 percent premium for the
international tobacco division, which had been valued at about $6
billion. Japan Tobacco's chief long-term strategist, Yasushi
Shingai, said in an interview that he did not feel the price was
too high. ``These are very strong and prestigious brands, and there
is a lot of potential to grow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With the deal, Japan Tobacco will vault from fifth place to
third in global cigarettes and gain a presence in Western Europe
and Russia. Its revenues last year were $27.2 billion, and its
holdings include pharmaceuticals and food.
</P>
<P>
   Formed in 1985 after privatization, Japan Tobacco owns Japan's
biggest-selling cigarette brand, Mild Seven, and makes Marlboro
cigarettes locally for Philip Morris.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the company was concerned about liability from
smokers' lawsuits, Shingai replied: ``We have three pending
litigations, but the law system and the culture are very different
than in the U.S.''
</P>
<P>
   There was some speculation Tuesday about a possible sequel to
the story, particularly if Nabisco becomes a takeover target again.
``Somebody like Philip Morris may find them appetizing,'' said Gary
M. Black, who tracks tobacco stocks for Sanford Bernstein &AMP; Co.

 &HT;    Episcopal Church averts split over homosexuality
 &HT;    By Kim Sue Lia Perkes
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAVASOTA, Texas _ The nation's Episcopal bishops ended a six-day
closed meeting Tuesday, saying they were convinced that divisive
issues, especially homosexuality, are best dealt with outside of
the church's legislative process.
</P>
<P>
   The bishops said that they had set aside for now the issues of
ordaining homosexuals and women, and of blessing same-sex unions,
in hopes of encouraging the 2.4 million members of the American
church to curtail efforts to change church doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   For seven years, the church has been under the cloud of a
potential schism. The most recent threat came in February when, in
an unprecedented move, eight international Anglican church primates
said they would help conservative Episcopalians start a new church
if the Episcopal Church took punitive action against four bishops
who will not support the controversial ordinations or homosexual
unions.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church, which in 1997 began requiring bishops to
ordain women, has not taken any action against the four bishops,
including Bishop Jack Iker of Fort Worth, who was out of the
country and did not attend the bishops' meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a sore upon our body, and we've discovered that
to continue to pick at it leads to a systemic infection,'' said
Bishop Chilton Knudsen of Maine. She was one of 140 bishops who
attended the meeting at Camp Allen, the retreat center for the
Diocese of Texas, which includes Austin.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Claude Payne of the Diocese of Texas said trying to
settle divisive church issues through church law creates a win-lose
outcome that is not productive. ``We will not vote up or down on
the hot sexuality issues,'' Payne said. He said he does not expect
the church to take punitive action against bishops who ordain
homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   No one expects the issue to go away, Payne said, but bishops can
lead the church to focus on its mission to help the poor and those
in need. The Episcopal Church is one in a string of mainline
denominations that have been grappling with homosexual ordinations
and unions. In January, 90 Methodist ministers in California
blessed a lesbian marriage in a ceremony that was part protest and
part wedding. The Methodist Church's governing body in 1996 ordered
the church's ministers to stop performing homosexual weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America defrocked
a pastor who was living with a male partner.
</P>
<P>
   Lambeth Conference
</P>
<P>
   Last summer's Lambeth Conference, the once-a-decade meeting of
the worldwide Anglican Communion, dealt Episcopal liberals a
stunning defeat by overwhelmingly approving a resolution that
declared homosexual relationships are contrary to Scripture and
advising against homosexual ordination and same-sex unions.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative Episcopalians in the United States, with the
support of international church primates, have demanded that the
Episcopal Church conform to the Lambeth resolution or they will
start a new church. The archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey, has
said he would not support a separate church.
</P>
<P>
   The Episcopal Church is one of 38 provinces in the worldwide
Anglican Communion. The bishops who head the provinces of Kenya,
Sydney, Rwanda, Jerusalem and the Middle East, Tanzania, South East
Asia, and the Southern Cone of America have sided with
conservatives in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop William Wantland of Wisconsin, an outspoken conservative
who does not ordain women, said that whatever the Episcopal Church
does creates ripples throughout the Anglican Communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Episcopal Church must not fall into the trap of thinking
it is a superpower just because America is a superpower,'' he said.
``The whole idea of a separate province depends on whether or not
the Episcopal Church remains true to the faith as perceived by the
Anglican Communion.''
</P>
<P>
   Presiding Bishop Frank Griswold said he plans to write the
primates a letter next week that will, in part, let them know what
happened at the meeting here. Payne said he is confident the
primates will back off.
</P>
<P>
   Avenue for discussion
</P>
<P>
   Resolutions passed at Lambeth are only advisory and not binding
on provinces, Griswold said. Earlier this century, Lambeth came out
against birth control and forbade divorce, positions it has since
changed.
</P>
<P>
   Passing the resolution that upheld traditional Bible teaching
about homosexuality opens the door for the Anglican Communion to
begin regularly discussing the issue, Griswold said. Before the
resolution, Griswold pointed out that ``the communion had never
discussed it before.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Griswold said he and the other bishops hope their efforts
will be able to keep the matter off the table at the next church
convention, which will be held in Denver in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're asking is the church as a whole consider in its
decision making what are the things that lend themselves to the
legislative community and what are the things that lend themselves
to more reflection and discussion,'' Griswold said.

NO DUCKING: HOLYFIELD SAYS HE WILL KNOCK LEWIS OUT IN THIRD ROUND
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ One fighter worked out for two hours in a
dungeon-like gym in Lower Manhattan, the booming bass line of
gospel music filling the sweat-filled air. The other didn't spar
and barely worked up a sweat over 45 minutes as a reggae beat
pulsated in the spacious Theater at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   The scenes were as different as the two men who will climb into
the ring at Madison Square Garden Saturday night for the undisputed
world heavyweight title.
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield, his chest and abdomen heavily muscled, looked
fit, as usual, as he snapped the head of his sparring partner with
a couple stiff uppercuts. Holyfield, the World Boxing Association
and International Boxing Federation champion, is supremely
confident. The attitude has altered the way he normally conducts
himself before a fight.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has never predicted that he would knock an opponent
out, let alone pick a round. But he is sticking to his prediction
of knocking Lennox Lewis out in the third round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still holding to the truth,'' Holyfield said during an
eight-minute interview with the news media. ``The truth of the
matter is I'm going to knock him out in the third round. I'm not
asking anybody in here to believe that or to write that. You can
write it now or later. On the 13th you'll have the answer
yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield (35-3) said it was nothing personal against Lewis, who
had claimed that Holyfield had been ducking him for the past year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has nothing to do with Lennox Lewis,'' Holyfield said.
``It just so happens that Lennox Lewis is the opponent I'm going to
knock out in the third round.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Thomas, Holyfield's lawyer, said Holyfield began his weight
training for the fight with his conditioning trainer, Tim Hallmark,
in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I called Tim back in November and asked him if there was
anything I could do to help get Evander ready,'' Thomas said. ``He
said make sure that Evander gets 10 workouts in December. Evander
did 12 workouts and had Tim supervise them in Atlanta. He's started
out faster and better for this camp than any other.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield left quickly after his workout, because he had to do
satellite television interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Lewis, the World Boxing Association champion, wore a
black-and-blue sleeveless spandex shirt with matching knee-high
shorts. It looked more like a scuba-diving outfit than boxing togs.
Lewis' workout was punctuated by punches thrown at the hand pads
held by his trainer, Emanuel Steward.
</P>
<P>
   With his bulging biceps, Lewis looks fit. There is no doubt that
he is massive. Before he left camp, Lewis said he weighed 260
pounds and expected to fight at 255. If he comes in at 260, he will
be the heaviest opponent Holyfield, who expects to fight at 214 to
217 pounds, has faced. George Foreman weighed 257 pounds when the
two fought in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis seemed fed up with the talk from Holyfield on that
third-round knockout. ``I don't know where he's getting that,''
Lewis said. ``I'm his hardest fight. Who has he ever knocked out in
three rounds? He should have knocked out Vaughn Bean. Amazing. He
comes out trying to knock me out, he'll get knocked out himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis excused himself after a couple more minutes of questions,
because he was cooling down from his workout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the flu season, a chill on the eve of the fight would not be
a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   He gave way to Steward, no stranger to fight-week hype.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they both come out wired up like I expect, I can see this
being a good fight,'' Steward said. ``It could be another
Hagler-Hearns. I wouldn't be surprised.''  &QL;

BASEBALL RAISES AND BRINGS IN THE EVER-SHIFTING STRIKE ZONE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKELAND, Fla. _ Larry Parrish saw nothing different about the
strike zone during the Detroit Tigers' first exhibition game
against the Pittsburgh Pirates last Friday. The next day, when he
went to home plate to exchange lineup cards for the game against
the Cleveland Indians, the umpires delivered a message.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said they got a letter that day,'' the Tigers' manager
said Tuesday, ``and this was the way they were going to call it.
They said you can expect the ball to be called up a little bit and
we're going to tighten it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exhibition season less than a week old, umpires have
begun implementing the changes in the strike zone that clubs were
informed about last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like they've called the ball up a little better and
they've moved it in,'' said Parrish, a former major league hitter.
``They're actually calling the strike zone.''
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Jefferies, the Tigers' designated hitter, said the umpires
were ``definitely calling a higher strike,'' adding: ``They're
calling it probably in the chest area. It's up there. I've noticed
it the last two, three games.''
</P>
<P>
   Rocky Roe, an American League umpire, said that in his first
spring training appearance behind the plate Monday he called five
or six strikes that he wouldn't have in the past. ``I think where
you'll see a difference,'' he said, ``is the real good curveball,
where the arc is coming through the strike zone. In the past we
would have had a tendency to call it a ball. We're making a
conscious effort.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort comes at the behest of Major League Baseball
officials, who are trying to address one of the most controversial
on-field issues in the game: the shifting strike zone. In recent
seasons, players and fans have seen the zone become lower and
wider, evolving into a rectangle more horizontal than vertical.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball officials want umpires to move back toward the strike
zone that is defined in the rule book, where a ball has to cross
home plate and the upper limit of the zone is ``a horizontal line
at the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the
uniform pants.''
</P>
<P>
   That upper-limit line, in the past two decades or so, descended
to a vague point somewhere below the waist. At the same time, the
strike zone expanded horizontally to where umpires were calling
strikes on pitches that were anywhere from one inch to six inches
(at least in the eyes of some beholders) off the outside corner of
the plate.
</P>
<P>
   In moving to reconstruct the strike zone that was in practice,
the commissioner's office was more concerned about the wide strike.
Pitchers such as Tom Glavine and Greg Maddux of Atlanta have made
their living making hitters chase pitches wide of the strike zone
because umpires have called them strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The strike zone across has been so big that hitters can't
reach it,'' Cleveland Manager Mike Hargrove said Tuesday before a
game against the Kansas City Royals in nearby Haines City. ``Or if
they do get the bat out there, there's no way they can do anything
with those pitches because they have no leverage.''
</P>
<P>
   But if umpires were going to take away the outside strike,
officials decided, they would compensate pitchers with a higher
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitch up, you have a chance to make contact,'' Parrish said.
``But a ball this far outside, you can't get to it without diving
into it and then you have to worry about getting domed.''
</P>
<P>
   So the commissioner's office decided that, the rule book
notwithstanding, the upper limit of the strike zone would extend
two inches above the top of the uniform pants. The idea, one
official said, was to make the strike zone better, not perfect.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Alderson, executive vice president of baseball operations
in the commissioner's office, informed general managers and
managers about the changes in a Feb. 19 memo. The umpires, however,
refused initially to cooperate in the strike-zone venture because
they said they worked for the league presidents, not the
commissioner's office.
</P>
<P>
   Although an internal battle has raged between the commissioner's
office and the league presidents over the general area of umpiring,
the presidents issued directives to the umpires last week telling
them to enforce the commissioner's interpretation of the strike
zone this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want it from the bill of the cap to the top of the
shoes, that's what we have to do,'' said Roe, who joined the AL
staff in 1981. ``They're our employers, and they're telling us what
to do. As long as we feel we're being backed and that's what they
want, that's what we'll do.''
</P>
<P>
   NL umpires, however, will apparently not do it happily. Bruce
Froemming, who in his 29th season is the league's senior umpire,
said he, for one, would have to lower his strike zone if he were to
follow the directive. But when he was asked if there was talk among
NL umpires not to follow the directive, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The only talk among National League umpires is the total
disrespect that has been shown. It's a total lack of respect to
change something against the rule book definition and not sit down
with a group of umpires and say, `This is what we'd like to do. How
do you feel about it?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Alderson tried to meet with umpires in both leagues, but the
umpires in each league voted not to meet with him. When three AL
umpires _ Jim Evans, Dave Phillips and Tim Tschida _ met with him
nevertheless, they were harshly criticized by some of their
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We work for Len Coleman and Gene Budig,'' Froemming said,
speaking of the league presidents. ``We don't work for Sandy
Alderson.''
</P>
<P>
   But the umpires appear ready to cooperate despite what their
political feelings may be. They just caution that they are not
robots.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a human element in it,'' Durwood Merrill of the
American League said. ``What I might see two inches up, he might
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitchers and hitters will have to adjust the same as umpires.
``It's going to be tough,'' said George Brett, a Hall of Fame
hitter and a spring coach with the Royals. ``You're so programmed
to swing at balls from here to here.'' He indicated an area from
the groin to the knees.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the strike zone was. All of a sudden, when they
start calling this one'' _ he drew a line above his waist _ ``it's
going to feel like mid-torso to the hitters. They're going to start
swinging at those balls up here'' _ chest high _ ``because they're
not going to be sure it's a strike.''

 LAKELAND, Fla.: a strike.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Facing pitchers with a good fastball, Brett said, hitters will
very likely pop up the high-strike pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Most hitters look for the ball down because that's where
pitchers have been taught to throw it. The change, Parrish said,
will help power pitchers but not finesse pitchers. He mentioned in
the latter group the Atlanta pitchers, some of whom he said ``have
gotten six inches off the plate outside the last few years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It could hurt some of their pitchers,'' he added, ``because
they're not power pitchers.''
</P>
<P>
   Glavine readily acknowledged that he stood to be affected if
umpires stopped calling the outside strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``But can they stop?'' he asked at the Braves' camp in
Kissimmee. ``I don't know. Some of these guys have been calling
pitches the way they have for a long time. Just like it's hard to
ask a pitcher to change his style overnight, it's hard to ask an
umpire to change his style overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the left-hander said he didn't see the high
strike helping pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Calling a strike above the belt is going to help probably five
guys _ Clemens, Schilling, Randy Johnson and anyone else who throws
in the upper 90s and pitches up in the strike zone,'' Glavine said,
referring to the Yankees' Roger Clemens and the Phillies' Curt
Schilling. ``Everybody else, no, it's not going to help them. I
don't care if they give me from the belt to the chest, I can't
afford to pitch up there. It's not going to do me any good. I'm
successful by keeping the ball down, and I always will be, as most
pitchers are.''

THREE-YEAR-OLDS GETTING READY FOR THEIR BIG WEEKEND 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ The best 3-year-old horses in America were
being primed Tuesday for their busiest weekend of the year, a
splashy series of shakedown races on the East and West coasts and
at a track in between. And they will be gunning for the prize of a
lifetime when their paths cross seven weeks later at the starting
gate for the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   Exploit, the son of Storm Cat and the best in the West, takes
the stage in the $250,000 San Felipe Stakes on Saturday at Santa
Anita. Undefeated in five races, he is one of five Triple Crown
candidates being trained by Bob Baffert, and all of them are in
action this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Another star from the Baffert barn, Prime Timber, will also run
in the San Felipe.
</P>
<P>
   Vicar, a son of Wild Again, leaped into the top spot in the East
two weeks ago when he won the Fountain of Youth Stakes at
Gulfstream Park. He returns to the same track Saturday as the
favorite in the $750,000 Florida Derby. He is trained by Carl
Nafzger, who trained Unbridled, the 1990 Florida Derby and Kentucky
Derby winner.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, there will be an encore: the $600,000 Louisiana Derby
at the Fair Grounds in New Orleans, where another Baffert star
heads the cast. He is General Challenge, unbeaten in three starts
in California, and he will be racing Answer Lively, winner of the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile and the 2-year-old champion last year but a
loser, by a nose, in the Risen Star Stakes two weeks ago. The horse
who beat him, Ecton Park, will also be spicing things by returning
in the Louisiana Derby.
</P>
<P>
   The crowded weekend stage will include fillies as well as colts.
On Saturday, last year's juvenile filly champion, Silverbulletday
(also trained by Baffert), is very likely to be the heavy favorite
in the $350,000 Fair Grounds Oaks in her second start of the year
and her second at the Fair Grounds. And on Sunday, more fancy
fillies will run in the Santa Anita Oaks, led by Excellent Meeting
(trained by you know who).
</P>
<P>
   But in spite of the achievements and uncommon speed of several
fillies in this year's 3-year-old class, doubts linger that any
filly will challenge tradition by challenging colts in the Triple
Crown. And history reminds us that only 36 fillies have tried to
win the Kentucky Derby and only three have succeeded.
</P>
<P>
   Baffert is keeping Excellent Meeting and Silverbulletday with
other fillies right now, though he is keeping his options open for
dramatic switches by Derby Day. Three Ring, who won the Davona Dale
Stakes on Feb. 21 by nearly 15 lengths, is not nominated to the
Triple Crown but her trainer, Eddie Plesa Jr., said he would enter
her Wednesday in the Florida Derby and hope for an inside post
position. And Honest Lady, a daughter of Seattle Slew trained by
Bobby Frankel, is still booked into the Santa Anita Derby but has
raced only three times anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our time, we tried to keep fillies and colts separate,''
said Jimmy Jones, who trained eight Derby winners for Calumet Farm
with his father, Ben Jones. ``Fillies can often run fast, maybe
faster than colts. But they don't really start to mature until
later in their 3-year-old seasons. It's probably a physical fact of
life. Later, they can hold their own against colts.''
</P>
<P>
   But until the best of the fillies are declared no longer in
contention for the Triple Crown, they must be ranked with the best
of the colts: Exploit, Cat Thief, Prime Timber, Menifee, General
Challenge and a pair of long-distance travelers from Dubai in the
Middle East who are being groomed in a most unusual way, Worldly
Manner and Aljabr.
</P>
<P>
   The last two are training in Dubai, where they will run in trial
races and then presumably take the voyage to Kentucky to challenge
the Derby horses who got there in the more or less conventionally
grinding way.

USC TO FACE RUSTY WYOMING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It took the better part of Tuesday for the USC
basketball team to fly to Denver, then drive 2{ hours to Laramie,
Wyo., for tonight's first-round game against Wyoming in the
National Invitation Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And that doesn't take into account the sub-30-degree
temperatures.
</P>
<P>
   But none of it could dampen the Trojans' enthusiasm over playing
the Cowboys in their first postseason appearance in two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty special,'' forward David Bluthenthal said. ``We're
happy we're in the NIT. It's good for us. We're heading in the
right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Even usually reluctant USC coach Henry Bibby has become almost
sugary in his assessment of playing in the NIT.
</P>
<P>
   ``To get into an NIT has been a dream for me, just to get into a
tournament with this basketball team,'' Bibby said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the question is how far the Trojans (15-12) can go,
considering they probably will be relegated to the road as long as
they continue playing.
</P>
<P>
   Before worrying about advancing to the semifinals at Madison
Square Garden, however, the Trojans must play a rusty Cowboys squad
that hasn't played since Feb. 27, when they defeated Nevada Las
Vegas 79-76.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys (17-9) play a run-and-gun style, with no starter
taller than 6-foot-8 forward Ugo Udezue, who is a member of the
Nigerian junior national team. Udezue scored just 98 points in 28
games last year, but is averaging 20.5 points per game this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're very athletic. Not big. Similar to our team,'' Bibby
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyoming coach Steve McClain is in his first season after
spending three years as an assistant at Texas Christian under coach
Billy Tubbs. He also coached at Hutchinson Community College in
Kansas, where he won the National Junior College Championship in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   One of the interesting sidelights to the game will be how
Wyoming point guard Chris McMillian plays against the Trojans.
McMillian is from Brea, where former USC point guard Kevin
Augustine grew up. The Trojans did not recruit McMillian because
they believed Augustine was their point guard of the future, but he
quit the team in December.
</P>
<P>
   Today they would love to have McMillian. He's averaging 9.5
points and 4.9 assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a good little player. But you can't recruit everybody,''
Bibby said. ``I'm sure he wants to show SC why we didn't take him
was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans would also like to use a good showing in the NIT as
a stepping stone for next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were so close. For most of us, we know how good we'll be
next year,'' Bluthenthal said. ``We'll definitely make the NCAA's
next year.''

MEXICAN TRUCKS' SAFETY IN QUESTION AS OPEN U.S. ROADS LOOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK SHAFFER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NOGALES, Ariz. _ State safety inspector Richard Saspe still
can't confirm that Mexican truck drivers give him trustworthy
documents about their rigs' safety, insurance and titles.
</P>
<P>
   He had suspected that something was fishy about all the
commercial drivers' licenses he was seeing. Saspe was right. A spot
check at the border the last six months has documented more than
100 drivers using false licenses.
</P>
<P>
   So, Saspe and other federal and state inspectors are concerned
about a Jan. 1 date rapidly approaching which is scheduled to allow
Mexican long-haul trucks to traverse the United States under the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Saspe marvels at how modern many Mexican
trucking companies have become recently.
</P>
<P>
   Those companies will do just fine when Arizona roads open to
them for long hauls outside the border commercial zone, Saspe says.
Gone are the days when brakes that worked were a luxury, when tires
were slick as a playground basketball, when brake lights and turn
signals simply stayed dark.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts remain, however, about the other Mexican shippers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study by the Inspector General of the U.S. Department
of Transportation found that 44 percent of the trucks inspected
crossing the U.S. border were ordered out of service for serious
safety violations in 1997. Federal inspectors in Nogales say that
number is slightly above 50 percent now for those trucks entering
Arizona. U.S. trucks have a 25 percent out-of-service rate and
Canadian trucks 17 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Mexican haulers are inspected with any kind of
regularity. Of the about 800 trucks that pass through the Nogales
port of entry daily, only about one in 30 receives anything more
than a cursory glance.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican officials claim that the out-of-service rate is so high
because safety inspectors repeatedly target the small number of
trucks that make the local runs from Nogales, Sonora, to warehouses
just north of Nogales, Ariz. Those trucks would not be used to
transport expensive cargos over long distances in this country,
they say.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Delaossa, who has been inspecting trucks the last six years
in Nogales, the last two for the U.S. Department of Transportation,
says he has no idea which trucks would stay and which would go.
</P>
<P>
   But he calls the quality of Mexican inspections ``poor'' and
says that he is constantly inspecting trucks ``which, if you could
believe the documents, have just gotten a clean bill of health over
there only to have numerous safety violations here.''
</P>
<P>
   Delaossa also said he has been involved in numerous instances in
which he ordered Mexican trucks out of service only to have them
try to re-enter Arizona without fixing the problems.
</P>
<P>
   Delaossa thought long and hard one recent day in his office when
he was asked if Mexican trucks should be allowed to cross this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I'd try it for four or five years just in the border
states and see if the fatality rates increased,'' Delaossa said.
'`I don't know if this is something I would want to push too
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Congress say it shouldn't be pushed at all. They
question whether sufficient progress has been made within the
Mexican trucking industry since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The trucks were supposed to be allowed to travel throughout
Arizona, California, New Mexico and Texas beginning in December of
that year but were delayed until it could be decided how to improve
safety and security regulations. Now, another NAFTA deadline is
rapidly approaching.
</P>
<P>
   State and federal inspectors still have no access to databases
kept in Mexico on the trucks. And although Mexico has agreed in
principle to use uniform inspection standards for trucks like in
the United States and Canada, Mexican officials said that documents
to that effect remain to be signed.
</P>
<P>
   There are no restrictions on the number of hours a day a Mexican
driver can be behind the wheel and no requirements to keep
logbooks, vehicle maintenance standards, a safety rating system and
regular roadside inspections, according to the federal
transportation study.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Rodriguez, Mexico's consul in Nogales, Ariz., said
the country's agency that oversees transportation has a system in
place to conduct inspections to U.S. standards and that the signing
of the tri-national document for uniform standards is a ``mere
formality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These are just a small number of trucks which make the local
runs up to the produce warehouses north of Nogales with which the
inspectors have problems,'' Rodriguez said. ``I would say that
between 80 and 90 percent of our truckers are ready for the next
phase of NAFTA and many of them have new equipment for the long
hauls.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Ken Barton, who administers the state Department of Public
Safety truck inspection program, also agrees that Mexican trucks
are ready to rumble on U.S. highways.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we open it up, there's no doubt in my mind that they will
get in compliance,'' Barton said. ``When those statistics are
brought up about out of service Mexican trucks in Nogales, I'm
reminded of a time that a study was done on the out of service
trucks in a commercial zone in Kansas City of local carriers and it
was 58 percent. We haven't cut off trade with Kansas City because
of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Police agencies in the Nogales area acknowledged that the
Mexican trucks have a good safety record in the area and haven't
been involved in any noteworthy accidents in which they were at
fault. Rodriguez also said that the out-of-service rate of the
trucks would drop dramatically if the state would build a new
truck-inspection station 30 miles north of the border rather than
at the border, which is the plan now.
</P>
<P>
   That would weed out many of the older-model trucks that make as
many as seven runs a day between produce storage warehouses in
Nogales, Sonora, and Rio Rico, north of Nogales, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Those kind of trucks would never be making long hauls in the
United States because the potential for breakdowns is high and
there is too much economically at stake with each load, said Miguel
Pacheco, who heads an organization of 34 border truck companies
called Central de Servicio.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco said that the flames being fanned against the Mexican
trucking industry are the work of the Teamsters union and U.S.
truckers who fear Mexican competition.
</P>
<P>
   Pacheco also is circulating a petition among Mexican truckers to
be sent to Congress concerning what he calls harassment and
outrageous fines by federal safety inspectors in Nogales. Pacheco
said that some Mexican truckers have been fined as much as $1,000
for having one light out on their rigs and that they have been
threatened with seizure of their passports and drivers licenses for
minor violations.
</P>
<P>
   Octavio Andrade Corella, who owns a Nogales, Sonora, trucking
company called Transportes OA with his two brothers, was one of
those fined heavily for having a brake light out in the back of one
of his company's 18 trucks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trucking companies in Mexico know exactly what they are
going to have to do if they run long routes in the States,''
Andrade said. ``We need to invest $50,000 in our trucks for better
tires, brakes and motors. Money is hard to come by with the falling
peso and interest rates being very high. But we still want to make
the investment even though we only make four or five trips a year
to Phoenix and Tucson and have no desire to make more trips.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the type of attitude that Saspe, the state's top
inspector in Nogales, says he has grown accustomed to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't care what anybody says, these trucks are a lot better
than they used to be and the truckers I know are not trying to beat
the system,'' Saspe said.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean that everyone is on the up and up. Saspe
noted that the abundance of false commercial driver's licenses was
traced to a printing press in the Mexican state of Sinaloa that
apparently was part of a counterfeiting ring that had connections
inside a local office of the government transportation agency.
</P>
<P>
   Saspe also said that Mexican truckers entering Arizona are
feeling a lot more relaxed these days because the time spent in
crossing to Arizona has been greatly reduced with the completion in
mid-February of a four-lane highway on the Mexican side that
bypasses downtown Nogales, Sonora.
</P>
<P>
   ``That definitely helps their frustration level before they get
on our highways,'' Saspe said. '`Now, I just hope they start
turning on their lights before it gets completely dark.''
