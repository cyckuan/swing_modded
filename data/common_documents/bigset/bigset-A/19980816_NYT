SANCHEZ VICARIO ON THE RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Arantxa Sanchez Vicario might lead the
women's tennis tour in nicknames.
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario is so renowned for her speed that Martina Hingis
dubbed her Forrest Gump, after the fleet-of-foot movie character.
</P>
<P>
   After her 6-4, 6-4 semifinal win in the Acura Classic over
Sanchez Vicario, Hingis noted that Sanchez Vicario's speed often
turns a match. ``You never know with her,'' Hingis said. ``She's a
big runner.''
</P>
<P>
   Other nicknames? Sanchez Vicario is also known as ``El Conejo,''
or the rabbit, or the ``Barcelona Bumblebee.''
</P>
<P>
   Handy competitor: Why has the 17-year-old Hingis held the top
ranking so firmly for more than a year? According to Sanchez
Vicario, it is not necessarily Hingis' ground strokes, serve or
athleticism. Rather, it's her quick hands, which give Hingis the
ability to create difficult shots.
</P>
<P>
   Four for four: When the top four seeds played in the semifinals
Saturday, it marked the fourth time this year that the top four
made it to the semifinals of a Corel WTA tour event.
</P>
<P>
   Upsets have been infrequent at Manhattan Beach, as only
sixth-seeded Irina Spirlea and seventh-seeded Sandrine Testud made
premature exits.
</P>
<P>
   Double your fun: Hingis has doubled her appearances in the
finals, as she and Natasha Zvereva advanced to the doubles final
with a 6-2, 6-3 win over Lori McNeil and Kimberly Po.
</P>
<P>
   After today's singles final, Hingis-Zvereva, the top-seeded team
in doubles, will meet either Chanda Rubin and Spirlea or Tamarine
Tanasugarn and Elena Tatarkova. The two unseeded doubles teams met
in the other semifinal late Saturday night. &QL;

DEFENSE DOMINATES SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ Several suspicions about the USC football team
were confirmed during the team's first scrimmage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The defense demonstrated that it is substantially ahead of the
offense and should be the strength of the team.
</P>
<P>
   As for the offense, well, it showed that it has a long way to go
before the season starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans' offense mustered three field goals and a touchdown
in the 70-play scrimmage that was highlighted by defensive end
Sultan Abdul-Malik, who had two sacks and four tackles for losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense wins games,'' Abdul-Malik said. ``We're going to be
much, much better. We're a more upfield-and-make-plays kind of
defensive line. I see more sacks for us this season.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Paul Hackett was not surprised by the defense's
dominance, but he said the offense was ``maybe a little behind''
where he expected them to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big thing is we had no touchdowns,'' Hackett said.
``That's the concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett was also concerned about the offense's frequent
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to be a good enough offensive team to afford
them,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage did little to alter the quarterback depth chart,
with Mike Van Raaphorst still the designated starter and freshman
Carson Palmer right behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst and Palmer were limited by soreness, so backups
Quincy Woods and Jason Thomas took most of the snaps.
</P>
<P>
   Van Raaphorst completed three of five passes for 20 yards while
Palmer was one for two for 33 yards. Woods completed one of six
passes for one yard and an interception while Thomas was two for
six for 20 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he hopes to decide where the quarterbacks stand in
the next few days.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think going into Monday this thing will sort itself out,''
Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The scrimmage did seem to come to life when the trio of freshman
tailbacks were inserted into the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Strong led all backs with 36 yards in six carries, while
Sultan McCullough had 22 yards in seven carries and a touchdown.
Miguel Fletcher of Alemany had 20 yards in three carries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their speed showed,'' Hackett said. ``You can't miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting tailback Chad Morton had minus-four yards in five
carries.
</P>
<P>
   A few veterans were held out of the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Mark Cusano did not play because of a hamstring
injury. Wide receiver Larry Parker was also held out, as Hackett
tries to bring him back slowly from last season's foot surgery.
Fullback Marvin Powell had a sore knee and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   One veteran who did play was John Fox, who was used at tight end
for the first time in a simulated game.
</P>
<P>
   Huber to redshirt: Tight end Scott Huber, who will be out for at
least the next six weeks after suffering a hip injury in practice,
will redshirt this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he will wait until the third or fourth game to
decide which other freshmen will redshirt.
</P>
<P>
   Iacenda out: Fullback Ted Iacenda has missed the past two days
of practice after experiencing pain in his shoulder. Iacenda had
surgery on both shoulders last winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got tweaked a little and I'm being very cautious with it,''
Hackett said.

SUSPICION TARNISHES GRAND DAY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. _ ``Just write about the race,'' John Toffan,
co-owner of Free House, winner of the Pacific Classic here
Saturday, admonished a room full of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   OK: Nice race.
</P>
<P>
   And now: About the drugs...
</P>
<P>
   Free House, an otherwise lovable galoot of a horse, with affable
owners and a nice-guy trainer and one of the all-time great
jockeys, now embodies one of the saddest facts of modern racetrack
life, which is that the mere hint of drugs will sour even the
sweetest day.
</P>
<P>
   Whether you talk about it or not. Whether you write about it or
not.
</P>
<P>
   In a swirl of events that, thankfully, is rare, a first-rate
colt raced in a million-dollar stakes Saturday with a medicinal
cloud hanging over him.
</P>
<P>
   After his previous race, a smashing victory at Hollywood Park in
July, Free House tested positive for clenbuterol, a
performance-enhancing drug that's permitted in training but not in
competition. He's one of 20 California horses, spread among seven
trainers, who have had positive tests for clenbuterol in the three
months since lab procedures were refined.
</P>
<P>
   In Free House's case, his handlers are waiting for the
California Horse Racing Board to deliver results of a second test
on the urine sample, which could exonerate them or could set them
up for major sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   For horseplayers, trying to pick a winner based on their recent
form, the lingering questions about Free House added confusion to
an evenly matched Pacific Classic.
</P>
<P>
   The fact Free House won the race, defeating important older
horses Gentlemen and Touch Gold in the process, didn't make things
any better.
</P>
<P>
   Either some cheaters won Del Mar's biggest race, and got to
enjoy a guilty party in the winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   Or Toffan, co-owner Trudy McCaffery and trainer Paco Gonzalez
are innocent and it's a crying shame their biggest victory is
tarnished.
</P>
<P>
   With drugs, or the suspicion thereof, there can be no happy
ending.
</P>
<P>
   Which is way No. 62 of saying that racing needs to get a handle
on this drug thing.
</P>
<P>
   Or, Just say Neigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, just put yourself in our shoes,'' Toffan said,
increasingly testy as the subject kept coming up after the race.
``That's all I got to say. What kind of emotions would you have?
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't do anything wrong. We haven't heard back from the
racing board. Whatever happened, happened. But I'll guarantee you
Paco didn't do it. And that's all I can say at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Toffan and McCaffery, Canada natives who are pillars of the
California racing industry and are normally the most media-friendly
of owners, have been careful to have little to say since the
clenbuterol scandal began to brew two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   They haven't returned reporters' phone calls. They skipped the
Pacific Classic post-position draw ceremony and press conference on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On the plus side, it was the owners and Gonzalez who confirmed
the rumors of a positive test to reporters in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery, Toffan and Gonzalez are not the picture of racetrack
cheaters.
</P>
<P>
   She's a real softy. She cries when her horse loses. She cries
when her horse wins. She probably cried at ``Blazing Saddles.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all my horses,'' McCaffery said in a typical quote. ``I
loved Bien Bien (a top turf horse of the early '90s). But there's
something about Free House that captures you. He's a very sexy
horse. Most horses look straight at you. He kind of does this.''
And Trudy cocked her head and shot you a sly look.
</P>
<P>
   Her boyfriend, Toffan, is a straight-shooting guy, a success in
oil and gold mining, with the old-fashioned notion that part of the
good life is breeding and owning thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is a friendly, bashful man without a hint of scandal in
nearly a decade of training at the highest level.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, in his brief comments on the subject, has denied using
clenbuterol. But if the second test comes back positive, the
natural conclusion will be that Free House received clenbuterol
legally in training and traces of the substance were still in his
system when he raced at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   In which case Team Free House will be guilty of nothing more
than miscalculation.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffery said Saturday she feels ``vindicated'' by Free House's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   But not so fast. The laboratory jury is still out.
</P>
<P>
   Until it speaks, all we know for sure is that where racetrack
drugs are concerned, suspicion can happen to anybody. &QL;

CLINTON INVESTIGATION CAUSES TOUGH QUESTIONS FOR PARENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEXA HAUSSLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He meticulously prepares for an inquiry like none he's faced,
crafting the precise words to be forthcoming, without saying too
much.
</P>
<P>
   But still, he fears a single question:
</P>
<P>
   Daddy, what is oral sex?
</P>
<P>
   He is Chris Hernandez, a Tempe father of two. And, like many
parents, he faces a dilemma in the wake of a presidential scandal
that has mainstream media tossing out intimate _ and very adult _
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he will have to explain the situation to his
children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem telling them what's right. My job is to
prepare them for life, and it is part of life,'' said Hernandez,
who has two sons, ages 14 and 11.
</P>
<P>
   Experts agree that parents should be honest with children if
they ask about the allegations against the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally, you want to give the child a small amount of
information and then see if they need more information,'' said Dr.
Pamela Frazier, a Valley psychiatrist who works with adolescents.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier suggests that parents avoid letting their children watch
if Clinton decides to make televised remarks after he testifies
before a federal grand jury Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably is going to be over the child's head, and it may
give him or her more information than she's ready to deal with,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Sara Brinkerhoff, a counselor who works with young children,
said, ``Certainly, talking about values is important, and honesty
is one of those values.''
</P>
<P>
   She also advised parents to avoid detailed explanations if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suppose the younger the child, the less specific you are
going to be about behavior,'' Brinkerhoff said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier urged parents to provide explanations about the news
events that are consistent with their own values.
</P>
<P>
   ``A young child they might feel confused that the president is
accused of being involved with a woman that's not his wife,''
Frazier said. ``The parent then would be in a position of perhaps
saying, `Well, sometimes adults do have relationships with other
people, and it's not necessarily what we think is right.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy Doren, a Tempe mother of two, said her 6-year-old daughter
already has asked why Clinton is often shown with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too long ago, we had a ``Newsweek,'' and she asked me,
`Mommy, why is he always in pictures with that woman?' '' Doren
said.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, she fears, the questions might get more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Her plan: ``Don't give them any more information than they ask
for,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Degon, a mother of three girls, ages 10, 8 and 7, from
Arizona City, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are too young to know the nitty-gritty,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez hopes he never has to answer graphic questions about
the presidential sex life. He hopes that, perhaps, for his boys,
the bustle of starting school will be more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   And he said he doubts they'll look to the president as a role
model.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're into sports and cartoons,'' he said. ``Clinton is not
a hero to them. Sports figures are _ you know, Tiger Woods and Mark
McGwire and Ken Griffey Jr.''
</P>
<P>
   But, if the boys do ask about the allegations against the
president, Hernandez said he'll be straight with them:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's human. All humans can do wrong.'' &QL;

SIDEKICKS RECOVER, TATTOO KNIGHTS, 10-2
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's a familiar, peculiar habit the Dallas Sidekicks
have developed the past few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Look awful on the road. Look stunning at home the next game.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, the Sidekicks (1-1) followed a poor effort with
another outstanding game in a 10-2 victory against the Sacramento
Knights before 10,621 at Reunion Arena.
</P>
<P>
   A week earlier, Dallas lost at Sacramento, 8-1. The Knights
appeared the team to beat in the new Premier Soccer Alliance at the
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wallop us, we wallop them,'' Sidekicks player/coach Tatu
said. ``So far there's no edge. We can't put ourselves as favorites
until we win with consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   Goals by six different Sidekicks, including two by Tatu, fueled
a 7-1 halftime lead. Tatu scored his first goal with the Sidekicks,
threading the defense on a free kick for an early 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Tatu assisted on three Dallas goals and punched a shot through
the legs of a Knights defender for his second score.
</P>
<P>
   Except for newly acquired veteran Dale Ervine, Sacramento showed
little on offense. Dallas defenders Mike Powers, Beto and Rusty
Troy formed a wall in front of goalie Shawn Ray, helping him to
shut down the Knights, including a 53-minute scoreless stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tribute to our team defense at home,'' Troy said. ``On
the road, we just need to figure it out.''
</P>
<P>
   The night ended badly for Ray, who limped off with a bruised
thigh after a first-quarter collision.
</P>
<P>
   Nick Stavrou and Gary Young scored two goals apiece. Giampaulo
Pedroso, Tatu and others set up goals with deft passing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They outmuscled us, outran us and completely dominated us in
Sacramento,'' Tatu said. ``Losing 8-1 to those guys pumped me up.
We had to prove a point.''
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento was scoreless the final 27 minutes of the first half
after a goal by Ervine was waved off. Officials ruled Sacramento
had too many men on the carpet when Ervine scored. The game was
then delayed 10 minutes while Ervine and Knights coach Iain Fraser
argued the call.

IS FLEA COLLAR TOO TIGHT?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You see the woman on the first-base side masquerading as a
poodle _ the floppy ears, cotton candy tail and jewelry-studded
collar and leash were something to behold _ and your first thought
is: Finally, someone came to Dodger Stadium dressed for the
occasion.
</P>
<P>
   The dog days of this Dodgers season continued Saturday afternoon
with a 5-3 loss to the National League's front-runners, the Atlanta
Braves. It was the Dodgers' eighth loss in 11 games, begging the
question: When, exactly, do they plan to stop chasing their
collective tail and go after the bone that is the wild-card berth?
</P>
<P>
   Saturday was as fine a day as any to make a little headway in
the pennant chase, as the Braves, in a twist, weren't nearly as
stifling as the sticky weather. The NL East leaders stranded 12
runners, starting pitcher John Smoltz struggled and second baseman
Tony Graffanino gift-wrapped the Dodgers' scores in the first
inning by bobbling the ball on a sure-fire, inning-ending double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Graffanino's gaffe loaded the bases and Bobby Bonilla emptied
two of them with a one-out single. Bonilla and first baseman Eric
Karros were stranded after Matt Luke struck out looking and Mark
Grudzielanek went down swinging.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers would manufacture only one more run, on Eric Young's
solo homer in the fifth. Nothing new there. The Dodgers had scored
three or fewer runs in seven of their previous 10 games (and lost
five of the seven).
</P>
<P>
   That's why hearts in the Dodgers dugout sank when Andres
Galarraga sent starter Chan Ho Park's 16th pitch of the game into
the center-field seats to put the Braves ahead 3-0 before any
Dodger had taken a swing.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the Dodgers' bats have been so quiet, they belong in
library stacks, not dugout racks. Grudzielanek's single in the
sixth was his first hit in three games; Luke's grounder to third in
the fourth was his first contact with rawhide in six at-bats;
Cedeno is hitless in this series, which concludes today.
</P>
<P>
   Luke is a rookie, Cedeno is in his first full season in the
majors and Grudzielanek is adjusting to his surroundings, having
been a Dodger for all of two weeks. Those looking for scapegoats
could round up those three and herd them off to the guillotines
along with struggling first-year players Trenidad Hubbard and
Adrian Beltre.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for excuses could blame injuries to two starting
pitchers (Ramon Martinez and Ismael Valdes) as well as another
starter, shortstop Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Those looking for answers would do well to look hard in the
mirror (president Bob Graziano and general manager Tommy Lasorda,
that goes for you, too).
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't reflect well on the leadership in the clubhouse that
center fielder Raul Mondesi was charged with driving under the
influence earlier in the season or that outfielder Gary Sheffield's
family had to be bought off (in the form of all-expense-paid trips
to Denver) before he would agree to participate in the All-Star
game at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bode well for the chemistry in the clubhouse when
Karros, another avowed leader, points a finger of blame for the
Dodgers' recent bumbling and stumbling in the general direction of
the younger players, as he did after Saturday's setback.
</P>
<P>
   How, pray tell, is Hubbard helped by Karros pointing out a day
after the fact that the key to Friday's 5-2 loss was not
Galarraga's three-run homer but Hubbard's at-bat in the fifth
inning? Hubbard stepped up to the plate with two outs, runners on
first and second and the Dodgers down by three, chased a 3-1 pitch
and popped out to end the inning with Mondesi on deck.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Hubbard could have tried to draw a walk _ or at least
a full count. But before teeing off on his teammate, Karros should
have considered this: Maybe Hubbard has seen one or more of the
veterans' baleful stares and was trying, with one mighty swing, to
show them he deserves to be here.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's trying to prove he belongs in the big leagues,'' Karros
conceded in an effort to cushion his criticism. Next time Karros
should try a pat on the back, administered in private.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the target is the playoffs, a pitch (or a teammate), the
Dodgers might as well be swinging at rainbows. They entered the
weekend six games behind the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race. If
the Cubs win 50 percent of their remaining games _ hardly a Ruthian
task considering 21 of Chicago's next 27 games are against teams
with losing records _ the Dodgers will have to win 26 of their
final 39 games to erase the gap.
</P>
<P>
   Winning two in a row would be a start. Winning four in a row
would be a first.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to make some run,'' Bonilla said.
</P>
<P>
   But how, if not with stellar pitching or timely hitting?
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe we can hold a seance,'' Bonilla joked.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they should summon Fifi, the Poodle Lady from San Pedro,
who said she wasn't dogging it to make a statement about the team
but rather ``to entertain the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   All you know is her bark was worse than the Dodgers' bite. &QL;

<P>
   Barry Switzer is long gone, so we've all put back into the
woodshed that tar, those feathers and those nooses.
</P>
<P>
   Now, allow me to dig up a Fisher forecast, pre-Chan Gailey's
hire, that went something like this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerry says he plans to keep the next coach from `being saddled
with the sort of criticism that surrounded Barry.' Jerry, I don't
wanna bet. That's almost a certainty, not just because it's your
plans, but because it's ours. Prediction: ... The next coach gets
more free rides here than a supermodel hitchhiker.''
</P>
<P>

complete with everything from scenes from a game of Clue (''Col.
Mustard in the kitchen with a candlestick; ``Michael Irvin in the
dormitory with a scissors'') to four 12-men-on-the-field violations
in one sequence against Seattle to a 16-3 loss to Oakland that was
even more embarrassing than the previous debacle against the
Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   Amid it all, Gailey receives nothing but praise and
understanding as the media assessors keep pumping gas into the Chan
Gailey Honeymoon Limousine.
</P>
<P>
   How did it go again? Switzer's successor ``gets more free rides
here than a supermodel hitchhiker.''
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, however, it should be pointed out that training
camp is the time when organizations must work out their kinks. Some
are fortunate enough to be able to do it smoothly, like the Denver
Broncos have. Others, like the Oakland Raiders, probably outkink
even the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   A training-camp tale each from two AFC West cities:
</P>
<P>
   We go to Oakland, where it was only a brief line of agate type
in the transactions one day, and then another brief line the next
day. But it represents an NFL personnel guy's training camp
nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   First the Raiders announced the signing of defensive lineman
Shannon Clavelle. Then a reporter informed Raiders boss Al Davis
that Clavelle has something of a shady background.
</P>
<P>
   Turns out that days before his signed with Oakland, Clavelle had
been arrested in Stillwater, Okla., on charges of being a prowler.
When Stillwater police were booking him, they discovered he was a
fugitive from justice in Colorado and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Clavelle made bail and started his trip to California. But
before he could be fitted for a uniform, he was out of a job. Davis
had cut him, meaning Clavelle got to be a Raiders Bad Boy for just
20 hours, upon which time he was forced to return to his day job _
Real-Life Bad Boy.
</P>
<P>
   Now we go to Denver, where they're already looking forward to a
fifth exhibition scheduled for 1999. Why? Because, coach Mike
Shanahan says, the game in Sydney, Australia, against the Chargers
will come in handy for whomever replaces the then-retired John
Elway at quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``\ROwner\S Pat Bowlen asked me about a fifth game next year and
I said, knowing our current situation, I'd be for it,'' Shanahan
says. ``You would really like that fifth game, to put an
inexperienced quarterback or an experienced quarterback in a
situation where he could have as many reps as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos are scheduling 1999 exhibitions based on the
anticipated retirement of players? Now that's the sort of luxury
planning of which the Cowboys and Raiders can only dream.
Numbers game
</P>
<P>
   The lucky number for the Vikings is five:
</P>
<P>
   The Vikings might have stability in ownership now with the
takeover by Red McCombs. Now if they get some stability at
quarterback going into the playoffs. In coach Denny Green's six
seasons, the Vikings have reached the playoffs five times. And in
each of those five tries, they've been quarterbacked by a different
guy: Sean Salisbury (1992), Jim McMahon ('93), Warren Moon ('94),
Brad Johnson ('96) and Randall Cunningham ('97). Keep Johnson
healthy this year, say the odds, and Green keeps his playoff streak
and his job.
Trivial pursuit
</P>
<P>
   From the You'll Never Guess Department: Who leads the NFL in
interceptions in the last three years? Try Keith Lyle of the Rams
with 20.
Quotable
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy Central'''s Craig Kilborn cracks wise on the proposed
new pro football league: ``Analysts are excited about the new
league and predict it will offer many exciting new opportunities to
exclude blacks from coaching and management jobs.''
Check out. ...
</P>
<P>
   Quarterback Doug Flutie, already a fan favorite in Buffalo, but
growing tired of some observers' negativity. ``For eight years in
Canada nobody asked how tall I was,'' says the 5-foot-10 Heisman
Trophy winner. ``Nobody cared. Did you win? That's all that
mattered.'' Flutie had a few go-rounds in the NFL, remember, with
New England and Chicago, before becoming a CFL superstar. In his
past two seasons in Toronto, he won two Grey Cup titles, threw for
11,000 yards and 76 touchdowns with 41 interceptions. He begins the
season backing up big-monied ex-Jag Rob Johnson, but if the Bills
struggle, Flutie is certain to be the people's choice.
</P>
<P>
   THE BUZZ NFC
Arizona first-round draft choice Andre Wadsworth, the pass-rusher
who was supposed to help turn the franchise around, has instead
spent the week talking of returning to school at Florida State, one
more example of why the Cardinals will remain the Cardinals as long
as the Bidwill family is in charge. ... Bam Morris is in the Bears'
camp, the running back-turned-drug offender now weighing in at 257
pounds. Bam's supporters say he's athletic enough to handle the
extra tonnage, but he's running 40-yard dashes in the 5-second
range, meaning Cowboys offensive lineman Larry Allen could smoke
him in a sprint. ... Packers general manager Ron Wolf says Green
Bay's only real problem is depth in the secondary. ... The Bucs
have beaten the bushes for talent, which is why the college with
the most representation on their roster isn't anywhere near Notre
Dame or Nebraska or Florida State. It's Texas A&AMP;M-Kingsville, the
Division II school with five of its former players in the Bucs'
camp. ... Robert Brooks' back problems could cause him to miss the
next month, a far bigger story if not for Green Bay's astounding
ability to overcome lineup changes at wide receiver. ... With
Carmen Policy no longer running the 49ers, look for the natural San
Francisco-Oakland preseason meetings to become an annual event.
Policy's dislike and distrust of Al Davis is among the reasons the
series was discontinued after 1993 despite a history that dates to
1967. ... Watching Mike Ditka coach the Saints is like watching
classic Warner Bros. cartoons: You don't know exactly when it's
going to happen, but you know it's going to happen. And you know
it'll have something to do with an anvil, some ACME dynamite, or an
unseen cliff. ... Most popular attraction at 49ers camp? Julie
Cialini, the 1995 Playboy Playmate of the Year and girlfriend to
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller. This is apparently the way things
work in San Francisco: Play quarterback and date a model. Ask Joe
Montana.
AFC
</P>
<P>
   Interesting little trick the NFL included in the fine print of
its rules regarding the Cleveland franchise: The club, which has
the benefit of extra draft picks, cannot use any of those picks to
pry a coach loose from his current club. This is to prevent a
repeat of that nasty Jets-Patriots-Bill Parcells business. It also
makes Green Bay, Kansas City and Pittsburgh feel more secure about
the respective futures of Mike Holmgren, Marty Schottenheimer and
Bill Cowher. ... Pro Bowl tackle Gary Zimmerman isn't doing this to
the Broncos on purpose, but the way he sort of winks every time he
says he's retiring (again) is a Denver disruption. ... Bengals
runner Corey Dillon, coming off a fine rookie season, is setting
his sights on a 2,000-yard season. Two problems: One, Dillon
probably doesn't have that sort of talent; Two, to rush for 2,000
yards your team must be ahead frequently late in games, and
Cincinnati definitely doesn't have that kind of talent. ...
Parcells says he is trying to avoid a quarterback controversy with
the Jets yet he starts Glenn Foley one week and starts Vinny
Testaverde the next week. A contradiction? Yes, but Parcells'
handling of quarterback controversies (see: Phil Simms, Chapters I
and II) makes him beyond reproach in this area. ... Did you hear
about Jimmy Johnson going berserk on the sideline after Dolphins
cornerback Terrell Buckley got too physical with a Redskins
opponent last weekend? Buckley got too physical, so Jimmy grabbed
Buckley by the facemask and did the same. ... Fernando Smith had
asked the Cowboys and other clubs for $1.3 million for a one-year
deal. The ex-Vikings defensive end took one more shopping trip
around the NFL and landed in Jacksonville _ at a cost of $1.6
million. ... As with Troy Aikman and his frequent salary
restructures, Denver quarterback John Elway is being made out a
hero because he's re-done his deal to lower his 1998 salary to an
eye-popping $300,000. It makes for a good story but remember: These
quarterbacks aren't giving back money; they're just deferring it to
another year, in many cases at a higher rate to reflect interest.

BAD SPORTS TAKE ROOT WHERE CIVILITY ONCE THRIVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bill Curry is not one to say sport was kinder and gentler in his
day, the 1960s and 1970s, when he played in the NFL for Vince
Lombardi and Don Shula, or the 1980s, when he coached at Georgia
Tech and the University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was never nice and gentlemanly in the NFL,'' he states.
``We always kicked each other in the pile.''
</P>
<P>
   But Curry has noticed a change in the level of sportsmanship
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   He recalls a freshman player he coached at the University of
Kentucky in 1993 who, on the opening kickoff of the season, drilled
the return man at the 20-yard line and proceeded to strut his way
into the opponent's end zone, drawing an unsportsmanlike conduct
penalty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach, I don't know why I did that,'' Curry recalled the
suddenly contrite player saying on his return to the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have to explain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew why,'' Curry said. ``That's all he'd ever seen on TV
growing up. You've got a bunch of 18-year-olds today who've been
told they're great and who see their heroes mouthing off on TV.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our culture is not interested in civility. Naturally, that
carries over into the athletic arena.''
</P>
<P>
   A great many other people involved in sports, including players,
coaches, administrators and fans, agree with Curry's blunt
assessment. Sportsmanship, they say, is declining at a rapid rate.
And society is the poorer for it.
</P>
<P>
   At a time when pro basketball players choke their coaches,
baseball players spit on umpires and college athletes expect their
teammates to cheat in order to win, has sportsmanship lost all
relevance in today's society?
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who has followed athletics in America over the past 20
years must conclude there has been a general erosion in the
standards of acceptable conduct for coaches, athletes and fans at
competitive events,'' says Big Ten Conference Commissioner Jim
Delany.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think sportsmanship is dead,'' Vic Bubas, former men's
basketball coach at Duke and former commissioner of the Sun Belt
Conference, said in The NCAA News. ``The state of it is pitiful,
awful. (And) I think the worst is ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone is as pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   Many athletes and sports officials believe sportsmanship is
still a viable notion. What's more, they say, as long as bad
sportsmanship is noted and criticized, there is still hope that it
will improve. Yet, even optimists acknowledge the situation has
been getting worse in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in sportsmanship, some observers say, reflects a
larger societal problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Times have changed,'' says tennis great Billie Jean King.
``Look at life. Look how fast the world moves. I just think people
are more outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a society whose character, whose moral fiber, is
definitely being challenged,'' says Alan Page, an NFL Hall of Fame
lineman who now is an associate justice of the Minnesota Supreme
Court. ``Athletes are only the very visible tip of the iceberg in
this problem, but they have a special obligation to be people of
character.''
Roll call of bad sports
</P>
<P>
   No one can pinpoint just when the alarm sounded that signaled a
decline in sportsmanship. But several high-profile events likely
set it off.
</P>
<P>
   Among them:
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore Orioles' infielder Roberto Alomar's spitting at umpire
John Hirshbeck during an argument in a game late in the 1996
baseball season. This is widely cited as a symbol of the eroding
control of authority figures in sports.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago Bulls forward Dennis Rodman head-butting a referee,
kicking a courtside photographer in the groin during a game,
routinely skipping practices, and fighting with and mocking
opponents _ yet keeping his job on a world championship team and
being idolized by many youths. More than anyone, Rodman
demonstrates that in today's world of sports, an athlete can
disrespect everyone, including himself, and still prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Golden State Warriors guard Latrell Sprewell choking his coach,
P.J. Carlesimo, during an argument at a basketball practice,
tearing down, for good, perhaps, the invisible wall of restraint
between player and coach.
</P>
<P>
   Boxer Mike Tyson biting the ear of fellow heavyweight Evander
Holyfield during a fight in Las Vegas, registering a new low even
in the most maligned of sports.
</P>
<P>
   In between, there have been any number of baseball beanball
brawls, on-court basketball battles and hot-dogging and showboating
scenes by touchdown-scoring football players and slam-dunking
hoopsters.
</P>
<P>
   Then there have been the cheap shots, the low blows and the
chemically enhanced performances, plus fan riots, referee baiting
and opponent taunting. Finally, there are coaches who run up the
score to assure their ascent in the weekly polls or who push
recruiting regulations to the limits in order to procure the best
talent.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the on-the-field unsportsmanlike behavior occurs ``in
the heat of the moment,'' according to athletes, and even sports
ethicists reluctantly accept such actions as an occasional part of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   There also are those who argue that the appropriateness of some
acts widely regarded as unsportsmanlike _ ``excessive'' celebration
and taunting, to name two _ is in the eye of the beholder.
According to that argument, an athlete's cultural background
determines his behavioral boundaries on the playing field.
</P>
<P>
   But other recent acts, the Sprewell choking incident for one,
clearly go beyond these boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   Not that sport was ever pure, its athletes completely virtuous.
Certain unsportsmanlike acts from the past stand out years, or even
decades later.
</P>
<P>
   For violence in the playing arena, look back to 1972 when
several players on the University of Minnesota basketball team
brutally attacked an Ohio State player during a game for the Big
Ten Conference title.
</P>
<P>
   Former Ohio State football coach Woody Hayes' punching of a
Clemson University football player on the sidelines at the end of
the 1978 Gator Bowl is forever frozen in our memories. Indiana
basketball coach Bobby Knight's ongoing physical confrontations
with his own players (hitting) and with officials (chair tossing)
is legendary.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Ali, renowned today for his statesmanship, helped
legitimize taunting in sports with his merciless baiting of
opponents ranging from Sonny Liston to Joe Frazier.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball great Ty Cobb is remembered for his ruthless ways with
opponents and fans as well as for his Hall of Fame playing career.
</P>
<P>
   ``One can go back 20 years or 30 years or 40 years and find the
same sort of thing,'' Page says of unsportsmanlike behavior. ``But
maybe there's been an increase in the level and the quality of the
misconduct. I have a sense that it's increased.''
</P>
<P>
   It's unlikely that even the most laissez-faire modern-day
athlete would sanction outright violence in the sporting arena, but
many see nothing unsportsmanlike about the theatrics that often
accompany a big basket, a game-turning touchdown or a monster home
run.
</P>
<P>
   What old-time ballplayers, sports officials and administrators
regard as taunting or excessive celebration, many contemporary
athletes regard as a style of celebration. To them, standing at
home plate and watching their home-run ball leave the park,
prancing into the end zone after a score, or mugging for the camera
after a slam dunk is all just part of the show.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran NFL defensive back Ray Crockett explained that position
in an ESPN interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you ever been out on the island, one-on-one, for the game
winner,'' he asked, ``and they throw the ball and you knock it down
or intercept it? Have you ever had that feeling?''
</P>
<P>
   If you had, Crockett said, ``You might want to high-step like
Deion Sanders for a minute and say, `That felt good.' You know what
I mean?''
Hard to define, easy to spot
</P>
<P>
   Sports philosophers don't offer a single definition of
sportsmanship, but most say it is rooted in ethics and hinges on
fair play and respect for one's self, one's opponent, officials,
spectators and the game itself. Though tough to define, just about
anyone involved in sports knows good or bad sportsmanship when they
see it, and no society would say it is unimportant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concept of sportsmanship is absolutely essential precisely
because it captures the ethical dimension of our games,'' said
Russell Gough, a Pepperdine University professor and author of
``Character is Everything: Promoting Ethical Excellence in
Sports''.
</P>
<P>
   In sports, as in society, there must be a minimum, basic ethical
foundation or a minimum of ethical values, Gough told ``The NCAA
News''. If not, he adds, ``Our games will self-destruct.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, says Diana Nyad, a record-breaking long-distance
swimmer who is now a sports journalist: ``We have come to a point
where, like in war, everything is tolerated. This is sports, and
everything is acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are frequent examples of good, even
outstanding sportsmanship. On one recent Sunday, sports fans got to
see Iranian soccer players present white flowers to Team USA before
their World Cup match. Afterward, the players exchanged jerseys.
The scenes gave some small hope that through sport, ruptured
political relations between the nations might someday be repaired.
</P>
<P>
   On that same day in June, golfer Payne Stewart showed true grace
after losing a substantial lead and the U.S. Open championship to
Lee Janzen. Stewart not only complimented Janzen and faced the
media with honesty and openness, he flashed a self-deprecating
sense of humor that put the tournament and the role of sport in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   At the Winter Olympic Games in Nagano, Japan, gold-medal
cross-country skier Bjorn Daehlie waited in the cold for the
last-place finisher, Philip Boit to cross the line. When Boit, the
first Kenyan to participate in the Winter Games, completed the
event, Daehlie, without fanfare, was there to give him a pat on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   These examples of good sportsmanship do offer hope to future
generations of athletes and fans. As it is, concerned sports
officials say, bad sportsmanship by adult athletes is having a
negative effect on children.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Alliance for Youth Sports, a
Florida-based nonprofit organization, 70 percent of children will
quit sports by age 13 ``because it isn't fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Alliance says 45 percent of children have been called names
and insulted while playing sports, and 71 percent wouldn't care if
no score was kept _ so severe are the consequences of having to
win.
</P>
<P>
   Those alarmed about the decline in sportsmanship at lower levels
of competition cite the influence professional athletes have on
youths.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys (pro athletes) have become heroes to the younger
generation. They dominate the stage of the child's imagination,''
says Jeff Benedict, former research coordinator at Northeastern
University's Center for the Study of Sport in Society. Celebrity,
status, wealth and fame, Benedict says, are now more important than
character, truth and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Many athletes say they are aware of the influence their actions
have on young players.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pattern themselves after us,'' says Mike Modano, the most
prominent member of the Dallas Stars. ``They act like us on the
playing field.'' For that reason, he adds, ``You really have to be
on your toes.''
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence suggests that the emphasis on winning by any
means necessary has had a detrimental effect on the behavior of
young athletes. High school sports have seen a shocking series of
unsportsmanlike acts in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., the dentist father of a high school
football player filed down the metal buckle on his son's helmet to
a razor-sharp edge that subsequently cut and injured five opposing
players. The father hoped to prevent opponents from grabbing his
son's helmet.
</P>
<P>
   In Colville, Wash., a high school wrestler, incensed that a
referee had penalized him a point for throwing a shoulder into his
opponent, head-butted the official, knocking him unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my temper, I guess,'' the wrestler explained.
</P>
<P>
   Locally, Fred Gomez, the father of defending Class 4A doubles
tennis champions Jessica and Vanessa Gomez of Colleyville Heritage,
was ejected from the regional tournament in Denton after he was
accused of throwing orange peels at a Highland Park player in the
stands.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Nathan Shafer, a former wrestler at MacArthur. He
pushed a referee, shoved a camera into a photographer's face, got
into an altercation with a security guard and knocked over a food
table after losing a semifinal match at the Texas State High School
Wrestling Championships last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a doubt, sportsmanship is in serious trouble,'' says
Ken Mays, a 33-year-old probation officer from Arlington and coach
of a girls youth basketball team.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the time you'll find parents and coaches with the
wrong attitude,'' Mays says. ``Winning can't be the sole reason for
being out here, especially at this age.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays found it necessary to go out to the bleachers before a
recent game and tell parents: ``Remember, these are kids. We're out
here to encourage them and support them. If they mess up or don't
do as well as you think they should, please don't get on them.''
</P>
<P>
   Mays touches on a point made by sports psychologists when
discussing the erosion of sportsmanship. That is, there is a
greater emphasis than ever on winning in sports. No longer is it
honorable simply to play your best and to play fair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, society right now is `win at all costs,''' says
Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman. ``I don't believe in
winning at all costs. You do everything you can to win, but you've
got a certain set of rules.''
Providing good examples
</P>
<P>
   If anything positive can be taken from the discussion of the
sorry state of sportsmanship, it is that groups have begun to
organize to call attention to the problem.
</P>
<P>
   National Sportsmanship Day, an annual event since 1991, was
developed by the Institute for International Sport, ``to create an
awareness of the issues of ethics, fair play and sportsmanship in
athletics and in the broader context of society.''
</P>
<P>
   The event provides a forum for athletes, coaches,
administrators, fans and parents to discuss those issues. More than
10,000 schools participated in the event this year.
</P>
<P>
   Further, resource materials such as instructional videotapes are
being produced and made available to student-athletes and their
coaches to teach players the basic principles of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Big Ten Conference now distributes a pamphlet
to athletes and coaches that calls for a ``commitment to fair play
and ethical conduct in sports,'' according to Jim Delany.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the pamphlet states that, ``Conduct intended to
intimidate, embarrass or demean the opponent by players, coaches or
fans is contrary to the educational mission of intercollegiate
athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The guides come none too soon for Delany.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on a slippery slope on the sportsmanship issue,'' says
Delany. ``The conduct of the playground was coming into
intercollegiate athletics. It was not just the examples of taunting
or unsportsmanlike conduct, but also the increasing presence of
self adulation masquerading as celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   Such efforts offer hope that sportsmanship, however wounded, is
not dead. But even more Draconian action may be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's time,'' says Alan Page, ``for the sports world to
consider a code of conduct, a code of ethics.''

GAMESMANSHIP VS. SPORTSMANSHIP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID A. MARKIEWICZ 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A popular television commercial of a year or so ago featured
retired bad-boy basketball player Bill Laimbeer instructing
nice-guy basketball star Grant Hill in the finer points of on-court
gamesmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Flopping, ref-baiting, the undetectable elbow.
</P>
<P>
   It was a funny spot, but it also showed just how accepted
gamesmanship has become in sports. And sports ethicists say it's
another sign of the general erosion of sportsmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Gamesmanship does not include breaking the written rules of the
game, but it does go well beyond the standards of good
sportsmanship, says Scott Kretchmar, who heads the graduate program
in sport philosophy at Penn State University.
</P>
<P>
   Kretchmar calls gamesmanship, ``the art and science of gaining a
strategic advantage through morally questionable means.''
</P>
<P>
   A lack of moral courage ``has allowed for an increasing amount
of gamesmanship,'' Kretchmar said. ``It's been reduced to the point
where wins are valuable, not the way you win.''
</P>
<P>
   One prominent example of gamesmanship: A baseball manager has
the bat of an opposing batter who's on a hitting tear checked for
cork, even though he knows it's not corked. The idea is to distract
the batter and reduce his effectiveness at the plate. Two variants:
have a pitcher checked for a foreign substance on his body, merely
to throw off his rhythm; call time-out before the opposing kicker
attempts a game-winning field goal in order to ``ice him.''
</P>
<P>
   Gamesmanship, sports ethicists say, is unsportsmanlike precisely
because it takes away from the legitimate means of determining who
is the best on a given day in a particular sport.
</P>
<P>
   It is a practice, they say, that disrespects the sport.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, acts of gamesmanship have become standard practice.
Kretchmar notes that nowadays ``there is no tension between
sportsmanship and gamesmanship,'' meaning that people don't
distinguish between the two anymore.

BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS DURING INTERVIEW BETTER INDICATOR OF JOB
PERFORMANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAX JARMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
You're cool, calm and collected, and all of a sudden the
interviewer wants to know if you ever ran out of Halloween candy
while there were still trick-or-treaters on your street.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Did you turn out the lights and pretend you weren't home, or,
did you improvise with some nuts or cookies from the kitchen?
</P>
<P>
   Your first reaction is, ``Huh?'' But, if you're involved in a
behavioral interview, your job prospects depend on giving the
correct answers to such seemingly irrelevant questions.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new concept, but it is increasingly thought to be a
better predictor of job performance than traditional interviews and
is growing in popularity among recruiters and human resource
professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very hot right now,'' said Rick Camp, who teaches
strategic inter viewing in the University of Michi gan Business
School's executive program. ``Everybody who is state of the art is
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Behavioral interviewing seeks to evaluate candidates by
assessing their specific actions and behaviors in given
circumstances. It is loosely based on the concept of behavioral
consistency in which past behavior is thought to be the best
indicator of future actions.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to eliciting general infor mation about a
candidate's knowl edge or expertise, interviewers, using the
technique, encourage subjects to recount, in detail, job situations
and the results of specific actions, even for seemingly minor
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   An airline customer service agent has to be able to deal with
angry people, so an interviewer might ask appli cants to describe
their last experience with an angry person, or customer.
</P>
<P>
   People in sales have to occasionally put people in uncomfortable
situa tions, so a candidate might be asked to describe the last
time they had to deliver bad news to a group or individual.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazingly effective,'' said Marc Blessing, vice president
of corporate development Management Recruiters International, a
Cleveland-based search and recruitment firm, that trains companies
how to use the technique. ``An interviewer can tell much more about
a person's atti tudes, work habits and skills by hearing them
describe real actions taken in real circumstances than by letting
them go on in abstract terms about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Deb Johnson, a recruiter with U-Haul International in Phoenix,
has been using the technique for about three months and swears by
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very effective means of interviewing,'' she said.
``You're able to determine how a person would approach a situation
in the future based on what they did in the past.'' She said it
also is an effective means of reducing turnover, by improving the
odds of hiring the right person in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing noted that some employers estimate the cost of choosing
the wrong candidate at three times the employee's first-year
salary. And that doesn't include the cost of having the position
effectively vacant until a productive individual can be found, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Given the cost of a bad hiring decision and the generally tight
prevailing labor market, Blessing said companies are looking at be
havioral interviewing as a means to improve their odds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In today's market you can't afford to make a hiring mistake or
to miss out on talent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Blessing said studies have shown that conventional interviews in
which candidates are asked to give opinions on their abilities can
be no better at picking the right candidate than flipping a coin.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have rehearsed answers and fancy comebacks to the
questions,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One of the chief advantages of behavioral interviewing,
according to Camp, is that candidates are unable to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't just come up with a canned answer, he explained.''
</P>
<P>
   But to get the most out of the process, the interviewer needs to
know what success is and what questions will measure that success.
But most importantly, the inter viewer needs to know what answers
demonstrate the level of success required.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are doing behav ioral interviewing, but they
are ask ing the wrong questions and anticipating the wrong
answers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the movement there is debate whether the questions should
ask what candidates did in a particular situation, or what they
would have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some candidates may not have had a particular experience, but
they have the knowledge insight and skills to have handled it
properly,' Camp said.
</P>
<P>
   Although it's harder to rehearse answers to behavioral interview
questions, some candidates can gain an advantage over others if
they recognize the technique and are prepared to answer questions
in an appropriate way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more a question of making the interview go a little
better by know ing what's required of you,'' blessing said.
</P>
<P>
   He offered candidates these sug gestions for recognizing
behavioral techniques:
</P>
<P>
   _ Behavioral interviews often begin with a statement that the
interviewer will be looking for specific instances from real
situations in answer to the questions and that the candidate should
not be nervous about pausing to consider answers.
</P>
<P>
   _Questions often begin with words such as, ``Tell me about a
specific situation in which you . . .''
</P>
<P>
   _When the candidate wanders to ward generalities, the
interviewer will often coax the candidate back to specific
examples, asking for the names of people, their titles and other
concrete details. Often the interviewer will rephrase the question
so it sounds different, but elicits the same information.
</P>
<P>
   To prepare for the possibility of a behavioral interview,
Blessing offers this advice:
</P>
<P>
   _Decide what your chief skills or strengths are and fix in your
mind actual experiences that exemplify them. Be sure to recall or
remind yourself of dates, names, quantities or other measurements
of success.
</P>
<P>
   _Understand the description of the job for which you are
interviewing and be prepared to recall specific actions and
behaviors which address the skills needed for the position.
</P>
<P>
   _Specificity is more important than vague proclamations of
skills. Small but telling actions and behaviors are more important
than unsubstan tiated claims of job success.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one expects you to have sin gle-handedly saved the world,
the company and your immediate boss from sure ruination,''
Management Recruiters President Allen Salikof said. ``They simply
hope that you're the one who can effectively do the job they're
hiring for.'' &QL;

RIP SPORTSMANSHIP: IT SEEMS AS THOUGH WE HARDLY KNEW YE 
WITH SPORTSMANSHIP PACKAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LEBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sportsmanship used to be winning and losing with grace.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship was respecting your opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship was respecting the game itself.
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship, ultimately, was knowing how to behave.
</P>
<P>
   We are gathered here today, therefore, to mourn the passing of
Sportsmanship. It died, without so much as a mention on
SportsCenter, after a long and fitful illness.
</P>
<P>
   Pallbearers included its former allies Humility, Honesty and
Fairness. Two more recent acquaintances, Greed and Selfishness,
were invited to carry the casket, but, without calling anyone,
elected not to show up.
</P>
<P>
   The great Jim McKay, who spent a career extolling Sportsmanship,
delivered the eulogy. Conversely, out of respect for Sportsmanship,
all ESPN anchors and radio talk-show hosts in attendance were
ordered to tape their mouths shut.
</P>
<P>
   Attending physicians weren't certain exactly sure how
Sportsmanship died.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody charged the pitcher's mound and pummeled him to
death,'' one said.
</P>
<P>
   Another doctor offered, ``I think somebody forced him to take
anabolic steroids and try out for the East German Olympic team.''
</P>
<P>
   There is also the possibility, police say, that Sportsmanship's
death was hastened by foul play.
</P>
<P>
   Suspects include Mike Tyson, Latrell Sprewell, Ben Johnson,
Rosie Ruiz, Jackie Sherrill, Dennis Rodman, Olympic snowboarders,
Albert Belle, Bryan Marchment, Jerry Tarkanian, Tonya Harding and
nearly all of the 1980s Southwest Conference football teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The list is a lot longer,'' a detective said. ``Sportsmanship
just wasn't important to a lot of people anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Newspaper files show that Sportsmanship survived an early
assault at the hands of the 1919 Black Sox. But Sportsmanship
developed chronic pulmonary problems from recurring college
football and basketball scandals. In the late 1970s, Sportsmanship
also began to lose its voice, unable to be heard over the din from
people like John McEnroe and Bobby Knight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roberto Alomar spat in the face of Sportsmanship once,'' a
local historian recalled. ``A lot of other athletes knew
Sportsmanship was good, but they kept looking in their mirrors and
never could find him.''
</P>
<P>
   As usual, the public blamed the media for its role in
Sportsmanship's passing. People pointed to the media's increased
coverage of Sportsmanship's longtime nemeses, Rule-Bending and
Showboating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it _ Sportsmanship had become dull,'' a network
official said in defense.
</P>
<P>
   At the funeral service, a special section of the pews was
reserved for professional golfers, who stoically bore the news of
Sportsmanship's passing. A book in the vestibule listed the names
of all golfers who voluntarily disclosed that they would not be
able to attend.
</P>
<P>
   Scotland's Colin Montgomerie said he wouldn't come to
Sportsmanship's funeral ``because I only vaguely knew the man.''
</P>
<P>
   Seated in the choir loft were Little League coaches and assorted
voices from various youth sports leagues. Some planned to sing an
earnest tribute to Sportsmanship; others, having neglected to learn
the lyrics, instead chose to merely lip-sync them.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the coaches scanned the church and expressed their
displeasure that the sanctuary did not have a scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It figures,'' said one disgruntled coach. ``Sportsmanship
never made a big deal about winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Taking the pulpit, the Honorable Fair Play, judge and longtime
friend of the deceased, brought to mind some of Sportsmanship's
finest friends and moments:
</P>
<P>
   Cal Ripken Jr. ... Wayne Gretzky ... NHL players shaking hands
after each Stanley Cup playoff series ... marathoner Frank Shorter
crossing the finish after 26 miles, and then standing at the line,
greeting each competitor as he finished.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sadly,'' Sportsmanship's old ally said, ``the list isn't as
long as it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship will be remembered as good and decent, and as
ethical and moral. Why people turned their backs on Sportsmanship
may never be known, but it is believed that the indifference
started at a young age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't important,'' said a parent at the burial. ``I
mean, it's not like it was going to help my kid get a
scholarship.''
</P>
<P>
   Sportsmanship is survived by its close cousins, Manners and
Hope.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to maintain dignity, Don King was not allowed to
show the funeral on pay-TV.

GUARANTEED: LASORDA FEELING WEIGHT OF LOSSES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Tom Lasorda was Dodgers manager, he always took the losses
hard. But nothing like this.
</P>
<P>
   For 20 years, he always had a job, no matter his place in the
standings or the general manager's heart. Now, that position is
his, but with no guarantees for the future.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty showed on his face Saturday afternoon as he
emerged from manager Glenn Hoffman's office after a 5-3 loss to the
Atlanta Braves in front of 41,240 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda spent more than 15 minutes in his former office with
Hoffman. The pictures of Rickles and Sinatra were gone.
Unfortunately, so were Garvey and Cey.
</P>
<P>
   He never got loud like that day in Cincinnati years ago when his
voice pierced two concrete walls and a glass partition. But the
pain was still there.
</P>
<P>
   As general manager, he has made moves and they aren't helping.
He has been working the room trying to keep spirits afloat, but if
the eighth consecutive loss to the Braves over two years was any
indication, he can't get blood out of this Dodgers stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very tough on him,'' Hoffman said. ``It's tough on
everyone. We aren't out of it, but we can't seem to get this turned
around.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps even more painful for Lasorda is knowing that someone
else will be in his chair next year. The owners at Fox have
reemphasized the search for a new GM in 1999. Lasorda knew the only
way to keep the job was to win and go deep into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   He even guaranteed the Dodgers would win the wild-card race
three weeks ago when he was in Cooperstown. Now, they are 6{ back
with 39 to play and Lasorda has gotten permission from several
clubs to talk to prospective GMs. That list is expected to include
Florida's Dave Dombrowski and Cincinnati's Jim Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Both of them have experienced games like Saturday, when the
Braves won despite playing poorly.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta got a first-inning, three-run homer by Andres Galarraga
off Chan Ho Park (10-7) and never gave up the lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive game Galarraga won with a
three-run shot. It also was the second game Dodgers pitchers walked
Chipper Jones before Galarraga homered.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves gave two runs back in the bottom of the first when
second baseman Tony Graffanino botched a potential inning-ending
double-play grounder and Bobby Bonilla followed with a two-run
single.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Bonilla started at third in place of rookie Adrian Beltre,
just two games after the Dodgers benched him for injuries and poor
play. They also didn't want to expose Beltre to Braves right-hander
John Smoltz, who is now 11-2 after coming off elbow surgery last
winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We gave them a bunch of opportunities,'' Smoltz said. ``But
fortunately things aren't going well for them right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla also singled in the fourth and walked in the eighth. He
caught a difficult popup near the Dodgers dugout in the second
inning. He cleanly handled five chances, including an inning-ending
double play in the first after the Braves threatened to keep the
rally alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If playing once in a while is the way it's going to be, then
that's what I'll do,'' said Bonilla, who will start at third in the
series finale against Braves left-hander Denny Neagle. ``You aren't
going to see me fight the Dodgers on this. I will do what they
want.''
</P>
<P>
   What they want most of all is runs.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers played without Gary Sheffield (sore right thumb) for
the second consecutive day. When Sheffield pinch hit for struggling
Matt Luke with runners at first and second and no outs in the
eighth, he represented the go-ahead run. The Braves replaced Smoltz
with left-hander John Rocker and Sheffield grounded into a double
play.
</P>
<P>
   Things looked better in the fifth, when trailing 4-2, singles
hitter Eric Young homered to left. It looked like it could be a
boost, but it also might have hurt. Young flied out in his next two
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta, which has the National League's best record (82-41),
added a run in the sixth when Jones doubled home Michael Tucker.
Park had walked Tucker, one of six in the game.
</P>
<P>
   He came back to strike out Galarraga, but was done for the day.
Park now has dropped two in a row after winning 11 straight at
Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Park was one of the pitchers who responded when Lasorda and
Hoffman replaced the fired Fred Claire and Bill Russell on June 21.
</P>
<P>
   That used to make Lasorda smile. Now, nothing works.

RANGERS NEED TO REDO GONZALEZ'S CONTRACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Something for the Rangers to start thinking about:
</P>
<P>
   Rafael Palmeiro turned down a three-year, $21 million contract
from the Orioles the other day.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle will make $11 million next season.
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa will be in the second year of a four-year, $42
million deal.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Sheffield has a six-year, $62 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rangers hold options on Juan Gonzalez for $7.25 million
in 1999 and $7.5 million in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with this picture?
</P>
<P>
   By comparison to those players mentioned above and many others,
Gonzalez will be playing for loose change the next two seasons. One
of baseball's most productive hitters will be making $3 million a
year less than players who can't carry his socks.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rangers' brass can clap their hands and celebrate their
good fortune in having such a bargain on their hands for the next
two seasons ...
</P>
<P>
   Or they can do the smart thing and work out an extension for
Gonzalez _ with a healthy signing bonus _ in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   He is still just 28 years old with his prime hitting years ahead
of him.
</P>
<P>
   He is also smart enough to know his value and moody enough to
let it bother him if he feels his team isn't showing him the
respect he deserves.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers were incredibly far-sighted when they signed him to
a long-term contract following the '93 season. What was big, big
money then now seems truly economical today.
</P>
<P>
   They will look even smarter if they act quickly to keep their
most important player happy and locked up with this team far into
the future. ...
</P>
<P>
   You may have heard lots of talk on the radio about the stiff
neck that sidelined Gonzalez for three games last week, but
insiders say there have been absolutely zero raised eyebrows in the
Texas clubhouse, where his teammates seem to appreciate all he has
done to keep himself in the lineup this season. ...
</P>
<P>
   Message to Johnny Oates: Your catcher looks like he needs three
or four days off to recharge his batteries. Remember when Kevin
Elster wore down in September of '96 in the middle of a pennant
race? ...
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Chan Gailey, because of his daily afternoon press
briefings during training camp, has been the Cowboys' point man in
dealing with the Irvin-McIver dorm incident with the media. That
concerned his family, who really hadn't seen him quite like this
before. ``They would call and ask me how I was doing,'' Gailey
says. ``They weren't worried about what was going on with the team,
they were worried about me. I appreciate that and I love them for
it.''...
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys' officials wonder why Will Clark was able to leave the
Rangers for three games for ``personal reasons'' earlier this
season without a full-scale media investigation while the Cowboys
couldn't handle their own internal situation the same way without
wholesale protests. Answer's easy: Because good citizen Clark was
involved in the former, Michael Irvin in the latter. Get it? ...
</P>
<P>
   Owner Jerry Jones admits that Gailey's honeymoon with the media
probably kept this situation from being even worse than it has
been. ``I think Chan has gotten some of the benefit of the doubt
that Coach Landry would have received,'' Jones says. ``It is
recognized that this man has standards. Had it not been Chan, this
could have been a lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chan has come in here and helped create what has been a good
feeling about our team and he deserved that. But let's face it,
along the way, Chan is going to have bruises.''...
</P>
<P>
   Gailey may sound like he's cutting rookie defensive end Greg
Ellis a little slack when he says that the first-round draft pick
has been put into a difficult situation by being thrust into a
starting role in his first year, but when pressed on how Ellis will
be graded, Gailey pulls no punches. ``He'll be graded,'' Gailey
says, ``as a starter who has to make plays.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   Gailey has also grown tired of watching tight end David LeFleur
drop passes. ``If \RLeFleur\S catches the next 30 in a row, his
average will be pretty good,'' Gailey says. ``Right now, it's
pretty bad. That's what we're assuming will happen \Rthat he'll
catch 30 in a row\S.'' We won't hold our breath. ...
</P>
<P>
   Bill Bates is a super person and was an over-achiever as a
player. But Ring of Honor? Please. ...
</P>
<P>
   Before they dumped Elster, the Rangers discussed moving Fernando
Tatis to shortstop to get more athleticism at the position, but
decided against it. Infield coach Bucky Dent thought he could teach
Tatis to play second, but not short. ``That's not something you
want to do when you're trying to win a pennant,'' Oates says. ...
</P>
<P>
   A National League scout says that when Rangers were talking
trade with the Expos for left-hander Carlos Perez, they told
Montreal that minor league infielder Warren Morris was untouchable.
Then they traded him to Pirates for Esteban Loaiza. Good choice.
...
</P>
<P>
   Conventional thinking is that Orlando Hernandez is likely the
odd man out of Joe Torre's postseason rotation, but if it's the
Yankees and the Rangers, how can he not start ``El Duque'' against
Texas after watching Thursday night's two-hit, 13-strikeout
masterpiece? ...
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Oates plays the percentages as much as any
manager in baseball, and that right-handers were hitting .144
against Hernandez, you have to wonder why he started Mike Simms in
right field when he had left-hander Warren Newson and switch-hitter
Luis Alicea on the bench. Rangers right-handers went 1-for-15
against Hernandez, and Simms struck out three times....
</P>
<P>
   Combat pay: ``Star-Telegram'' Rangers beat writer Johnny Paul
was hit square in the mouth by a ricocheting baseball in the dugout
in Cleveland last week. No loose teeth but you could read Gene
Budig's signature on his right front tooth. ...
</P>
<P>
   And former Metroplex author, sports columnist and talk show host
Skip Bayless, now with the ``Chicago Tribune'', escaped with bumps
and bruises despite broadsiding a semi en route to an interview at
the Bears' camp a couple of weeks ago. Trying to check his map,
Bayless says he skidded through a stop sign on wet pavement....
</P>
<P>
   Reports that Cubs' phenom Kerry Wood has a ``dead arm'' amuse
veteran right-hander Orel Hershisher. ``I wish I was tired and
could throw 97 miles an hour,'' Hershiser says. ...
</P>
<P>
   Former DePaul and Mavericks' star Mark Aguirre is among 17 who
will be inducted into the Chicagoland Hall of Fame on Sept. 24.
Harry Caray is also on that list.

EXPERTS ON SOUTHERN CULTURE SAY IT'S TIME FOR ATONEMENT

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The months of singing, clapping and praying are
nearly over, and it's time for Bill Clinton to present himself for
atonement in the Baptist tradition.
</P>
<P>
   For those Americans who have been watching the presidential sex
scandal with mounting incredulity, experts on Southern politics and
religion have an explanation:
</P>
<P>
   The legal drama is actually a Southern religious pageant about
redemption. It is less about small perjuries and more about large
sins like adultery. And in this tradition the customary conclusion
is the big, public, tearful confession. Witness televangelist and
Louisiana Pentecostal preacher Jimmy Swaggart.
</P>
<P>
   Both Oran P. Smith, author of ``The Rise of Baptist
Republicanism,'' and Charles Kimball, a Baptist minister and
chairman of the Wake Forest University religion department, say
they are surprised that Clinton hasn't chosen to take the
traditional Baptist way out of his dilemma, rather than waiting for
the grand jury to do it for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep expecting President Clinton to walk down the aisle of
the Billy Graham Crusade,'' Smith said. ``It almost couldn't fail
for him to say he is a fallen creature like everyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Swaggart, photographed with a prostitute in 1988, tearfully
begged his congregation and his family for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have made your load heavier. I have hurt you,'' he said in
husky whisper. ``Please forgive me for sinning against you.''
</P>
<P>
   On the strength of his repentance, Swaggart regained his
ministry and was rebuilding his national television following when,
in 1991, he was again photographed with a prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   It's time, Smith said, for Clinton to ``walk the sawdust
trail,'' the trip up the aisle of the revival tent after the altar
call, where the sinner asks for forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he did do something he has to apologize for, then I think
if he were to come forward and repent in some way, the probability
of forgiveness is much higher,'' Kimball said, echoing the
sentiments of Sen. Orrin Hatch, a devout Mormon, just a few days
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   If many Americans are confused by the events in Washington, it
may be because they fail to understand how much Washington has
become dominated by Southern political culture, including its
fundamentalist faith.
</P>
<P>
   Special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, a Texan, is a devout Sunday
school teacher and son of a minister in the fundamentalist Church
of Christ.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually all of the leaders in Congress are Baptists, the
largest single religious denomination in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the Republican leadership, such as House Speaker
Newt Gingrich, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, President Pro Tempore
of the Senate Strom Thurmond and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.
</P>
<P>
   It also includes a majority of Democratic leaders, including the
Arkansan Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, who hails from Tennessee,
House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt of Missouri and Senate
Minority Whip Wendell Ford of Kentucky. Baptists all.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Southern Baptist Convention, the apparatus of the
Republican Party is now largely controlled by religious
conservatives. It is they who are awaiting Clinton's trudge up the
sawdust trail, and there is the sense that nothing less will
satisfy them than the old ending to the central story of the faith.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, there is more to this case than politics and religious
pageantry, Kimball warns.
</P>
<P>
   Underneath the Clinton scandal, ``You do have a question of
morality and leadership. Someone who is sworn to uphold the
Constitution and the laws of the land makes it more difficult to
just wink at an issue like this,'' he said. &QL;

HINGIS TO MEET DAVENPORT IN FINAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Lindsay Davenport may be from nearby Newport
Beach and may be the hottest player in women's tennis, but that
didn't persuade the crowd in Manhattan Beach to favor her.
</P>
<P>
   Heck, Davenport probably wouldn't have cheered herself, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand,'' Davenport said of the crowd's affinity for
sentimental favorite Monica Seles. ``Whenever I watch Monica, I
cheer for her, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, the lack of support Saturday night did not aversely
affect Davenport, as she required only one hour to beat Seles 6-4,
6-2 in the semifinals of the Acura Classic at Manhattan Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   The second-seeded Davenport will meet top-seeded Martina Hingis
in the final today at 11:45 a.m. It will be their third meeting
this year (they have split the other two). Hingis holds a 6-4
career advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martina is not going to give Lindsay the unforced errors that
I gave her,'' Seles said. ``They're ranked 1 (Hingis) and 2
(Davenport), so it should be pretty even.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Davenport is a distant second, she has been dominant
lately, winning the past two Corel WTA events and 11 straight
matches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a lot to beat her,'' Davenport said of
Hingis. ``Martina is going to want to win and win badly, send a
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles sent a message to Davenport when she opened the match by
taking a 3-0 lead. Davenport settled down, however, and allowed
Seles just three more games in the match.
</P>
<P>
   The key? Davenport had 14 unforced errors to Seles' 34. ``I just
started making errors out of the blue,'' Seles said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport concurred, saying, ``She was missing a lot of balls. I
didn't do anything spectacular to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Seles would have liked to put forth a better effort in front of
a crowd that was so partial to her. ``They've been so nice to me
here,'' Seles said of the fans, ``so it's so frustrating because of
how I played.''
</P>
<P>
   The pairing was a rematch of last year's Acura Classic final, in
which Seles won 5-7, 7-5, 6-4. Saturday night's match, however, did
not have nearly as much drama.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably wasn't as good as last year's final,'' Davenport
said. ``I don't think Monica was at her best, but I'll take a win
against her.''
</P>
<P>
   In a semifinal Saturday afternoon, Hingis beat third-seeded
Arantxa Sanchez Vicario 6-4, 6-4. Sanchez Vicario had a 4-3 lead in
the second set, but Hingis recovered to win three straight games.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis' win propelled her over something of a hump because she
had lost in the semifinals of her last three tournaments. ``I can't
believe I'm in the finals,'' Hingis said, facetiously. ``I don't
know how it feels anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis has won her past seven matches against Sanchez Vicario
and owns a 7-1 career record against her. When she plays the
Spaniard, Hingis said, she feels more in control than against other
high-ranked players.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gives me more time to do some things,'' Hingis said. ``The
other ones _ like Lindsay, Monica and Mary Pierce _ hit through the
ball real hard. I don't have control against them. ... Against
Arantxa, I feel like I'm the personality on the court.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanchez Vicario said she was pleased with her play, even though
she lost and took more risks than in a typical match. ``When you
play against Hingis, you have to go for more shots than you
normally do,'' she said.

ANALYSTS GIVE DVDs POSITIVE SPIN 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE McNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Digital versatile disc players are well on their
way to joining TVs, VCRs, PCs and CD players as a must-have
consumer electronics product.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs have already moved from the periphery as a favorite toy for
the so-called ``new adapters'' who buy leading-edge gizmos.
Mainstream status seems inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   One trade group predicted last week that DVDs are within four
years of becoming a mass-market item. By the year 2002, there will
be DVD video players in 8.6 million American homes and factories
will produce 183 million discs, according to the study by the
International Recording Media Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at 2002 as only the beginning,'' proclaimed Charles Van
Horn, IRMA executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs and players went on sale 18 months ago and are expected to
be in 800,000 homes by the end of the year, IRMA projects. Other
trackers believe that figure could reach 1.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   DVDs, which are the same size as audio compact discs with seven
times the capacity, play full-length movies with digital clarity,
offer six-channel sound and instant rewinding, and store massive
amounts of information such as trailers, deleted material and
interviews. A basic DVD player retails for $400 while discs sell
for $20 each. The number of outlets selling DVDs will hit more than
12,000 at the end of this year, compared to 5,000 at the end of
1997.
</P>
<P>
   The trade group also said typical consumers are buying DVDs at a
rate of 15 to 20 per year, compared to 10 to 15 VHS videotapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``IRMA's statistics chart a rapid rise for DVD during the next
four years as the format establishes a strong consumer niche for
itself,'' Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   ``DVD ... is a rather small marketplace in comparison to VHS,
but as the first true convergence entertainment product, the
potential, according to our statistics, is tremendous.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding further fuel will be the inclusion of DVD-ROM players in
most new personal computers. IRMA projects combined worldwide
production of DVDs will reach 430 million in 2002 while DVD-ROMs
will reach 850 million.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Adams, president of Adams Media Research, says IRMA's
statistics may be on the conservative side based on what he
foresees as strong sales during the upcoming holiday season. He
notes that DVDs are growing at similar rates to compact discs when
that format was rolled out in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that round discs are in and cartridges
playing in machines with moving parts are out,'' Adams asserted.
``I don't see any reason to change the view that it's going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRMA projection came in the same week as a trio of key
developments that underscore the growing importance of DVDs:
</P>
<P>
   _ 20th Century Fox dropped its opposition to the format and
announced plans for eight titles to be released later this year.
Fox's move was crucial because it had been the lone major studio
holdout on DVDs and because its endorsement clears the way for
Paramount and Fox to release a DVD version of box-office megahit
``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Fox and Paramount come out with a `Titanic' DVD, it will
really propel the market,'' said Jay Frank, sales manager at home
electronics retailer Evolution Audio in Agoura Hills. ``This format
is not a fad. It's here to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Image Entertainment Inc., which remains the nation's largest
laserdisc producer but is scrambling to ramp up its DVD operations,
turned around profits for its quarter ended June 30 with earnings
of $205,000 compared with a loss of $191,000 in the year-ago
period. Sales rose to $17.1 million from $16.9 million with 38
percent of the 1998 revenues from DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the company's stock is not tracked by any Wall
Street analysts, investors have significantly boosted the share
price as an endorsement of Image's commitment to DVDs. The stock's
value rose from $3.0625 at the end of March to $10 last month. It
closed at $8.125 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are obviously betting that DVD will grow,'' said
Jeff Framer, Image's chief financial officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realize DVD is the future, but we still have to do
laserdisc,'' added Framer, who believes much of the interest in
DVDs has come from technophiles and early adapters who already own
laserdisc players, which usually cost $1,000 each plus $50 a pop
for the laserdisc. ``DVD has done so well because it already has a
captive audience and it's so much cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   Jae Kim, an analyst with Paul Kagan Associates in Carmel,
Calif., credits Image's management for having the foresight to
diversify. ``They saw the handwriting on the wall and knew that
their future would evaporate like a water drop in the Sahara if
they relied solely on laserdisc,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Image will move its distribution operation next month from Los
Angeles to a state-of-the-art facility in Las Vegas but will keep
corporate headquarters and production operations in L.A.

GOLF ENTHUSIASTS GET ONE SHOT AT MONITORING TOUR EVENT ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOMMY CUMMINGS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Golf fans tend to get defensive with critics who contend that
watching the sport on television is boring.
</P>
<P>
   Well, let's see how they defend watching the sport on monitors
smaller than most TV screens and listening to soft-talking
announcers on audio that sounds like AM radio.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at noon tomorrow, PGATour.com will join forces with CBS
Sportsline, GolfWeb (www.golfweb.com) and USA Today Online to
produce live Internet coverage of the $2.5 million AT&AMP;T Pebble
Beach National Pro-Am in Pebble Beach, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   It's unprecedented because the one-day event _ which began in
February but was postponed when rains swept through Monterey Bay _
will not be televised, not even by the Golf Channel.
</P>
<P>
   That's right. The whole shooting match is online.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas-based Broadcast.com will provide live audio from the
tournament's three courses. Simul-Sports will furnish panoramic
digital photographs for an interactive view, which will be combined
with the audio feed and the PGA Tour's real-time Java-enhanced
leader board powered by the IBM Corp. PGATour.com provides links to
the necessary multimedia plug-ins.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds so high tech, but it's simply one more way to watch
golf these days.
</P>
<P>
   Golf fans can get a head start watching the 'Net by accessing
the 80th PGA Championship's official site (www.98pga.org), which is
being produced by PGA Interactive and CBS SportsLine, for today's
final round.
</P>
<P>
   The Pebble Beach event is a one-time shot because the tournament
is not going to be televised, said Jerry Milani, a spokesman for
CBS SportsLine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the success, it might be something that will be
done more often.'' Success will be measured by viewership numbers
and feedback from viewers about the quality of the cybercast,
Milani said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be interesting to see how this all translates to
the Internet,'' Milani said.

Review: Outdoor International (outdoorinternational.com).
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, Outdoor International plans to introduce a
directory of international online hunting and fishing guides, which
would make this well-done site ``true'' to its name.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Outdoor International, created by Dallas
resident Mitch Lewis, gives outdoor enthusiasts plenty of resources
for planning their next domestic fishing or hunting trip.
</P>
<P>
   The site allows visitors to search through more than 18,000
professional guides and outfitters. Users can search by city,
state, game and fish species, saltwater, freshwater or even their
favorite lakes and rivers. Users can also receive weekly fishing
reports via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoors International also includes a news ticker for the
latest on events in the outdoors world. Links on the site direct
users to information regarding hunting or fishing dates, seasons
and limits. One of the more interesting features is Bragging
Rights, where users can tell tall tales of their outdoors exploits.
</P>
<P>
   Plans are to create a trading area, a retailers database and
message boards. If those features pan out, it will be hard to find
a site that can top Lewis' effort.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis is an avid outdoor enthusiast who, with his wife Amy,
hunts in South Texas near El Campo and tries ``fishing anywhere and
everywhere as much as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Considering the work necessary to maintain such an elaborate
site, it brings up the obvious question: When do they find the time
to hunt and fish? Rating: HHHH (out of five stars)

LOS ANGELES: operations in L.A. 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients)
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ Warner Bros. is planning a special 25th anniversary release of
``The Exorcist'' on DVD even though the horror hit was one of its
original DVD releases last year. There are now well over 1,000
movies released on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   The new version of ``The Exorcist,'' with a price tag of $24.95,
includes a 75-minute BBC documentary, an introduction by director
William Friedkin, a separate documentary on storyboards and
production, outtakes of sound effects, commentary by screenwriter
William Peter Blatty and three original trailers.
</P>
<P>
   One potential problem has emerged for DVDs: a rival pay-per-view
format, Divx, that carries the backing of retailing giant Circuit
City. The Divx system is being tried out in the San Francisco and
Richmond, Va., markets and will go nationwide next month.
</P>
<P>
   With Divx players, consumers rent titles for viewing that become
unviewable in two days, eliminating the need to return the disc.
But opposition has emerged over the issue of the consumer
electronics industry establishing a beachhead with the long-term
goal of making the consumer pay per use on all forms of
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, many retailers aren't pleased since they believe
they'll be cut out of most revenues. Tower, Suncoast, Sam Goody,
Hollywood Video, Fry's Electronics and Warner Bros. _ the strongest
Divx proponent _ have bought billboard space in San Francisco to
proclaim, ``Only Open DVD Delivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Adams, however, believes the format war is somewhat incidental
over the long term. ``Divx will appeal to some people who want the
feature, but I think that arguing against it may be shooting the
overall business in the foot,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Kim, the major issue isn't competing formats, it's piracy.
If codes are unscrambled, copies made by criminals could be of much
higher quality than typical illegal copies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've always been optimistic about DVD,'' he said. ``The only
real thorn has been copy-protection issues because if someone is
able to bust the encryption, they can derail it. That's exactly why
there needs to be severe penalties.''
</P>
<P>
   As for more distant future, Adams believes that the DVD format
will eventually have to offer recordable features. ``Recordability
could be the next wall that DVD faces, but we probably won't get to
that for five to 10 years,'' he said.

RODRIGUEZ FULFILLING CANSECO'S PREDICTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Seattle's Ken Griffey, Jr. hit his first home run
since July 30 on Saturday and 42nd overall, and it is unlikely he
can catch Roger Maris' single-season home run record.
</P>
<P>
   But Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez appears poised to join
another exclusive group, the 40-40 club for home runs and stolen
bases.
</P>
<P>
   Entering today's series finale with the Chicago White Sox,
Rodriguez has 36 homers and 35 stolen bases. He never thought he
would reach such a lofty plateau, but someone else did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was 17 years old and Jose Canseco said `You'll do it,'''
Rodriguez said this past week. ``He said, `All you have to do is
average five home runs and five stolen bases a month all season for
30-30.'''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco was the first to do 40-40, in 1988 with Oakland. San
Francisco's Barry Bonds joined him in 1996 and just missed last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know talent,'' said Canseco, now with the Blue Jays. ``In
the off-season down in Miami, we were playing flag football and I
saw his acceleration and said `Whoa!' I told him then _ and this
was about six years ago _ that he could be the best shortstop in
the majors.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he closing in on that title?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, he's there now,'' Canseco said. ``There are some good
ones, but Alex has more speed and more power than anyone else, and
he can play the position.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was delighted with the rave review, and with the
memories of their first meetings in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd play volleyball, basketball, flag football,'' he said.
``Jose can't play basketball at all, but he's great at the others.
He gave me a lot of confidence, telling me that kind of thing when
I was just a high school kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco has struggled with injuries in recent seasons, but he
has a chance for another 40-40 season this year. He has 32 home
runs and 26 stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest part is the home runs,'' said Canseco, who said
he didn't think 50-50 is possible. ``You walk, get a hit, get on
base on an error, you can steal second and third and get two. You
can get a steal on the back end of a double steal. The only way to
get a home run is to hit one over the fence.'' &QL; 
BOWDEN A DODGER?
</P>
<P>
   The last time Cincinnati GM Jim Bowden talked to the Dodgers, it
was in late May about trading shortstop Barry Larkin. That is all
about to change.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have begun seeking permission to talk to Bowden
about filling their general manager position. Interim GM Tom
Lasorda won't be back next season, but he has been put in charge of
finding his successor.
</P>
<P>
   It probably is a good time for Bowden to leave. He is in the
midst of a feud with club president John Allen, who has been
running the Reds during the suspension of owner Marge Schott.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, the two men deny any ill feelings and each have issued
statements denouncing published reports about a rift. But the two
have been strained since Allen asked Bowden to start slashing the
payroll.
</P>
<P>
   It got worse when Allen signed right-hander Pete Harnisch to a
three-year contract while Bowden was trying to shop Harnisch.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden compared the situation to the Dodgers' big May 15 Mike
Piazza trade with Florida. Dodgers executive vice president Fred
Claire was left out of the dealing when Fox took over the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden publicly says he's loyal to the Reds. But he loves to
spend and wants to win, and the Reds can do neither right now. His
name also has surfaced in Baltimore as a replacement for retiring
Pat Gillick. &QL;

McLane's box Wednesday night to see Randy Johnson pitch. Ryan and
Johnson are old friends and fans of each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``He helped me a lot,'' Johnson said. ``A lot of the success I
had when I went to Seattle came from things he suggested.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangers fans might not be thrilled with Ryan's helping an
opposing pitcher, but Ryan said pitchers are pitchers, no matter
what uniform they're wearing.
</P>
<P>
   Like Ryan, Johnson was plagued by control problems early in his
career. Johnson's problem was mechanical. Ryan developed perfect
mechanics growing up in the New York Mets organization and never
lost them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's a power pitcher, somebody I had something in common
with, and we talked pitching,'' Ryan said. ``I don't look at it
that way (as helping the opposition). We helped each other.''
</P>
<P>
   The two have stayed friends and Ryan, who lives in Alvin (about
40 minutes south of the Astrodome), was thrilled to see the Astros
acquire Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to see a World Series in Texas, and maybe this will
help us get one,'' he said. &QL; 
INDIANS READY TO DEAL?
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland has added Cecil Fielder in the wake of Jim Thome's
hand injury. Thome will be out four to six weeks with a broken
fifth metacarpal after getting hit by a Wilson Alvarez pitch last
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   But their major concern is if Kenny Lofton, David Justice and
Sandy Alomar Jr. don't improve, the Indians won't last long in the
postseason no matter what moves are made. Lofton (leadoff), Justice
(usually No.3 hitter) and Alomar (bottom third of the order) have
key spots in the lineup. They've all played well below par this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Lofton: He's still having a better season in the leadoff spot
than Marquis Grissom did in 1977, but has failed to ignite or
inspire an offense that sorely needs a kick in the butt. He's
hitting .274, which is far below his career average of .316 and his
.333 average from last year with the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   He has 11 homers and 54 RBI, but is hitting only .256 since the
All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   After hitting .344 with six homers and 29 RBI in April, Justice
has disappeared. He has hit .257 with 10 homers and 33 RBI since.
Usually good against left-handers (.322 last year) Justice is
batting .225 this season.
</P>
<P>
   Justice has been unable to play much in the outfield because of
offseason surgery on his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Justice hit .329, 31 doubles, 33 HRs, 101 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Most knew Alomar wouldn't repeat last year's career season _
.324 average, 37 doubles, 21 homers, 83 RBI, game-winning hit in
All-Star game, 30-game hitting streak, and a great post-season.
</P>
<P>
   But on a recent 12-game trip, Alomar batted just .105 and has a
season average of .247 overall with six homers and 37 RBI. Last
year, he hit .321 with runners in scoring position. Ths year it's
.207. &QL; 
HIT MAKERS
</P>
<P>
   The 1999 option for NL MVP Larry Walker has kicked in, and
that's good news for Walker and the Colorado Rockies. Walker says
he wants to finish his career in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was my decision four years ago, and four years later, it
still is,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Rockies are happy because they have one of the game's
best players at a relatively cheap price.
</P>
<P>
   Walker is earning $5.875 million this year, and the option year
_ which kicked in at 1,075 plate appearances in 1997-98 _ is for
only $5 million. There are 36 players, including the Dodgers' Bobby
Bonilla, making more than Walker this season. There could be a
renegotiation at some point, but Walker isn't about to complain
about the four-year, $22-million-plus-option deal he signed before
the 1995 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anybody in this world can be underpaid when
you're making $5 million a year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of hitters, of Dante Bichette's 19 homers this year, 12
have either tied the game or put the Rockies ahead. The latest came
Monday, when his grand slam broke a 2-2 tie in a 6-2 win. That came
one day after he went 4 for 5 with five RBI that pushed him to the
100 mark for the fourth consecutive year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I probably appreciate that the most _ coming through when it
counts,'' Bichette said. ``I feel like I've been consistent. That's
what I love to do more than anything _ drive in runs. I feel I
should drive in more than 100 every year.''

Astros nip Cubs on errant throw by Mulholland
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
The Astros spent 3{ hours trying to take a victory away from the
Chicago Cubs, and Terry Mulholland gave them one in a matter of
seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Call it luck, call it destiny, or just simply call it Astroball.
The Astros have found some dramatic and creative ways to pull out
games in the late innings, but Saturday night's 5-4 victory over
the Cubs was a new one for the comeback kids.
</P>
<P>
   After walking the bases loaded in the 11th inning, Mulholland
induced a two-out hopper back to the mound from Derek Bell. The
veteran lefthanded pitcher seemed to hurry his throw, which sailed
over Mark Grace's outstretched arm at first base, and pinch runner
Tim Bogar hustled home with the winning run in the Astros' 21st
victory in their final at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got very lucky tonight,'' said Astros closer Billy Wagner
(3-3), who struck out five of the six batters he faced and
qualified for the victory. ``Any time something like that happens,
you know someone is looking out for you. You're not going to see
very many games end like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, when it comes to the Astros, local fans have learned
to expect the unexpected. The prospect of losing all three games in
their series with the Cubs looked real in the third inning when the
visitors took a 4-0 lead. After dropping Friday's series opener, an
early deficit was not a good sign, considering Kerry Wood will be
on the mound today for the Cubs, who fell one-half game behind the
Mets in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   But the Astros steadily chipped away at the deficit, thanks in
large part to a heroic effort by Moises Alou, who hit two homers,
singled and scored three times to spark his team's 37th comeback
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I have enough superlatives to talk about the
kind of season he's having,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said of
Alou.
</P>
<P>
   It would be about the same as talking about the kind of season
the Astros are having. Their 76-47 record is the best 123-game
start in franchise history, and they increased their National
League Central lead over the Cubs to nine games with seven meetings
remaining between the two teams.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's game was witnessed by 52,003 fans _ 68 shy of the
regular-season Astrodome record. The crowd erupted when Alou tied
the score in the ninth with a blast off Cubs closer Rod Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I go to the plate, I'm very confident,'' Alou said.
``I like to be in the spotlight and in the pressure situations.
Beck made some good pitches to me, but he left a (forkball) over
the plate, and I took advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs took advantage of Astros starter Mike Hampton in the
third inning, but he eventually got the last laugh. After breezing
through the first two innings without incident, Hampton found
himself in the middle of a crisis in the third when the Cubs sent
10 batters to the plate and scored four runs. Every Cub reached
base in the inning except starting pitcher Kevin Tapani, who struck
out twice, and Manny Alexander, who lined out sharply to center
field.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the third-inning damage against Hampton occurred on
balls that never left the infield. Sammy Sosa, who was hitless in
his first 24 career at-bats against Hampton, drove home one run
with a bases-loaded infield single, and Glenallen Hill followed
with a two-run hit that caromed off Jeff Bagwell's glove and rolled
into foul territory near first base. Jose Hernandez contributed an
RBI double to the scoring spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky, but they were lucky to score four runs in that
inning,'' Dierker said. ``Some of the balls weren't hit very hard
at all.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros knocked a run off the Cubs' lead in the fourth on the
first of Alou's two homers and another in the sixth on a sacrifice
fly by Bell, who has 87 RBIs this season.
</P>
<P>
   Any hopes the Astros had of getting another run in the sixth
died when Ricky Gutierrez lost track of the outs and was doubled
off first base on Bagwell's line drive to right field.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton was a different pitcher after the third inning, retiring
12 of the last 14 batters he faced, including 11 in a row during
one stretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hampton did an unbelievable job,'' Wagner said. ``He kept his
composure and kept us in the game. You can't ask for much more than
that.''
</P>
<P>
   After Alou singled and Carl Everett doubled him to third to
start the bottom of the seventh, Sean Berry pulled the Astros
within a run with a sacrifice fly to center. A perfect block of
home plate by Cubs catcher Scott Servais kept the Astros from tying
the score. Everett, perhaps being a bit too aggressive, tried to
score from third with one out on Brad Ausmus' ground ball to
Alexander, who was drawn-in at second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the best play he's ever made,'' said Everett,
referring to Servais' block. ``I tried to sneak in the back door,
but he made the play.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's 35th homer of the year _ a leadoff shot off a 3-2 pitch
from Beck _ tied the score in the ninth and forced extra innings.
Rookie righthander Scott Elarton kept the Astros close with two
perfect innings in relief of Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros appeared ready to end it in the 10th when Craig
Biggio drew a leadoff walk and Cubs manager Jim Riggleman
instructed Mulholland to walk Bagwell and Alou intentionally to
face Everett with two out. The move paid off, as Everett bounced
out to third on the first pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had situations where we could have won the game several
times,'' Everett said. ``But we finally did, and that's the only
thing that matters.''

NEW LAWS TO GOVERN ARIZONA ELDER CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MAUREEN WEST  
 and JUDY NICHOLS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last summer, Nancy Neutz made a surprise midday visit to the
adult care home where her mother was living. She found her mom
slumped in a bedroom, so drugged she couldn't sit up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I gave her the sleeping medicine too early,'' the
home's owner said. But Neutz knew instantly that the problem was
more serious than that. Her mother had been given an overdose of
tranquilizers. Neutz soon realized that the reason the house was
always so clean for visitors was that the residents were taken out
of their rooms only for meals.
</P>
<P>
   So she moved her mother to another home. She reports that the
last six months of her mother's life were spent in a caring
facility _ a good home.
</P>
<P>
   Neutz visited the home after ``The Arizona Republic's'' ``Homes
Without Hope'' series in June 1997 raised concerns about the
quality of many elder care homes throughout Arizona. She was one of
about 2,000 readers who sent letters or e-mail or made phone calls
to ``The Republic'' in response to the series, which detailed the
abuse, neglect and financial exploitation of Arizona's frail elders
in care homes.
</P>
<P>
   Although problems continue, the industry is on the brink of
major changes a little more than a year after the series appeared.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, new laws passed by the Arizona Legislature will go
into effect.
</P>
<P>
   After Nov. 1, many of the poorly run care homes will have
difficulty meeting stricter rules written by the Department of
Health Services. Their licenses will be denied as they come up for
annual renewal or apply for a new license.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the progress has come from the raised awareness and
increased involvement of family members and friends. But the most
visible changes are the result of new laws and regulations spurred
by the articles. Among those changes:
</P>
<P>
   _Fingerprinting and background checks will keep criminals from
working as caregivers. It starts Friday. The health services agency
is already swamped with requests for forms from care-home owners.
</P>
<P>
   _A care-home owner's past record can be used to deny a new
license, ending the games played by owners who close a home riddled
with complaints only to open a new one with a new name and a clean
file. It starts Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _New regulations in effect in November will require more
training for caregivers and will give residents and their families
more rights. Consumers' rights as care-home patients are spelled
out: If people want to leave a home because of financial or
physical abuse, they can leave and not be bound by a longer-term
contract.
</P>
<P>
   _Two 24-hour hotlines funded by the Legislature will be in
operation by year's end: One to report abuse and another to provide
information and referral services and emergency placements.
</P>
<P>
   The new laws and regulations offer hope that the adult-care
industry will be cleaned up. But Joan Johnson, who oversees
adult-care home licensing for the Department of Health Services,
sees a great sea of troubles to clean up with a very small mop and
bucket.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, funds for additional inspectors were not
authorized in any of the new elder-care laws. The failure of DHS to
collect nearly $1 million in adult-care license fees angered some
lawmakers, who then balked at any new appropriations for the agency
until it brings in the revenue it is already supposed to have
collected. Caught in the bureaucratic crossfire will be Arizona's
elders.
</P>
<P>
   There is no question that new inspectors will be needed: Elder
care is a growth industry, with the number of adult-care homes now
at 880, up from 656 a year ago. The number of Arizonans over the
age of 65 is expected to double over the next 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   Enforcement is nevertheless under way: Ten adult homes have been
closed by DHS during the past year and a half. Johnson promises
that it is just the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; But homes that have many substantiated claims against them are
still open. The series last summer detailed allegations of abuse,
neglect and financial exploitation in three Valley care homes run
by Pat Glaser. Since then, Glaser, who continues to have complaints
filed against her at DHS, has gotten a new license. An
administrative judge said DHS didn't prove the home was in
substantial violation of state statutes.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser declined to comment for this story. &QL; 
REFERRAL PROBLEMS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; While some of the problems in the care-home industry are being
cleaned up, there have been setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   The series last summer found referral agencies engaged in ``body
brokering'' _ moving frail residents from home to home to collect
multiple referral fees _ a practice that elder experts say can
kill.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rather than improving, the business, which places residents in
homes, has spiraled out of control the past year.
</P>
<P>
   A bill to regulate the industry died in the Legislature after
accusations were made that it would unfairly benefit the half-dozen
referral agencies that dominate the market.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than clean up practices, some feared, the law would
tighten the grip that agents have on care homes.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 care homes and assisted-living facilities have
opened, and the competition for residents has become intense. As a
result, some referral agencies are charging adult-care homes as
much as double the amount they charged last year. Some home owners
are desperate to keep beds filled and will pay agents what they
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, placement agents are demanding that home operators
pay ``protection'' to agents in order to keep the supply of elders
flowing their way, said Sharon Phillips, owner of three care homes
and president of the Arizona Adult Care Home Association.
</P>
<P>
   The ``protection,'' according to Phillips, includes the high
fees and new dues in trumped-up referral associations, which some
financially strapped owners say are so expensive that they would
have to reduce the level of care to residents in order to make the
payments.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Ferseta, into whose home Neutz placed her mother in the
last six months of her life, doesn't believe the new laws and
regulations will affect her much. Her residents at Helping Hand
Care Home receive good food and plentiful liquids, and proper
personal care and attention. The reports at DHS confirm that there
haven't been complaints about care against her home in northwest
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   New regulations will mean that her daughter and husband, who are
certified caregivers, will have to be fingerprinted and attend some
classes if she wants them to continue helping her. But that's no
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the regulations make it harder for the bad homes to
operate, maybe there will be more business for the good ones. That
is the reason I don't lose my hope,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Lindeman, executive director of the Governor's Advisory
Council on Aging, believes legislation is needed to clean up the
placement system.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the very least,'' she said, ``the law could require
referral agents to be licensed or approved by the state.'' &QL; 
RETAINING LICENSES
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is that judges' technical interpretation of the
law can allow homes to continue operating despite long records of
abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser retained her license over the objection of the Department
of Health Services, which tried in late 1997 to revoke the license
of one of her care homes in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   DHS said that Glaser or her manager, Fran Wagner, had failed to
get medical care for a week for an 80-year-old woman who fell and
broke her ankle in two places, had failed to properly document
medications for residents and had verbally abused a resident.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser said the 80-year-old had fallen twice, once on April 24,
1997, only spraining her ankle, and again a week later, sustaining
the breaks. Glaser said she had called the family the first time,
and they decided not to take the woman to the doctor, and that the
family was already planning to take her to the doctor the day she
fell the second time.
</P>
<P>
   Glaser said Wagner, accused of the verbal abuse and medication
errors, was no longer the manager of the home, but was still a
caregiver.
</P>
<P>
   The administrative judge, Kay A. Abramsohn, said DHS didn't meet
the burden of proof regarding the broken ankle or the medication
errors. And, the judge said, the verbal abuse was not a substantial
violation of the law.
</P>
<P>
   Abramsohn said Glaser's home did not threaten the life, health
or safety of residents, and therefore should keep its license.
</P>
<P>
   One particular court decision, however, has put new power into
the hands of families who have had an elderly member in a bad home.
The Arizona Supreme Court ruled in September that relatives can
collect for pain and suffering, even after a victim of elder abuse
dies.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came in the case of Fred and Frances Denton, profiled
in the ``Homes Without Hope'' series. &UR; Recently the Denton lawsuit
was settled for an undisclosed amount.
</P>
<P>
   A continuing adult-care problem is the low pay given caregivers.
The average pay is $6 to $8 an hour for jobs that are physically
and emotionally demanding.
</P>
<P>
   If more care homes have to raise wages to draw workers, those
costs would be passed on to residents of the homes and their
families, said Darlene Pasternak, a registered nurse and owner of
Citrus Manor adult-care home in Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the problem of low pay, some care-home owners
worry that new training requirements proposed will result in fewer
people to give care.
</P>
<P>
   The new DHS regulations will require that those who are hired to
care for frail elders have at least 50 hours of training or pass
out of a training course. No untrained person can be left alone
with residents. Currently, anyone off the street can be hired and
be left alone to care for residents that same day. But that will
change when the new training regulations take effect in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless this kind of work gets in your blood like it has mine,
why would anyone work for $7 an hour in a job that is awfully hard
when they could get an easier job at a hotel or store down the
road?'' asked Linda Payne, who has been a professional caregiver on
and off for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Increasing the requirements for the owners of care homes and
the managers who run them will make more difference than increasing
training or retraining caregivers,'' said Pasternak, owner of
Citrus Manor.
</P>
<P>
   She points out that the proposed new rules still require only
eight more hours of training for a manager than a caregiver. &QL; 
BEST LINE OF DEFENSE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The best line of defense for families, however, is the concerned
oversight of family members, according to Steve Lacey, an elder
care ombudsmen for Maricopa County. Without personally checking on
the home and its operators, it is impossible to know if your loved
one is in the hands of people who know _ or care _ what they are
doing.
</P>
<P>
   Every week Lacey sees advertisements for adult care homes for
sale and it worries him to think who might be buying them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like buying a Dairy Queen,'' he said. ``I worry about
someone buying into this businesses and not knowing what they are
getting into. They are responsible for the care of people in that
home.''
</P>
<P>
   There is still a gap in the law that leaves family members out
in the cold when a home is sold. Family members of residents of the
ill-fated Philadelphia Home on West Park Place in Phoenix, which
was closed July 2, weren't told that the facility had changed
hands. They found out only after six residents, one by one, were
taken to hospital emergency rooms for dehydration and pressure
sores.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hensley's family visited the home and noticed he was
losing weight. They stopped by daily with a hot meal. Viona Bogre,
also at the home, did not have children living locally. Her
daughter found out the day before Bogre died that the home's owner
and caregiver had changed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the problems of the home were well-known to DHS and
Adult Protective Services workers, relatives were not contacted by
the state agency workers who were in or out of the home.
</P>
<P>
   In Ferseta's home such considerations seem unrealistic. Who
would dream of treating people like that? She makes sure her guests
don't miss the ``Lawrence'' ``Welk Show'' on Saturday evenings and
hires a musician to come once a week to play their favorite songs,
live. Ralph Covell, a lifelong farmer, is at his finest then, and
sings along, she says. Loraine Higley, a former ballerina, moves as
best she can to the shape of the music. During breaks in the music,
Bessie Kubanis, 91, is full of bright conversation and memories of
her long career as an insurance company secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Ferseta, not unlike many other good adult care-home owners,
wants life to be beautiful and peaceful for her guests. And,
mostly, it is.  &QL;

OLERUD POWERS METS PAST D BACKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In this year of baseball's bulging biceps, it is easy
to overlook a guy who doesn't rattle the fences nearly as often as
Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   But make no mistake _ New York Mets first baseman John Olerud _
a 6-foot-5, 220-pound string bean by comparison _ can swing the
wood very well on his own terms.
</P>
<P>
   Is it too far-fetched to say that he is a legitimate candidate
for the National League's Most Valuable Player award?
</P>
<P>
   Not if he continues to hit as he has been and the Mets are able
to slip through the wild-card door and into the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud collected three hits and drove in three runs Saturday
night _ two with a home run in the first inning _ to help lead the
Mets past the Diamondbacks, 5-4, at Bank One Ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   Paired with the Chicago Cubs' loss to Houston, the Mets (66-54)
inched in front of the Cubs (67-56) by a half-game in the NL
wild-card race. Arizona, which lost its third straight and sixth in
its last seven, fell to 45-77.
</P>
<P>
   The left-handed-hitting Olerud raised his league-leading average
to .355. Olerud, who led the American League in hitting with a .363
average while with Toronto in 1993, is attempting to become only
the second man in history to win a batting title in both leagues.
The other was Ed Delahanty with the Phillies in 1899 (NL) and
Washington (AL) in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets saw a 3-0 lead evaporate as Arizona scored four times
in the sixth inning against right-hander Armando Reynoso.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White drove in two runs with a single, the 699th and 700th
RBIs of his career. Jay Bell tied it when he drove in White with a
double, and Kelly Stinnett drove in Bell with a single to make it
4-3.
</P>
<P>
   New York regained control with a pair of runs in the seventh off
Diamondbacks right-handed reliever Bobby Chouinard (0-2).
</P>
<P>
   Pinch-hitter Matt Franco drove in the first with a single, and
Tony Phillips, who drove in the winning run in a 3-2 New York
victory on Friday night in the series opener, put the Mets back in
front for good with an RBI double to left.
</P>
<P>
   The rally enabled Reynoso to remain unbeaten at 4-0. Greg
McMichael, Mel Rojas and John Franco shut the Diamondbacks down in
the last three innings, with Franco earning his 25th save.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets gave Reynoso a 2-0 cushion in the first inning when
Phillips led off with a single to right field and scored on
Olerud's 16th home run of the season. It came as right-hander Bob
Wolcott hung a 2-2 breaking pitch over the plate and Olerud, who
resides part time in the Valley and whose wife, Kelly, is a former
volleyball player at Arizona State, hit a line drive into the
right-field stands.
</P>
<P>
   Wolcott appeared to be headed for more trouble when Mike Piazza
hit a looping double down the right-field line. Arizona right
fielder Karim Garcia dove in an attempt to catch it but missed, and
the ball rolled a short distance away, not enough for Piazza to
take a chance on going to third. Wolcott then escaped further
trouble by getting Brian McRae on a called third strike and getting
Todd Hundley on a grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, Reynoso cut down a potential Diamondbacks rally
almost before it began.
</P>
<P>
   White led off with a walk and stole second. Then with two out
and Stinnett at the plate, Reynoso, known for a strong pickoff move
at first, caught White napping at second and picked him off as
second baseman Carlos Baerga snuck in behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Olerud gave the Mets a 3-0 lead in the second inning. Edgard
Alfonzo hit a one-out double to left field and scored on Olerud's
single to left. Olerud moved to second as Diamondbacks left fielder
and former Met Bernard Gilkey attempted to throw Alfonzo out at the
plate, but was stranded as Piazza flew out to Garcia in right and
McRae fouled out to first baseman Travis Lee.
</P>
<P>
   Reynoso breezed through the third and fourth, then got into
trouble in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Bell doubled to left with one out. Garcia moved him over to
third with a groundout to first for out No. 2. Reynoso then hit
consecutive batters _ Stinnett and pinch-hitter David Dellucci _
and almost hit a third, Andy Fox, before Fox tapped back to Reynoso
for the third out. &QL;

NO SNAKE EYES ROLLED  
 ORLANDO GAMBLES PAY OFF

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Rattlers Coach Danny White couldn't help but admire
the risks that his Orlando counterpart, Jay Gruden, took Saturday
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a man after my own heart,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, it was causing White's heart to palpitate.
</P>
<P>
   The Predators converted two huge fourth-down plays in the final
quarter, leaving the Rattlers among the national viewers who will
watch next week's historic ArenaBowl XII at Tampa Bay after a 38-33
loss before 14,015 fans at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando, after beating the Rattlers twice at the Snake Pit this
season, will try to capture its first title against its Florida
rival, the Storm (14-2), in the first ArenaBowl to be televised on
a national network.
</P>
<P>
   Forget last year's championship and the one they won in '94 in
Orlando against the highly favored Predators. This game was bigger
to the Rattlers because ABC Sports will show the title game. And
the loss hurt more than any other in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just from an organizational standpoint, this was probably the
biggest game we allowed to slip out of our hands,'' quarterback
Sherdrick Bonner said. ``All week, Coach White told us there would
be 50 million people watching two teams play'' in the final.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Rattlers (11-5) are among the spectators.
</P>
<P>
   One could blame a sputtering offense that continually couldn't
deliver on third-down plays, or eight blown points by the kicking
game.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, blame Orlando receiver/defensive back Barry Wagner,
who showed why he's the Michael Jordan of this league.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner, who won the league's Ironman Award as most valuable
player the past six years, returned the opening kickoff for a
touchdown. He scored on a run. He made the catch that kept alive a
scoring drive on fourth and 10 at the 2 with less than nine minutes
to play and the Rattlers leading by a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   He scored the winning points on an 18-yard catch with six
seconds left. And he intercepted Bonner's desperation pass off the
end-zone net as time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get a championship team, they know how to overcome
adversity, they know how to fight back,'' Wagner said. ``When they
need a big play, they're going to get it for you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers, who lost a two-point heartbreaker to the Predators
(11-5) on June 20, never led until Bonner found Hunkie Cooper from
11 yards out for a 33-26 lead with 10:58 left.
</P>
<P>
   Pat O'Hara completed just 18 of 38 and had only two touchdown
strikes, horrible by Arena standards. He was getting rushed and
looked out of sync with his receivers in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   O'Hara was picked off by Carlos Brooks at the 1 early in the
period, then, on the next possession, threw three straight
incompletions from his 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona came with the big heat,'' Gruden said. ``But when the
game's on the line, Pat makes the big throws.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the biggest came on fourth and 10 with the noise of
14,000 fans ringing in O'Hara's ears.
</P>
<P>
   No problem. Wagner caught a crossing route for a 12-yard gain.
O'Hara completed four more in a row, finding Robert Gordon for a
12-yard score with 5:15 left. A high snap and a wobbly pass by
holder Connell Maynor kept Orlando from regaining the lead.
</P>
<P>
   The Rattlers could have run out the remaining five minutes, but
they couldn't manage a first down after taking over on their 5 with
4:38 to play.
</P>
<P>
   On first down, Bonner went deep to Calvin Schexnayder, but
all-league defender Chris Barber made a great play to deflect the
ball away and prevent a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   On second down, Bonner's short pass missed Cooper. On third
down, Bonner had Randy Gatewood open over the middle for a first
down but missed him by inches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew they were going to come up and press us,'' White said.
``We knew the short passing game wasn't going to work, and they
were ready for the run, so you go deep. We had our chances. We had
guys open twice. Barber makes a great play on the deep one to
Calvin, or the game's over.''
</P>
<P>
   That set up the winning drive. Gruden was ready to let kicker
David Cool decide it with 19 seconds left on fourth and 4 from the
Arizona 24-yard line. But Gruden changed his mind, and O'Hara
passed 11 yards to Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to leave it up to the offense and make our drive
the last drive of the game,'' said Gruden, who led Tampa Bay to
four Arena titles as the quarterback. ``Pat made a big throw, and
Robert made a great catch.''
</P>
<P>
   After an offside penalty on Orlando, O'Hara got the ball to
Wagner in the corner of the end zone for a 38-33 lead. &QL;

MICKELSON HAS PLENTY OF TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, WASH. - Phil Mickelson shot himself out of another
major championship Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what happened, what went wrong ``this'' time, Mickelson
pressed his lips together and tilted his head as if to consider the
question from another angle.
</P>
<P>
   He said . . . let me get the exact quote. Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   ``I really couldn't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   If Lefty can't, who can?
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson had just signed his scorecard, the one that featured
five straight bogeys on the front nine and added up to 78 shots, 8
over par.
</P>
<P>
   His third round in the PGA Championship _ one of the worst
scores of the day _ had to be fresh in his mind. Yet when pressed
to assess the disaster, to explain how a player with his talent and
potential could start the day in the hunt, 4 strokes off the lead,
and fall 15 shots back, he didn't have a good answer.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson wasn't uncooperative, or evasive. ``It's not like I
was hitting the ball bad,'' he volunteered, trying to be
responsive. He mentioned 3-putting No. 1. Then there was the shot
at the fourth hole that found the rough and started the bogey
slide.
</P>
<P>
   Thoughtfully, Mickelson kicked the ashes of his round, like an
insurance adjustor at the scene of a house fire.
</P>
<P>
   The best he could come up with was a shrugging, ``I just
couldn't hit enough good shots to make par.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson doesn't owe anyone an explanation why he hasn't won a
major, and the PGA is his 26th. He didn't proclaim himself the next
Jack Nicklaus. The media did.
</P>
<P>
   The former three-time NCAA champion who won his first pro
tournament when he was a junior at Arizona State is more
disappointed in his failure to win a major title than he ever will
show publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson doesn't strike me as the type who is going to beat his
head against a ball washer or take out his frustration on his
clubs. According to legend, a Tour player mired in an awful slump
once tied his putter to the rear bumper of his sedan, like tin cans
decorating a wedding getaway car, and sped down the highway
gleefully dragging the offending stick behind him, orange sparks
flying.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson is still young, 28. He has won a dozen PGA Tour
titles. His bank account is as green as his golf bag. When he
counts his blessing, it takes a while. Overall, his life is good,
very, very good.
</P>
<P>
   Yet because he hasn't won the Masters, the U.S. or British Opens
or the PGA, Mickelson is labeled as an underachiever. His failures
are rehashed at each major championship.
</P>
<P>
   This year Mickelson tied for 12th at The Masters after he hit a
ball into the water on the final day. He tied for 10th at the U.S.
Open but never seriously threatened. He shot 85 _ 85! _ in the wind
at the British Open, finishing 28 over par.
</P>
<P>
   Now this. On what in tournament parlance is known as ``moving
day,'' Mickelson packed his game and went south, again. His solemn
march through the evergreens solidified his reputation as a player
who, like Dorothy's friends in ``Wizard of Oz,'' is incomplete.
Something is missing.
</P>
<P>
   If so, what? What prevents this player who can hit every shot
other golfers can _ and a few shots most others can't _ from
reaching the next level? You would like to think it's only a matter
of time. Look at the late-blooming Mark O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Until Mickelson wins a major, he will retain the dubious title
as the most analyzed player in golf.
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson, what is it? Are you putting too much pressure on
yourself?
</P>
<P>
   ``Possibly,'' he said, responding to a question he has asked
himself countless times. After Saturday's round, he put himself on
the shrink's couch. He said he is not visualizing good shots. ``I'm
waiting for something bad to happen, and that's no way to play the
majors.'' No, it's not.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't break through soon, Mickelson may become the first
golfer featured in ``Psychology Today.'' This week he picked up a
national magazine and saw his face on the cover. Beneath the
pensive photo of the winner of the Mercedes Championship, the first
event Lefty played this year, ``Golf World'' asked, ``Does Phil
Mickelson Have What It Takes To Win A Major Championship?''
</P>
<P>
   Obviously not yet. &QL;

PGA'S FINAL 18 A TEST FOR GOLFERS  
 SINGH, STRICKER UP BY 4 STROKES AFTER 3 ROUNDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL HUFFMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Neither Vijay Singh nor Steve Stricker has ever
won a major golf title, and there is no reason to believe that the
80th PGA Championship will be a first. The signs are too ominous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's pretty hard to argue with a 4-shot lead, which Singh
and Stricker maintain with 18 holes to play at Sahalee Country
Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are pretty good players at the top,'' noted Mark
O'Meara, who is seeking his third major victory of the season, as
well as a piece of history.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will find out a lot about themselves'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Singh knows it, just as he is aware that his best finish in 23
majors is fourth place in the 1993 PGA. He has never contended,
really.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody within 5 or 6 shots still has a chance,'' said Singh,
who was shaky early in Saturday's third round, then rolled in three
straight birdies beginning at the 13th hole for a 3-under 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, there's more pressure on me and Steve,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker, who never has cracked the top 10 in 11 previous
majors, was slightly tentative after his 66. Like Singh, he is at
7-under 203.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever been in this position before, so hopefully, I
can come out like I did (Saturday) and play aggressive,'' said
Stricker, who fired bogey-free golf, capping his round with a huge
save from the trees at No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm playing well, and Vijay is playing well. We both
had a good tournament last week'' at the Buick Open.
</P>
<P>
   Good, but not great. Stricker actually shared the lead in that
event with Billy Mayfair going into the final round, and Singh was
1 shot back. Stricker ended up tied for sixth, while Singh tied for
eighth. Neither broke par.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is this trend to the 1998 season: The winner in the
three previous majors has come out of the blue. O'Meara did not
lead The Masters until the last hole and never lead the British
Open until late on the back nine. U.S. Open champ Lee Janzen
trailed by 7 strokes with 16 holes to play in that tournament
before an unbelievable rally overtook Payne Stewart.
</P>
<P>
   Plus, there are some thoroughbreds left in this horse race that
are capable of making up ground quickly, the most notable being
Davis Love III. The defending champ shook off a poor start with
three late birdies for a 69 that got him to 3 under.
</P>
<P>
   Also at that number were 1995 PGA champ Steve Elkington, who
bogeyed the last hole for a 69, and Mayfair, the Buick winner, who
shot his second straight 67.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm swinging so well and putting so good that when I hit a bad
shot, I'm not worried about it,'' said Mayfair, who made his second
eagle of the tournament at No. 2, where a 3-iron from 200 yards set
up a 6-foot putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's really the difference when you're in a (groove) like
I'm in. That, and you're making a few more putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Four players were at 2 under, including O'Meara with a 69 and
his sidekick, Tiger Woods, who overcame ``control problems'' for a
70.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I can go out and shoot a good, solid round in the mid-60s,
you never know,'' said Woods, who made a strong showing three weeks
ago in the final round of the British, where he came up 1 stroke
shy of making the playoff won by O'Meara.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Woods needs a round like the course record 65 posted by
Greg Kraft on Saturday, when the temperatures _ and the scores _
dropped at Sahalee.
</P>
<P>
   Not that everyone got hot. There were several major pileups,
most notably by Colin Montgomerie, who started the day 3 back of
Singh and limped in with a 77. Scottsdale's Phil Mickelson wasn't
much better. He trailed by 4 to start the day before disappearing
with a 78 that pushed him 15 shots to the rear.
</P>
<P>
   But Sahalee can do that to a player in a subtle way, especially
if you get lost in its deep, dark woods. Whether that happens to
Singh, a five-time winner, or Stricker, who has won twice, remains
to be seen. They certainly have the big-time games to hold up.
</P>
<P>
   The majors, however, are a strange brew. Winning that first one
often takes a player to the outer limits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you win a major, it changes everything,'' O'Meara said
earlier in the week. ``But it's a very unpredictable, unscientific
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me 17 years, and I thought I was a very good
player.'' &QL;

KEALY TOUGH NUT TO CRACK  
 ASU QUARTERBACK IS READY TO LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON, ARIZ. - Behind every good man . . . is a sister knocking
his backside into the bushes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Want to know where I learned to be tough?'' Ryan Kealy said.
``When I was young I lost to a ``girl.'' A lot. That'll do it.''
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Arizona State quarterback's successful freshman
season was his resiliency after knockdowns, injuries,
interceptions. To trace the genesis of this mental toughness, check
out the bloodlines.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's father, Joe, was his coach throughout much of Pop Warner
football.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a definite sign of weakness when you show emotion,
especially when your parental figure is in front of you,'' the
younger Kealy said. ``I learned at a young age to keep it inside
and turn it into a positive thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a stickler. And I learned early to respect that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Dad used to play quarterback for Kealy and his older sister,
Shelby. One sibling would play receiver and the other defensive
back. Kealy quickly learned a lesson in humility.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to kick my butt,'' he said. ``But she pushed me. And
that helped.''
</P>
<P>
   Kealy's subconscious recalled those moments during a game at
Oregon State last season, and it proved to be a career turning
point.
</P>
<P>
   He threw back-to-back interceptions in the second quarter and
was pulled. He was embarrassed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an inner thing,'' he said. ``It's tough to compete and
fail, to let down your team. My concern wasn't with me but my team
and how we were going to come out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   When Coach Bruce Snyder put him back in for the second half,
Kealy dusted off his pants and went after it, just as he used to
do.
</P>
<P>
   How much of an impact did that moment make? In the last six
regular-season games, Kealy completed 94 of 169 passes for 1,264
yards, 11 touchdowns and only three interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   His resilience also surfaced against Washington State. After he
passed for 185 yards and three touchdowns in the first half, the
Cougars rebounded and took a 25-24 lead in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy responded by engineering a drive that he capped with the
go-ahead touchdown. He was a big reason the Sun Devils won six of
their last seven games.
</P>
<P>
   ``His confidence level really changed over the course of the
season,'' wide receiver Lenzie Jackson said. ``He tried to be a
leader in the huddle early on, but you could tell he was nervous. I
could see it in his eyes later how much more confident he was.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snyder, ``There's nothing wrong with his toughness. He's
mentally tough. When he gets knocked down, I don't even think he
knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's bright. He has a quick arm. That's why we're all very
excited that he's going to be good.''
</P>
<P>
   His biggest test yet may come early in the season. He underwent
surgery late last year after tearing the anterior cruciate ligament
in his right knee during the regular-season finale against Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   His rehabilitation was successful and Kealy feels 100 percent,
but some wonder whether he's mentally prepared to withstand a hit.
Kealy says, ``No problem,'' and that may be because he overcame
similar surgery on his left knee out of high school.
</P>
<P>
   If he has a shortcoming related to his emotions, it's how much
he demands of himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's real hard on himself,'' Joe Kealy said. ``If there's a
chink in the armor it's that he expects perfection most of the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Snyder, ``He can really get frustrated with himself. I've
never seen him frustrated with wide receivers, protections or
play-calling. That's not an issue. But when he doesn't do what he
thinks he should, I bet his blood pressure shoots up.''
</P>
<P>
   That was more of a problem early last season, when he struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Against Brigham Young, for example, he completed just 12 of 29
passes. Those first few games were difficult on him, especially
when he had to go into the huddle and try to rally the troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was awkward,'' he said. ``I hadn't performed yet. It's hard
to have the respect of your teammates if you haven't played. It's
hard to say stuff if you haven't done it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, some of the other guys, like (former guard) Kyle
Murphy and (center) Grey Ruegamer, stepped in and helped me out.''
</P>
<P>
   He grew more comfortable with the role. He'll never be a rah-rah
guy, but if he performs well and has confidence in the huddle, he
believes he can be a leader by example.

<P>
   Kealy is ready to take the next step to becoming a better
quarterback. He needs to throw the long ball better. And at times
he chose to pass for a first down when it might have made more
sense to run.
</P>
<P>
   But he still managed a prolific season for a freshman. In fact,
he registered the third-highest yardage total, fourth-most
touchdown passes and third-most completions ever for a Pac-10
freshman quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I learned to turn those negatives into positives,''
Kealy said. ``Some of the mistakes I made will help me this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe most important, he has commanded the respect of his
teammates, even if they do pick on his appearance at times. Some
call him ``Pigpen'' because he'll go for a week without shaving, or
his hair will be disheveled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to be comfortable,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Kealy can look any way he wants if the Sun Devils keep winning
behind him. &QL;

MERCURY PUTS ON GAME FACE TO MAKE FINAL RUN AT PLAYOFFS

   SACRAMENTO _ The Mercury has never lost to the Sacramento
Monarchs. This is no time to start.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Phoenix's final three regular-season WNBA games, all
must-wins if there is to be a postseason, are against the Monarchs
(7-20 before a Saturday night game against Utah). The other
opponent, on paper quite dangerous, is Utah (8-20 before Saturday).
They will play Monday in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury (16-11) has no excuse for losing to the Western
Conference cellar candidates, especially in the heat of a playoff
chase. But the last trip to Utah ended in a 90-80 loss. And
Sacramento, in games at 6 tonight and Wednesday at America West
Arena, can salvage nothing more from this season than to spoil
Phoenix's plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to take these games like we're playing in the
playoffs,'' guard Bridget Pettis said, a mode the Mercury adopted
Monday. ``If we win these three games, we're in it for sure, and
we're going to take it step by step and do what we do best.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're playing great defense. If we keep our defensive
intensity where it is right now, especially against teams like this
that haven't had a great season, I think we'll be all right.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mercury, 6-0 all-time vs. Sacramento and winner of four of
its past six games, has motivation and momentum on its side.
Phoenix routed Detroit, 84-59, on Friday to eliminate the Shock
from playoff contention.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Mercury improved from a three-point winning margin in
the season opener against Sacramento, when Ruthie Bolton-Holifield
was healthy, to a 21-point margin, 88-67, when the teams last met
July 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I'm worried about is Sacramento,'' Coach Cheryl Miller
said. ``It's a young team and Heidi (VanDerveer) has done a great
job of keeping them energized, regardless of their record. They
play hard, they're physical, and anything can happen. We cannot
take anything lightly or for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether VanDerveer will return for a second full season is the
hot topic here. She was promoted from assistant to replace the
fired Mary Murphy for the second half of last season, then
retained.
</P>
<P>
   The knee injury that took out Bolton-Holifield, the league's
second-leading scorer in 1997, in the fifth game assured a second
rocky season. Sacramento has started three rookies: Ticha
Penicheiro at point guard and Tangela Smith and Adia Barnes from
the University of Arizona at forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our individuals got better, our team got better, and I think
there's only so much in this season, a short season, that you can
hope for,'' VanDerveer told the ``Sacramento Bee''.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager Jerry Reynolds said a decision on the coach's
status will be made after the season. Five coaches, including two
in Los Angeles, have been fired since the now 10-team league
debuted. Two, Washington's Cathy Parson and Los Angeles' Orlando
Woolridge, have interim status. &QL;

TWINS MUFFLE RED SOX
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-REDSOX-TWINS-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Kevin Paul Dupont 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ There was a lot less thunder _ but still a dash of
fireworks _ when the Red Sox and Twins met again late Saturday
afternoon at Fenway Park. Over the previous two nights, the clubs
piled up 40 runs, resulting in a pair of Sox wins by a cumulative
score of 21-19.
</P>
<P>
   Volume 3 in the four-day Book of Big Hits and Interminable Games
had the clubs producing rather modestly. And in the end, the Twins
shingled together their first win of the series, a 3-2 squeaker
that was decided on a Pat Meares one-out single in the seventh that
brought in Marty Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   A Fenway crowd of 32,412 (sellout No. 26) saw the Townies erase
a 1-0 deficit on a Mo Vaughn homer in the first, move in front,
2-1, on a Mike Stanley double in the fourth, then lose the lead in
the fifth on three singles off starter John Wasdin that evened it
at 2-2.
</P>
<P>
   The winning hit by Meares came off reliever Pete Schourek, who
took over for Wasdin in the sixth and was greeted by a Cordova
triple. One out later, Meares delivered the RBI safety to left,
what proved to be the end of three days of big hits, tons of runs,
and more offense than you get at your typical company slow-pitch
tilt.
</P>
<P>
   The most commotion all day came in a bombastic first inning when
Twins cleanup hitter David Ortiz, with a man on, drilled a shot
over the right-field foul pole. As the ball hooked and landed in
the seats, and first base umpire Marty Foster called it fair, Ortiz
broke into his home run trot.
</P>
<P>
   Up with the music. Twins, 3-0. Another one of those games.
</P>
<P>
   Wrong.
</P>
<P>
   In short order, Vaughn was leaping mad, Red Sox manager Jimy
Williams was asking the umpiring crew to consult (till they got it
right). After a minute or two, the umpires wiped the homer off the
board. The home plate umpire, Terry Craft, ruled the shot foul _
and his word was final.
</P>
<P>
   Outcome: a major league do-over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw it, I threw him a fastball in and he turned on it,''
said Wasdin, who threw five good innings, constantly pitching out
of trouble. ``It was definitely foul and I was helping it go foul
(by waving his hands). The right thing was done. All the umpires
had in mind was to make the right decision. It would have been a
costly decision. The right call prevailed.''
</P>
<P>
   To no one's surprise, the Twins were hot, especially first base
coach Ron Gardenhire. If there is ever a Gardenhire movie made,
only Jack Nicholson could do the guy justice in this scene. He
pulled one of those five-star nutties that really only happen in
baseball. Anyone remember Carl Yastrzemski hunkering down to cover
home plate with dirt after he was called out on strikes? It was one
of those.
</P>
<P>
   For all his anger _ appropriate though it was _ Gardenhire was
sent to the showers. Ortiz then returned to the plate and was
fanned on one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   As he stepped out of the box and headed to the dugout, the
frustrated Ortiz cracked his bat over his leg. Craft was in no mood
for histrionics at this point and he summarily tossed Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox evened it, 1-1, in their half of the first when Vaughn
sent a screaming bullet into the Twins bullpen. In the fourth,
Boston touched up former Red Sox pitcher Frankie Rodriguez for its
only other run, Stanley's double knocking home Vaughn after the
first baseman reached on a slow roller to third. Rodriguez allowed
seven hits over seven innings and looked like a guy you'd want in
your rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Runs in the fifth and sixth clinched it for the Twins. In the
fifth, three singles led to Otis Nixon coming across with the
equalizer. And Cordova's leadoff triple off Schourek, still getting
accustomed to American League relief duty, set the stage for the
end.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, on a day when Boston paid tribute to Babe Ruth, it
was a game to be remembered for some decent pitching and an
overruled home run that turned into a strikeout. Ortiz didn't like
it. And if you're wondering what the Bambino might have thought,
then you better consult your Baseball Encyclopedia.

PLEDGE TO RE WORK DEAL LATER MIGHT SATISFY WADSWORTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's an easy way for the impasse between unsigned first-round
draft pick  &UR; Andre Wadsworth and the Cardinals to end _ a win-win
solution for both sides.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals promise to renegotiate Wadsworth's contract after
three seasons, regardless of whether it's a four-, five- or
six-year deal. That way Wadsworth would get the big bonus he's
looking for _ the team already has said it will pay him $10.44
million on a six-year deal _ and he would be out of the contract in
three years.
</P>
<P>
   The contract wouldn't void, which would make the Cardinals
happy. There wouldn't be a buyback, which also would satisfy owner
 &UR; Bill
 &UR; Bidwill. But Wadsworth would get a new deal after the third season,
possibly a lucrative contract that would pay him as much as the top
defensive linemen in the league, something he is demanding, if his
play reaches that level.
</P>
<P>
   So how would Wadsworth's agents know that the Cardinals actually
would keep their word to tear up the contract after three seasons?
</P>
<P>
   The team could put it in writing.  &UR; Bob Ferguson, vice president
of player personnel, could even sign it in blood, although
Wadsworth's agents,  &UR; Eugene Parker and  &UR; Roosevelt Barnes, know his
word is good.
</P>
<P>
   They've dealt with the Cardinals for the past three seasons and
have four other clients on the team _ defensive end  &UR; Simeon Rice,
offensive guard  &UR; Lester Holmes, linebacker  &UR; Tony McCombs and
second-round draft pick  &UR; Corey Chavous, a defensive back from
Vanderbilt. None of the negotiations were contentious. Some were
tedious, but in the end, deals were done.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's deal also will get done. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   He cannot afford to leave a bonus of between $8 million and $11
million on the negotiating table. If he sits out the season and
goes back in next year's draft, he'll never get that money back.
Plus, there's no guarantee he will be picked as high as third
overall again. In fact, if the draft were held today, Kentucky
quarterback  &UR; Tim Couch, Ohio State linebacker  &UR; Andy Katzenmoyer and
Texas running back  &UR; Ricky Williams might be the first three players
selected.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth's agents cannot afford for the player to go back in
the draft. It would kill their recruiting for next season. Rival
agents would remind players that the agents couldn't get Wadsworth
signed.
</P>
<P>
   Rice didn't sign two years ago until Aug. 19. They made sure he
got in before the last preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Now with the foot injury to starting defensive end  &UR; Brad Ottis,
the Cardinals have a bigger need to get Wadsworth in soon.
</P>
<P>
   The best guess here is that Wadsworth will agree to terms and
report before the last preseason game, Aug. 28 at Oakland. &QL; 
Stick to football &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Being a native of Washington, Ferguson recently bragged about
Sahalee Country Club in Redmond, site of this weekend's PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really a beautiful course,'' he said. ``The last time I
played it, I shot 158. I bought a dozen balls before I teed off and
lost every ball by the eighth hole. I bought nine more at the turn
and lost them all by the 13th hole, and nobody in the foursome
would loan me any more.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping that in mind, here's an idea. Ferguson puts his best
offer on the table. Allow Wadsworth to put his next to it. Then,
play 18 holes. The winner's offer stands.
</P>
<P>
   Wait a minute. Given Ferguson's game, that could mean fore
years, fore fore-ty million. A really bad idea. &QL; 
For richer, for poorer &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rookie quarterback  &UR; Ryan Leaf's San Diego teammates knew he had
just signed a six-year, $31 million deal. So, they figured he could
afford to buy them a few things.
</P>
<P>
   That's why middle linebacker  &UR; Junior Seau swiped Leaf's credit
card and treated 25 veteran teammates to dinner at a posh La Jolla,
Calif., restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tab Leaf picked up without knowing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He brought me a receipt and said, `Here you go, we had a good
time,' '' Leaf said.
</P>
<P>
   Seau said Leaf wasn't pleased, but it is a long-standing
Chargers tradition for a suddenly rich rookie to take care of other
team members. &QL; 
Short shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret the Cardinals aren't happy with their
place-kicking situation. They will take a long look at the waiver
wire when cuts are made beginning next week. Here are four players
they could be interested in if they become available _ Green Bay's
 &UR; Brett Conway, Tampa Bay's  &UR; Pete Elezovic, Oakland's  &UR; Cole Ford (a
Tucson native) or Indianapolis'  &UR; Matt Vanderjagt, who played in the
Canadian Football League.
</P>
<P>
   The Dallas Cowboys, who will play New England Monday night in
Mexico City, are winless in international preseason games in Tokyo,
London, Mexico City and Monterrey, Mexico, since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Giants offensive lineman  &UR; Ron Stone, on facing the NFL's top
defensive linemen in the NFC East: ``We're going to have a bunch of
werewolves this year. We have a bunch of monsters coming at us.'' &QL;

VALLEY'S PRACTICE TONE DIFFERS FROM FLAGSTAFF'S RIGOROUS LOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. The Cardinals don't know whether to thank the
schedule makers or curse them.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL season will begin one week later than usual. This means
a change in preseason plans for the Cardinals and other NFL teams
that conduct training camps on college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, this would be the Cardinals' final week of camp at
Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff. But school is starting at
NAU, so the Cardinals had to clear out. They've returned to the
Valley, and, after a players' day off today, will resume practice
Monday at their facility in Tempe.
</P>
<P>
   That's good news for the players: It gets them out of one week
of those dreaded two-a-days. The bad news: Their only workout now
is in the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin could continue two-a-days in Tempe but
doesn't think it would be wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to drain everything out of this team practicing
twice a day in the heat,'' Tobin said. ``I want something left when
we play our first game.''
</P>
<P>
   Tobin will have the team on the field early _ 8:15 a.m. _ to
beat the heat. A tent has been erected between the practice fields
as a respite where ice and water will be available.
</P>
<P>
   It will be a case study for those who believe teams overtrain
with double workouts and lengthy meetings. The long-term results
might be a team that is fresher mentally as well as physically. &QL; 
Ottis heads injury list &QL; 
The Cardinals are down to their third-level left defensive end
after &UR; Brad Ottis re-fractured his left foot in Friday's 27-24
preseason win over the Chicago Bears.
</P>
<P>
   Ottis initially fractured his foot while running before minicamp
last spring. A screw was implanted surgically.
</P>
<P>
   Tobin described the aggravation as ``a hairline fracture that
barely shows up on the X-ray.'' Ottis might be back in three weeks
for the season opener at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   He had been on the first unit while first-round draft pick
 &UR; Andre
 &UR; Wadsworth holds out. Without Wadsworth and Ottis,  &UR; Jerry Drake
moves from backup left tackle to first-team left end.
</P>
<P>
   Several offensive linemen suffered injuries that will sideline
them at least a week: backup rookie tackle  &UR; Anthony Clement
(strained knee), backup guard  &UR; Jerome Daniels (strained knee),
backup center  &UR; Allen
 &UR; DeGraffenreid (sprained ankle) and backup guard  &UR; Tom Guynes
(fractured finger). Rookie receiver  &UR; Kevin Drake's neck injury was
believed serious, but X-rays were negative. He might be back
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver  &UR; Rob Moore (groin), fullback  &UR; Larry Centers
(hamstring), and cornerbacks  &UR; J.J. McCleskey (hamstring) and  &UR; Ty
Howard (knee) are expected to return Monday. &QL; 
Evaluations &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The coaches still are not ready to make a call on a No. 2
quarterback. Tobin added that he plans to keep both  &UR; Stoney Case
and
 &UR; Dave Brown, &UR; no matter how the competition ends.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Scott Player remains ahead of rookie  &UR; Marcus Williams in the
punting derby. Kicker is more perplexing: Tobin didn't like
 &UR; Corey Wedel's &UR; short kickoffs but was impressed with Wedel's 45-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pat Tillman, the rookie safety from Arizona State, once again
was the team's leading tackler.
</P>
<P>
   The turning point in the Bears game was the defense not allowing
Chicago to score after it recovered an  &UR; Adrian Murrell fumble at
the Cardinals' 25-yard line.
</P>
<P>
   ``The defense should be proud of that. I was,'' Tobin said.
``That's the key to winning football games _ rising to the
occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals have 10 days before they are required to trim the
80-man roster to 60, and they might begin the week thin at some
positions. &QL;

CUBS COLLAPS ING  
 FANS BELIEVE AN NUAL RITE HAS AL READY BEGUN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cubs fans are once again expecting the worst from their beloved
boys from Chicago's north side.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs, probably the most endearing yet most frustrating club
in the majors, has one of the largest legions of loyal fans in the
game. They continue to wait for the Cubs to win another World
Series.
</P>
<P>
   And wait, and wait, and wait . . .
</P>
<P>
   A month ago, the zanies who follow the Cubs' every move were
riding high, believing this might finally be the year the Cubs
break through and reach their first World Series since 1908. For a
while there, the dream looked real. Now it might be nothing more
than a nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what's worse, either having the Cubs start out
the season like they did last year, just totally out of it, or
teasing us the way they have this year,'' said  &UR; Joe Hutchinson, a
Valley resident who echoes the belief of so many other Cubs
fanatics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is horrible. I'm just depressed. . . . I'm ever the
optimist, but I'll tell you what, it doesn't look good right now.''
</P>
<P>
   It really does not look good for the Cubs right now. While they
watched division rival Houston swing the deal of the year in
acquiring
 &UR; Randy Johnson, the Cubs countered by trading for relievers  &UR; Matt
 &UR; Karchner and  &UR; Felix Heredia.
</P>
<P>
   Since the trading deadline passed, Houston has widened its lead
in the National League Central over the Cubs from 3{ games to eight
as of Saturday. During the same time span, the Cubs also have seen
their lead in the wild-card race go from 3{ games ahead to a slim
half-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cubs fans are expecting the worst. Only a miracle run during the
final six weeks of the season will make them believe. After all,
this is a club that has endured as many collapses as any other team
in major league history. &QL; 
Been there, done that &QL; 
Yes, that was Oakland's  &UR; Rickey Henderson talking to  &UR; Albert Belle
last week, trying to offer the enigmatic Chicago outfielder some
advice on dealing with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I've been through this period a little,' ''
Henderson said. ``I didn't want to talk about the game. I wanted to
be in a shell. Then they say you're cocky and stuck up and all
that, but that's not how it is. I told him to keep his head high.
He's a good man, no matter what they say.''
</P>
<P>
   After reaching 100 RBIs last week, Belle refused to talk to
reporters, who, whether Belle likes it or not, will continue to
cover baseball games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned that lesson when I got traded back to the A's the
first time,'' Henderson said about negative media treatment after
he continually avoided the press. ``The media in New York could be
tough on me, but when I left, they said, `We love you. We were just
doing our jobs. Don't feel bad about anything.' That got me to
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, the message that the media is not an enemy will get
through to Belle, who, believe it or not, can be engaging. &QL; 
Bobby boo &QL; 
Los Angeles'  &UR; Bobby Bonilla, who has been relegated to left field
while rookie  &UR; Adrian Beltre takes over at third base, was booed
loudly by the folks at Dodger Stadium on Tuesday, when he let a
very catchable ball drop in front of him for a single and later let
a fly ball get by him, a play that was ruled an error.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla was asked if he heard the booing and facetiously
offered, ``I'm crushed. I don't know what to do with myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla, who has been booed by the best in New York and
Baltimore, then basically challenged Dodgers fans to raise their
efforts to higher levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me put it this way,'' Bonilla said. ``I've got a thick
skin. I'm not trying to start anything, but they've got a ways to
go before they catch up to New York. It's going to take a long time
before they rattle my cage. I've been through a lot worse.'' &QL; 
The prosecution rests &QL; 
How much worse can things get with the Florida Marlins? Owner and
blight on the game  &UR; Wayne Huizenga has a standing $150 million
offer from  &UR; John Henry to buy the struggling and gutted club, but
the man who made his money in garbage and movie rentals refuses to
take it seriously.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sordid details of why Huizenga won't listen to Henry's
offer are surfacing, and, as we've said repeatedly in this space,
Huizenga is the man to blame. In reality, Henry, who also has said
he is willing to privately finance a new park, has virtually no
chance to buy the Marlins, and it has everything to do with
Huizenga's greed.
</P>
<P>
   His nearly yearlong song and dance to sell the club to  &UR; Don
Smiley and his legion of wobbly investors has several provisions
that would continue to generate money for Huizenga. Henry's
proposal, an all-cash deal, does not.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Huizenga's deal with Smiley would include the sale of
SportsChannel Florida to cable magnate  &UR; Charles Dolan, but only if
the new Marlins ownership group agrees to show Marlins games on the
cable outlet through 2024.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Huizenga has a clause with Smiley that would pay
Huizenga a $15 million fee if the Marlins leave Pro Player Stadium
for another venue in South Florida before Dec. 31, 2007, or a $20
million payment if the Marlins leave the area completely.
</P>
<P>
   Huizenga is seeking $169 million for the Marlins, which is
probably $50 million more than they are worth. As one South Florida
columnist so eloquently stated, ``Rich people are never rich
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Wonder if your World Series trophy, which will forever be
tarnished in the eyes of serious baseball fans, brings you
happiness, Wayne? &QL;

SINGH, STRICKER TIED FOR LEAD AT PGA
</HEADLINE>
 GLF-PGACHAMPIONSHIP-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Joe Concannon

<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vijay Singh grew up in the scenic splendor of
the Fiji Islands, heavily populated by people of Indian ancestry.
In Hindi, his first name means ``victory.'' Saturday, Singh kept
alive his dream of capturing a precious major golf victory, as he
shot a 3-under-par 67 for a three-round total of 203 that leaves
him tied with Steve Stricker (66) for the lead of the 80th PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   After Singh birdied four holes out of five on the back nine at
Sahalee Country Club, starting at the 11th, and executed a
marvelous curling putt from the fringe on the 18th to save par, he
talked about what winning his first major championship Sunday would
mean. ``You don't think about it when you're on the range,'' said
Singh. ``I'm not thinking right now about winning the golf
tournament. You can't help but feel your time may be soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, who is one of the game's most dedicated believers in
practice _ has been seen in the lingering dusk on practice tees
around the globe _ ended up in the tie for the lead after Stricker
also made a remarkable par on the 18th.
</P>
<P>
   Singh and Stricker, who were paired together last week in the
Buick Open, own a four-shot lead over Davis Love (69), who is
bidding to become the first repeat winner since Denny Shute in
1937; Billy Mayfair (67), a two-time winner on Tour this year, and
Steve Elkington (69), a former PGA champion. Mark O'Meara's 69 made
him one of four players at 208, keeping him in contention to become
the only player other than Ben Hogan to win three majors in the
same year. And Greg Kraft set a course record with a 65, tying him
with four others at 209.
</P>
<P>
   Stricker, who won the Kemper and Western opens two years ago but
had a down year in 1997, has had five top-eight finishes in his
last seven tournaments, restoring his confidence. Saturday he
played what he termed one of the best rounds of his life on a
difficult course, highlighted by some par-saving play on the 18th,
where he was awarded a drop after hitting into one of the towering
pines that line the fairways, then chopped a sand wedge to within
10 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had kind of a hanging lie,'' said Stricker. ``The ball was
above my feet. I was trying to fly it on the green, and even if it
rolls through the back, I've got it up on the tier where the pin
was.''
</P>
<P>
   As Stricker was signing his scorecard, Singh was still out on
that dreadful 18th hole, which normally plays as a par-5 but was
converted to a 475-yard par-4 for the tournament. After his second
shot strayed to the left, he made a high, breaking putt that
nestled in within a foot of the pin. This was a fine finishing
touch, after he had birdied the 11th, saved par on the 12th, and
birdied the 13th, 14th, and 15th holes to complete a tour of
36-31_67.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was about 35 feet,'' said Singh, ``and I had to go over the
fringe most of the way. So it was a pretty good putt, I thought. It
was really an up-and-down round, especially the first few holes. I
got my thoughts together on the back nine. I think the shot of the
day was on the 12th when I put my tee shot in the bunker and I was
just trying to play anywhere in front of the green. The ball just
came out really well, and that really got me fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stricker's round showed few flaws, and when he opened a
three-shot lead, it seemed he might be on his way to his first
major championship. He had learned on Friday it isn't easy, when he
was at 5 under before hitting his tee shot in the water at the
par-3 17th to set up a double bogey and fall out of the lead.
``Anything can happen on those last four holes,'' he said. ``You
need to be patient, not try and be a hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Love seemed to be falling out of contention with three bogeys in
the first six holes, but he made a comeback with birdies on the
seventh (8-iron, 20 feet), eighth (6-iron, 30 feet), 13th (6-iron,
15 feet), and 16th (8-iron, 2 1/2 feet) to set up a run at his
second major championship. ``I hit a lot of bad shots starting
off,'' he said. ``I was lucky I wasn't more over par. Maybe part of
it is trying too hard to defend.''
</P>
<P>
   The group tied with O'Meara at 2 under included Skip Kendall
(68), Frank Lickliter (69), and Tiger Woods (70). Woods opened with
a 12-foot birdie putt but failed to make a sustained move. He
remained in the fray by making an 18-foot birdie putt on the 15th.
``It was a long day for me,'' said Woods. ``I had to do a lot of
scrambling. I'm pleased to be par for the day. It could have been a
lot worse.''

<P>
   PHOENIX - Heavy rains Saturday night caused problems at Bank One
Ballpark as rain leaked through the retractable roof.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks President Rich Dozer said there was a small leak
above the stands on the first-base side, but it didn't cause any
fans to be displaced or problems with the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're more worried right now about a power outage,'' Dozer
said. ``We've been told there are large areas without power, and
the lights have flickered a couple of times.''
</P>
<P>
   However, one fan said the leak in the roof over Section 329
(left-field corner) was ``just gushing out'' and that the area
about 10 feet from the top row of the stadium was drenched. Fans in
that area said they filled out complaint cards to be compensated
for their discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   As guest relations staff members refused to comment on the leak,
water poured into their third-floor office. &QL;

FABREGAS HAPPY IN ROLE WITH METS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB YOUNG  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - In some ways, not much has changed for  &UR; Jorge Fabregas
since the Diamondbacks traded him to the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   He's still the odd man out. Only Fabregas is a little more
comfortable with that role in New York than he was in Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   After emerging from spring training as the Diamondbacks starting
catcher, Fabregas suffered an ankle injury, struggled at the plate
and lost his job. He shared time with  &UR; Kelly  &UR; Stinnett and  &UR; Damian
Miller, but he knew it was only a matter of time before he had a
new address.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an idea'' a trade was coming, he said. ``I knew the
three-catcher thing wasn't working. That's not healthy for a
pitching staff to have a different catcher every night.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I don't think any of us (catchers) were happy. It wasn't
really working out for any of us. None of us was extremely happy
about it. I didn't know what my role was anymore. I knew what it
was at the beginning of the season. I was the everyday catcher.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabregas knows he isn't going to be the Mets' starter, at least
not this season. It's  &UR; Mike Piazza's job. Still, Fabregas is
content. Piazza is a free agent at the end of this season. If he
goes elsewhere, Fabregas and  &UR; Todd  &UR; Hundley, who is being used in
the outfield now, might be left to battle for the starting job.
</P>
<P>
   ``My job is to give Mike a day off now and then, pinch-hit when
I'm needed,'' said Fabregas, who homered in a loss to St. Louis in
his only start for the Mets, equaling the number of home runs he
hit for Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a thing where I have to look at the long term,''
Fabregas said. ``I accept that. I have to be smart and look at the
big picture. I'm trying to do what I can to contribute and help
this team make the playoffs. That's the exciting thing about it. We
have a chance to go to the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``My role is definitely reduced, but obviously, I'm not
expecting to play a lot with a Hall of Famer catching.''
</P>
<P>
   Fabregas said he still is healing from the ankle injury, and he
only regrets that he didn't live up to expectations in Phoenix,
where he lost in arbitration over his contract, only to have
Managing General Partner  &UR; Jerry Colangelo tear it up and give him a
new deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad that I wasn't able to fulfill my obligation here,''
he said. ``I take things personally. I take things very hard. Maybe
I tried too hard.'' &QL; 
Signed, sealed &QL; 
The Diamondbacks signed catcher  &UR; Luis Urueta, the first prospect
the club has signed out of Colombia. A 6-foot-2, 180-pound
17-year-old, Urueta is a switch-hitter who will play this season
for the Diamondbacks' Boca Chica club in the Dominican Summer
League.
</P>
<P>
   Urueta was signed by  &UR; Junior  &UR; Noboa, the team's scouting
coordinator in Latin America. &QL; 
Familiar face &QL; 
Anyone who got to the ballpark early the last couple of nights may
have noticed a young middle infielder who bears a striking
resemblance to first baseman  &UR; Travis  &UR; Lee. It's Lee's 17-year-old
brother,  &UR; Taber. &QL; 
Injury update &QL; 
Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter said tests showed that shortstop  &UR; Danny
Klassen suffered a slight fracture in his left shoulder while
making a diving play against the Dodgers in Los Angeles. Still,
Klassen, who is with the club's Triple-A affiliate in Tucson, is
expected to be back in action within another week to 10 days, as
initially projected. &QL;

HYSAW COULD BE OUT FOR SEASON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PAYSON, Ariz. _ Arizona State cornerback Courtney Hysaw
dislocated his right knee during practice at Camp Tontozona
Saturday and may be out for the season.
</P>
<P>
   Hysaw, a track standout from Denver who sat out last season,
fell during a drill. He was not hit by anyone. However, the field,
which has seen sporadic rain during the past few days, may have
given out under him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was playing good,'' Bruce Snyder said. ``The whole thing is
unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Hysaw was competing for a backup job behind starters Courtney
Jackson and J'Juan Cherry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me cry,'' Jackson said. ``I know how hard he worked. I
always told him I can't wait to see him play, to see him in
uniform.''
</P>
<P>
   Hysaw was taken by helicopter to Phoenix's Good Samaritan
Hospital. He is expected to undergo surgery in the next few days. &QL;

ASU IS 8TH IN POLL  
 ARIZONA RATED 24TH; OHIO STATE IS NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL BRADLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The college football season will start with a double
dose of Arizona in the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State was ranked No. 8 and the University of Arizona was
No. 24 in the preseason Associated Press Top 25 media poll, which
was released Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils received two first-place votes as well and 1,256
points, five behind Pac-10 rival UCLA, which got one first-place
vote. Ohio State, ranked No. 1, had 30 first-place votes in one of
the closest preseason polls.
</P>
<P>
   ``No comment,'' ASU Coach Bruce Snyder said of the Top 10
selection. ``We're just trying to get from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   ``All that stuff is flushed out. We're not talking about it. It
doesn't mean much.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Arizona State was No. 9 and Arizona No. 25 in the
ESPN/USA Today coaches' poll.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Bowl Championship Series, formerly the Bowl
Alliance, will match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams in the Fiesta Bowl
on Jan. 4, based on a new and complex ratings system that involve
polls, computer rankings, strength of schedule and won-loss record.
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State has an edge on any team on the road to Tempe. It has
been 30 years since the Buckeyes won their third national
championship in 1968 under Coach Woody Hayes. Now, a year after
watching rival Michigan win its first title in 50 years, the
Buckeyes are primed for another championship run under Coach John
Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being No. 1 is something you shoot for, so we're certainly not
going to apologize for being picked as the best team to start the
season,'' Cooper said. ``The expectation level has always been high
here, and it's a compliment to our program. It's something we'll
try to live up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Ohio State, which is led by Mesa product Joe Germaine at
quarterback, received 1,668 points, edging No. 2 Florida State by
five points. The voting was the second closest in the 48-year
history of the AP preseason poll. In 1994, Florida beat out Notre
Dame by two points.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles received 22 first-place votes and 1,663 points in
gaining their 11th straight Top 5 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan and Nebraska split the 1997 national title, the
Wolverines finishing No. 1 in the AP poll, the Cornhuskers No. 1 in
the coaches' poll. Arizona State finished 14th and Arizona was
unranked.
</P>
<P>
   Notable in the poll were:
</P>
<P>
   This is the lowest preseason ranking for Notre Dame (No. 22)
since 1986, when the Irish did not make what was then the Top 20.
Notre Dame will visit ASU on Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Big Ten and the Southeastern Conference led all conferences
with five teams apiece in the Top 25. The Pac-10 had four: ASU,
Arizona, UCLA and Washington at No. 18. &QL;

ROOMIES RIVALS, BUT SHARE GOAL  
 ARIZONA'S SMITH, JENKINS BOTH WANT TO BE TOP QB 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLAS, Ariz. - As roommates, Keith Smith and Ortege Jenkins
are at least an odd couple, if not an apparent impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   Roomies with different personalities are one thing. But rivals?
Joe Frazier never roomed with Muhammad Ali. If he had, the poor
place would have looked like something left by the U.S. Olympic ice
hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   But peace reigns in a dorm room at Cochise College, where Smith
and Jenkins share floor space and time at quarterback during the
University of Arizona's eight-day preseason camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on the same team and we want the same thing _ to win,''
Jenkins said. ``It will show everybody out there, especially the
new guys, that it doesn't matter what you've done in the past. You
still have to go out and work hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said, ``People can start talking controversy, but there's
no quarterback controversy. I can tell you that right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Not now, but what about later?
</P>
<P>
   It's an inescapable question. Arizona Coach Dick Tomey intends
to let Smith and Jenkins split time for as long as necessary. It
could be a few weeks into the regular season before he decides on a
starter.
</P>
<P>
   Two quarterbacks often lead to double trouble. But Tomey is
confident that problems will be avoided. He cites their proven
athletic abilities, their friendship and their understanding of the
task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked them: `Can you handle being a backup?' '' said Tomey,
who employed two quarterbacks, Ronnie Veal and George Malauulu,
with mixed results in 1989, when Arizona was 8-4. ``They both can.
We've got two great guys here. They both want to play every down,
and they both know that's not going to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   The best bet is that a starter will emerge sometime within
Arizona's first four games. Barring an injury, a starter will not
be picked on the basis of what happens in camp.
</P>
<P>
   For now, there is no official rivalry. Unofficially, there is
nothing but one.
</P>
<P>
   From the sidelines during each session of the two-a-day drills,
reporters keep a running tally of pass attempts, completions and
interceptions. Who's ahead? Who's behind? After three days and five
practice sessions, it was within a completion or two of a dead
heat.
</P>
<P>
   For Tomey, the dilemma is that both Smith, a 5-foot-11 junior,
and Jenkins, a 6-2 sophomore, are talented, each in his own way.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is a darting runner who can throw on the move. In 1996, he
took the starting job from Brady Batten in the second game. He went
on to set a school record for passing percentage and an NCAA
freshman single-game record with 502 total yards in a four-overtime
loss at California.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins is a terrific drop-back passer. He started seven times
last season after Smith was injured in the fourth game against
UCLA. He went on to throw 19 touchdown passes for a freshman record
in the Pacific-10 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're the two best I've ever had at one time,'' said Tomey,
who is starting his 22nd year as a head coach.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Jenkins and Smith could be the unrivaled starter
at any number of schools. That, in itself, poses a problem.
</P>
<P>
   Smith talked about transferring after last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I considered it,'' he said. ``But I never talked to
another school. I wanted the coaches to know I was considering it
and that I was serious. But I also wanted the truth about the
situation, and I got it. Coach Tomey was honest with me.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomey told Smith that he was still in the hunt. With that as
motivation, Smith was so impressive in spring drills that he
appeared to have an edge over Jenkins.
</P>
<P>
   Then Jenkins began to talk transfer. A preseason football
magazine quoted him as saying, ``If Dick Tomey comes to me and
tells me I lost the starting job, I'd have to give transferring a
major thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins doesn't deny making the comment. Today, however, he says
he's not going anywhere. If he did transfer, he would leave himself
only one year of NCAA eligibility because he was a redshirt
freshman.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their reasons for staying, the underlying message of
their transfer talk is unmistakeble. Both believe they should
start. Jenkins is more outspoken about it than Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, I think I should,'' said Jenkins, also a basketball
player, who said he would rather play in the next Fiesta Bowl than
the Final Four because Arizona already has a national basketball
title. ``I think I deserve to start and complete what I did last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure Keith thinks the same way. You have to look at his
situation and what happened to him _ the way he suddenly stopped
playing because of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand his reasons for wanting to play, and I believe he
understands mine.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Smith sounds as if he is prepared to be half of a twin
bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're both ready to handle the two-quarterback situation,'' he
said. ``It's something we talked about all summer. We were on
campus, talking, throwing the ball around and having a good time.''
</P>
<P>
   First-year offensive coordinator Dino Babers believes this
potential two-headed monster can destroy opponents instead of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have two quarterbacks with different styles, it can
be an extremely positive and explosive situation for our offense,''
Babers said. ``I mean, you've got a defense splitting time in
preparation for one style and then another. You'd have one defense
for one guy and another defense for the other guy. I wouldn't want
to be the defensive coordinator in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Babers' argument makes good sense. The trouble is,
neither Smith nor Jenkins is a theory. They have ambitions. And
there is ego, of which a healthy dose is good in any quarterback.
There are also relationships and timing between receivers, running
backs and offensive linemen. There's nothing new about an offense
suddenly falling out of sync after a quarterback change.
</P>

SUSPENSION COSTLY FOR HALL  
 ENDORSEMENT DEAL CANCELED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By NORM FRAUENHEIM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Olympic medalist Gary Hall Jr. lost a major
endorsement and a chance to compete in two key meets because of the
provisional suspension that was lifted last week by FINA,
swimming's international governing body.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terribly costly,'' Hall said Saturday of a prohibition from
competition that lasted from May 15 through Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   He said his endorsement deal with Speedo was ended by the
swimsuit company when FINA announced its temporary suspension of
the Phoenix sprinter for a positive marijuana test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand when an athlete fouls up like this that, yes,
we're expected to keep the company in mind,'' said Hall, who
withdrew from the Goodwill Games and was unable to compete in
national championships that ended Saturday. ``I can understand how
it would be a concern for a company like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this is the same company that sponsors the Chinese
National Team.''
</P>
<P>
   Chinese women have repeatedly tested positive for steroids and
other performance-enhancing drugs since the 1994 World
Championships in Rome.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about Hall's contract with Speedo were not answered by
company executives late last month when the suspension was
announced. Speedo's offices were closed Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hall's attorney, Ed Hendricks of Phoenix, raised the possibility
that Speedo might renew the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume there will be an attempt to reinstate the Speedo
contract in light of the lifting of the suspension,'' said
Hendricks, who successfully argued that the suspension should end
within three months because Hall could not be considered a two-time
offender.
</P>
<P>
   Gunnar Werner, FINA's honorary chairman, said Hall tested
positive at the 1996 Olympics, where he won two gold and two silver
medals. But marijuana had just been added to the banned list and
was not subject to sanctions until after the Olympics. FINA said
Hall then tested positive on May 15 during a meet at Phoenix Swim
Club. As a first-time offender, he could not be subject to more
than a three-month suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Hall said he has resumed training. He said his
workout schedule stopped completely when the suspension was
disclosed in a FINA newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just impossible to find the motivation,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Because he was ineligible for the national championships, he was
unable to earn a spot on one of three international teams for the
Pan-Pacific, Pan American and World Short Course Championships. The
Pan Pacific meet is considered a key steppingstone to the 2000
Olympics. The site is the Olympic pool in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether he could be added at a later date. Hall
believes he can be added if he goes fast enough in his specialties:
the 50- and 100-meter freestyles.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that would be unprecedented,'' said Hall's father, Valley
eye surgeon Gary Hall, a three-time Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   USA Swimming has, in fact, already set a precedent of sorts. It
added Hall as a relay member to the team for the World
Championships at Perth, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Hall failed to make that team in qualifying. But he went to
Perth and swam two anchor legs, one for a gold medal and one for a
silver. However, he was not added to that U.S. team for an
individual event. &QL;

GRAY WOLF LOSES IN TEST OF NATURAL SELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BARRY BURKHART  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   You might have read last week about an endangered Mexican gray
wolf that was found dead in the White Mountains near the carcass of
an elk calf.
</P>
<P>
   The wolves, raised in captivity, are a recent reintroduction to
Arizona, an attempt to re-establish the wolf. Unfortunately, this
small female was the mother of the only pup born in the wild that
still was there.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists may try to provide food for the motherless pup and
attempt to keep it in the wild. An alternative would be to capture
it and raise it in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   Another wolf was shot by a camper, who said he killed the animal
after it attacked his dog. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service won't
prosecute the camper.
</P>
<P>
   But the death of the female wolf seems more compelling because
it apparently happened during a conflict with another predator _
namely a mountain lion, perhaps the most formidable killer in the
state.
</P>
<P>
   But before the confrontation could be figured out completely,
federal agents had to determine whether a crime had been committed.
</P>
<P>
   Since the wolf was an endangered species, the place of her death
was treated as a crime scene. It's against the law to kill a member
of an endangered species. The wolf's remains were sent to experts
for examination.
</P>
<P>
   ``A chunk of its side was ripped out, which could have been
consistent with being shot with a high-powered rifle,'' said  &UR; John
 &UR; Phelps, furbearer specialist for the Arizona Game and Fish
Department. ``That was the first thought.''
</P>
<P>
   When it was determined that probably wasn't the case, Phelps
said, other biologists were allowed to examine the scene.
</P>
<P>
   It appears, Phelps said, the lion had killed the elk calf and
was challenged by the wolf.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pack of wolves can challenge a lion,'' he said, ``but
usually an individual wolf wouldn't do that _ especially a small
female like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it should have been, but taking out this wolf was no
easy task for the lion, according to Phelps.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole hillside was torn up,'' he said. ``There apparently
was a pretty good fight. Usually, a lion will grab the back of the
neck and break it or grab the throat and suffocate when it attacks.
This was a small wolf, but it put up a good fight. This was not
typical of a lion kill.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the wolves have shown signs of their inexperience in the
wild. There have been reports that some have shown little fear of
humans. There was speculation that the dead wolf, probably having
never encountered a lion, didn't know how formidable this foe would
be.
</P>
<P>
   But she obviously was aggressive.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of wolf you'd like out there (if the species
is going to re-establish itself),'' Phelps said. ``It's too bad she
had to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was just too aggressive.'' &QL; 
Information growing &QL; 
In the next few weeks, Game and Fish should have available on its
Internet site a unit-by-unit breakdown of hunting information on
both small and big game, according to  &UR; Bob Miles, a public
information officer for the department who is organizing the
service.
</P>
<P>
   Only bison will be excluded.
</P>
<P>
   The information will be compiled from the reports of wildlife
managers in the various units, who work the field in those areas.
</P>
<P>
   There will be reports on quail and other small game plus reports
on big-game populations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an attempt to tell hunters which rocks to hunt
under,'' Miles said. ``But it will be an overview with specific
information on each unit. It will give them a general place to
start.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should be a tremendous help to hunters _ especially for
small-game stuff. It will be more basic for big game. But it will
give good access information.''
</P>
<P>
   Miles, who once worked in the Tucson region, said a similar
Internet page was developed there and became the most popular part
of the region's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The information also will be available in hard copy at Game and
Fish's regional offices free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   Target date is about Sept. 1. &QL;

 &HT;    Kenyans wondering what position the U.S. has toward their
country
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nairobi, Kenya All David Ndira wanted was to help.
</P>
<P>
   Ndira, 32, an accountant who works in a building 200 yards from
the American Embassy in Nairobi, heard the explosion Aug. 7. He
came running at once, with rescue on his mind.
</P>
<P>
   But U.S. marines, more worried about maintaining security than
about saving lives, would not allow him into the heavily damaged
embassy, Ndira said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were concerned with their stuff first,'' he said. ''They
were more concerned about the embassy than about the locals.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first of several actions taken by Americans since
the bombing nine days ago that have left some Kenyans wondering
whether Americans value the lives of Africans quite as much as they
value the lives of other Americans.
</P>
<P>
   As people lay trapped in the rubble, some would-be rescuers were
driven off for fear they were looters. The dozen Americans who died
seem to some Kenyans to have been mourned more than were the more
than 200 Africans who died in the same explosion. And, said Ndira,
the terrorist attack on the U.S. embassy in Nairobi was ascribed
greater importance than the simultaneous bombing in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, because no Americans were killed in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ''That makes you feel like a second-class human being,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in the view of some Kenyans, then added
insult to injury by advising Americans not to travel to Kenya, a
move the Kenya Tourist Board called ''a major threat to Kenya
tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   American officials have shown that they are aware of the
resentments, and sensitive to them. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright has said she will visit Kenya shortly. U.S. Ambassador to
Kenya Prudence Bushnell said Friday that the U.S. was giving Kenya
tools used in the rescue - helmets, saws, computers, generators and
a firefighting vehicle - as a gesture of friendship.
</P>
<P>
   And the State Department quickly withdrew its advisory against
traveling to Kenya, to the applause and relief of the Kenya Tourist
Board.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, Kenyans seem stunned by the bombing, which blew a
whole in the city center and shattered windows for blocks around.
On Saturday, as they have for the nine days since the attack, they
gathered by the hundreds and even the thousands on the sidewalks
near the site of the explosion to gaze on the scene in silent awe
and bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   Around the city, people continued to clean up. Merchants blocks
from the embassy swept shards of glass into giant piles and covered
their storefronts with plywood. Workmen atop a building 50 yards
from the embassy replaced roofing tiles ripped loose by the force
of the blast.
</P>
<P>
   A bulldozer rumbled through the debris behind the American
embassy. U.S. Marines inside stood guard at the bombed-out windows
with automatic weapons. Above the gutted building, the American
flag few at half mast.
</P>
<P>
   And outside, people piled wreaths, roses and carnations into a
memorial mound. A sign amid the flowers read, ''KENYANS WANT PEACE
NOT BOMBS.'' Another begged, ''GOD HEAL THE HEAVY HEARTS.''
</P>
<P>
   But even into quiet and moving tributes, other feelings intrude,
feelings of annoyance and perplexity at the actions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a resentment,'' said Sam Nyamweya, secretary general
of the Kenyan Football Association, after team members had laid
their flowers. ''They are thinking that the Americans are out for
the interests of the embassy and Americans rather than the
interests of everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be overstating the case to say that Kenyans are angry
at the United States. ''Resentment'' is the word most frequently
used. People said the embassy should be rebuilt out of town, where
it would endanger fewer people. They said Bushnell should apologize
for Americans who thought rescuers were looters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, they didn't sound angry. They sounded hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the resentment felt by everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Americans are just victims,'' Kaboro said as he herded his
children from the scene of the attack. ''The ambassador herself was
also injured. American people got killed. Nothing against the
Americans.''

This particularly applies to the Paperbacks. The ``Advice, How-To,

MR. PRESIDENT, SKIP THE WORD GAMES WHEN YOU TESTIFY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A whole lot of people in America think they're having sex, but
aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Don't panic. It's just a lawyers' definition of sex that Bill
Clinton may use to weasel out of lies he told the American people
about his relations with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   When Clinton appears Monday before Ken Starr's grand jury, he
may use the definition of ``sexual relations'' accepted by the
judge in the Paula Jones lawsuit:
</P>
<P>
   ``A person engages in `sexual relations' when the person
knowingly engages in or causes contact with the genitalia, anus,
groin, breast, inner thigh, or buttocks of any person with the
intent to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why you want to get lawyers out of your life, especially
your sex life. Only lawyers could invent a definition of sex that
ignores the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that the nation is preoccupied with oral sex and the
Oval Office. As a friend said, ``Thank you, Bill Clinton. Now I
have to explain to my daughter what oral sex is.''
</P>
<P>
   Say this for Nixon: He tried to burn the Constitution, but he
gave us expletives deleted.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, the president may tell the grand jury he didn't have
sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky, even though she was having
oral sex with him.
</P>
<P>
   Read that definition carefully, the way a lawyer like Clinton
would. A woman who performs oral sex on a man is having sexual
relations, but the man isn't.
</P>
<P>
   That should give feminists a reason to dislike Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Come on, try that definition on your spouse, significant other,
or mother. See if you don't get thrown out of the house.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't having sex, she was.'' Yeah, that'll work.
</P>
<P>
   Philanderers will carry that definition around, and read it
aloud like cops reading Miranda warnings. Call them Monica
warnings.
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry, Bill, but having extramarital oral sex is not the
moral equivalent of raiding the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   Some say that a president's sexual activities are his business,
but let's just play the game called ``If I Were President.''
</P>
<P>
   If I were president, I would have to ask advisers what to do
about relations with Saudi Arabia, Russia and Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The American people are easier to understand. They appreciate
honesty, not the lawyerly skill of demonstrating that words don't
mean what they mean.
</P>
<P>
   If I were president, I wouldn't fool around with women or
semantics. A president's most important relationship is with the
people, and not worth damaging.
</P>
<P>
   So say I know that, but I'm drawn to a young intern who's drawn
to me. I'm a man of appetites and needy ego, not just a president,
and I've always gotten away with it. What do I do?
</P>
<P>
   I'd say to myself that she's half my age, an employee, and a
young woman who might get so attached she shows up at fund-raisers
and airports where there are many cameras.
</P>
<P>
   I'd take a cold shower, and think about the stock market
falling.
</P>
<P>
   All right, I'm the president and the cold shower didn't work.
I've had contact with the young intern that would get a lamp thrown
at me by my wife. What do I tell the public?
</P>
<P>
   Do I claim I didn't have sexual relations with that woman,
whatever the heck it was she was doing? Well maybe. Everybody lies
about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Show me someone who doesn't lie about sex, and I'll show you the
dullest person in the world, or the most interesting. Show me
someone who redefines sex, and I'll show you a president with major
chutzpah.
</P>
<P>
   Asia and Russia are going down the tubes. Wall Street is
teetering. Say I'm a popular president, but know my ratings will
crash with the Dow. I have to answer the special prosecutor's
questions via video on Monday. What do I tell the grand jury, and
the American people, who will hear the leaks within minutes?
</P>
<P>
   I guess I'd tell the truth, even if it meant confessing to
cheating and lying in Lincoln's former home. Americans are trained
on Oprah. They'll understand.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'd resign and be remembered as the president who quit at
the height of his popularity for the good of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Well, I'm not president, Clinton is, and he's not likely to quit
as readily as I would.
</P>
<P>
   He weaseled his way out of the draft. He weaseled with that ``I
didn't inhale'' thing. He weaseled out of supporting gays in the
military with ``don't ask, don't tell.'' He weaseled his way out of
taking a position on affirmative action. He's practically weaseled
his way out of being a Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   He's weaseled every which-way on matters of sex, and it's hard
to see why he won't do it again on Monday. So far the weasel hasn't
gone pop, but gotten more popular.
</P>
<P>
   However, Clinton knows the whole world will be listening to the
grand jury leaks, and any speech he may give about his testimony.
He knows that Monday could be the final episode of the Clinton
show, firmly establishing his X-rated place in history.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine if, just once, he didn't play games with words. He just
might get away with telling the truth.

   &UR; COLD MOUNTAIN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Charles Frazier. Vintage Contemporaries, $13.
</P>
<P>
   This ambitious first novel, which won a National Book Award in
1997, recasts much of the ``Odyssey'' in the South near the end of
the Civil War, with a wounded Confederate soldier standing in for
Odysseus. His journey home resembles ``a Whitmanesque foray into
America: into its hugeness, its freshness, its scope and its
soul,'' James Polk wrote in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BIG TROUBLE: A MURDER IN A SMALL WESTERN TOWN SETS OFF A
STRUGGLE FOR THE SOUL OF AMERICA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By J. Anthony Lukas. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $17.
</P>
<P>
   The author's teeming journalistic account of the murder of a
former Idaho governor in 1905 and its aftermath is set against the
growing conflict between capital and organized labor, and is full
of historical digressions and fascinating characters, ranging from
Clarence S. Darrow to James McParland of the Pinkerton National
Detective Agency. ``Lukas has done much more than exhume one of the
most dramatic trials of the century; he has excavated a stratum of
American history, tracing the fault line of class that sundered
society in another time,'' Richard Lingeman said here in 1997. A
smaller-scale criminal justice drama,  &UR; MAY GOD HAVE MERCY: A TRUE
STORY OF CRIME AND PUNISHMENT &LR; , by John C. Tucker (Delta, $11.95),
tells of the legal missteps that led to the highly publicized
execution of a possibly innocent man in Virginia in 1992 for the
rape and murder of his sister-in-law. Last year our reviewer, Roger
Parloff, found the book ``a lucid and engrossing exploration'' of
the risks that come with the death penalty and the occasional
tragedy that inevitably results.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PRESENT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Alfred Corn. Counterpoint, $13.50.
</P>
<P>
   This collection of poems draws from our cultural history to make
surprising links between disparate entities, like Bach and Kafka,
who are shown not only to be driven by the same spiritual forces
but to affect their audiences in similar ways. The author is ``a
stylist of the first order,'' William Ferguson said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; COD: A BIOGRAPHY OF THE FISH THAT CHANGED THE WORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mark Kurlansky. Penguin, $11.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the humble Atlantic cod, dried and
salted, was one of the world's first nonperishable foods and the
fuel that has driven explorers and traders since the Viking days.
Last year, in these pages, Molly Benjamin called this an
``eminently readable book.'' Another briny title from the same
publisher,  &UR; IN THE SLICK OF THE CRICKET &LR; , by Russell Drumm
($13.95), chronicles a reporter's five-day fishing trip with Frank
Mundus, a Long Island charter-boat captain, raconteur and famous
great white shark hunter. The result is ``a lively portrait of a
tobacco-chewing, colorful and crude original,'' Carol Peace Robins
wrote here earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE THREE-ARCHED BRIDGE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Ismail Kadare. Translated by John Hodgson. Vintage
International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Set in the 14th century during another time of social upheaval
in the Balkans, this vivid parable finds the Turkish armies at the
gates of Europe, and various bridges -- both stone and metaphoric
-- rising and crumbling between two cultures. The result is ``a
profoundly atmospheric book'' and ``an utterly captivating yarn,''
Patrick McGrath wrote here last year. The same publisher has
reissued an earlier novel by the Albanian author,  &UR; THE PYRAMID &LR; 
(translated from the French of Jusuf Vrioni by David Bellos, $11),
which focuses on the intrigues behind the construction of the
Pyramid of Cheops in ancient Egypt, a story with echoes of Kadare's
homeland during the communist era. In 1996 in these pages, Bruce
Bawer called this ``a haunting meditation on the matter-of-fact
brutality of political despotism, the harshness of life among the
humble and powerless, and ... the stonelike permanence of death.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A CAB CALLED RELIABLE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patti Kim. St. Martin's Griffin, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   A 9-year-old Korean-American girl is forced to take care of her
demanding father after her mother, tiring of living ``a dog's
life,'' vanishes one day in a taxi. Last year our reviewer, Denise
Gess, called this an ``elegantly and humorously told''
coming-of-age novel.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SATCHMO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Gary Giddins. Da Capo, $19.95.
</P>
<P>
   The legendary jazz trumpeter Louis Armstrong is the subject of
this biographical tribute, which pulls together unpublished photos,
sheet music, letters, diaries and other memorabilia, including an
annotated restaurant menu. ```Satchmo' is a valuable, jubilant look
at a great man and artist,'' Tom Piazza wrote here in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEW YEAR'S EVE &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Lisa Grunwald. Warner, $13.99.
</P>
<P>
   Heather and Erica are twins whose childhood competiveness is
rekindled in adult life after the accidental death of Heather's
son. Last year our reviewer, Polly Morrice, said this family novel
``depicts this age-old struggle with sympathy and skill.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A BOOK OF MIGRATIONS: SOME PASSAGES IN IRELAND &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Rebecca Solnit. Verso, $14.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual post-modern travelogue, a California author uses
Ireland as a lens for looking at identity politics, history,
culture and the meaning of journeying and attachment to place.
Solnit is ``a writer of startling freshness and precision,'' Rand
Richards Cooper wrote here in 1997.

CENSUS BUREAU: AMERICANS TOO BUSY TO VOTE IN 1996 PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN
</HEADLINE>
  By SCOTT SHEPARD 
 c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Five million Americans were just too busy to vote
in the last presidential election, one of the chief reasons why the
1996 balloting was the weakest since 1924, a Census Bureau report
to be released Monday shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time constraints are now the single biggest reason Americans
who are registered give for not voting,'' said Loretta Bass, a
co-author of the report.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts on U.S. voting behavior patterns say the low
1996 turnout in 1996 reflects the uninspiring campaigns waged by
the candidates, President Clinton and Republican Bob Dole.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you probe beneath the `I'm-too-busy' excuse, you'll find
that people saw little of importance to decide (in 1996),'' said
Curtis Gans, head of the Committee for the Study of the American
Electorate, a non-profit organization that monitors voting trends.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not, as some have claimed, a picture of a satisfied
electorate,'' Gans added. ``In the majority of elections, citizens
are decreasingly motivated either by partisan interest or civic
duty.''
</P>
<P>
   Only 54 percent of the voting age population in the United
States voted in the 1996 presidential election, down from 61
percent in the 1992 campaign, the Census Bureau report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the so-called ``motor voter'' law, which went into
effect in 1995 and made it easier to register to vote, the Census
Bureau found that registration in 1996 was at its lowest ebb since
1968. Some 128 million people, or 66 percent of the voting age
population, were registered to vote.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21.3 million who registered but did not vote in 1996, 5
million said they were too busy or could not take off time from
work or school - ``a sign of the times ... hectic schedules and
increasing demands of employers,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But why were they really too busy? Because they weren't
interested,'' said Rodolfo O. de la Garza, a professor of
government at the University of Texas in Austin and vice president
of the Tomas Rivera Institute, a think tank that studies Latino
issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given a campaign between Clinton and Dole, you think, Hell, I
need to work on my car,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, 17 percent of non-voting registered citizens reported
to the Census Bureau that they did not vote in 1996 because of
apathy about the political process, up from 11 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen percent said they disliked the candidates, 3 percent
fewer than in 1980 when President Carter was challenged by Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1980, only 7.6 percent said they were too busy or could
not get time off to vote, compared to 21.5 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Other reasons people gave for not voting were in 1996: illness
or emergency (14.9 percent), out of town (11.1 percent), forgot or
had no transportation to the polls (4.3 percent).
</P>
<P>
   However, Hispanic voters, now being aggressively wooed by
Democrats and Republicans alike, were a significant exception to
the downward trends in 1996, the Census Bureau found.
</P>
<P>
   ``And rightly so,'' said Lisa Navarrete, spokeswoman for the
National Council of La Raza (NCLR), the nation's largest Latino
advocacy unit. ``The anti-Hispanic, anti-immigrant rhetoric (of the
GOP campaign) really spurred a lot of anger among immigrants ...
They took it personally.''
</P>
<P>
   Among Hispanics, naturalized citizens were more likely to vote
in 1996 than native born Hispanics, according to the Census Bureau.
Fifty-three percent of naturalized Hispanics voted while only 42
percent of native born Hispanics voted.
</P>
<P>
   Research soon to be released by the Tomas Rivera Institute finds
the same trends among Hispanics in 1996, de la Garza said. In New
York, for example, naturalized Dominicans were much more likely to
vote than native-born Puerto Ricans. The same pattern held among
native born and naturalized Mexican-Americans in Texas and
Cuban-Americans in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an anti-immigrant election, and they were voting to
protect themselves,'' de la Garza noted.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau report also found that:
</P>
<P>
   - More people voted by absentee ballot in 1996 - 8 percent,
compared to 4 percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   - The voter turnout among whites was 60.7 percent, compared to
53 percent for African Americans, 45 percent for Asians and Pacific
Islanders and 44.3 percent for Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   - Voting from 1992 to 1996 declined by much more for whites (8
percent) than for African Americans (3 percent). There was no
significant change for Hispanics or Asian Americans between the two
elections.
</P>
<P>
   - Women voted in greater percentages (59.6 percent) than men
(57.0 percent), continuing a trend that began with the 1980
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   - Suburbanites outvoted the central city, 59.8 percent compared
to 57.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   - Among age groups, the peak years for voting participation were
65 to 74 years of age (70.1 percent) while the least likely voters
were 18 to 19 (30.2 percent) and 20 to 24 (33.4 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - The higher the family income, the more likely a person
registered and voted. Families with incomes above $75,000 had a
73.6 percent turnout rate, more than double the 39.5 percent rate
of families with income below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   - People with college degrees were nearly three times as likely
(74 percent) to vote than those who had not completed high school
(39 percent).
</P>
<P>
   - Southerners were less likely to register (65.9 percent) and
vote (52.2 percent) while Midwesterners were more likely to
register (71.6 percent) and vote (59.3 percent).

   CLINTON-TESTIMONY (Washington) _ Almost seven months after he
promised to provide details about his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, President Clinton faces the Kenneth Starr grand jury to
answer questions about that relationship. Later, he may make
televised remarks to the nation or issue a written statement. His
schedule calls for him to depart Monday for vacation at Martha's
Vineyard, Mass. By STEWART M. POWELL. (``w'' category.)

<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (Undated) _ A whole lot of people in America think
they're having sex, but aren't. Don't panic. It's just a lawyers'
definition of sex that Bill Clinton may use to weasel out of lies
he told the American people about his relations with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky. Imagine if, just once, he didn't play
games with words. He just might get away with telling the truth. By
ROB MORSE. (``k'' category.) (Already filed.)

   BOWERS _ Mississippi is preparing yet again to open old wounds
and air out dirty laundry - KKK leader Sam Bowers is going on trial
August 17 - for the fifth time - for the murder of Vernon Dahmer
Sr. A Hattiesburg civil rights activist who died in 1966 when he
tried to protect his family from a band of about 16 klansmen
torching his home. The Dahmer family has waited a long time for
this day; meanwhile, Bowers and his co-defendants are cocky. Bowers
has said he wants to get in court as soon as possible. And Devours
Nix, who was arrested and will stand trial later this year, got out
of jail by claiming he was too ill for it, and then was caught
teeing off at a golf course. Will the state finally put these men
in jail? (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   IMMIG _ ATLANTA _ Michael Favorov is a Russian doctor at the

   PROBE-COSTS _ WASHINGTON _ Critics of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr have made the $40-50 million spent on the probe of
President Clinton into a rallying cry. Starr's defenders turn the
tables, asserting that White House delay tactics, stonewalling, and
costly court appeals have dragged out the four-year probe and
driven up the price tag. And that is just part of the money battle
that has been a backdrop in this titanic legal struggle. (Malone,
Washington Bureau)

   LEGAL _ If she were President Bill Clinton's lawyer, Susan
Brenner says she would advise him to tell the truth. Brenner, a
professor of law at the University of Dayton, doesn't say that in
an old-fashioned, all-American, cannot-tell-a-lie tone. She says it
because she feels the president is in grave danger of being hung
out to dry by Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, which could happen
if he lies and perjures himself. (Kline, Dayton Daily News). 15.

   LOGGING _ The era of big timber is over at the U.S. Forest
Service. Or at least that is what Chief Mike Dombeck says. But as
Dombeck moves to reform the agency away from being timber based to
being more ecologically based ,he is facing resistance from within
his own agency, critcism from industry and its allies in Congress
and skeptism from environmentalist who contend that Dombeck is long
on rhetoric but short on action. We focus on how Dombeck's agenda
is affecting the management of the 4.5 million acres of national
forests in the eastern United States. (Harmon, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   w/ LOGRAGE _ James Sullivan has spent the last 15 years hounding
the Forest Service in the northeast Georgia mountains. Profile on a
volunteer who is part of a band of environmentalists who monitor
Forest Service-sanctioned timber cutting. Sullivan has documented a
disturbing trend of overharvesting in parts of the national forests
seclued from public view. 25 inches. (Harmon, Atlanta

   LOGLIFE _ A profile of a mountain logging family who for years

   HORSEFARM-TROPHIES (Lexington, Ky.) _ After Calumet Farm,
thoroughbred racing's most legendary stable, collapsed in
bankruptcy in 1991, virtually every trapping of the breeding and
racing empire was auctioned to pay debts. Today, all that remains
of the farm's legacy is a collection of some 530 trophies and
awards, housed at the state-run Horse Park since 1982. Now that
those awards seem headed for the auction block, a raucous battle
has erupted in Bluegrass country between those who argue that the
collection should go to the highest bidder and those who say that
it is an important part of Kentucky's heritage and should stay put.

of the farm's legacy is a collection of some 530 trophies and
awards, housed at the state-run Horse Park since 1982. Now that
those awards seem headed for the auction block, a raucous battle
has erupted in Bluegrass country between those who argue that the
collection should go to the highest bidder and those who say that
it is an important part of Kentucky's heritage and should stay put.

ADVERTISING: LAS VEGAS ALTERS ITS IMAGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By EDWIN MCDOWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The city of Las Vegas had an advertising budget of $27 million
last year, or or almost 10 times that of the average state's ad
budget in 1997. No wonder, then, that Las Vegas drew almost 30.5
million visitors for the year, who spent almost $25 billion and
filled 86.4 percent of the city's hotel and motel rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those admittedly impressive statistics masked some
fundamental problems with the city's tourist industry, including
falling hotel occupancy and competition from the many casinos that
have sprung up elsewhere in recent years. So this fiscal year, the
Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority has earmarked an
additional $300,000 for advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, it recently undertook a six-month analysis of Las
Vegas as a destination, after which it adopted its first-ever
multiyear advertising and marketing plan, which will extend through
fiscal 2003. The result is an ambitious plan to reposition Las
Vegas as an entertainment destination, rather than primarily a
gambling mecca.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past we did only one-year plans,'' said Rossi
Ralenkotter, vice president of marketing for the Las Vegas
Convention and Visitors Authority. ``But because of the evolution
of our marketplace, it was imperative to do the research and
determine what direction we were going to take from a marketing and
advertising viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for tampering with apparent success are included in
both a 63-page strategic and market analysis released two and a
half weeks ago, and a 222-page marketing and advertising program
released last week. Both analyses were compiled by R&AMP;R Advertising
of Las Vegas, the longtime agency for the Las Vegas Convention and
Visitors Authority.
</P>
<P>
   What both studies show, for example, is that as impressive as
Las Vegas room occupancy was in 1997, exceeding the national
average by almost 22 percentage points, it actually dipped to its
lowest percentage since 1992 and fell four percentage points from
90.4 percent in 1966. At the same time, the five big hotels
scheduled to open within the next 16 months will add 20,000 more
rooms to the existing 106,000-room inventory, putting added
pressure on hotel occupancy and room rates.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, a decade ago only two states had legalized gambling
(Nevada and New Jersey), while 30 states have it today. And within
two years, some 90 percent of the U.S. population is expected to be
within 200 miles of casino-style gambling.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the city's worries, 39 percent of visitors said they
would have come to Las Vegas more often had they not had access to
casinos closer to home. Among visitors with a propensity to gamble,
surveys showed, the number of visits to Las Vegas over a five-year
period dropped to seven from 11.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most surprising finding, perhaps, is that for the first
time more visitors (50 percent vs. 48 percent) consider Las Vegas
an entertainment resort than a gambling resort. And it is in
recognition of that fact that Las Vegas now intends to undertake
what it describes as ``the most dramatic change in its history,''
repositioning itself as a ``world-class entertainment destination''
and going head to head for the tourist dollar with such cities as
Paris, New York, San Francisco, Orlando, Atlantic City and Monte
Carlo, as well as with Disney, Universal and Fox.
</P>
<P>
   That is where the Las Vegas ad campaign comes in. By earmarking
$13.8 million for television (primarily national cable television),
$1.8 million for outdoor ads, almost $1.3 million for newspapers
and $1 million each for radio and consumer magazines, Las Vegas
will try to reposition itself as America's best vacation value for
millionaires as well as those of modest means.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In prior decades, Las Vegas was marketed primarily as a gaming
destination,'' last week's report said, ``with resorts at the low-,
mid- and high-price range levels.'' Now, ``with occupancy levels
flat and room inventory continuing to increase, Las Vegas must
communicate its message to multiple audiences and consumer
segments.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, ads will gradually shift from image-driven to
retail-oriented, and for the first time the consumer campaign will
focus on such amenities as dining, shopping, recreation,
entertainment, resorts, night life and special events. The current
tag line, ``Open 24 Hours,'' will be retained on all destination
advertising, while the slogan, ``It's Anything and Everything,''
will adorn print and electronic ads. Television commercials will
carry both slogans, but also ask, ``How Soon Can You Get Here?''
</P>
<P>
   Where, then, does this re-emphasis leave gambling, whose slot
machines, tables and roulette wheels took in about $5 billion last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not neglecting gambling,'' said Ralenkotter of the
Convention and Visitors Authority. ``We're still the No. 1 gaming
destination in the world, and still the No. 1 place where people
want to go to gamble. So we're going to speak about the gaming side
of Las Vegas in our promotional literature and collateral
material.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We need to let the traveling consumer know all
the new things we've added in the last five to seven years, like
golf, spas, restaurants with national and international
reputations, and shopping that's comparable to anywhere in the
world.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAUTAUQUA, N.Y. _ In 1899, after the philosopher William James
visited Chautauqua, the combination arts festival and resort here
in southwestern New York, he wrote that he was ``spellbound by the
charm and ease of everything, by the middle-class paradise, without
a victim, without a blot, without a tear.'' But James said he was
astonished on entering ``the dark and wicked world again, to catch
myself quite unexpectedly and involuntarily saying: `Ouf! what a
relief! Now for something primordial and savage.'''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Chautauqua, founded in 1874 by Lewis Miller, an Akron,
Ohio, inventor, and father-in-law of Thomas Edison, and John Heyl
Vincent, a Methodist minister, as a summer school for Sunday-school
teachers, is a utopian community of 7,500 summer residents
seemingly devoted to the highest ideals of the spirit and the
intellect. Nestled on 750 acres on the shores of Lake Chautauqua,
the Chautauqua Institution is a place of pastel-colored Victorian
cottages with filigreed trim and gardens coordinated with pink and
white flowers. Children ride their bikes without fear of cars. And
sometimes it does seem a little like Truman Burbank's artificial
hometown of Seahaven in the Jim Carrey movie ``The Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   But in its heyday in the 19th century, Chautauqua was one of the
most important cultural institutions of its time, with an
incalculable effect on the dissemination of education and culture
in the United States, particularly for women, who had little access
to higher education. Today, after exhausting its original mission,
Chautauqua, almost incredibly, has carried on, averting financial
crises, and prospering.
</P>
<P>
   Four sitting American presidents have visited Chautauqua,
including Ulysses S. Grant, Theodore Roosevelt and Franklin D.
Roosevelt, who gave his ``I hate war speech'' in the amphitheater
in 1936. President Clinton prepared for his debate with Robert Dole
here in 1996. And George Gershwin composed his Concerto in F in one
of the practice shacks in 1925.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as it gears up for its 125th anniversary celebration next
year, Chautauqua is undergoing a profound self-examination, asking
how it can broaden its anachronistic population of mostly white,
older and prosperous Americans so that it can remain true to its
fundamental mission: serious debate about contemporary issues in an
atmosphere of cultural vitality.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're asking ourselves a lot of important questions about our
future,'' said Daniel Bratton, Chautauqua's president and a
Methodist minister. ``We're using the anniversary as a time to
bring these issues to a head.''
</P>
<P>
   But what exactly is Chautauqua? ``Even Chautauquans have
difficulty explaining Chautauqua,'' said Joan Fox, the director of
public information. Chautauqua is a nonprofit institution, not too
different from a giant co-op. Most of the common ground is owned by
the Chautauqua Foundation. The 1,100 houses are privately owned,
some of them by eighth-generation Chautauquans. The institution
operates on a budget of some $14 million a year with a year-round
staff of about 90, which in the summer grows to 1,500 people. It is
governed by a 24-member board of trustees.
</P>
<P>
   The Chautauqua Institution has its own daily newspaper, The
Chautauquan, its own symphony orchestra, conservatory theater,
opera company and ballet company. A total of 8,000 students attend
its schools of music, ballet, opera, theater and visual arts. At
the center of Chautauqua life is the 10:45 a.m. lecture in the
5,000-seat amphitheater, with the summer divided into subject
weeks. This summer's topics have included ``Ethics: Teaching
Virtue, Educating for Character'' and ``The Road to Educational
Excellence.''
</P>
<P>
   Cultural events are open to outsiders, and over the course of a
summer about 142,000 people visit. There is a children's school and
day camps, called the Boys' and Girls' Clubs. Chautauqua has its
own security force, which has little to do but rebuke teen-agers
who pour soapsuds in the fountains. There is a 158-room wooden
hotel, the Athenaeum, built in 1881, also run by the institution.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua has its own deeply ingrained rituals, Old First Night
Day, for instance, its annual birthday celebration, and Recognition
Day, when members of the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle,
one of the oldest continuous book clubs in the country, graduate,
each class with its own motto, emblem and officers. Those who read
extra books can join the Guild of the Seven Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chautauqua is kind of the memory of America,'' said Jeffrey
Simpson, whose family has been coming here for 88 years, and whose
book ``Chautauqua,'' will be published next year by Harry N.
Abrams. ``One of the reasons it was so successful is that it
reflected a small-town America many Americans were moving away
from. We know from Sinclair Lewis that small towns could be
culturally arid places. But because of its transitory nature,
Chautauqua could be the perfect small town. It reflected that
wonderful American curiosity, that omnivorous interest in
information, and it is contained in this picture-perfect place.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Saturday, there was a Catholic Mass in the Chapel of
the Good Shepherd and Jewish Services in the Hurlbut Church,
followed by bridge instruction in the Women's Clubhouse and an
Alumni Association ``Great American Picnic.'' Bard O'Neill,
director of Middle East Studies at the National War College, was
lecturing on Islamic fundamentalism to a group in the Hall of
Philosophy, built to resemble the Parthenon.
</P>
<P>
   Every 15 minutes or so, the bells in the campanile of the Miller
Bell Tower chimed, sometimes pealing out hymns. Down by the lake,
children played not far from Palestine Park, a contour model of the
Holy Land, with a pond representing the Dead Sea, and a trickle of
water the River Jordan. At McKnight Hall there was a School of
Music voice master class, while at the Chautauqua Center for the
Visual Arts there was a demonstration, ``Making an Adirondack Twig
Basket.'' Later, there was another Mass in the Hall of Philosophy,
and a choir rehearsal for Sunday services.
</P>
<P>
   Religion is fundamental to Chautauqua, although many residents
do not attend church. Most Chautauquans are Christian, and about 20
percent are Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an inarticulated awareness of the sacred and the holy
in the whole community because of the natural surroundings and
because of the created human beauty,'' said Ross Mackenzie,
director of the department of religion. ``Civil discourse,
friendship, dance, music, all of these are expressions of human
created beauty. They all give us an awareness of the holy.''

<P>
   `The Heart' of the Movement
</P>
<P>
   Although Chautauqua was originally founded with a religious
purpose, its major influence has been secular, primarily through
the Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle, formed in 1878. The
circle has been called ``the heart of the Chautauqua movement.''
Members were required to read books from a list with the aid of
study guides. In the first 20 years, 10,000 local reading circles
were formed, a quarter of them in villages of less than 500. There
were circles in prisons and country stores.
</P>
<P>
   By 1918, more than half a million people had taken the
Chautauqua correspondence course. ``This permeation of American
life through its smallest units is perhaps the most significant
social fact about Chautauqua,'' said Arthur Bestor Jr.,
Chautauqua's president from 1915 to 1944. Today there are few local
reading circles left, and the movement continues mainly at the
summer institution, with each ``class'' required to read 12 books
in four years. There were 127 graduates this year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1883, Chautauqua was chartered as a university and remained
one for 12 years, until other universities began offering summer
courses. By the end of the 19th century, Chautauqua was, Russell
Lynes, the historian, wrote, ``a cultural phenomenon with some of
the sweep and force of a tidal wave.'' There were about 300
independent or loosely affiliated chautauquas. Traveling
chautauquas, or ``tent chautauquas,'' provided forums for famous
speakers like William Jennings Bryan, who once gave 50 lectures in
28 days on the circuit.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of talking pictures and cars, which enabled
people to travel to find culture, the traveling chautauquas began
to decline. Today there are about 28 loosely affiliated local
chautauquas, including one in Lakeside, Ohio, on Lake Erie, and the
Ocean Grove Camp Meeting Association in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   In 1933, Chautauqua went into receivership. Money was raised by
deeding back the houses, which had been rented, to members for 20
percent of their assessed value.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Chautauqua seemed to be going into a decline.
Attendance was lagging; the buildings were in disrepair, and it was
having a hard time meeting its budget. Richard Miller, a Milwaukee
lawyer, and great-grandson of Lewis Miller, became chairman of the
Chautauqua board.
</P>
<P>
   He began an aggressive fund-raising campaign and built up the
endowment. The old buildings were repaired. Today, Chautauqua has
an endowment of about $40 million with another $50 million in
promised bequests from its wealthy members.
</P>
<P>
   But today's typical Chautauquan is no longer a Sunday school
teacher, or a public-school teacher, but is over 50 and a wealthy
professional. Houses can cost up to $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to Attract Younger People
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is that some of the people who make it interesting
_ like professors _ can't afford to keep coming,'' said Twig
Branch, a fourth-generation Chautauquan, who is an insurance agent.
``We business people are really boring,'' he added with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Chautauqua is also struggling to attract younger people, and
indeed there has been an increase in the number of children on
``the Grounds.'' It is also trying to attract a more diverse
population. For one thing, in order to get foundation support, it
needs diversity.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a rapidly expanding black middle class, and they
haven't discovered it,'' said Bratton, the president of Chautauqua.
``Everybody, including blacks, likes to have people like them
around,'' he said. ``The absence of a critical mass makes it a
longer task.''
</P>
<P>
   Most people believe that diversity will develop. ``This is a
time of growth,'' said Alfreda Irwin, 85, the institution's
official historian, whose family has been coming to Chautauqua for
six generations. ``Learning is a sport here. Vincent and his son,
George, said we needed to stay close to the movements of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the society is diverse, we aim to be like society.
Chautauqua is very open and would like to have all sorts of people
come here and participate. I think it will happen, just
naturally.''

   EUREKA, Calif. _ At the center of Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.'s
plan to decommission the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant is a
fundamental technological problem: where and how to store 14,040
spent fuel rods that will give off toxic radiation for tens of
thousands of years.
</P>
<P>
   Much like the Korean radioactive waste that triggered widespread
protests when it was shipped through San Francisco last month,
Humboldt Bay's used radioactive fuel is a potentially lethal
collection of isotopes that could unleash cancers and other severe
health consequences to anyone exposed.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike the Korean wastes, high-level American wastes have no
place to go. The Idaho site for foreign radioactive waste was set
aside as part of federal attempts to control the international
spread and use of nuclear technology in the 1950s, but federal
plans to establish a depository for domestic waste have encountered
stiff opposition and left plants such as Humboldt Bay with nowhere
to ship their spent fuel rods.
</P>
<P>
   Technological innovations, however, have provided Humboldt Bay
with an alternative: ``dry cask'' storage. Dry casks are
18-foot-tall concrete and steel cases designed to keep radioactive
waste contained virtually forever, if need be. They are called dry
casks to distinguish them from another common storage method, in
which the waste is submerged in a pool of water.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows us to move forward with dismantling the plant sooner
and it provides a simpler way of storing the fuel,'' PG&AMP;E spokesman
Alec Arago said of the dry casks.
</P>
<P>
   Since shutting down the Humboldt Bay facility in 1976, PG&AMP;E has
kept the fuel rods in a 26-foot-deep pool of water within the
plant. The water once cooled the rods but now serves primarily to
block radiation from reaching the outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fuel pool is safe but it requires a lot of attention and
vigilance,'' Arago said. That attention costs PG&AMP;E $10 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the cost, another disadvantage to the pool is its
potential vulnerability to a major earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   The company has kept the Humboldt Bay plant in ``safe storage''
since 1983, delaying full decommissioning. There were many reasons
for the delay, but the principal one was the fuel problem.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, moving the fuel rods into dry casks wasn't
considered feasible because it would have required an expensive and
difficult two-step process in which the rods would have had to be
put in the casks and then taken out and encased in other
extra-strong containers to safeguard them against potential
accidents during shipment to a federal depository.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, with the delay in certification of a federal
disposal site, it was clear the casks would have to remain at the
Humboldt site for some time, and none of the casks met the criteria
for withstanding the kinds of powerful earthquakes they could be
exposed to there.
</P>
<P>
   But all that has changed with the development of multipurpose
canisters, containers that can be used both for storage and
shipment, and with PG&AMP;E's desire to speed up the decommissioning
process.
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing the nuclear industry's quandary, several companies
have designed the multipurposed canisters now awaiting approval
from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the vendors are busy licensing dual-purpose systems
because that way, when the DOE (Department of Energy) comes to take
the fuel, you're done with it,'' Patton said.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E estimates each dry cask will cost roughly $1 million, and
the Humboldt Bay plant will need six to eight casks. The company
has projected a $16 million price tag to acquire and load the
casks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's clearly not an exact reckoning,'' Arago said, noting that
prices differ among vendors.
</P>
<P>
   First, however, PG&AMP;E is seeking a design that will withstand
twice the force of the strongest earthquake ever measured in the
Eureka area. The Little Salmon Fault, which ties into a network of
faults called the Cascadia Subduction Zone, is a few hundred yards
from the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The company has asked the California Public Utilities Commission
to allow money from the plant's decommissioning fund to be used for
the $7 million estimated cost to get the cask designed and
certified, a process expected to take three years.
</P>
<P>
   Under PG&AMP;E's plan, Humboldt Bay's 390 fuel rod assemblies would
end up in stainless steel canisters encased in dry casks bolted to
a 6-foot-thick concrete platform. Where the platform would be
located still must be decided, but it is likely to be near the
plant.
</P>
<P>
   To distant passersby, the casks would look like a giant pack of
beer, Patton said. Although models vary depending on the company
that builds them, a basic dry cask weighs 125 tons and measures 12
to 15 feet in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven nuclear power plants in the United States use dry casks
and nine others are pursuing them.

AGING NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS PUT GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES TO THE TEST

<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ Across the nation, nuclear power plants are
coming to the end of their lives, and government and industry
officials are beginning to see whether decommissioning guidelines
work the way they were designed to.
</P>
<P>
   Nuclear power plants are required to set aside enough money to
pay for their eventual dismantlement, and for the first few plants
fully decommissioned, the estimates have proved accurate.
</P>
<P>
   But nearly every nuclear power plant is different and
generalizing costs is difficult, said Leigh Ann Marshall, a
spokeswoman for the Nuclear Energy Institute, a trade association.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little misleading to say there are 105 plants
operating and the dismantling cost will be X amount because there
are too many variables, like the cost of waste disposal and when
waste is actually moved by the federal government,'' Marshall said.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government does not plan to have a site that can
take high-level radioactive waste from nuclear power plants until
2010, meaning plants must find a way to store it until then.
</P>
<P>
   Using general NEI estimates, decommissioning those 105 plants
could run in the range of $38 billion to $54 billion. According to
the association, the average size of a nuclear plant is 1,000
megawatts and the cost for decommissioning a plant of that size
runs between $350 million and $500 million.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co. projects a $195 million bill for
decommissioning the Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power Plant, a 65-megawatt
facility. Dismantling PG&AMP;E's other nuclear plant, the Diablo Canyon
Nuclear Power Plant, is estimated at $1.2 billion. The Diablo plant
is a 2,400-megawatt facility with two reactors.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-nuclear power activists, such as Jim Adams of Redwood
Alliance, say decommissioning contains far too many uncertainties
to be confident about estimates. The Redwood Alliance, an
Arcata-based environmental group, has asked state authorities to
re-examine the estimate for Diablo Canyon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to do a national service in pointing out this
decommissioning is a huge sleeping giant,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   The first plants to complete the cycle have managed to meet
their budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Two demonstration plants - Shippingport in Pennsylvania and
Pathfinder in Minnesota - were decommissioned in 1989.
Shippingport, a 72-megawatt plant, cost $98 million to dismantle
and Pathfinder, a 58-megawatt facility, cost $81 million to
deconstruct.
</P>
<P>
   The 330-megawatt Fort St. Vrain demonstration plant in Colorado
was decommissioned in 1996 at a cost of $189 million. And New York
State's Shoreham plant, a 849-megawatt plant that operated the
total equivalent of only two days, was decommissioned in 1995 for
$186 million.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, utility companies built nuclear reactors because
they believed nuclear fission would be a cheap source of energy,
said Duke Wheeler, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory
Commission.
</P>
<P>
   In the age of deregulation, utility companies face greater
competition than ever and the costs of decommissioning figure into
making the operation of nuclear power plants more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is the present generation of nuclear power plants
are reaching the end of their economic viability,'' Wheeler said.
``What we're finding out and what a lot utilities are finding out
very painfully, is it (nuclear power) is not very cheap at all.''

<P>
   EUREKA, Calif. _ Towering over Pacific Gas &AMP; Electric Co.'s
power plant complex just south of Eureka is a 250-foot-high red and
white vent stack, a seemingly benign fixture that has dominated
southern Humboldt Bay for 35 years.
</P>
<P>
   Unbeknownst to hundreds of thousands of motorists who stream by
on nearby Highway 101 each year, the stack represents a danger of
frightening proportions. A powerful earthquake, experts say, could
topple the stack into the adjoining Humboldt Bay Nuclear Power
Plant, cracking the structure that contains nuclear fuel rods and
releasing radioactive waste into the surrounding air and water.
</P>
<P>
   In coming weeks, PG&AMP;E will install a smaller, 50-foot-tall steel
vent stack, and then begin taking down the longtime signature of
the Humboldt Bay skyline, the first step toward decontaminating the
plant and removing it once and for all. The entire process is
projected to take seven years.
</P>
<P>
   The Humboldt Bay power plant, shut down since 1976, has been a
source of controversy for decades, as PG&AMP;E and anti-nuclear power
activists struggled over what to do with the aging facility that
sits only a few hundred yards from a network of earthquake faults
called the Cascadia Subduction Zone. The plant originally was
closed for refueling but was never reopened because of earthquake
safety worries.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, plant managers agree with activists that the
radioactive waste should be removed and the building taken apart as
soon as possible. If PG&AMP;E wins approval, the West Coast's first
commercial nuclear power plant would become one of the first in the
nation to be fully decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   The move is applauded by Redwood Alliance, an Arcata-based
environmental organization that works on energy issues and has
fought to keep the plant closed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is in an earthquake you could have major damage
done to the reactor core and the rods in the pool to the point
where you would have radiation leaking out into the environment,''
said Jim Adams, Redwood Alliance's point man on the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Before PG&AMP;E can rid itself of the Humboldt Bay plant, it must
negotiate a maze of regulatory obstacles and overcome huge economic
hurdles. In the process, it could set precedents that will help
guide demolition of the nation's 105 operating nuclear reactors,
all of which eventually will have to be decommissioned.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E must find a way to safely store highly radioactive waste,
devise ways to decontaminate the plant and pay an as-yet-unknown
bill. The first, and likely the biggest challenge, will be to win
approval for storing 14,040 radioactive fuel rods in 18-foot-tall
steel and concrete caskets on the plant site. On-site storage is
necessary because environmental concerns have blocked approval of a
federal storage site in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The state will hold hearings on PG&AMP;E's request later this summer
and in the fall. PG&AMP;E hopes to begin work within three years and
the plant could be torn down by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The company decided earlier this year to move ahead for several
financial reasons: storing radioactive waste at the plant costs $10
million a year, decommissioning costs are escalating and PG&AMP;E wants
to sell four gas-generated power plants, valued at $30 million,
that are adjacent to the nuclear plant.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and government officials say the deconstruction of the
Humboldt Bay plant will force the public to address issues that are
being raised as scores of plants built in the 1960s and 1970s _
most of them operating today _ approach the ends of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sleeping and it is going to be awakening here and it's
big,'' said Duke Wheeler, a spokesman for the U.S. Nuclear
Regulatory Commission. ``It's not all that big now, but it is going
to become big, much bigger than it is now. It is a substantial,
emerging part of the whole power-generation industry.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Three U.S. nuclear power plants already have been dismantled and
two more are in the process. Humboldt Bay is one of five plants
that have started decommissioning, and it is unusual because the
power plant is built underground and because PG&AMP;E is proposing a
novel way of taking care of radioactive waste by storing it in
earthquake-proof containers.
</P>
<P>
   Nine nuclear plants, including Rancho Seco near Sacramento and
San Onofre in Orange County, have ceased operating and their owners
have decided to maintain them in their current state for the time
being.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government licenses nuclear reactors for 40 years,
and plants can ask for a 20-year extension. To date, only one
application has been filed for an extension, although more are
expected soon.
</P>
<P>
   As a condition of the license, plant operators commit to
decommissioning the nuclear plant after it quits producing power,
and that means eliminating radioactive material on site that would
be a danger to public health and safety, or to the environment. To
eventually pay for the deconstruction, plants are required to set
aside enough money to cover the estimated decommissioning costs.
</P>
<P>
   The process is complicated and expensive, and the Humboldt Bay
Nuclear Power Plant will help pave the way for others to follow.
</P>
<P>
   One direct beneficiary of Humboldt Bay's experience will be
PG&AMP;E's other nuclear plant, the much larger Diablo Canyon Nuclear
Power Plant in San Luis Obispo County, which started operating in
the early 1980s and probably will be decommissioned sometime after
2020. With two reactors capable of generating 2,400 megawatts of
electricity, the plant cost $6 billion to build, and
decommissioning it is now estimated to run $1.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the small Humboldt Bay plant capable of
generating only 65 megawatts cost $24.8 million to build in 1963
but is projected to cost $195 million to decommission.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest obstacle to tearing down the plant is what to do
with the 390 assemblies of highly radioactive spent nuclear fuel
rods stored in a pool of water at the facility. The assemblies,
which are 6 inches square and 8 feet long, contain the individual
fuel rods in which nuclear fission took place, generating the heat
that transformed water into steam and then turned turbines to
produce electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The rods contain a number of radioactive elements, including
plutonium, which has one isotope that takes 25,000 years to lose
half its radioactivity. The rods are stored in water that
originally served to cool them and now serves to shield the outside
from radiation.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the federal government has planned to build a
repository for the nation's high-level nuclear waste, such as
Humboldt Bay's spent fuel rods. But the current plan to use Yucca
Mountain in Nevada has encountered considerable opposition.
</P>
<P>
   Leigh Ann Marshall, a spokeswoman for the Nuclear Energy
Institute, a trade association, said the actual demolition of the
plant is not a difficult process.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's really driving the cost of decommissioning through the
ceiling is the high-level waste has no place to go,'' she said.
``The federal government hasn't provided a place for it. The more
plants have to baby-sit that waste, the more expensive it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, nuclear plants have turned to dry storage as an
alternative. As part of its decommissioning plan, Humboldt Bay
proposes putting the radioactive rods in 16-foot-tall concrete and
steel cylinders known as dry casks that would be bolted to a
6-foot-thick concrete pad near the plant.
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E expects to pay $16 million to acquire six to eight casks
and load them with the fuel assemblies. But first the company must
find a cask design that can withstand twice the force of the
strongest earthquake ever measured locally.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the storage problem comes the hurdle of how to go
about deconstructing the plant, with little experience to go on.
Company officials said they will reassess their plans and make a
final decision once they receive a license for dry casks, expected
within three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of this is how you do it,'' said Adams, of Redwood
Alliance. ``They haven't done it (decommissioning) with a large
reactor. I'm a little concerned about how the technology will work
_ how you will actually take this apart and how (radioactive)
releases might occur during the work.''
</P>
<P>
   The tall concrete vent stack, which filtered radiation from air
released from the plant, demonstrates the difficulty ahead for
PG&AMP;E. The inside of the base of the stack, where its contamination
is the heaviest, is saturated with cesium _ the same element found
in radioactive fallout from bombs _ at 100,000 times the level
found naturally in the surrounding ground.
</P>
<P>
   The company has contracted with Burns &AMP; Roe of New Jersey to use
a crane with a 300-foot boom to carefully disassemble the stack,
step by step, in 17 different sections. To ensure the interior
contaminated concrete is removed, workers will cut the rings into
pie pieces, seal them and send them off to a waste processing
center.
</P>
<P>
   The stack removal is projected to cost $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the stack. Within the plant's refueling building
are highly contaminated areas, such as the reactor vessel, a
48-foot-long by 10-foot-wide steel tank, that will have to be cut
up and shipped out.
</P>
<P>
   All told, dismantling what's left of the plant after stack
removal is expected to cost more than $150 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like other nuclear plants that have shut down before the end of
their 40-year license, the Humboldt Bay plant became unprofitable
to operate. That happened after the Three Mile Island disaster
created a slew of new regulations and other unforeseen costs, such
as earthquake safety, surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   But the new requirements generated by Three Mile Island were no
more daunting than the web of state and federal regulations PG&AMP;E
must now negotiate in order to store fuel in dry casks and get
access to money already set aside for plant decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
   The Humboldt Bay plant, like all nuclear power plants, is
required to have a decommissioning fund, and it stands at $156
million. The fund has grown through investment from about $45
million in ratepayer money collected in the 1980s, and it is
expected to continue growing to a total of $210 million.
</P>
<P>
   But the money can be used only with the permission of the
California Public Utilities Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, PG&AMP;E asked the utilities commission for $7
million from the fund to pay for design of the dry casks, and to
get them licensed and approved by the federal government. The
company has also requested that the purchasing and loading the dry
casks, estimated at $16 million, be paid for by the fund.
</P>
<P>
   The utilities commission is slated to hold public hearings on
the request later this summer and in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   In an ironic twist, the Redwood Alliance finds itself allied
with PG&AMP;E, pushing the utilities commission to pay for the work and
move the process ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's our goal, to get this taken apart as soon as we can,''
Adams said. ``In some senses, we're on the same side (with PG&AMP;E)
for the first time because we agree this should go forward at
Humboldt Bay. Everything is moving forward. We just want to make
sure it's done right.''
</P>
<P>
   PG&AMP;E officials say they have included great leeway in their
estimate that it will cost $195 million to dismantle the plant.
However, one official admitted it is a bit like planning for a
vacation two or three years away because so many variables could
come into play and change the estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Adams fears cost overruns could deplete the fund and force PG&AMP;E
one day to return to ratepayers for more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a whole lot of faith in these numbers,'' Adams
said. ``We're just trying to open up the door and get people to
realize what a huge cost uncertainty we have here.''

exercise in journalistic discipline into a personal referendum, one
more swaggering scene in the long-running Boston drama of ``us'' _
working-class Bostonians _ vs. ``them'' _ the Globe. By Felicity

   BOWERS _ Mississippi is preparing yet again to open old wounds
and air out dirty laundry - KKK leader Sam Bowers is going on trial
August 17 - for the fifth time - for the murder of Vernon Dahmer
Sr. A Hattiesburg civil rights activist who died in 1966 when he
tried to protect his family from a band of about 16 klansmen
torching his home. The Dahmer family has waited a long time for
this day; meanwhile, Bowers and his co-defendants are cocky. Bowers
has said he wants to get in court as soon as possible. And Devours
Nix, who was arrested and will stand trial later this year, got out
of jail by claiming he was too ill for it, and then was caught
teeing off at a golf course. Will the state finally put these men
in jail? (Rochell, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   PROBE-COSTS _ WASHINGTON _ Critics of independent counsel
Kenneth Starr have made the $40-50 million spent on the probe of
President Clinton into a rallying cry. Starr's defenders turn the
tables, asserting that White House delay tactics, stonewalling, and
costly court appeals have dragged out the four-year probe and
driven up the price tag. And that is just part of the money battle
that has been a backdrop in this titanic legal struggle. (Malone,
Washington Bureau)

   LEGAL _ If she were President Bill Clinton's lawyer, Susan
Brenner says she would advise him to tell the truth. Brenner, a
professor of law at the University of Dayton, doesn't say that in
an old-fashioned, all-American, cannot-tell-a-lie tone. She says it
because she feels the president is in grave danger of being hung
out to dry by Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr, which could happen
if he lies and perjures himself. (Kline, Dayton Daily News). 15.
</P>
<P>
   LOGGING _ The era of big timber is over at the U.S. Forest
Service. Or at least that is what Chief Mike Dombeck says. But as
Dombeck moves to reform the agency away from being timber based to
being more ecologically based ,he is facing resistance from within
his own agency, critcism from industry and its allies in Congress
and skeptism from environmentalist who contend that Dombeck is long
on rhetoric but short on action. We focus on how Dombeck's agenda
is affecting the management of the 4.5 million acres of national
forests in the eastern United States. (Harmon, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

CLINTON PREPARES FOR ADMISSION AND APOLOGY IN LEWINSKI TESTIMONY  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Sunday rehearsed a possible
admission of an ``inappropriate relationship'' with former White
House intern Monica Lewinski as he prepared for make-or-break
testimony before a grand jury investigating his conduct.
</P>
<P>
   White House Deputy Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the
president had not reached a decision about whether to make a public
statement before departing on a two-week vacation on Martha's
Vineyard, Mass., after his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony caps a seven month investigation by
independent counsel Kenneth Starr into allegations of a sexual
relationship and attempted cover up.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats publicly scripted politically
acceptable remarks for Clinton as the president huddled with his
lawyers in the upstairs residence of the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah,
counseled Clinton to be ``blunt _ tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch added: ``If he does that and then really asks the American
people to forgive him or at least work with him, I think the
polling shows that the American people probably are willing to
allow him to finish out his term.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch said the American people are so eager to put the episode
behind the nation that they are willing to accept that Clinton lied
under oath and to them in public statements when he denied a sexual
relationship with Lewinski.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing this president could do is say, `Look, I was
trying to protect my wife, my daughter from pain and suffering that
I'd caused,''' Hatch advised.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., the second ranking Democrat on the
House Judiciary Committee and a brother of Ann Lewis, the White
House director of communications, offered a similar assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out that the president is going to say, yes, there
was some sexual activity between him and Monica Lewinsky and he
covered that up to protect his family, herself, himself, et cetera,
I think that will be regrettable, but hardly an impeachable
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch and Frank appeared on NBC News' ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, who served as Clinton's White House chief of staff
through his re-election, said that if Clinton ``changes his
testimony and acknowledges an improper relationship here, he
obviously is going to have to go through a lot of pain himself, not
only in apologizing to his wife and his family, but obviously to
the staff and to those that he misled and to the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Panetta counseled being forthright nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, R-Fla., a high ranking member of the House
Judiciary Committee, signaled that some Republicans may not accept
a presidential admission of a lie with an apology. McCollum, in an
appearance on CBS News' ``Face the Nation,'' said that a president
cannot ``be held to any less standard than we hold somebody else
who has committed a crime, and perjury is a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   McCollum added: ``If at the end of the day I concluded that the
president of the United States lied under oath in a judicial court
proceeding, I would have a very hard time not voting to recommend
impeachment to the House.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides said that Clinton was working on the phrasing, voice tone
and body language that he might use during Monday's closed-circuit
testimony to a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton fielded questions from his team of personal lawyers, led
by Washington superlawyer David Kendall and Mickey Kantor, the
tough Los Angeles corporate lawyer who served as a top campaign
adviser in 1992 and later commerce secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall said in a terse written statement that he said was
issued to staunch ``an enormous amount of groundless speculation''
about Clinton's testimony that: ``The truth is the truth. Period.
And that's how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' only public appearance on Sunday was to attend
church services at Foundry United Methodist Church. The couple
entered the church holding hands. Clinton clutched his bible. He
waved to a crowd. Mrs. Clinton wore sunglasses on an overcast day
with occasional rain.
</P>
<P>
   During a moment in the service when members of the congregation
exchanged greetings with each other, more than a dozen people
reached out to the president.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Shropshire Jr., minister of the parish, told his
congregation: ``When you have opposition and hopeless situations,
God bears us up on eagles' wings.''
</P>

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE -- OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has repeatedly denied having a sexual relationship with
Lewinski, 25, who started working at the White House as a
21-year-old college graduate.
</P>
<P>
   In a Jan. 17 deposition in the Paula Jones' sexual harassment
suit, Clinton said: ``I have never had sexual relations with Monica
Lewinski. I have never had an affair with her.''
</P>
<P>
   In remarks at the White House on Jan. 26, Clinton publicly
reiterated his denial as his wife stood by his side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never had sexual relations with that woman, Ms.
Lewinski,'' declared Clinton, wagging his finger for emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinski initially denied a sexual relationship with Clinton in
a sworn affidavit in the Jones' law suit. But after winning
immunity from prosecution from Starr, Lewinski told Starr's grand
jury on Aug. 6 that she carried out an 18-month sexual relationship
with the president, according to lawyers familiar with her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is the first American president who is the focus of a
criminal investigation who will testify before a grand jury. But
his appearance is carefully circumscribed.
</P>
<P>
   After Starr insisted Clinton testify in a July 17 subpoena,
Clinton's lawyers negotiated unique arrangements that would not be
available to ordinary Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony is limited to a single day in contrast to
some of the more than 70 witnesses who have appeared before the
grand jury since January who have returned four or five times.
Clinton's testimony is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. EDT Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is being permitted to remain at the White House rather
than being required to appear before the grand jury in person in a
federal court house a dozen blocks away.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton will have the support of three lawyers during his
testimony _ Kendall and Nicole Seligman of the Williams &AMP; Connolly
firm, and White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's testimony will be relayed to the grand jury via a
closed-circuit one-way television link that will, in effect, work
to limit spontaneous questions from the 23-member grand jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Grand jurors with questions must relay their questions to a
prosecutor in the grand jury room who will then relay it by phone
to one of the prosecutors asking Clinton questions at the White
House.

   NEW YORK _ The restless clan of chic geeks and entrepreneurs who
populate New York's new media industry may not be anywhere near as
rich as their West Coast counterparts. But in the pages of Jason
McCabe Calacanis' monthly magazine, Silicon Alley Reporter, they
emerge far more glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   ``The industry here is driven by people,'' Calacanis, 27,
lectured a magazine job applicant recently over breakfast at
Balthazar's, a trendy downtown restaurant. ``On the West Coast
there are a handful of celebrities _ Bill Gates, Larry Ellison,''
Calacanis said, referring to the chairman of the world's two
largest software companies. ``Those people are boring. They don't
take good pictures.''
</P>
<P>
   Calacanis' irreverence is either refreshing or hopelessly
sophomoric, depending on one's point of view. Yet his shameless
boosterism of Silicon Alley _ New York's downtown multimedia hub _
has helped create the aura of community and even home-team spirit
for a disparate group of colleagues and competitors who otherwise
might have little more in common than being located in Manhattan
and trying to find some sort of profitable business on the World
Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly Calacanis' application of celebrity journalism to the
world of New York new media has earned him a certain measure of
success. In less than two years the Silicon Alley Reporter has
grown from a few photocopied sheets to 116 glossy pages, on the
strength of advertising sales and revenue from the periodic
industry conferences Calacanis has organized like last month's
``Rising Tide Summit,'' which attracted more than 200 registrants
who paid $500 each to attend.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, there is a growing sense in some quarters that the
community identity that Silicon Alley Reporter has worked so hard
to sell may no longer be the way many members of that community
want to see themselves _ or be seen by the larger business world.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are some holdouts, notably the online magazines
Feed and Word, increasingly, the definition of ``new media'' in New
York seems to be moving away from artsy, underfunded Web sites like
Stim, a Prodigy pop-culture project that fell by the wayside, or
the interactive soap opera The East Village. The new media seem to
be maturing instead into online extensions of the old-line
Manhattan media _ whether in advertising, marketing, publishing or
broadcasting.
</P>
<P>
   And as venture-capitalized start-ups evolve into IPO-financed
corporations, some industry executives are concerned that
Calacanis' unflagging promotion of an image evoking artists' lofts
and SoHo may be at odds with the businesslike demeanor that will
play well in boardrooms and on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a hypester in an industry that could do with less
hype,'' said Kyle Shannon, co-founder of Agency.com. The company's
shareholder is the giant advertising holding company Omnicom and
which through a series of acquisitions has become the largest
agency devoted to creating advertising on the Internet. ``There are
two Silicon Alleys _ the one where people go to the parties and the
one where people actually do the work,'' Shannon said.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, many of the citizens of Silicon Alley are not yet
ready to go completely corporate _ to stop dressing in black or
bleaching their hair blonde or, among the men, raising goatees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to work very hard to balance the kind of
accountability we have to have now with the creative risk-taking
that brought us to where we are,'' said Nicholas Butterworth,
president of Sonicnet, an Internet broadcaster acquired last year
by the cable giant Tele-Communications Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to move to new office space, and I'm scared,'' said
Butterworth, whose company has been located in a loft. ``One of the
terrible and great things about Sonicnet is we have no walls. What
happens if we put up walls?''
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth said he reads the Silicon Alley Reporter because
Calacanis, a former gossip columnist from Brooklyn, manages to tell
it mostly like it is. ``Is it balanced? No. It's partisan. But it
delivers the goods.''
</P>
<P>
   Few would fault Calacanis for not speaking his mind _ although
he seems to save his rants for subjects beyond the borders of
downtown Manhattan. Born of a new-media column that he was writing
for Paper Magazine, the first issue of Silicon Alley Reporter
carried the headline ``Microsoft Alienates Alley.'' And in his
daily e-mail feed last week, Calacanis critiqued Texas-based
Zapata's Internet acquisition strategy as ``over-simplistic 1995
thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   Other characteristic fixtures of Calacanis' magazine include a
controversial map that highlights a revolving _ some say random _
bunch of new media firms below 57th Street. Then there's the
monthly feature labeled ``Digital Dim Sum: They Lead the Charmed
Life so You Don't Have To,'' which presents paparazzi-style
photographs of aspiring Silicon Alley business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason's challenge will be to figure out what his focus is as
the industry fragments into its logical genres,'' said Josh Harris,
co-founder of the online research firm Jupiter Communications and
now chief executive of an Internet television venture. ``I look at
my contemporaries and we've all been through the war and we all
know it's never going to be the same. It's like after my freshman
year, it's time to leave the dorm.''
</P>
<P>
   At last month's conference, for instance, some attendees
grumbled at the hour devoted to interviewing the Belgian anarchist
who won notoriety earlier this year by throwing a cream pie in the
face of Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jason doesn't represent Silicon Alley,'' said one attendee,
who insisted on anonymity because he didn't want to risk
retribution in print. ``This is someone who is busy being flip and
glib when the industry is really about serious people who are
running serious businesses.''
</P>
<P>
   But such criticism may also belie a certain defensiveness about
the industry's lingering immaturity, even as it struggles through
adolescence.
</P>
<P>
   ``What people try to avoid saying about Jason, and it's not
really about Jason but about the industry in New York, is that it's
small-time,'' said Michael Wolff, the newly appointed media
columnist for New York magazine and author of ``Burn Rate'' (Simon
and Schuster, 1998), a book about the rise and fall of his own New
York new media company. ``The point about New York is we have not
had a defining business here,'' Wolff said.

<P>
   The Alley's derivative nickname first caught on in 1995, with
the explosion of Web and the conviction that its ``content'' _ the
techie catch-all for magazines, newspapers, music, movies, TV,
advertising and various vaguely defined interactive stuff _ would
be produced in the world's media capital.
</P>
<P>
   But of all of those things, only advertising has shown a
propensity to make money on the Web. Moreover, the truly successful
Web content _ at least this month _ appears to be the information
tools or ``portals'' aggregated by major search engines like Yahoo,
Excite and Snap!, which are all located on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, New York partisans are quick to point to the initial
public offering of Doubleclick, an advertising services firm, which
went public last winter at $17 a share and closed Friday at $43.
City officials cite a survey conducted by Coopers &AMP; Lybrand that
shows that by mid-1997, the number of new- media jobs and companies
had doubled to 105,771 and 4,881, respectively, in a mere 18
months.
</P>
<P>
   And on Friday, shares of 24/7, another Web advertising firm,
rose 45 percent to close at $20.25 in its first day of trading. Two
more New York companies, The Globe, an online community Web site
and Earthweb, an interactive services firm, also recently announced
their intention to go public.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts, the disadvantage of being across the continent
from Sand Hill Road where Silicon Valley's venture capitalists hold
court is not as sharp as it once was, as East Coast investors like
Flatiron Partners take up some of the slack.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, in the insular new media community, the fact that Joanne
Wilson, wife of a Flatiron partner, Fred Wilson, sells advertising
for the Silicon Alley Reporter has raised eyebrows in some circles.
</P>
<P>
   Calacanis denies critics' contention that the companies Wilson
invests in get special editorial consideration.
</P>
<P>
   A black belt in karate who put himself through Fordham
University repairing electronic equipment, Calacanis makes no
pretense to vaunted journalistic objectivity. ``It's no secret I'm
a fan of this industry,'' he said. ``We write about every failure.
We cover it. We don't obsess over it.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduating with a degree in psychology, Calacanis landed a
job in technical support for Sony Corp.'s legal department. A
habitual hustler, he managed to talk his way into a ride on the
corporate jet to chat about the internet with Sony's
then-president, Michael Schulhof.
</P>
<P>
   A project for America Online that he developed after leaving
Sony did not take off, but in the winter of 1996, Calacanis took
the modest sum America Online paid him for his efforts and started
Silicon Alley Reporter, which he initially wrote, produced and
distributed almost entirely himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with a staff of eight helping him put out the magazine,
Calacanis is growing up and branching out. Forsaking neighborhood
loyalties for the prospect of a new market, he has been spending a
lot of time in Los Angeles lately and has begun running a ``Digital
Coast Reporter'' insert in the magazine, appropriating the
appellation a group of Southern California new-media entrepreneurs
recently bestowed on the region.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, meanwhile, to compete with a local online news
service, (AT)NY, Calacanis recently started a daily e-mail news
feed.
</P>
<P>
   And he has entered into a partnership with Gordon Gould, 28, who
has put more than $100,000 into the magazine _ its first
investment. On behalf of the magazine, Gould also organized a
conference last month at the New York Historical Society, where
Palm Pilot-toting new-media executives dined on sushi and were
invited to think beyond their business concerns to the social
implications of the Web and related media.
</P>
<P>
   David Bunnell, a West Coast technology publishing veteran who
attended the conference, said he came away bullish on the New York
new-media enclave and on The Silicon Alley Reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What good magazines do is identify some kind of audience and
provide the members of that audience with a sense of membership and
belonging; and they've done that remarkably well,'' said Bunnell,
who runs the trade publication Upside. ``What they lack in
resources they make up for in enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   And as with the industry Calacanis covers, maturity shows signs
of tempering raw enthusiasm. One evening last week, dressed in
black with sunglasses atop his head, Calcanis made an appearance at
a SoHo courtyard party held by the Web ad-tracking company
I-Traffic. Six months ago he might have been carrying a camera to
snap the faces of his favorite entrepreneurs and their hangers-on.
But this time he said there would be no party report in his
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have other things to do; I have to write an analysis of the
Ticketmaster-City Search deal,'' he said, referring to last week's
announcement of a West Coast new-media merger. ``I have to get the
daily out. I have work to do.''

 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the top of the first inning at Fenway Park on
Tuesday night, the city's man in the news made his way to his box
seats next to the Red Sox dugout. On either side, people who were
there said, fans cheered Mike Barnicle, the columnist for The
Boston Globe. Hands patted his back. Some well-wishers asked for
his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Only hours before, Barnicle had endured a much less pleasant
encounter. He stood at a news conference and apologized to
colleagues for his ``sloppiness'' and ``creating embarrassment for
the paper'' after he used some jokes from comedian George Carlin in
a column without attributing them.
</P>
<P>
   But according to the well-wishers' reaction at Fenway, their guy
had won. Mike had kept his job. He had taken on the Globe's
management, defied its demand for his resignation. For a proud man,
a two-month suspension without pay was humiliating but a minor
victory nevertheless.
</P>
<P>
   Some people will say that Barnicle, who is 54, does not matter
as much to Boston as he used to. Even so, he remains enough of a
figure to have turned a painful exercise in journalistic discipline
into a personal referendum, one more swaggering scene in the
long-running Boston drama of Us vs. Them.
</P>
<P>
   For working-class neighborhoods, the Globe has been Them. ``It's
an institution,'' said Carter Wilkie, an aide to Mayor Thomas
Menino, ``that has long been criticized as driven by elites, that
speaks to elites _ the progressive elites, representing the Puritan
tradition of civic responsibility. Mike is the voice of the
unrepentant, unapologetic common man.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of this, some people say that Barnicle, who grew up
working class himself in Fitchburg, has been an important link to
the blue-collar communities that felt the paper did not care about
them.
</P>
<P>
   Other observers take a slightly different tack, seeing the
columnist as a monument to a time when the city was locked in an
old battle of Yankees vs. Irish, Puritans vs. Catholics, a battle
that is part of the city's past and has little to do with its
high-technology, multiethnic present.
</P>
<P>
   But plenty of people in the city still see the newspaper, which
sends 473,000 copies around the city, state and New England every
weekday and nearly 750,000 on Sundays, as the voice of the elite,
of BMW-driving social engineers who send their children to private
schools.
</P>
<P>
   During the busing controversy of the 1970s, as J. Anthony Lukas
described it in his 1985 book ``Common Ground,'' the Globe became
so identified with the pro-busing forces that bullets were fired
into its lobby. Police snipers briefly hid on its roof.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, the newspaper, said former editor Michael
Janeway, was derided in working-class neighborhoods. It became for
those people ``the voice of some blind avenging abstract justice.
It was a justice located in the western suburbs, that had no
understanding for the feelings and dilemmas of the poor white
people of Boston,'' Janeway said.
</P>
<P>
   As Barnicle remembers the feelings of the white students, ``All
of them knew that graduation from South Boston High wasn't a ticket
to Harvard. If they were lucky they might get a union card. Who was
the Globe to tell them this was what should happen to them?''
</P>
<P>
   In January 1973, Barnicle, who had been an elevator operator in
the Cannon House Office Building and a low-level Democratic
political operative, caught the eye of the Globe's political
writer, Robert L. Healy. At his urging, Jack Driscoll, the editor
of The Evening Globe, looked at Barnicle's work.
</P>
<P>
   He had a strong voice, resonant to blue-collar readers even when
he was taking liberal positions they despised. As recounted in
``Common Ground,'' in the midst of the anti-busing rage in 1974, he
urged Edward M. Kennedy, the state's senior Senator, to speak to
angry demonstrators. ``You could tell them, senator, that law knows
no neighborhood, that justice is not confined to any one block,
that fear must be put aside and the fact of law adhered to.''
</P>
<P>
   His role, said Janeway, who joined the Globe in 1978, after the
busing crisis, was ``papering over busing's wound.'' He added,
``The symbolic importance of someone like Barnicle became
outsized.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle joined the morning newspaper when The Evening Globe
folded in 1985. He got into television. He sometimes got the
newspaper in trouble; over the years the newspaper has paid at
least $115,000 in two legal settlements as a result of his work,
according to two lawyers who have been briefed on the cases.
</P>
<P>
   But he made his voice heard. He wrote angrily about criminals
(``maggots'') and scathingly about political opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a member of the state Legislature for six years,'' said
Tom Vallely, a close friend of Barnicle who is now director of the
Vietnam program at the Harvard Institute for International
Development. ``I represented a large part of the gay and lesbian
community. Mike Barnicle wrote an article ridiculing the gay pride
parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``The organizers came to me and said, `He's your friend. Will
you denounce him?' I said, `No. Mike Barnicle's unfair to everyone.
Including you.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Those attacked by Barnicle often attacked back. The Globe
defended him. But by 1991, when Boston Magazine was making
well-publicized and apparently futile efforts to find some of the
people he quoted, some colleagues wondered whether he cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were all these rumors and rumblings about Barnicle, none
of them proven,'' Matthew Storin, the newspaper's editor, said
recently. When Storin was shown evidence in 1995 that another
columnist, Patricia Smith, was fabricating characters, he decided
to avoid an immediate confrontation with Ms. Smith. If she
acknowledged fabrication and resigned then, Storin said, he feared
``Barnicle would be caught up in the wake of that, and I wasn't
sure if I could save him, even if the charges had been unfounded.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the case of Barnicle, few reporters or editors brought
their suspicions to those in authority. ``It's my belief that his
work has never been scrutinized to the degree any other reporter's
work would be,'' said Sarah Snyder, an assistant metropolitan
editor. Barnicle and his editors deny that.
</P>
<P>
   For many people in the city, Barnicle's voice, sometimes maudlin
and sometimes pugnacious, had strong appeal. As Wilkie of the
mayor's office describes it, ``It's the voice of Archie Bunker vs.
the the voice of the church lady with her syrupy, self-righteous,
almost silly sense of order and rectitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the elites that Barnicle took swipes at were his
colleagues. In 1992, he wrote, ``missing a story seldom bothers
more than a handful around here,'' a moment recalled in an article
about Barnicle in the current issue of The Boston Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   His relations with the Globe's management were mercurial well
before The New York Times Co. bought the newspaper for $1.1 billion
in 1993. Editors like Thomas Winship sometimes rode herd on him and
sometimes indulged him, according to Winship and two other former
Globe editors, Janeway and Driscoll.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, as a member of the Newspaper Guild, Barnicle was among
those offered a buyout. After he threatened to take it, saying he
was burned out, Driscoll, then the editor, gave him a three-month
leave without pay. He returned as an associate editor with a hefty
six-figure salary.
</P>
<P>
   The salary, a new office and his television celebrity friends
rankled colleagues who felt ``Boston Mike'' was nothing more than a
persona. ``I never got a sense of the deep hostility there is
apparently out there in the newsroom toward me,'' Barnicle said on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   He also has ardent newsroom loyalists, from Stan Grossfeld, the
Pulitzer-Prize-winning photographer, to telephone operators. The
sports-media critic Howard Manly, who admires Barnicle's knowledge
of the city, calls him ``a stand-up guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Outside the Globe, he has strong partisans, as the scene at
Fenway Park showed. And as Barnicle sees it, the Globe and his
partisans are on opposite sides of the city's cultural divide.
</P>
<P>
   ``As busing recedes into memory,'' he said, ``other social
issues and the Globe's position on them have taken busing's place
and added to the resentment. It has fairly liberal positions on
abortion, sexual preference, affirmative action.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert S. Larkin Jr., a former managing editor who is the
Globe's vice president and assistant to the publisher, does not
believe Barnicle's old role still makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   For a long time, he said, Barnicle ``did play the role of
someone who was the voice of the disenfranchised, the powerless.
But that simply is not something that works in the 1990s. A new
generation of leaders has emerged from different groups. The
managing editor of the Globe is an African-American man. Women have
a new voice in the city. The Latino population has a voice of its
own. We're clinging to the old model when the new model has formed
around us.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Barnicle and his partisans, the old model of Us vs. Them
was alive and well when Storin, feeling deceived over the jokes
column, demanded his resignation. This time, it was the people's
writer vs. irrationally rigid journalistic justice. The editors,
however, felt it was less a question of justice than of standards.
In a letter to readers in Sunday's paper, Storin said, ``Members of
my staff want to know that our journalistic standards are not being
compromised. They want to be held to the highest standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle, who said Sunday that he ``respects'' Storin's
position, was not so understanding before last week's reprieve. At
that time, the man who once defused the resentment against the
Globe used it in his attack. The street guy also had powerful
advertisers and journalistic heavyweights on his side.
</P>
<P>
   After Barnicle led such a battle, it was inevitable that, when
Storin and Globe publisher Benjamin B. Taylor softened his
punishment to make it ``fit the crime,'' as they said, critics
contended they had retreated under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Barnicle survived as a columnist. But his old role may not have.
</P>
<P>
   Some of his colleagues were openly skeptical of his explanation
of the Carlin joke fiasco _ that he had not read the book ``Brain
Droppings'' but had gotten the jokes from friends. On Friday,
Barnicle said that these two friends now ``don't know that they
gave me the lines.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't tell me the source of the jokes,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   In the Boston Phoenix article, media writer Dan Kennedy said,
``Barnicle is still standing'' like a monument. ``But to what?''

PRESIDENT FACES HISTORIC ENCOUNTER WITH GRAND JURY
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday faces the painful
prospect of becoming the first chief executive in U.S. history to
testify to a grand jury as the primary target of a criminal
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of Sunday preparing for his historic encounter
with independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who is weighing possible
perjury and obstruction of justice charges against him that could
in turn lead to an impeachment inquiry by Congress in the fall.
Starr's questions are likely to delve into the most intimate
details of the president's extra-marital sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who turns 52 on Wednesday, has pledged to testify
``completely and truthfully,'' via a secure one-way closed-circuit
video link, about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, 25, the
former White House intern who earlier this month went before the
same 23 grand jurors under a broad grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, again urged Clinton to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it on NBC's Meet the Press: ``If he does that and then
really asks the American people to forgive him or at least work
with him, I think the polling shows that the American people
probably are willing to allow him to finish out his term and wait
to replace him until the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hatch added, ``if he lies before the grand jury, that would
be grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes session with Starr and his prosecutorial team is
expected to begin at about 1 p.m. (EDT) and consume much of the
afternoon. It will take place in the Map Room of the White House,
where Franklin Roosevelt once followed the course of World War II
and where Clinton sipped coffee with wealthy backers in building a
huge political war chest for his 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters that
Clinton would probably make a televised appearance after his
testimony to the grand jurors, who will be at the federal
courthouse, 12 blocks away down Pennsylvania Avenue, watching on
large color monitors. He will then leave for a two-week vacation at
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton evaluated his embarrassing legal and political
problems with his wife Hillary and with a tight circle of lawyers,
the president's official aides and friends were spinning various
scenarios of just how his responses on Monday might differ from
what he said when the scandal first broke last January.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Clinton emphatically denied having any kind of
``improper'' relationship with Lewinsky and, specifically, of
having ``sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to dampen such scenarios, David Kendall,
Clinton's chief private lawyer, issued a rare statement stating:
``There is apparently an enormous amount of groundless speculation
about the president's testimony tomorrow. The truth is the truth --
period. And that is how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached with Starr last month, Kendall will
accompany Clinton when he testifies to the grand jury, a privilege
not normally available to witnesses. In agreeing to appear, Clinton
has waived his constitutional protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kendall, Clinton will have access in the
ground-floor Map Room to Nicole Seligman, a Kendall associate, and
to White House counsel Charles Ruff. Along with the first lady, it
is only this group that knows how the Clinton will deal with his
extraordinary interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not diminish a rash of conjecture that the
president was about to change his story after nearly seven months
and admit to having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has already queried everyone from Linda Tripp, who taped
20 hours of conversations with Lewinsky, to several dozen Secret
Service agents who protect Clinton, to the president's closest
confidants. Lewinsky, who worked at the White House as an intern
from July 1995 to April 1996, visited the White House on 37
occasions after April 1996, most recently in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton tells the grand jurors, his testimony will
almost certainly will not put an end to his woes. Congress is due
to receive a secret report from Starr, probably in September, which
will be referred to the House Judiciary Committee. That panel must
then decide whether to hold an impeachment inquiry.

ANALYSIS: STRIKES RAISE KEY ISSUES OF HOW BELLS CAN COMPETE 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also AT&AMP;T-TCI-GREENTHAL)

 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The stock of Bell Atlantic Corp. has lost 11.8 percent of its
value since Aug. 3, when the 73,000 of its employees who are
represented by the Communications Workers of America authorized the
union to call the strike that began the next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Over the same period, shares of the other four local Bell
telephone companies _ each with their own big union contingents _
have declined by an average of 3.8 percent. While three of them _
Ameritech, BellSouth and SBC Communications _ have signed new labor
contracts since last spring, about 34,000 union workers at U S West
walked off the job early Sunday after failing to reach an accord
over contract issues that include a new performance-based pay
structure.
</P>
<P>
   It was not surprising that Bell Atlantic's shareholders showed
signs of being spooked before the strike. More intriguing was that
investors showed no sign of relief even after workers returned to
their jobs last Tuesday after a two-day walkout. The company's
stock remained essentially flat for the rest of the week, closing
at $41.125 on Friday, down $1.8125. Nor, with U S West's labor
situation unsettled, have the shares of the other Bells rebounded.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the stock market's broad downturn, of course, there
may be no need to read labor implications into the dip of the Bell
shares. But strikes, or even the threat of them, raise important
questions about the Bells' ability to compete in the $200 billion
telecommunications industry _ a business where they will try to
move beyond conventional local service to offer long-distance and
Internet services.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, a key victory for the communications workers at
Bell Atlantic was the union's securing rights to install and
maintain sophisticated new data networks, limiting the company's
ability to use lower-paid nonunion labor for such work.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into this future marketplace, where few of their rivals
are unionized, the Bells will carry a significant labor legacy.
According to the Communications Workers of America, overall union
representation, including the International Brotherhood of
Electrical Workers, at each of the five Bells is an average of 60.7
percent of the work force. Meanwhile, among the companies with
which the Bells will be competing _ alternative local carriers,
long-distance companies, Internet service providers and cable
companies _ only  &UR; AT&AMP;T &LR;  Corp.has a large union work force.
</P>
<P>
   All of this raises key questions. Do their large proportions of
union workers put the Bells at a long-term disadvantage in a
brutally competitive market where almost all of the other players
use mostly nonunion labor? And even if labor costs end up
representing only a fraction of the Bells' business costs, will the
need to negotiate new ways of operating with a big union hamper the
companies' ability to move nimbly in a fast-changing environment?
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic executives refused to discuss these matters last
week. But the issues seem unlikely to go away. True, labor issues
will probably not be the defining factor in the fate of the
regional Bells over the next few years. More influential will be
technological change, regulatory shifts and corporate takeovers.
And as Frank Governali, the head telecommunications analyst for
Credit Suisse First Boston, pointed out, good, creative management
can almost always trump potentially problematic labor questions.
But that management burden will undoubtedly be higher on the
leaders of the Bells than on their counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   And it cannot help but be an issue for the big corporate
customers who will have an expanding choice of service providers.
In awarding contracts, how do they factor in the potential costs of
a strike like Bell Atlantic's, in which installations and repairs
were simply not performed. Corporate communications managers might
ponder: This time the strike was only two days, but what if next
time it's two weeks? Or two months? Or four months, as with Nynex
Corp.in 1989?
</P>
<P>
   Morton Bahr, president of the Communications Workers of America,
said that his union's power actually provided a competitive
advantage to the unionized communications companies because they
offer customers a more knowledgeable, better trained work force.
``All the empirical evidence indicates that the best continuous
education programs for workers are in union shops,'' Bahr said last
week.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview before the U S West strike began, Jerry Brown, a
company spokesman, said that the union provided an efficient way
for management to communicate goals and strategies to its workers.
Yet, he also said that the main sticking point in the talks was the
company's plan to link more of a worker's pay to performance _
which, of course, tends to be the way pay is set in nonunion
workplaces.
</P>
<P>
   Such sticking points can only grow more important as competition
heats up in the industry, in the view of Eric Strumingher, a
telecommunications analyst at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   ``Short term, what's going to happen over the next three years,
I don't think labor's a major issue,'' Strumingher said. ``But on a
longer-term issue, and once the marketplace stabilizes and
everything evens out a bit, then we will get down to who has a low
operating-cost structure. The Bells are going to have some
questions to answer.'' &QL;

<P>
   Jay Leno, NBC's biggest late-night television star, climbed into
an outdoor ring in Sturges, S.D., on the evening of Aug. 8 and
threw himself into an increasingly ferocious wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the one with Hulk Hogan that Leno and his tag-team
partner Diamond Dallas Page ``won'' in a pay-per-view event staged
by World Championship Wrestling. That one, like all professional
wrestling matches, was only as ferocious as the script allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But in twisting Hogan's arm behind his back and making him howl
for mercy, Leno did become a participant in a wrestling match that
really is for blood: the one between broadcast television and cable
television over millions of dollars in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks became far more concerned about
advertising money flowing to cable this last spring, when for the
first time in several years total money committed to the network's
fall programing lineups declined, from about $6.1 billion last year
to about $6 billion this year. Cable, meanwhile, is projecting an
increase, from about $2.25 billion last year to about $2.8 billion
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling got in the middle of this high-stakes face-off because
weekly wrestling shows on three cable channels have become the
dominant hits of cable television. The cable channels with
wrestling shows, TNT, TBS and USA, are increasingly using this fact
to try to pry more revenue from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives, meanwhile, are trying, with some forced
subtlety, to reference the stereotype of the wrestling audience _
lower-income, under-educated _ as a reason why cable is not a place
premium advertisers ought to want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Though network executives, not wanting to look like snobs who
are writing off a segment of the American population, never overtly
cite the wrestling audience as an undesirable lot. Nevertheless,
they went out of their way during presentations of their new
programing to advertisers last spring to denigrate cable for its
heavy diet of full nelsons.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., bought full-page ads in several
newspapers asking advertisers ``wrestling with their mix,'' who
might be ``thinking of shifting ad dollars from broadcast to
cable'' to check out the list of top 15 shows on cable: eight of
them (highlighted in capital letters by ABC) were wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
   Leno's own network, NBC, which is owned by General Electric,
made much the same point when Don Ohlmeyer, president of the
network's west coast division, noted the prevalence of wrestling
among cable's most popular shows and suggested advertisers would be
getting ``the Gorgeous George Network _ all Hulk Hogan all the
time'' _ if they switched money into cable.
</P>
<P>
   The cable networks who program the bulk of cable wrestling are
not taking these comments lying on the mat. If anything, years of
frustration in finding respect _ and the ad money that goes with it
_ for wrestling have only increased the goal of stealing as much
money as they can from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   The cable networks point to statistics showing enormous numbers
of viewers _ especially young men _ tuning in to wrestling on a
regular basis. ``Between the two networks, 35 million viewers a
week are watching some portion of the wrestling shows every week,''
said Barry Koch, vice president for research at TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hammer, senior vice president of original production for
USA Networks Inc., said that on a weekly basis, the big wrestling
shows on the two channels on Monday nights reach ``more men between
the ages of 18 and 49 than shows like `Law and Order,' `NYPD Blue,'
`Homicide,' `Third Rock From the Sun' and `Spin City.'''
</P>
<P>
   In order to achieve these impressive numbers, the cable
executives are comparing five hours on two channels with individual
half hours and hours on the networks. But the fact that the
audience for wrestling is young, male and growing is not in
dispute. And those three factors almost always add up to increased
commitment from advertisers because young men are among the hardest
viewers for advertisers to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither network would cite specific revenue totals for
wrestling, Joe Uva, president of sales for Turner Entertainment, a
unit of Time Warner Inc., said that since 1994, ``revenues for
wrestling have increased tenfold.'' And Tim Brooks, senior vice
president of research for USA Networks, said that commercials in
wrestling that had once sold for as little as $5,000 are now
bringing in as much as $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Siegel, president of TNT, said, with a note of resentment
in his voice, that he had ``been out pounding the pavement for
three years'' trying to stir advertisers to put more money into
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed some bitterness that he was being asked about how
successful wrestling is becoming only after the networks started to
take on wrestling's popularity and a mainstream star like Leno
chose to participate in an event. ``ABC's full-page ad was borne of
ignorance,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited deals with advertisers like Pepsi, which after a lot of
effort, committed to a long-term deal for its Mug root beer, as
evidence that higher-profile advertisers were starting to accept
the value of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Uva cited other new advertisers who have put money into
wrestling, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, MCI Communications and
numerous movie companies. ``We used to mainly have advertisers like
motor oil and do-it-yourself companies,'' Uva said.
</P>
<P>
   The cable executives are emphasizing the growth of wrestling's
popularity beyond what was thought to be its base: rural areas of
the South and Midwest. Now, Siegel said, there are wrestling
viewing clubs on colleges like the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology and the University of California at Los Angeles.

   But there may be a limit to the kind of advertisers that the
wrestling shows can reach, and that may be where the broadcast
networks look to score points.
</P>
<P>
   In several demographic categories that networks use to elicit
premium prices from advertisers, wrestling does not seem to have
shed what Siegel labeled a ``stigma that it's a lower-income,
lower-educated phenomenon.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, the wrestling shows are short of competitive in
three audience breakdowns frequently employed by network salesmen:
homes with a professional or manager as head of household, homes
with a college graduate with $50,000-plus income and households of
$75,000-plus income.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, shows bring in the extra advertising dollars when
they can score more than 100 per cent in the index for attracting
homes in those three categories. For example, ``Monday Night
Football,'' which is broadcast head-to-head with the highest-rated
wrestling shows in the fall, scores 126 in the professional and
manager category and 133 in homes with more than $75,000 in income.
</P>
<P>
   The wrestling shows, meanwhile, never come close to a 100 score
in any category and sometimes fall into the 40s or even 30s. Koch,
the head of research for Turner, acknowledged these results and
said, ``We're not selling an upscale audience.'' Brooks, the head
of research for USA, said that wrestling needs to be sold to
advertisers of ``mass market products,'' not high-priced items like
BMW automobiles. ``You don't sell a Beamer to people watching
wrestling,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Siegel said that the wrestling shows on the two Turner channels
have consciously set out to expand the traditional audience for
wrestling by making it ``family entertainment.'' Thus, wrestling
long ago abandoned any pretense of being a sports event. As he put
it, ``it's a soap opera.''
</P>
<P>
   Eric Bischoff, president of World Championship Wrestling (when
he's not wrestling against Jay Leno as he did a week ago), talks
openly of ``creating the soap storyline.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea to involve Leno arose, he said, after Hogan made an
appearance on the ``Tonight'' show and his segment did especially
well in the ratings. So much for sniffing at the low-brow wrestling
audience: ``Tonight'' executives started calling, Bischoff said,
looking to find some wrestling role for Leno.
</P>
<P>
   Bischoff said he came up with a storyline that started off with
a faked takeover of Leno's set one night by Hogan and Bischoff,
leading to a challenge to settle it in the ring.
</P>
<P>
   For Leno, who donated his entire fee (which he said would
surpass $1 million) to charity, all of this was about ``having a
little fun in the summer when everything else is dead.'' He said,
``It's no different from going to Disneyland, with all these funny
characters.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Jay Leno, NBC's biggest late-night television star, climbed into
an outdoor ring in Sturges, S.D., on the evening of Aug. 8 and
threw himself into an increasingly ferocious wrestling match.
</P>
<P>
   No, not the one with Hulk Hogan that Leno and his tag-team
partner Diamond Dallas Page ``won'' in a pay-per-view event staged
by World Championship Wrestling. That one, like all professional
wrestling matches, was only as ferocious as the script allowed.
</P>
<P>
   But in twisting Hogan's arm behind his back and making him howl
for mercy, Leno did become a participant in a wrestling match that
really is for blood: the one between broadcast television and cable
television over millions of dollars in advertising revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The broadcast networks became far more concerned about
advertising money flowing to cable this last spring, when for the
first time in several years total money committed to the network's
fall programing lineups declined, from about $6.1 billion last year
to about $6 billion this year. Cable, meanwhile, is projecting an
increase, from about $2.25 billion last year to about $2.8 billion
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Wrestling got in the middle of this high-stakes face-off because
weekly wrestling shows on three cable channels have become the
dominant hits of cable television. The cable channels with
wrestling shows, TNT, TBS and USA, are increasingly using this fact
to try to pry more revenue from advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives, meanwhile, are trying, with some forced
subtlety, to reference the stereotype of the wrestling audience _
lower-income, under-educated _ as a reason why cable is not a place
premium advertisers ought to want to be.
</P>
<P>
   Though network executives, not wanting to look like snobs who
are writing off a segment of the American population, never overtly
cite the wrestling audience as an undesirable lot. Nevertheless,
they went out of their way during presentations of their new
programing to advertisers last spring to denigrate cable for its
heavy diet of full nelsons.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, a unit of Walt Disney Co., bought full-page ads in several
newspapers asking advertisers ``wrestling with their mix,'' who
might be ``thinking of shifting ad dollars from broadcast to
cable'' to check out the list of top 15 shows on cable: eight of
them (highlighted in capital letters by ABC) were wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
   Leno's own network, NBC, which is owned by General Electric,
made much the same point when Don Ohlmeyer, president of the
network's west coast division, noted the prevalence of wrestling
among cable's most popular shows and suggested advertisers would be
getting ``the Gorgeous George Network _ all Hulk Hogan all the
time'' _ if they switched money into cable.
</P>
<P>
   The cable networks who program the bulk of cable wrestling are
not taking these comments lying on the mat. If anything, years of
frustration in finding respect _ and the ad money that goes with it
_ for wrestling have only increased the goal of stealing as much
money as they can from the networks.
</P>
<P>
   The cable networks point to statistics showing enormous numbers
of viewers _ especially young men _ tuning in to wrestling on a
regular basis. ``Between the two networks, 35 million viewers a
week are watching some portion of the wrestling shows every week,''
said Barry Koch, vice president for research at TNT.
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Hammer, senior vice president of original production for
USA Networks Inc., said that on a weekly basis, the big wrestling
shows on the two channels on Monday nights reach ``more men between
the ages of 18 and 49 than shows like `Law and Order,' `NYPD Blue,'
`Homicide,' `Third Rock From the Sun' and `Spin City.'''
</P>
<P>
   In order to achieve these impressive numbers, the cable
executives are comparing five hours on two channels with individual
half hours and hours on the networks. But the fact that the
audience for wrestling is young, male and growing is not in
dispute. And those three factors almost always add up to increased
commitment from advertisers because young men are among the hardest
viewers for advertisers to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither network would cite specific revenue totals for
wrestling, Joe Uva, president of sales for Turner Entertainment, a
unit of Time Warner Inc., said that since 1994, ``revenues for
wrestling have increased tenfold.'' And Tim Brooks, senior vice
president of research for USA Networks, said that commercials in
wrestling that had once sold for as little as $5,000 are now
bringing in as much as $35,000.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Siegel, president of TNT, said, with a note of resentment
in his voice, that he had ``been out pounding the pavement for
three years'' trying to stir advertisers to put more money into
wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed some bitterness that he was being asked about how
successful wrestling is becoming only after the networks started to

chose to participate in an event. ``ABC's full-page ad was borne of
ignorance,'' Siegel said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited deals with advertisers like Pepsi, which after a lot of
effort, committed to a long-term deal for its Mug root beer, as
evidence that higher-profile advertisers were starting to accept
the value of wrestling.
</P>
<P>
   Uva cited other new advertisers who have put money into
wrestling, including Procter &AMP; Gamble, MCI Communications and
numerous movie companies. ``We used to mainly have advertisers like
motor oil and do-it-yourself companies,'' Uva said.
</P>
<P>
   The cable executives are emphasizing the growth of wrestling's
popularity beyond what was thought to be its base: rural areas of
the South and Midwest. Now, Siegel said, there are wrestling
viewing clubs on colleges like the Massachusetts Institute of

LAWYERS FACE UNIQUE OBSTACLES IN DEFENDING CHILDREN ACCUSED OF
VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By PAM BELLUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ As a lawyer for the likes of Rodney King, Latrell
Sprewell and Tupac Shakur, John Burris has experience handling
difficult, highly charged cases. But Burris, a prominent California
lawyer, wondered if he had met his match with a client he agreed to
defend two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The client, accused of attempted murder, whiled away strategy
sessions playing with Batman toys and action figures. In court,
Burris recalled, ``he would draw, he would get in his mother's lap,
he would sleep, he would make funny faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris found himself struggling with how to best represent his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communicating with a 6-year-old about legal matters is
impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first-grader was charged with trying to kill a neighbor's
newborn baby by dumping the infant out of his bassinet and
punching, kicking and beating him with a stick. In defending the
boy, Burris became one of a relative handful of lawyers
representing young children accused of deadly crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world of unexplored legal ground, raising a battery of
questions for defense lawyers. Do young children always understand
the charges against them? Can they assist in their own defense?
What happens when parents and lawyers have different definitions of
the child's best interest? If children are too young for juvenile
detention centers, where should they be held? If they confess to
crimes, have they knowingly waived their right to remain silent?
</P>
<P>
   Issues like this came to the fore again last week when two
Chicago boys, ages 7 and 8, were charged with murdering an
11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris, in an apparent attempt to take her
bicycle. Police officials said the boys began throwing rocks and
struck Ryan in the head, causing her to fall off her bicycle,
knocking her unconscious and fracturing her skull. They said at
least one of the boys then molested her with a tubular object, and
suffocated her to death by stuffing her panties in her mouth and
leaves and grass in her nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the arrests, defense lawyers have challenged
confessions the police said they obtained from the boys. The
lawyers have complained that parents were not in the room when the
boys were being interviewed and argued that the boys were incapable
of waiving their Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, faced with an Illinois law that bars children
under 10 from being confined in a locked facility, and reports from
psychological experts that the boys did not seem dangerous, a
Juvenile Court judge forged a Solomonic solution. He allowed the
boys to go home with their parents, but ordered them to stay inside
at all times and to wear electronic monitoring bracelets on their
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like this are uncharted territory, said Robert Schwartz,
executive director of the Juvenile Law Center, a nonprofit legal
service in Philadelphia that represents abused children and
children charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know a whole lot about kids who kill at this age
because there aren't a whole lot of them,'' he said. ``It's not
like kids who set fires, or kid sex offenders, where we know there
are certain patterns. These cases are all different _ in age,
premeditation, the weapon that's used.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the scarcity of meaningful precedents, defense lawyers in
these cases are feeling their way.
</P>
<P>
   Burris, a well-known Oakland civil rights lawyer, said that for
a meeting with his young defendant, he brought in his 8-year-old
son's toys, ``rolled up my sleeves and got on the floor and sought
to communicate that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the boy knock an action figure down and pop it right up
again, Burris said he could tell the boy had no sense of the
permanence of death. He also said his client ``never understood who
I was. It took him a long time to call me Burris. I was the talking
tall man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gagen, who represents 11-year-old Joshua Almaguer-Mendez,
charged with killing his 13-year-old neighbor by firing a rifle out
his bedroom window in Antioch, Calif., in June, consulted the
priest in his client's church, who ``came in and talked to Josh
about how it was important to talk to me, and I was a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has had some practice with children accused in killings,
with eight cases in the last 25 years involving children younger
than 11, including the 1994 case of two boys, ages 10 and 11,
accused of dropping a 5-year-old from the 14th floor of a housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Darron Bowden, until recently the supervising attorney in the
Cook County Public Defender's juvenile criminal division, said
lawyers in his office have used stick figures and sports analogies
(``our team, their team''), and drawn on their own experiences
raising children. Bowden, now in charge of the civil division, says
he tries to involve the child as much as possible with his own
defense, using whatever knowledge the child has. For example, the
child or his family might be able to lead the lawyer to witnesses
who have been identified only by their street names.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a client who might be too young to
describe himself, lawyers talk to teachers, coaches, even Cub Scout
leaders, as they try to understand how to frame the child's defense
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Often, defense lawyers wrestle with whether to claim their young
clients are incompetent. There are, first of all, gradations of
competence. Does the child understand right from wrong? Does he
understand that shooting a gun can kill someone? Does he understand
what it means to be on trial?
</P>
<P>
   Burris chose to argue incompetence for the 6-year-old from the
San Francisco suburb of Richmond, convinced that, even though the
charges were reduced to assault with great bodily injury, it was
best to ``get him out of the criminal justice component of the
system.'' A juvenile court referee agreed in July 1996, three
months after the charges were filed, and since then the boy has
been receiving treatment and other social services, Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   Gagen considered taking the same tack with Joshua, but he was
concerned about the time it would involve: weeks for psychiatric
evaluations, months or years in treatment, and, under California
law, the possibility of facing criminal charges once he was deemed
competent (a risk Burris' client also faces). For children this
young, he and other lawyers said, weeks can seem like eons, so
lawyers try to move the cases along as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 10, Joshua was convicted of a lesser charge, involuntary
manslaughter. But Gagen said he was never entirely convinced that
his client understood the magnitude of the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one occasion in a 10-day trial when he leaned
over and asked me something or complimented me about something or
expressed any anger,'' Gagen said. ``I didn't see much interest in
`Are we winning or losing? What are those witnesses saying or our
witnesses saying?'''

</P>
<P>
   William Lansat's client, Nathaniel Abraham, has already been
found competent to stand trial as an adult for fatally shooting an
18-year-old in Pontiac, Mich., last year, when Nathaniel was 11.
Lansat said he was considering a plea of diminished capacity,
claiming that Nathaniel could not have formed the intent to kill
and drawing on evaluations that he says show Nathaniel functions at
the level of a child three to five years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, defense lawyers have trouble dealing with a child's
parents, who may disagree with the lawyer's strategy or may even
wind up unwilling accomplices to a defense that claims the child's
problems were due to parental abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these parents come in and say, `Find my kid guilty. I
want to get him help.''' Lansat said. ``They don't understand that
the role of an attorney is to represent the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris came to believe early on that his client should not be
returned to his parents, something the boy's mother, naturally,
objected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were my loyalties here?'' he said he asked himself. ``I
could talk to the mother and the granddad, but I couldn't really
talk to the child.'' He ultimately succeeded in having the child
placed elsewhere. ``In terms of the gravity of what had happened, I
thought it was clear there was something wrong with that
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Howard, the lawyer for Mitchell Johnson, who pleaded guilty
last week to the school shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., a crime
committed at 13, said he had a difficult time with Mitchell's
parents, who are divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was constant friction between the two, and I was pretty
much in the middle,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in court, some lawyers try to showcase the youth of their
clients. The private lawyers defending the 8-year-old charged in
the Ryan Harris case stood him on a chair when one witness was
testifying and, on Thursday, brought a physician's scale into the
courtroom, propped the boy on it, and suggested that a child of 56
pounds and 4 feet 2 1/2 inches could not have committed such a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Bowden, are wary of going overboard. Often, he
said, a member of the public defender's staff is assigned the job
of calming, distracting and comforting the child in the courtroom.
The lawyers in the Ryan Harris case have kept both boys occupied
with toy cars, candy and coloring books.
</P>
<P>
   Most defense lawyers seek to avoid having their young clients
testify, fearing they could be ``pinned down by the rapid-fire
questions of the prosecutor,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these children are too young to be tried in adult court,
even under a rash of new state laws that have lowered the minimum
age. But defense lawyers say that as a result of recent
high-profile juvenile crimes, one of the main official distinctions
between juvenile and adult criminal proceedings _ that the approach
in adult court is adversarial, while juvenile court takes a more
collaborative route to a resolution _ has become a myth when
serious crimes are involved. Juvenile prosecutors are under
pressure to exact a tough price for an egregious crime.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bowden said, ``when you've got a kid who's incarcerated
looking down the barrel of some heavy-duty time, it's everything
but non-adversarial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These lawyers say the crucial difference with juvenile court is
that there is usually a judge instead of a jury and that juvenile
court judges have broad discretion in sentencing. And sentencing,
the lawyers say, is a crucial phase, as they try to convince a
judge that locking up a child for his impressionable adolescence
would not be in anyone's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``With older kids, they tell you `I did three years. I did the
crime.' They develop a philosophy,'' Schwartz said. ``The
7-year-old doesn't develop a philosophy. We have to worry about the
short-term and the long-term issues. Coming out of institutions
today are kids who we put away five or 10 years ago because we
thought they would be a danger to themselves or others.''

PRESIDENT FACES HISTORIC ENCOUNTER WITH GRAND JURY
</HEADLINE>
 BC- 
 Appends 2 graf shirttail describing Clinton day  By ANDREW J. GLASS 
 c.1998 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton on Monday faces the painful
prospect of becoming the first chief executive in U.S. history to
testify to a grand jury as the primary target of a criminal
proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   He spent much of Sunday preparing for his historic encounter
with independent counsel Kenneth Starr, who is weighing possible
perjury and obstruction of justice charges against him that could
in turn lead to an impeachment inquiry by Congress in the fall.
Starr's questions are likely to delve into the most intimate
details of the president's extra-marital sex life.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who turns 52 on Wednesday, has pledged to testify
``completely and truthfully,'' via a secure one-way closed-circuit
video link, about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, 25, the
former White House intern who earlier this month went before the
same 23 grand jurors under a broad grant of immunity.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Sen. Orrin Hatch, the Republican chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, again urged Clinton to do just that.
</P>
<P>
   As he put it on NBC's Meet the Press: ``If he does that and then
really asks the American people to forgive him or at least work
with him, I think the polling shows that the American people
probably are willing to allow him to finish out his term and wait
to replace him until the year 2000.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Hatch added, ``if he lies before the grand jury, that would
be grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The high-stakes session with Starr and his prosecutorial team is
expected to begin at about 1 p.m. (EDT) and consume much of the
afternoon. It will take place in the Map Room of the White House,
where Franklin Roosevelt once followed the course of World War II
and where Clinton sipped coffee with wealthy backers in building a
huge political war chest for his 1996 re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters that
Clinton would probably make a televised appearance after his
testimony to the grand jurors, who will be at the federal
courthouse, 12 blocks away down Pennsylvania Avenue, watching on
large color monitors. He will then leave for a two-week vacation at
Martha's Vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Clinton evaluated his embarrassing legal and political
problems with his wife Hillary and with a tight circle of lawyers,
the president's official aides and friends were spinning various
scenarios of just how his responses on Monday might differ from
what he said when the scandal first broke last January.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, Clinton emphatically denied having any kind of
``improper'' relationship with Lewinsky and, specifically, of
having ``sexual relations with that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In an apparent effort to dampen such scenarios, David Kendall,
Clinton's chief private lawyer, issued a rare statement stating:
``There is apparently an enormous amount of groundless speculation
about the president's testimony tomorrow. The truth is the truth --
period. And that is how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement reached with Starr last month, Kendall will
accompany Clinton when he testifies to the grand jury, a privilege
not normally available to witnesses. In agreeing to appear, Clinton
has waived his constitutional protection against
self-incrimination.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Kendall, Clinton will have access in the
ground-floor Map Room to Nicole Seligman, a Kendall associate, and
to White House counsel Charles Ruff. Along with the first lady, it
is only this group that knows how the Clinton will deal with his
extraordinary interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   But that did not diminish a rash of conjecture that the
president was about to change his story after nearly seven months
and admit to having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has already queried everyone from Linda Tripp, who taped
20 hours of conversations with Lewinsky, to several dozen Secret
Service agents who protect Clinton, to the president's closest
confidants. Lewinsky, who worked at the White House as an intern
from July 1995 to April 1996, visited the White House on 37
occasions after April 1996, most recently in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Clinton tells the grand jurors, his testimony almost
certainly will not put an end to his woes. Congress is due to
receive a secret report from Starr, probably in September, which
will be referred to the House Judiciary Committee. That panel must
then decide whether to hold an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his grand jury preparations, Sunday appeared to be a
normal day for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Arm-in-arm with his wife and Bible in hand, he went to church
with his wife. Later in the day, he was briefed by his national
security team, which is tracking situations in Northern Ireland,
where 28 people were killed Saturday in a car bombing, and in
Africa, where civil unrest raged in Congo and investigations
continued into embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A soaking rain will accompany low pressure tracking through the
Middle Atlantic States on Monday. The area of rain, which will
contain a few embedded thunderstorms, will spread from Pennsylvania
Monday morning to southeast New England by afternoon. In general,
rainfall tallies will average near one-half inch, though higher
amounts will occur locally. Scattered thunderstorms will also erupt
in the Southeast near the Appalachians as a jet stream disturbance
passing overhead lifts very sultry air enveloping the region.
Intervals of clouds and sunshine and spotty thunderstorms will
cover the remainder of the Southeast, including Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sunshine will boost daytime readings to near 100
degrees from northern Texas to western Kansas while temperatures
hold near 90 degrees in the central Rio Grande Valley as a cluster
of showers and thunderstorms crosses the region.
</P>
<P>
   A broken line of strong thunderstorms will precede a cold front
advancing through the Middle West. Behind the front, cooler and
drier air will spread into the upper Mississippi Valley. Farther
west, brisk winds gliding up the sloping terrain will fuel a
cluster of potent storms in eastern Montana and the western
Dakotas.
</P>
<P>
   Gray and cool weather will persist in northern sections of the
coastal Northwest while California stays mainly sunny and hot,
except for the coast where patchy clouds and cooler conditions will
occur. Ample sunshine will be seen in the interior West with
isolated afternoon storms in many of the mountains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Shower Cycle  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A lattice work of fog covered parts of southern Georgia and
Alabama on Sunday morning. The lower part of the atmosphere was
rather sultry. Afternoon thunderstorms seemed certain like previous
days, but the pattern of where they would first form was already
spelled out by the cloud configuration. A few slivers of clear sky
would give a head start to the day's heating, and cumulus clouds
initially grew over the clear patches. As the day progressed, these
billowy clouds became the first storms, but the areas that stayed
foggy the longest escaped the cycle of thundershowers. &QL;

 &HT;    Uma's Emma, `Avengers' slip on a Peel
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``The Avengers''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ralph Fiennes, Uma Thurman, Sean Connery. Directed by
Jeremiah Chechik. Rated PG-13 for action violence and some
innuendo. At metro theaters. 1 hour, 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Mrs. Peel, we're in need of a script doctor. And
another Mrs. Peel.
</P>
<P>
   In between sips of champagne and civilized quips, secret agents
John Steed (Ralph Fiennes) and Mrs. Emma Peel (Uma Thurman) foil
criminal masterminds plotting against the British government. It's
a shame Hollywood can't hire this pair to track down the Warner
Bros. executives responsible for churning out such expensive,
idiotic movies as ``Batman &AMP; Robin,'' ``The Postman'' and
``Sphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the studio's ominous decision not to show the film to
critics in time for Friday's opening, ``The Avengers'' isn't a
stink bomb. At least visually, it pays witty homage to the '60s
British TV series' vein of Carnaby Street surrealism. The flick
unreels in picture-postcard England dappled with the damndest
sights: a boardroom full of men dressed in teddy bear costumes, a
proper nanny who whips knives out of her baby carriage and, of
course, Thurman in leather.
</P>
<P>
   Except for a talent at filling out a catsuit, Thurman is one of
the movie's two big problems. The chief fault: a half-baked script
by Don MacPherson. He also wrote ``Absolute Beginners,'' another
movie long on style but lacking narrative coherence or momentum.
Same goes with ``The Avengers,'' which has Mrs. Peel and Steed
battling Sir August de Wynter (Sean Connery, looking slightly
embarrassed), who has found a way to control the weather. The plot
is less engrossing than it sounds.
</P>
<P>
   MacPherson has watched too many bad American action films,
emulating their lame puns and Schwarzenegger-style taglines. A few
examples: Poor Connery has to say things like ``Rain or shine, all
is mine'' or offer howlingly lame bits of innuendo. As they wander
through a dripping hothouse, he coos to Thurman, ``One should never
fear being wet.'' So what's wrong with Thurman? Easy. She's trumped
by the cool, feline memory of Diana Rigg, who originated the role.
Remember: Mrs. Peel does not sweat. Mrs. Peel does not lose her
cool. Mrs. Peel does not appear unkempt, ever. Thurman manages to
do all three while struggling with her British accent. Perhaps she
never watched Rigg, wanting to make the part ``her own.'' Forget
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Like Thurman, the movie flubs things that made the TV series a
gas. Steed and Mrs. Peel were the prototypes for Mulder and Scully.
They had no personal lives to speak of, lived only for their work,
and shared a relationship that was teasingly ambiguous. Like ``The
X-Files'' movie, ``The Avengers'' film addresses that issue by
tossing in a kiss that flattens the champagne.
</P>
<P>
   And while Thurman works too hard, Fiennes underplays his role to
the point of fading into the wallpaper.

 &HT;    Bowers facing murder charge for 5th time
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HATTIESBURG, Miss. _ Two people who will encounter each other at
the Hattiesburg courthouse today have met in this court before and
both probably are hoping that after all the years this will be the
last time.
</P>
<P>
   One is Ellie Dahmer, widow of Vernon Dahmer, who was a grocer,
farmer and highly-respected NAACP leader during the civil rights
era. Dahmer died 32 years ago protecting his family from carloads
of Ku Klux Klansmen who attacked his house with shotguns and
firebombs.
</P>
<P>
   The other is Sam Bowers, who stands accused_for the fifth time_
of ordering the attack. The former imperial wizard of the White
Knights of the KKK has been free on $200,000 bond since his arrest
in May; he will drive from his home in Laurel Monday to face murder
charges one more time.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a terrible thing we have to remember,'' Ellie Dahmer
said. ``But we've been preparing ourselves for 32 years, trying to
get here.''
</P>
<P>
   New witnesses_repentant former Klansmen_provided the Forrest
County District Attorney's Office with enough evidence to indict
Bowers in the 32-year-old crime. Bowers was tried in connection
with the Dahmer attack three times in state court and once in
federal court in 1968 and 1969. All the juries deadlocked and the
courts declared mistrials. Records from the racist spy group, the
Sovereignty Commission, made public for the first time this year,
indicated Bowers had tampered with the juries in some of those
cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a case that's an unsolved mystery,'' said Lee
Martin, special assistant to the state Attorney General, who will
help try the case. ``We know Bowers is responsible for this.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened since the night Ellie Dahmer's world changed
forever, the night Sam Bowers's life attached itself to hers.
</P>
<P>
   Ellie Dahmer was once a mother of eight who spent the 1960s
sleeping in shifts. She and her husband didn't dare sleep at the
same time, for fear of an attack. But, for some reason, on the
January night the Klan showed up, they were both asleep.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the 73-year-old widow lives on the exact spot where the
attack took place, in a house rebuilt in 1967 by the Hattiesburg
Chamber of Commerce. Five of her children live near her on the
Dahmer property, land she doesn't dare let anyone but family have.
She works as an election official, a position given to her twice by
the voters of Forrest County.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty-two years ago, I couldn't have had this position,
because I couldn't vote,'' she said. Her husband was killed days
after he announced he would help black people register to vote by
collecting poll taxes at his store. ``There's been a lot of changes
in Mississippi. Blacks are treated like people now.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '60s, Bowers headed an organization dedicated to
preventing blacks from voting or having any of the other rights
that white Mississippians took for granted. The FBI has blamed his
group for 10 killings and dozens of church bombings, beatings and
cross burnings. His philosophy at the time, he has said, was that
he was waging a holy war against communists and blacks bent on
destroying Christian, Anglo-Saxon Mississippians.
</P>
<P>
   Bowers was convicted of conspiracy in a federal court for the
1964 murders of civil rights workers Michael Schwerner, Andrew
Goodman and James Chaney in Philadelphia, Miss. He served six years
in a federal prison in Washington state, and was released in 1976.
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 73, Bowers is a reclusive businessman with a
mysterious smirk_ is he wincing or holding back a smile?_who leases
out-of-date video games and pinball machines. He lives and works
where he always has, in a squat, sprawling brown warehouse on the
other side of the tracks from downtown Laurel and the Victorian
houses on the hill. He teaches Sunday school. A hero of his is
Mickey Mouse. Last week in court, where the judge in this case
heard and denied his motion to dismiss the charges for lack of due
process, Bowers wore a Mickey Mouse belt, tie and pin on the lapel
of his seersucker suit. Last month, he told those present at
another hearing that Mickey Mouse was a militant. In one cartoon,
the Disney character uses a net to capture U.S. government planes,
he explained.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Bowers' neighborhood has become mostly black.
Most of the former wizard's customers are black owners of bars and
cafes along Maple Street. He eats lunch every day at Marie's, a
black-owned cafe. His philosophy today is a mystery. He speaks to
few people, and shuns all media, whom he once called ``whores.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too young to remember all that, but I think if he done
it, he should have to pay for it,'' said Bill Sykes, who is white
and runs an appliance repair shop a few doors down from Bowers.
Sykes rents a video machine from Bowers for his laundromat, but
wishes he didn't have to. ``My wife is black and she didn't want me
doing business with him. And his machines are all old, but I can't
find someone else.''
</P>
<P>
   Sykes represents change in Mississippi. He says he and his wife
get stared at, but no one threatens them, as they might have back
then.
</P>
<P>
   The older generation is more reticent to bring up race or talk
about the past; having lived through a time when race was a bloody
battlefield, it's harder for them to talk about it now, even if
times have changed. Bill Sykes's father, Dodd, a grocery store
owner who lived through the era when Bowers wore a hood and the
races didn't mix, had nothing to say about the trial that starts
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just a working man,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And a 52-year-old black man, the Rev. Joe Boykin, who was
shopping at Dodd's store, said people should forget about the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``They ought to just let him go,'' he said of Bowers. ``It's in
the past, people's minds is different now. There's no sense in
digging something up from that long ago.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ezekiel Chambers, a younger black man, disagreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he needs to go to trial and get punished for what he
did,'' he said. ``That should have happened 30 years ago. He's been
walking around free all these years.''
</P>
<P>
   He stopped talking and watched a 1961 powder blue Ford Falcon
round a corner. It was Bowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``There he is now,'' he said. ``Talk about the devil and you'll
see the devil.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second time in the 1990s that Mississippi
prosecutors have used new evidence to resurrect the state's past.
In 1994, Byron de la Beckwith was convicted of assassinating NAACP
worker Medgar Evers in 1963. Beckwith, who is spending his final
days in the Rankin County prison, was tried twice in the '60s, but
all-white juries deadlocked, as they did in the Bowers trials.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Beckwith case that inspired the Dahmers to push the
Forrest County D.A. to look anew at the Vernon Dahmer slaying.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be tried in the same courtroom where Bowers stood
trial three times before. It has been renovated in the last decade,
but the Jim Crow, blacks-only balconies remain, although now the
press usually sits there.
</P>
<P>
   Several Klansmen who participated in the attack were convicted
in the 1960s. Two Klansmen who were not convicted, Devours Nix, 72,
and Charles Noble, 55, were arrested the same day last spring as
Bowers. Nix was released on his own recognizance because he has
cancer and said he was too ill to sit in jail, but he was arrested
again a few weeks later when he was caught playing golf. Nix and
Noble are out on bond and will go to trial this fall.
</P>
<P>
   For the prosecution, these cases are about the Dahmers more than
they are about Mississippi.
</P>
<P>
   ``This family lost a husband and a father, when in the middle of
the night, two carloads of cowards come and burn and shoot up his
house and kill him,'' said Martin, the assistant attorney general.
``They are a family of great integrity. They're not bent on
revenge. They just want justice. If somebody killed my daddy, I'd
be real hateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Helfrich, the assistant Forrest County D.A., has an even
deeper personal sympathy for the Dahmer family.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad also died in 1966, of cancer, and I think of him almost
daily,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he also sees the larger implications.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is some of Mississippi's past that needs to be
cleansed,'' he said. ``It's very difficult to resurrect a case
that's 32 years old. There are no transcripts from the Bowers
trials because they ended in hung juries. And some people do not
want to remember. There are those who feel we shouldn't bring up
the past. But I'm sure if it was their father, they'd feel
differently.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Michael Favorov is a Russian doctor at the Centers for
Disease Control who helped discover a new strain of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Yiannis Ventikos is a Greek scientist at Georgia Tech whose
research helps to save fish endangered by hydroelectric power
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Cregan-O'Brien is a world-class Irish dancer who teaches
American children the traditional steps of her homeland.
</P>
<P>
   All came to Atlanta on a special immigrant visa available only
to the world's best and brightest in science, arts, education,
business or athletics. Known as the national interest waiver, it is
given to immigrants who can prove their skills and talents are so
unique that America would substantially benefit if they were here.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked for me and I would say this is a great thing for the
United States, too,'' said Ventikos, 33, who has a doctorate in
fluid mechanics. His national interest waiver application was
approved last year and he became a U.S. permanent resident this
year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several paths to U.S. permanent residency, which can
lead to citizenship. The majority of immigrants are allowed to
enter because a family member is a U.S. citizen. Others are
sponsored by employers who have to prove the immigrants are not
taking jobs from Americans. That process, coordinated by the U.S.
Labor Department, is called labor certification.
</P>
<P>
   But skilled professionals who can prove their work is in the
national interest of the United States can get on the fast track
and bypass labor certification, which can take 18 months or more.
By contrast, national interest waivers can be approved in several
months.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not taking jobs from American workers,'' said Carolyn
Soloway, an Atlanta immigration lawyer whose firm has helped
hundreds of immigrants get national interest waivers. ``They are
granted the visa because they have something so unique and so
unusual to contribute that you can't just stick an ad in the
newspaper and find someone that can do the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those who get national interest waivers are doctors,
scientists and researchers who work at the Centers for Disease
Control and research universities such as Georgia Tech, Emory and
the University of Georgia. The national interest waiver is also
open to artists and others who make cultural contributions.
Cregan-O'Brien, 24, qualified because she was able to prove that
she could make cultural and educational contributions through Irish
step dancing. A competitive dancer for 20 years, she also is
qualified to teach. She arrived in Atlanta in July and has started
teaching students through the non-profit Irish Dancers of Atlanta.
Before she arrived, the school had been flying in Irish dance
teachers from Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't qualified teachers coming out of the woodwork,''
said Jack O'Neill, president of Irish Dancers of Atlanta. The
group, founded last year, includes about 60 families with 80
children. Most are of Irish extraction and their goal is to learn
Irish dancing and celebrate their heritage.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill advertised for an Irish dance teacher in the United
States but found no one who was willing to move to Atlanta. ``To
get the quality of teacher we wanted, we needed to go to Ireland,''
he said, adding that children who want to compete have to be taught
by certified instructors.
</P>
<P>
   Cregan-O'Brien's attorney, Benjamin Landey, was able to prove
that her talent would benefit America culturally and educationally.
She applied for a national interest waiver last November and was
approved in March.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an art form that's taken very seriously throughout the
world,'' said Landey. ``Among people of Irish descent, it strongly
assists them in maintaining their cultural roots. There aren't that
many qualified teachers around who can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Landey discovered that an eclectic array of immigrants had
gotten national interest waivers because of their cultural
contributions, including a Russian ballroom dancer, a folk dancer
from Mexico, a Filipino painter, a classical musician from India
and a Chinese composer. So he agreed to help Cregan-O'Brien get
one, too.
</P>
<P>
   Applicants must document their unique talents, educational
background and extraordinary contributions to their field. They
must also provide up to a dozen letters from experts who can
explain how their work will benefit the United States.
Cregan-O'Brien had letters from Irish dance experts in Ireland and
the United States, and officials from the Georgia Council for the
Arts, Callanwolde Fine Arts Center and the Fulton County Arts
Council. She also was endorsed by Georgia Sen. Max Cleland and Rep.
Joseph P. Kennedy II of Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Soloway said her clients submit letters from international
institutes and organizations in the private and the public sector
that have the expertise to determine whether a person's
contribution would be in the national interest. Scientists and
doctors, for instance, might ask officials from the World Health
Organization or UNICEF to vouch for their work, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We like to show the person has a very wide and international
reputation by getting letters from experts in the field from as
many different countries as we can,'' Soloway said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the effort, Landey said, ``Not too many people qualify
for this. It is hard to prove.''
</P>
<P>
   There are no clear rules on who is eligible for a national
interest waiver, immigration officials in Washington said. Neither
Congress, which wrote the law in 1990, nor the Immigration and
Naturalization Service, which has to write rules to apply it, have
defined national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't really any firm guidelines out there,'' said
Edward Skerrett, chief of the INS administrative appeals unit in
Washington, D.C., which reviews applications that have been denied.
``When we wrote the regulations, we said it was up to the
petitioner to demonstrate that a waiver of the job labor
certification would be in the national interest.''
</P>
<P>
   The requirements are vague and subjective. Decisions are made by
officers at INS centers across the country. Denials can be appealed
to INS officers in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've consistently looked for some substantial benefit to the
United States,'' said John Grissom, an INS official in Washington.
``It is a bit difficult to quantify.'' Although the INS could
provide no exact figures, Grissom said ``very few'' national
interest waivers get approved on appeal. ``They approve a lot of
them in the field. They get all the petitions and we only get the
bad ones. That's why we don't approve many.'' He recalled a
petition by a man who claimed to be ``the world's greatest
whistler'' whose application still was not approved on appeal.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, Congress wrote the law to include artists and
others who make cultural and educational contributions, which is
why dancers and scientists have an equal shot at getting a national
interest waiver.
</P>
<P>
   ``We look for a guy who's got some kind of track record, who can
submit evidence that his future work would be in the national
interest,'' he said. ``We look for evidence that indicates they are
a cut above the rest.''

 &HT;    A bid even Huizengamighty can't refuse
 &HT;    By Greg Stoda
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The promise made in this space on May 25
of this year _ my personal pledge to refrain from writing any more
columns about the Florida Marlins _ is about to be broken.
</P>
<P>
   But not without good reason.
</P>
<P>
   There's news here.
</P>
<P>
   J. Gregory Stoda, 45, worth whatever modest sum his brilliant
and beautiful wife, Pat, has managed to accumulate through a
determined savings plan mixed with savvy investments, is hereby
announcing a bid to buy the team.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Everybody else is.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing owner H. Wayne Huizengmighty can, and probably
will do, is turn me down.
</P>
<P>
   Which, basically, is what he's doing to Marlins President Smiley
Don, who every day looks more and more like the mark in a
Huizengmighty shell game. Which, basically, also is what he's doing
to Joe Cubas and John Henry by pretending they don't exist.
</P>
<P>
   The H. in H. Wayne, we now know, stands for Hesitant.
</P>
<P>
   Money, quite obviously, is not an object. Not with Henry having
offered a reported $150 million in cash to take the Marlins off
Huizengmighty's greedy hands.
</P>
<P>
   Good. Because money is not an object with The StodaGroup,
either.
</P>
<P>
   That's the name of my organization. It helps, advisers tell me,
to have a fancy title with words shoved together and capital
letters in places where it doesn't seem capital letters belong.
</P>
<P>
   Looks important, advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Lends legitimacy, advisers say.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are no advisers to The StodaGroup. There's only
an adviser. Singular. And, truth be told, he isn't an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   He's the money guy.
</P>
<P>
   And the money guy, an acquaintance of mine for almost two
decades, has no problem _ none whatsoever _ with the price tag.
He's a relatively young man, and already a billionaire or on his
way to being one. His financial portfolio is more than sound, and
its growth is predicted to be exponential.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, my contribution of $1,810.23 is gravy.
</P>
<P>
   Our proposal?
</P>
<P>
   The StodaGroup will go to $180,001,810.23 _ more than a 20
percent increase above any previous reported high offer _ for the
Marlins. But only for the Marlins and their spring training
complex. Nothing else. No television deal involving SportsChannel
(see, there's another title with words shoved together and a
capital letter in a strange place). No buyout on any departure from
Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Huizengmighty takes our money and gets out. He can negotiate all
ancillary issues on anyone else's dime he hopes to steal.
</P>
<P>
   The StodaGroup has received corporate assurance that money
necessary to build a retractable roof, baseball-only stadium at a
site to be determined near the Palm Beach County/Martin County line
and its burgeoning corridor will be available. The facility will be
the central block of an expansive entertainment/recreation area
that will include a mall with three anchor stores, an eight-screen
theater multiplex, restaurants and a water park.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Leyland will be retained as manager, if he desires to
return. Dave Dombrowski will move from general manager to
president, if he desires to return. John Boles will be offered the
general manager's position.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate builder, of course, gets naming rights: Swoosh
Park at Nike Village.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and the point man purchasing the team _ the $180million guy,
not the spare-change guy _ wishes to play left field himself.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Jordan would prefer to bat third in the order.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Stoda writes his column for the Palm Beach Post, West Palm
Beach, Fla.

 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the new professional ethos of Wall Street, back-slapping has
replaced bravado. Investment banks talk up teamwork. Even big-name
deal makers, like star wide receivers, say they could never go it
alone.
</P>
<P>
   So it is only reluctantly, and a little brusquely, that Jill
Greenthal, a media banker for the investment banking firm of
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, &UR;  &LR; speaks about the thing that makes
her stand out from her colleagues, her competitors and most of her
clients. That is, that she is a woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay much attention to it; it's a fact of life,'' she
said, studious-looking and reserved. ``For clients, it doesn't make
a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, though, it does.
</P>
<P>
   However hesitant Ms. Greenthal may be about calling attention to
it, she was the lead banker for Tele-Communications Inc.'s recent
agreement to be acquired by AT&AMP;T Corp. in a $70 billion deal. And
that work, which earned her firm a $40 million fee, one of the
largest of its kind in banking history, is a milestone of sorts for
women in investment banking. It was one of the few times that
anyone in the business can recall a woman taking the lead role in a
headline-grabbing public acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenthal, 42, has been in the investment-banking game for
15 years, longer than many of her female peers. She has also carved
out a niche advising the constantly agglomerating giants of the
media and telecommunications world, where most deals are between
men, brokered by men.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Greenthal's work for the cable giant TCI has made her _
she would say her team _ a leading name in media mergers and
acquisitions. The deal stood out for a few reasons, and not simply
because of its size. One is the ground-breaking nature of the
AT&AMP;T-TCI alliance, joining the businesses of communications and
entertainment, cable and phone wires.
</P>
<P>
   It is also significant, from Wall Street's perspective, because
the Denver-based leaders of TCI _ John Malone, the chairman, and
Leo Hindery, president _ make so many acquisitions that they
generally act as their own bankers, rarely seeking outside advice.
Malone in particular hates to pay the huge percentage commissions
bankers charge. Some people close to him said the $40 million
Donaldson bill was his biggest _ and hardest to swallow _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We typically don't hire bankers, John and I,'' Hindery said.
``But we were talking about a fundamental change in TCI and we
needed outside advice.'' He said a key factor in selecting Ms.
Greenthal was that she had an ability to  &QL; 
adapt her ways to suit hands-on clients. ``She can listen as well
as talk, react as well as initiate,'' Hindery said.
</P>
<P>
   Does it matter that Ms. Greenthal is a woman? Hindery says it
does, at least to him. ``This was one of the largest fees ever
paid, and it was important to me that it go to her,'' he said.
``This is an industry that's full of aggressive people, most of
them men. It needs more women to be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal was far from Ms. Greenthal's first, of course. She
worked at Smith Barney and Lehman Brothers before joining
Donaldson, and has represented big clients before, including
companies like U S West and Comcast. But none had ever propelled
her to center stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see many of the people who do deals in my business, and the
percentage of women is extremely low,'' said Joele Frank, who
specializes in mergers and acquisitions for Abernathy, MacGregor
and Frank, a public relations company. ``Especially at the highest
levels, and the biggest deals, women do not play much of a role,''
Ms. Frank said, adding, ``They often don't stick around that long''
as investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage, it is true, can be overemphasized. Goldman, Sachs
&AMP; Co.; Morgan Stanley Dean Witter; Allen &AMP; Co., and many other
investment banks do have women deal makers. Sitting across the
table from Ms. Greenthal during negotiations between TCI and AT&AMP;T,
in fact, was Katherine Dietze, a managing director of Credit Suisse
First Boston who was part of the team advising AT&AMP;T _ though not
the team leader.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenthal says she does not encounter many other women in
her duties, especially as team leaders. The reason, she said, is
probably the conflict between raising a family and being on call
day and night. That is a hurdle for women in many service
industries, but a brick wall for many at the top levels of
investment banking, where every deal is viewed as a patient in
intensive care, liable to expire without constant attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should not really be an issue for women more than for men;
family should be important for both,'' she said. ``But I suppose it
is harder for women. It takes a family that is really
understanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenthal, who is married and has two children, said that
while she had been unwilling to sacrifice everything for her
career, the high-wire act of balancing job and family required
extreme flexibility.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Tom Eisenmann, was himself on a similarly demanding
career track, as a partner at the consulting firm of McKinsey &AMP; Co.
But he opted to return to school, earning a doctorate at Harvard
Business School, where he is now a tenure-track professor. The
family moved to Boston from New York in 1994, and Ms. Greenthal now
works out of Donaldson's Boston office, where she is the co-head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because he was in the consulting business, he understands the
life style,'' Ms. Greenthal said of her husband, interrupting her
summer vacation on Cape Cod to take a reporter's telephone call.
``If it weren't for a supportive family, my career would not be
possible.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   A native of Milwaukee, she considers her business career a
natural outgrowth of her business-oriented family life _ her father
and three siblings, all of them brothers, pursued corporate
careers. When she graduated from Simmons College in 1978 she went
straight for Harvard Business School.
</P>
<P>
   It was between years at Harvard that she had her first taste of
finance, working as a summer associate at Goldman, Sachs. She
developed a speciality in media banking at Smith Barney and later
joined the media department at Lehman, where she stayed for 10
years before joining Donaldson in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As a media expert, Ms. Greenthal developed a reputation for
being assiduous, in a lawyerly way, and for providing solid
technical banking advice to businessmen filled with their own
ambitions for buying companies and spinning off divisions. At
Lehman, for example, she advised a consortium of companies
including U S West on its 1993 investment in Time Warner
Entertainment, an early melding of telecommunications and
programming. She later helped prepare Lin Broadcasting, a cellular
phone company, for its sale to AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   But her big break came in developing a relationship with TCI and
some affiliate companies. In 1995 and again in 1997, she helped TCI
set up tracking stocks for the sometimes oddball collection of
companies that Malone spun off from the TCI mother ship. (Tracking
stocks are investment vehicles that track the performance of a
business without conferring ownership rights.)
</P>
<P>
   She also forged close ties to Hindery even before he joined TCI
last year. Recently, she helped him establish Intermedia Partners
VI for investing in cable ventures around the country.
</P>
<P>
   The run-up to the big TCI deal came earlier this year, when
Hindery recruited Ms. Greenthal to advise the company on a much
smaller business link-up. TCI and AT&AMP;T were thinking about becoming
partners in TCI's At Home Corp., an online TCI affiliate. In the
course of those talks Malone and Michael Armstrong, AT&AMP;T's
chairman, agreed instead upon a full acquisition of TCI. At that
point, TCI kept Ms. Greenthal and the Donaldson team as their sole
bankers, excluding Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which some on Wall Street
had considered TCI's leading bankers.
</P>
<P>
   There are no secrets to being a good banker, male or female, Ms.
Greenthal says. But if she emphasizes one thing, again invoking the
new Wall Street mantra, it is teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   She calls attention to her partnership with Dennis Leibowitz,
Donaldson's leading media analyst. Leibowitz has closely followed
trends in media and telecommunications, and has been involved in
many of same deals Ms. Greenthal has worked on, only from the
analyst's side. A report he wrote last spring sought to decipher
the structure and strategy of TCI, one of the media world's most
complex companies, in part because of its many spinoffs and
tracking stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came to DLJ in large part because of Dennis,'' she said,
adding that clients count on research analysts to cover their
company closely, and inform investors, especially after the bank
arranges a key transaction for the company. ``A strong research
analyst can be very helpful in generating business.''
</P>
<P>
   Leibowitz calls their banking relationship ``love at first
sight.'' He said he took the initiative to lure her to Donaldson,
where the two have formed a banking-analyst partnership on most of
the big deals the firm has undertaken in the media field.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery also emphasizes teamwork when describing why he chose
Donaldson as his lead bankers. He said one of Ms. Greenthal's
strongest attributes was running a tight organization and
concentrating her colleagues' energy on a common goal. For the
TCI-AT&AMP;T deal she led a group of 10 bankers. ``It's like
Normandy,'' he said. ``You've got to get all these people focused
on one target in a hurry.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no way of telling if Ms. Greenthal, or any other
investment banker, can hope to achieve many monster payouts like
the $40 million fee she brought home for Donaldson. But Ms.
Greenthal says she sees nothing that would take her away from her
banking career now, particularly since she views the TCI-AT&AMP;T deal
as opening the path to a slew of copy-cat mergers in an industry
eager to embrace the next trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reverberations,'' she said, ``are just starting to be
felt.'' &QL;

<P>
   LOCK HAVEN, Pa. _ With the Bald Eagle Ridge looming behind his
baseball cap, Lee Gilbert, a bespectacled 55-year-old in a T-shirt
and baggy khaki pants, drove his little red lawn tractor past farm
buildings into a blue corrugated steel hangar and rolled out a
mean-looking Czech L-39.
</P>
<P>
   A surplus military fighter jet painted in camouflage colors, it
was emblazoned with Russian warnings and stenciled pictures of
ejector seats _ and proudly bore the restored red star of the
Soviet Union on its tail.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he piloted the roaring fighter jet up over the
mountains and began a series of breathtaking rolls, dips and dives:
3,000 feet down in five seconds, to a height he jokingly called
``normal strafing altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who made his money selling foam insulation, owns his
own hangar and five airplanes. But the fighter jet is the only one
that lifts off at 180 miles per hour and, as he puts it, ``makes
your hair stand on end.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, more and more Americans have been
rushing to buy surplus Russian MiGs, Czech L-39s, Polish Iskras and
Yugoslavian Sokos as private playthings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a handful of planes, the fad has caught on, and
now there are hundreds of fighter jets owned by civilians: the
Classic Jet Airplane Association lists 423 on its rolls. That is a
minuscule percentage of the country's 186,000 private planes _ but
in 1989, when the group was formed, there were 10 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration, unprepared for the
growing number of surplus military jets coming in from former
Soviet bloc countries, stopped issuing the permits that let them
fly here _ a moratorium that lasted two years. Now, the fighter
jets owned by civilians are allowed in the United States but with a
passel of rules: no flying more than 600 miles from home without
the FAA's permission, at least 1,000 hours of flight time, regular
maintenance and FAA inspections _ and no live guns.
</P>
<P>
   These military jets, which now often sport real, but
nonfunctioning, guns, are not just owned by former Navy and Air
Force pilots. Dr. W.B. ``John'' Johnson, a cardiologist from
Missouri who owns a Soko Galeb G2A and flew it to the Oshkosh
Airshow in Wisconsin earlier this month, said perhaps half are
owned by ``ordinary guys'' who pay an average of $50,000 to
$400,000 for the fighters. An L-39 like Gilbert's costs about
$325,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the owners are businessmen, said Johnson, a burly,
dark-haired man wearing a dark green cotton zippered flight suit
with an embroidered Soko patch sewn on his sleeve. ``There's all
kinds: There's a fellow who built a business in janitorial services
in Utah; others who distribute widgets and make odd things. Then
there's a few physicians, a few lawyers.'' One is a Harley-Davidson
dealer from Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Esper Petersen, 48, a building contractor from Chicago with no
military flying experience, termed his fellow jet owners ``a pretty
interesting group of overachievers; they're usually pretty well off
and, at our get-togethers, what you get is a bunch of bosses,
everybody bossing everybody else around.''
</P>
<P>
   When they're not running their businesses, these middle-aged men
_ their average age is about 55 and no one can name any women _
like to fly high, fast and noisy. While the newest MiG 29s _ only
slightly used _ fly at two and a half times the speed of sound, the
older jets, used in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia, fly
close to the speed of sound: Mach .8 vs. Mach 1. That's close
enough for a thrill _ especially in a stripped-down military
cockpit peering over a gun sight, doing a triple roll.
</P>
<P>
   These guys have fun. Petersen, a bachelor, said flying the jets
is ``better than anything _ except sex.'' Allen Smith,
vice-president of a pharmaceuticals company who owns another L-39,
disagrees. ``He's wrong _ he hasn't flown enough _ it's better than
sex.'' Ron Whitt, a shampoo bottler who just bought his L-39 on
Thursday, said he bought it to ``crank and bank'' _ and to
advertise: He'll paint the sides with the name of a new product,
Race Glaze, and fly the jet to airshows. Others say they see the
two-seater jets _ used as trainers for the various Soviet forces _
as a way to educate the young about flying.
</P>
<P>
   As Ian Johnson, the doctor's 21-year-old son and an aspiring jet
pilot, said: ``We grew up with jets.''
</P>
<P>
   The public may also not understand that the sight of a fighter
jet bearing red stars and Russian warnings doesn't exactly make the
Pentagon tremble. Real military jets carry a ``friend or foe''
warning system which has been disabled in the surplus jets, said
Jack Harrington, an aviation lawyer who is also president of the
Warbirds of America, a group dedicated to the preservation of
fighting aircraft of all vintages. In addition, the jets file
flight plans and maintain routine contact with air controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane community knows these jets,''said Jon Galt
Bowman, who owns several of the fighter jets and represents the jet
owners of the Warbirds' board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a certain mystique when you say jet _ even a
certain apprehension,'' said Rudy Beaver, president of
International Jet in Gadsden, Ala., the country's largest importer
of the surplus fighter jets. ``But in many ways, jets are simpler:
a little twin-engined Cessna has six levers to manage the engine _
a jet only has one.'' And, the jet pilots say, their engines are
more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But they do burn a lot more fuel. Because of it, they are often
flown to airshows, where the pilots all seem to know each other,
standing in groups on the tarmac near their planes, laughing. About
20 of the jets _ most with their Russian warnings intact _ showed
up in Oshkosh. But the most fun may well be the mock dogfights they
get into on weekends.

   ``When I first got my fighter jet, I headed up to the Wisconsin
border,'' Petersen said. ``There's a lot of P-51s up there, and I
went after them. We got into a dogfight and they shot me down.''
Not to worry. ``Oh, not really shot down _ I have a gun sight
hooked to a camera _ I get 'em in the cross hairs and snap a
picture, for proof.''

   Although they don't come with fax machine ports, microwave ovens
and CD players the way the new corporate jets do, the military jets
offer the following advantage (depending, of course, on how you
look at it): In the corporate jets, you can't feel the enormous
pull of gravity that make most earthlings very, very sick to their
stomach. In the MiGs and Sokos, the pilot-owners revel in the fact
they can take up to 8 ``G's'' _ a gravitational force equal to
eight times one's body weight.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Soviet Union, its former republics
``were desperate for cold, hard cash,'' said Doug Schultz, a
fighter pilot and jet owner who recently tried _ and failed _ to
bring some of the newest surplus planes into this country. Schultz,
who said he ran into ``political cobwebs and dead-ends,'' bought
his planes from an importer in Burlington, Vt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. government does not sell its surplus fighter jets to
its citizens: They chop them up, said Carol Simpson, a spokeswoman
for the Defense Department's Reutilization and Marketing Service.
To find one _ and there are some _ you'd have to buy them from
another country or from a dealer who did.
</P>
<P>
   To find a fighter jet these days _ from any country _ Schultz
said, potential top gunners might subscribe to Trade-A-Plane, a
yellow-paged classified paper that comes out three times a month
(800-337-5263; $42 a year).
</P>
<P>
   Or they could call International Jets, Inc. in Gadsden, Ala.,
which offers old fighters including L-39s, Iskras and several
British planes.
</P>
<P>
   The company lets you take a half-hour ``demonstration'' flight _
the equivalent of a test drive. But unlike your local used-car
dealer, they charge for it: $1,000, which is deducted from the cost
of the plane if you buy it. They can also obtain the FAA's
certification for the plane _ the equivalent of running it through
the department of motor vehicles for a car registration.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, the importers pay about half of the retail price of
the plane, or even less. But they have to pay the duty, reassemble
the pieces (it's taken apart for shipping), and remove any obsolete
navigation equipment. They may also paint it _ although some of the
owners prefer to leave the planes with their original, if faded,
Soviet warnings and decals.
</P>
<P>
   When they decided to call a halt to their import in 1993, the
FAA was ``worried a lot of millionaire playboys would be hurling
themselves around and falling into schoolyards,'' Schultz said.''
Both the federal officials and the pilots say that hasn't happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys treat them the way they do classic cars,'' said
Terry Allen, of the FAA's certification service in Washington
``They preserve them; they practically worship them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the 1996 regulations, the FAA requires that pilots be
trained by an FAA approved trainer and must have logged 1,000 hours
of flying time _ in contrast to the young Soviet pilots who
originally flew the planes, who, jet enthusiasts claim, were
required to show only 50 hours of flying. Nowadays, most of the
pilots receive their training in the United States; Gilbert, an
early customer, bought his plane from an importer in Burlington,
Vt., but flew over for 10 days of training in the Czech Republic.
He later spent more time training with a Russian pilot _ in Lock
Haven.
</P>
<P>
   Petersen, from Chicago, trained with the same Russian pilot in
Gadston, Ala. ``When he first came over, he only knew three English
commands: `Speed big,' `speed small' and `don't do that,''' the
builder recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, the FAA spokesman, said that since the first
civilian-owned foreign fighter jets were allowed into the United
States, there have been no accidents that killed people ``on the
ground,'' meaning innocent bystanders. How about the pilots
themselves? ``That's different,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On August 2, in Oshkosh, the wife of one of the civilian jet
pilots was killed when her husband crashed their two-seater Spanish
Saeta, one of the rare Spanish military jet ``warbirds'' in the
United States. The jet struck a tree and some power lines before
crashing onto a residential street. No one on the ground was
injured. The cause of the crash is still being investigated.
Nevertheless, both the jet owners and the FAA say that the number
of fighter jet deaths have been low, maybe even proportionately
less than for the country's other 186,000 private planes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the time you have the money, you're 55 and married with a
house full of kids,'' said Don Kirlin of Quincy, Ill., president of
the Classic Jet Airplane Association. ``That's not the stereotype.
These are definitely not guys boozing and looking for babes.''

<P>
   LOCK HAVEN, Pa. _ With the Bald Eagle Ridge looming behind his
baseball cap, Lee Gilbert, a bespectacled 55-year-old in a T-shirt
and baggy khaki pants, drove his little red lawn tractor past farm
buildings into a blue corrugated steel hangar and rolled out a
mean-looking Czech L-39.
</P>
<P>
   A surplus military fighter jet painted in camouflage colors, it
was emblazoned with Russian warnings and stenciled pictures of
ejector seats _ and proudly bore the restored red star of the
Soviet Union on its tail.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, he piloted the roaring fighter jet up over the
mountains and began a series of breathtaking rolls, dips and dives:
3,000 feet down in five seconds, to a height he jokingly called
``normal strafing altitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Gilbert, who made his money selling foam insulation, owns his
own hangar and five airplanes. But the fighter jet is the only one
that lifts off at 180 miles per hour and, as he puts it, ``makes
your hair stand on end.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, more and more Americans have been
rushing to buy surplus Russian MiGs, Czech L-39s, Polish Iskras and
Yugoslavian Sokos as private playthings.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with a handful of planes, the fad has caught on, and
now there are hundreds of fighter jets owned by civilians: the
Classic Jet Airplane Association lists 423 on its rolls. That is a
minuscule percentage of the country's 186,000 private planes _ but
in 1989, when the group was formed, there were 10 in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993, the Federal Aviation Administration, unprepared for the
growing number of surplus military jets coming in from former
Soviet bloc countries, stopped issuing the permits that let them
fly here _ a moratorium that lasted two years. Now, the fighter
jets owned by civilians are allowed in the United States but with a
passel of rules: no flying more than 600 miles from home without
the FAA's permission, at least 1,000 hours of flight time, regular
maintenance and FAA inspections _ and no live guns.
</P>
<P>
   These military jets, which now often sport real, but
nonfunctioning, guns, are not just owned by former Navy and Air
Force pilots. Dr. W.B. ``John'' Johnson, a cardiologist from
Missouri who owns a Soko Galeb G2A and flew it to the Oshkosh
Airshow in Wisconsin earlier this month, said perhaps half are
owned by ``ordinary guys'' who pay an average of $50,000 to
$400,000 for the fighters. An L-39 like Gilbert's costs about
$325,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the owners are businessmen, said Johnson, a burly,
dark-haired man wearing a dark green cotton zippered flight suit
with an embroidered Soko patch sewn on his sleeve. ``There's all
kinds: There's a fellow who built a business in janitorial services
in Utah; others who distribute widgets and make odd things. Then
there's a few physicians, a few lawyers.'' One is a Harley-Davidson
dealer from Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Esper Petersen, 48, a building contractor from Chicago with no
military flying experience, termed his fellow jet owners ``a pretty
interesting group of overachievers; they're usually pretty well off
and, at our get-togethers, what you get is a bunch of bosses,
everybody bossing everybody else around.''
</P>
<P>
   When they're not running their businesses, these middle-aged men
_ their average age is about 55 and no one can name any women _
like to fly high, fast and noisy. While the newest MiG 29s _ only
slightly used _ fly at two and a half times the speed of sound, the
older jets, used in Vietnam, Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia, fly
close to the speed of sound: Mach .8 vs. Mach 1. That's close
enough for a thrill _ especially in a stripped-down military
cockpit peering over a gun sight, doing a triple roll.
</P>
<P>
   These guys have fun. Petersen, a bachelor, said flying the jets
is ``better than anything _ except sex.'' Allen Smith,
vice-president of a pharmaceuticals company who owns another L-39,
disagrees. ``He's wrong _ he hasn't flown enough _ it's better than
sex.'' Ron Whitt, a shampoo bottler who just bought his L-39 on
Thursday, said he bought it to ``crank and bank'' _ and to
advertise: He'll paint the sides with the name of a new product,
Race Glaze, and fly the jet to airshows. Others say they see the
two-seater jets _ used as trainers for the various Soviet forces _
as a way to educate the young about flying.
</P>
<P>
   As Ian Johnson, the doctor's 21-year-old son and an aspiring jet
pilot, said: ``We grew up with jets.''
</P>
<P>
   The public may also not understand that the sight of a fighter
jet bearing red stars and Russian warnings doesn't exactly make the
Pentagon tremble. Real military jets carry a ``friend or foe''
warning system which has been disabled in the surplus jets, said
Jack Harrington, an aviation lawyer who is also president of the
Warbirds of America, a group dedicated to the preservation of
fighting aircraft of all vintages. In addition, the jets file
flight plans and maintain routine contact with air controllers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplane community knows these jets,''said Jon Galt
Bowman, who owns several of the fighter jets and represents the jet
owners of the Warbirds' board of directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there's a certain mystique when you say jet _ even a
certain apprehension,'' said Rudy Beaver, president of
International Jet in Gadsden, Ala., the country's largest importer
of the surplus fighter jets. ``But in many ways, jets are simpler:
a little twin-engined Cessna has six levers to manage the engine _
a jet only has one.'' And, the jet pilots say, their engines are
more reliable.
</P>
<P>
   But they do burn a lot more fuel. Because of it, they are often
flown to airshows, where the pilots all seem to know each other,
standing in groups on the tarmac near their planes, laughing. About
20 of the jets _ most with their Russian warnings intact _ showed
up in Oshkosh. But the most fun may well be the mock dogfights they
get into on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first got my fighter jet, I headed up to the Wisconsin
border,'' Petersen said. ``There's a lot of P-51s up there, and I
went after them. We got into a dogfight and they shot me down.''
Not to worry. ``Oh, not really shot down _ I have a gun sight
hooked to a camera _ I get 'em in the cross hairs and snap a

PATENTS: REMOVING ZINC FROM SCRAP METAL; CUTTING THE COST OF
COMMUTING; ROSS PEROT ATTACKS PATENT BILL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Texas)  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Honda imported into the United States for the
first time an automobile with a galvanized body _ which meant that
the car's steel frame had been coated with zinc to prevent rusting.
By the mid-1980s nearly all new cars had galvanized bodies.
</P>
<P>
   But in solving the rust problem, galvanized steel has created
new, unanticipated troubles now that many of those cars _ and other
galvanized machinery and consumer products _ are landing in the
scrap heap. For steel mills that recycle the steel into new metal,
removing the zinc is a huge headache.
</P>
<P>
   Zinc, it turns out, melts at a much lower temperature than steel
_ at 600 degrees Fahrenheit vs. 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit.
</P>
<P>
   At the high temperature needed to melt steel, ``the zinc comes
off as a white hazardous fume that is expensive to capture,'' said
Michael Lucas, chairman of Metal Recovery Technologies Inc., a
company based in East Chicago, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Metal Recovery Technologies recently patented a process that it
says will remove the zinc cheaply without creating hazardous
byproducts.
</P>
<P>
   The scrap metal is first passed through rotary drums that
contain a warm bath of sodium hydroxide. As the zinc combines with
the solution to form sodium zincate, it washes away from the steel.
</P>
<P>
   Then the zinc itself is recovered. The sodium zincate is passed
through tanks containing magnesium plates. As a low-voltage
electrical charge is applied, the zinc ions cling to the plates.
The zinc is then slurried off and dried.
</P>
<P>
   Lucas said his company was building a plant to use the new
process and was licensing the use of its system to steel mills. He
contended that the process could save industry millions of dollars
in energy costs.
</P>
<P>
   Metal Recovery Technologies received patent 5,779,878.
</P>
<P>
   A New Method for Commuting
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Mullen, an independent inventor who for the most part
works out of a home office, thinks that people waste far too much
time and energy driving to and from their jobs. So he has designed
and patented a radically new transportation system for commuting by
car. His light rail system would replace the high-occupancy vehicle
lanes feeding into many cities.
</P>
<P>
   As drivers approached, they would enter their destinations into
a computer and pay with a type of credit card. Then they would
drive their cars onto ramps, which would engage the wheels of a
vehicle, much as an automatic car wash does, and then propel it
onto the railway.
</P>
<P>
   ``The computer, when it sees you're trying to get on, will open
up a space between the cars streaming by you,'' Mullen said.
``Then, zing, you'd zip right in between them.''
</P>
<P>
   Once on the rail, drivers could sit back and read the paper or
apply makeup or just relax until they arrived at their
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're putting no mileage on your car,'' Mullen said. ``And
you have a free, automatic chauffeur.'' But once you get off, you
do have to find your own parking space.
</P>
<P>
   Mullen said he had had trouble convincing transportation experts
of his system's viability. ``It's a railroad for the 21st
century,'' he said. ``I'm afraid it's ahead of its time.`
</P>
<P>
   Mullen received patent 5,775,227.
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot Causes a Stir
</P>
<P>
   Ross Perot, the billionaire and former independent presidential
candidate, caused quite a stir at the U.S. Patent and Trademark
Office recently when he showed up at a meeting of the Patent Office
Professional Association, a union representing patent examiners.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before about 700 examiners, Perot railed against
controversial plans for a new Patent Office building and lambasted
pending congressional legislation that would make patent
applications public after 18 months. Currently, they are secret
until a patent is issued.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation also would turn the agency into a
quasi-governmental entity much like the Postal Service. Perot
called such plans ``a breach of national security.''
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

`NEW GHOSTS, OLD GHOSTS': IF NOT A GULAG, A SYSTEM OFTEN CRUDE AND
HARSH 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Publication notes are at the end of review.) 
(js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One reason China presents such a large human rights question is
the very opacity of the country, its vastness and its invisibility
to the outside world (even though things are a lot more visible
today than they were in the past). There is no doubt that some
peaceful protesters, independent labor-union organizers and
human-rights campaigners have been imprisoned. But how many? And
what can be said of conditions in the fabled labor camp system in
the country's remote northwest? Does it, as some critics have said,
produce a substantial portion of China's exports? Is it a vast
state within a state in the spirit of the former Soviet Gulag
Archipelago?
</P>
<P>
   Those questions have never before received more careful answers
than they get in ``New Ghosts, Old Ghosts,'' James Seymour and
Richard Anderson's important and timely examination of the Chinese
prison system. The overall conclusion of those two respected
experts on human rights in China may come as a surprise to those
who have become accustomed to the image of China as a kind of
post-Stalinist hell.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing in ``New Ghosts, Old Ghosts'' that would remove
China from the list of countries with major human-rights
violations. But Seymour and Anderson, while detailing abuses,
correct many of the exaggerated visions of the Chinese picture,
which, they argue, is bad but not nearly as bad as some have
maintained.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at its worst, the laogai is not, as some have claimed,
`the Chinese equivalent of the Soviet Gulag,' '' they conclude.
(Laogai is the Chinese expression for reform through labor and is
used in this book as a synonym for the Chinese prison system.)
</P>
<P>
   ``The crudeness of China's judicial procedures does result in
people sometimes being convicted of crimes by mistake,'' the
authors continue. ``Still, it must be said that the overwhelming
majority of prisoners have been incarcerated for the same reasons
they are in other countries: they are believed to have committed a
crime. Only a tiny percentage of post-Mao-era laogai prisoners have
been sentenced for political reasons.'' Moreover, addressing
another issue that has been treated with more emotion than lucidity
by other analysts, the authors of this book conclude that the
laogai system is economically minuscule.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although much has been made of the economic importance of
forced labor in China, in fact prison output makes no significant
contribution to the gross domestic product,'' they conclude.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour and Anderson concentrate on China's vast and sparsely
populated northwest. These are the territories _ Gansu and Qinghai
provinces and the Xinjiang Autonomous Region _ where large numbers
of China's most notorious prison camps have been built, especially
in the long, harsh years of Maoist dictatorship. The authors warn
early on that ``the Chinese government's distortion, obfuscation
and secrecy make it difficult to count many of China's penal
institutions or to estimate how large each is.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the difficulties, ``New Ghosts, Old Ghosts'' provides an
impressively detailed portrait of prison conditions in each of the
three areas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Seymour and Anderson begin with a kind of walking tour of the
several detention centers and laogai factories that one would see
in Xining, the major city of eastern Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
   Seymour and Anderson estimate the number of prisoners in each
area, the totals being large but far from Maoist or Stalinesque in
dimension. They estimate the Xinjiang prison population to be about
85,000, down from 160,000 in 1955. This would strongly indicate
that the nationwide prison population is a small fraction of the 6
million to 8 million estimated by another human rights campaigner,
Harry Wu. Among the prisoners in Xinjiang are a substantial number
of political prisoners, especially Muslims who have been rounded up
by Chinese police intent on suppressing separatist sentiment in
Xinjiang, largely populated by Turkic-speaking Uighurs.
</P>
<P>
   The economic output of the Xinjiang prison system, the authors
believe, is ``well under 1 percent of the regional total output.''
Some prison-made products are exported to foreign countries,
despite Chinese denials, the authors conclude, but not very many of
them and mostly over the border to Russia, not to the West.
</P>
<P>
   The serious human rights problem that Seymour and Anderson
stress is not the size of the prison population nor that prisoners
are made to work (they are in other countries also) but their
treatment, which is often abysmal. Tibet is not an area studied by
the authors, but they remark in a footnote that the problem of
torture in Tibetan prisons is well documented.
</P>
<P>
   In Xinjiang, they collect information on a ``secret laogai
operation known as the Gray (Huise) Uranium Mine,'' which they call
``the grimmest laogai unit that our research turned up.'' The death
rate in this camp, probably because of the radioactivity of the
uranium ore mined there, is between 10 percent and 20 percent per
year.
</P>
<P>
   Other prisoners work in coal mines, where ``some become ill from
black-lung disease, but many do not live long enough to develop
that malady, as safety conditions are atrocious.'' These
institutions seem exceptionally bad even by China's low standards.
Seymour and Anderson conclude, for example, that, while Xinjiang's
prisoners are generally badly treated, those in neighboring Qinghai
by and large are not.
</P>
<P>
   This careful, sober study might well induce human rights
activists to turn their attention away from the size of China's
prison population to what the authors describe as the more
fundamental concerns: ``the substantial number of prisoners who do
not belong there and the harshness of the conditions in the less
well-managed institutions.''
</P>
<P>
   In reaching that overall conclusion, ``New Ghosts, Old Ghosts''
clears away both the pro-Chinese apologies and the anti-Chinese
hysteria that has often surrounded this question, providing instead
the most objective and dispassionate evaluation of the real
situation that we are likely to have.

FUTURE OF TROPHIES LATEST CHAPTER IN LEGENDARY STABLE'S COLLAPSE

   LEXINGTON, Ky. _ One week ago, a moving van pulled up in front
of the International Museum of the Horse at the Kentucky Horse Park
here to take away some pieces of racing history and carry them to
the ``21'' Club in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   On the shipper's manifest were the glittering trophies won by
thoroughbred racing's most legendary stable, Calumet Farm. The
trophies bore the names of the horses that once made Calumet
pre-eminent, names that resonated even with those who had never
placed a bet: Citation, Whirlaway, Tim Tam, Alydar.
</P>
<P>
   But after Calumet collapsed in bankruptcy in 1991, virtually
every trapping of the breeding and racing empire was auctioned to
pay debts. Today, all that remains of the farm's legacy is the
collection of some 530 gold, silver, crystal and pewter trophies
and awards, which have been housed at the state-run Horse Park
since 1982. And now that those awards also seem headed for the
auction block, a raucous battle has erupted in Bluegrass country
between those who argue that the collection should go to the
highest bidder and those who say that it is an important part of
Kentucky's heritage and should stay put.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be an embarrassment to the state and the
racing industry to have this great historical collection dissolved
to satisfy some desperate creditors,'' said James E. Bassett III,
chairman of the Keeneland Association, which operates the Keeneland
racetrack, and head of the Save the Calumet Trophies committee. A
newspaper ad run to benefit trophy supporters compared their
possible loss to the selling off of the symbols of the state's
other great passion, the University of Kentucky's basketball
trophies.
</P>
<P>
   The emotional debate over the fate of the Calumet collection _
the sleek Tiffany-designed Triple Crown trophies won by Citation
and Whirlaway in the 1940s, the gloriously engraved bowl made from
melted silver coins hoisted over Bull Lea in the 1938 Bluegrass
Stakes _ is the latest chapter in the sad downfall of a sports
dynasty.
</P>
<P>
   It is a saga riddled with greed and miscalculation, one that
left once-rich heirs to the Calumet Baking Powder fortune bankrupt
and a proud racing name in shambles. And like the war over the
trophies, it is a tale that is far from over. Federal officials in
Houston are investigating whether former top Calumet officials,
desperate for cash, might have killed one of the stable's
most-beloved horses, Alydar, in 1990 in order to collect an
insurance windfall.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest turn in the fate of the trophies, Calumet
supporters and others appeared in U.S. Bankruptcy Court here to
block removal of any trophies to the ``21'' Club. Guernsey's
Auction House, a New York company, had arranged to display them
there and at sites like Saratoga Springs to generate publicity for
the planned sale next month.
</P>
<P>
   But lawyers argued that the trophies might be damaged during
shipment or display and were not fully insured. Federal Bankruptcy
Judge Joe Lee, who is presiding over a tangle of bankruptcies
involving the heirs of Calumet's founders, agreed, keeping the
collection at the Horse Park and ruling that anyone with the means
to buy the trophies could afford to fly here to see them. Besides,
he added in a courtroom aside, he understood that the ``21'' Club,
the swank Manhattan restaurant, attracted flamboyant celebrities
like Madonna.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the auction will only take place if a qualified bidder
steps forward by the end of the month and offers at least $2.81
million for the collection, which also includes 40 oil paintings of
horses. That is because the Horse Park has already raised $2.7
million in public donations and funds from the Kentucky state
legislature to buy the trophies out of bankruptcy proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Creditors say they deserve to get as much money for the Calumet
collection as possible, and a Tennessee businessman who has bought
bankruptcy debts of the farm and the heirs in recent years at deep
discounts will be the big winner in any sale. Still, local lawyers
involved in the case say they have little doubt about the tide of
public sentiment. Not long ago, for example, officials at the Horse
Park gave bankruptcy trustees a videotape presentation celebrating
the area's thoroughbred tradition. Included was a television news
report which showed schoolchildren putting pennies and nickels into
a glass jar to save the trophies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Public opinion is running dead against us,'' said James Lyon,
a lawyer here who is a bankruptcy trustee for one of the heirs.
</P>
<P>
   The Calumet collection, housed in 15 display cases including one
that recreates how the trophies were exhibited at the farm's
mansion, testifies to the thousands of victories won by jockeys
wearing the devil's red-and-blue silks of Calumet, including nine
Kentucky Derbys. Along with traditional loving cups, trophies and
plaques, the collection includes other valuable objects given to
race winners like ornate punch bowls, urns, tea services, serving
trays, samovars and smaller awards known as julep cups.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the trophies often became ensnared in the same
passions and intrigues that embroiled Calumet.
</P>
<P>
   John Morgan, a lawyer involved in the bankruptcy proceedings who
has researched the trophies' history, said that initially Lucille
Parker Wright Markey apparently thought about donating the
collection to Churchill Downs, the site of the Kentucky Derby.
Markey was the widow of Warren Wright Sr., the man who presided
over Calumet's glory days in the 1940s and 50s.
</P>
<P>
   That plan changed in 1968 when Dancer's Image finished first in
the Kentucky Derby but was disqualified by judges, making Forward
Pass, a Calumet horse, the winner. Because Churchill Downs
officials dawdled for five years before handing over the trophy,
Markey cut them out, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1982, when Markey died after owning Calumet for 51
years, that the fates of both the farm and the trophies were set.
That year, J.T. Lundy, a man who had married into the Wright
family, took over the stable because the children of Warren Wright
Jr. did not want to run it. And by most accounts, it is Lundy, who
spent lavishly on leased jets and a fleet of cars and also borrowed
heavily from banks to buy new horses, who is blamed for Calumet's
collapse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   During the late 1980s Lundy staked the farm's financial fortunes
on Alydar, a horse that won the hearts of racing fans by finishing
second to Affirmed in all three Triple Crown races in 1978. After
his racing days, Alydar commanded top stud fees. But Lundy, who
faced a cash shortage, quickly exhausted the horse's value by
selling his breeding rights into the distant future. As a result,
some suspected foul play when Alydar, who was covered by a $36
million insurance policy, was discovered in his stall one night in
1990 with a shattered right rear leg. Despite efforts to save him,
he had to be put down.
</P>
<P>
   Lundy and others involved in the farm's operation have long
maintained that the tragedy was an accident. But even before
Markey's death, both she and her second husband, Gene Markey, who
operated Calumet with her, distrusted Lundy and decided to put the
trophies out of his reach, said Margaret Glass, who served as the
stable's secretary for four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The Kentucky Horse Park had come into existence a few years
earlier, and Glass said she urged Gene Markey to place the trophies
there in 1982. Officials of Sotheby's appraised the collection that
year, valuing it at $1.2 million, and the trophies were leased to
the Horse Park for the annual fee of $1.
</P>
<P>
   The trophies might have quietly resided there forever had one of
the Calumet heirs not listed a share in the collection as an asset
when she went bankrupt in the mid-1990s. Ever since, creditors and
buyers have been eagerly circling the collection.
</P>
<P>
   One Louisville business offered to buy them for $1.2 million.
Two years ago, Horse Park officials started a public drive to raise
a similar amount. But last year, to determine the collection's
value, Judge Lee ordered the bankruptcy trustees to hire an auction
house to appraise it.
</P>
<P>
   Guernsey's was selected and the company soon shocked local
trophy supporters by estimating the awards could bring over $5
million.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ettinger, Guernsey's president, said he believed that
Sotheby's, which appraised the collection at $1.2 million again in
1995, had been far too conservative because it had based its
estimate on the weight of the precious metals contained in the
statues rather than their value to racing fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like, guess the worth of a Picasso by the value of the
paint and the canvas,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether the Calumet collection is sold to the
Horse Park or auctioned, the big winner will apparently be G.
Donald Puckett, a businessman from Kingsport, Tenn. In recent
years, Puckett, who is related to one of the Calumet heirs by
marriage, has been buying up creditors' claims at deep discounts.
Now, he stands to reap from 80 percent to 85 percent of any money
collected by the sale of the trophies and other bankruptcy assets,
said lawyers involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Puckett, who declined to be interviewed, has also apparently had
his eye on the Calumet collection for some time. He already owns a
stake in the collection, having purchased it from an heir. And in
the mid-1990s, he contacted lawyers involved in the bankruptcy
proceedings offering to buy their share of the awards for $6,000,
said Lyon, the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to call him `The Trophy Man,''' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Horse Park officials said, Puckett contacted them
and asked whether they would be interested in leasing the trophies
from him if he spent $5 million to buy them. Bill Cooke, a Horse
Park spokesman, said that he did not recall the precise annual fee
suggested by Puckett, though he recalls that it was over $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever it was, it was absurd,'' Cooke said.
</P>
<P>
   J. Jeffrey Landen, a lawyer who represents Puckett, said the
businessman believes that the collection should go to the top
bidder and that the estimate by Guernsey's is more in line with its
value than the lower price put on it by Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Ettinger, the Guernsey's president, said that a bidder had
recently emerged who had tentatively expressed interest in
guaranteeing the $2.81 million minimum. Under the guidelines
established by Lee, the collection must be sold together, though
the buyer could then break it up for resale.
</P>
<P>
   As with much of the Calumet story, what will happen next is
anyone's guess. These days, the farm appears to be thriving again
under the guidance of a new owner, Henryk De Kwiatkowski, and on a
mid-summer's day soft shadows fall over the grave of Alydar, which
is marked ``Chestnut Horse.'' Litigation over the stable's collapse
continues, and creditors and others continue to hunt for Lundy, who
disappeared not long after declaring bankruptcy in 1992 and has
been evading subpoenas and process servers since, said lawyers in
the case.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Margaret Glass, the long-time Calumet secretary,
said she believes the trophies should stay at the Horse Park, where
she helped put them. She says that while the stable heirs neglected
the operation, it was the Horse Park that cared for the collection,
and the creditors can look elsewhere for money.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is the centerpiece of that place and they belong there,''
she said. ``They belong in Kentucky and they belong intact.''

 &HT;    An analysis of the Pepsi 400 at Michigan Speedway
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The First 50:
</P>
<P>
   The race was only two laps old before Jeff Green hit the wall,
which brought out the first caution and allowed teams to top off
their tanks, knowing that every gallon in the tank was precious.
Six laps later, however, Sterling Marlin ran into rear deck of
Derrike Cope's Pontiac, which then ran into the Chevrolet of Morgan
Shepherd. Both cars were damaged enough to remedy them useless.
Marlin's team owner Felix Sabates ran down to pit of Cope's car
owner Chuck Rider and apologized. ''We pulled out all stops, leased
an engine from Bobby Labonte's team,'' Rider said. ''This really
hurts.'' On the restart, Ernie Irvan, Mark Martin, Jeff Gordon,
Bobby Labonte and Dale Jarrett pull away from rest of pack. Nobody
was worrying about gas mileage at this point despite the torrid
pace. There were only two lead changes, twice by Martin for two
laps; three from Irvan for 40.
</P>
<P>
   The Second 50:
</P>
<P>
   The second round of pit stops began with Jarrett the first in
and out in 16.7 seconds. Chassis adjustments were the order of this
round, along with four tire changes and fuel. Kenny Irwin cut it
close on his stop, coasting into the pits on gas fumes only. Dale
Earnhardt didn't pit and picked up the five bonus points for
leading a lap. When he did pit, he did so in 13.3 seconds. The top
10 at the point: Jarrett, Irvan, Martin, B. Labonte, Gordon, Jeff
Burton, Jeremy Mayfield, Wally Dallenbach, John Andretti and Ward
Burton. Irvan regains lead on lap 60 and Earnhardt, with a loose
car, falls back to 22nd and goes down a lap on No. 79. Martin is
second and Gordon sixth. Irvan picked up the $10,000 bonus for
leading at the halfway mark. now on the the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   The third 50:
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett takes has 27.3-second pit stop for track bar adjustment
trouble with lug nuts on tire change. Track bar adjustment on 88
car 27.3 seconds. Bill Elliott was penalized a stop-and-go for
speeding down pit road and went down a lap. After starting 23rd,
Jeff Burton moves to third on lap 112. At this points Gordon is no
factor, running sixth on lap 113.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff start 25th now up to third on lap 112. Jarrett falls back,
the victim of an ill-handling car. The battle for the lead remains
between Irvan and Martin, whose car doesn't handle as well when
running right behind Irvan. Gordon still hasn't led. The last time
he didn't lead a lap was at Texas when he wrecked on the second
lap. Elliott was back up to 14th when his motor quit on lap 135. On
lap 142, only 10 cars are on the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   The final 50:
</P>
<P>
   Eight cars on the lead lap with Martin, Irvan, Burton, Jarrett,
Bobby Labonte, Jeremy Mayfield, Wally Dallenbach and John Andretti.
The final round of pit stops are hurried and harried. Gordon still
hasn't led a lap, but is running sixth on his stop. Irvan still
leading and takes two tires; Martin takes four in 17.1 seconds.
Irvan pays dearly as Martin on fresh tires, on lap 167 pulls away.
Burton goes low and passes Irvan on 172; Jarrett gets him on lap
174 and takes third. Gordon still hasn't led.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton's motor blows, bringing out caution on lap 179. The
nine cars on the lead lap hit pit road. Jeff Burton, Martin and
Gordon take right side tires. Burton crew blew it, didn't put lug
nuts on tightly causing Burton to come back in. He takes on four
tires, but it's too late. He came in second and went out ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Today's Impact
</P>
<P>
   With 20 laps to go Sunday, Jeff Gordon was running fourth a half
lap behind and destined for no more than a top five finish. Then
came the blown motor in Ward Burton's Pontiac, bunching up the
field and bringing it down pit road for the last gasp. It was all
Gordon needed. He took on two right side tires, came out third and
blew away the field for his eighth victory of the year and fourth
in a row.
</P>
<P>
   Who was hot
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's crew. They got him out of the pits in third place
behind Martin and Jarrett and once in front never had to check his
rear view mirror.
</P>
<P>
   Who was not
</P>
<P>
   Martin. He also took on two tires during that last stop, got out
first, and held Gordon off for six laps before fading to fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Points update
</P>
<P>
   The beat goes on. With his victory, Gordon moved 97 points in
front of Martin and 233 ahead of third place Dale Jarrett. The top
five: Gordon, 3262; Martin, 3165; Jarrett, 3029; Rusty Wallace,
2863.
</P>
<P>
   Did You Know?
</P>
<P>
   With his victory Sunday, Gordon moved to 15th on the all-time
victory list, tied with Bobby Issac. It was Gordon's 37th career
victory, eighth of the year, fourth straight and 26th on a
superspeedway.
</P>
<P>
   The four straight tied the all time modern era record, dating to
1972, held by Mark Martin, '93; Bill Elliott,''92; Harry Gant, '91;
Dale Earnhardt, '87; Darrell Waltrip, '81; and Cale Yarborough,
'96. He led only nine laps, but they were the last nine. His margin
of victory was 1.8 seconds, amazing when you realize with 20 laps
to go he was more concerned about going down a lap than winning the
race . . . Only nine cars finished on the lead lap . . .
</P>
<P>
   Next week's story line
</P>
<P>
   Dale Jarrett defends his title in the Goody's 500 at Bristol,
but Gordon will be the man to beat as he goes for his fifth victory
of the year and fourth in his career at Bristol.

CLINTON FACES CRITICAL TEST BEFORE GRAND JURY
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
By NANCY MATHIS &QL; 
and JOHN C. HENRY &QL; 
c. 1998
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Houston Chronicle &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pondering full disclosure and a national apology,
President Clinton breaks his silence today about his relationship
with a former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Political advisers, hoisting trial balloons all weekend,
suggested the president may concede an ``inappropriate
relationship'' with Monica Lewinsky and may seek forgiveness from
the American people who have shown little interest in delving into
his personal life.
</P>
<P>
   On the most critical day of his presidency, Clinton will make an
unprecedented closed-circuit televised appearance before a
23-member grand jury probing allegations that he lied about his
relationship with Lewinsky, 25, and urged her to lie as well.
Later, the president may make a statement to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Former aides and allies contended Sunday that Clinton should
throw himself on the mercy of the court, and the mercy of the
public, in an effort to save his beleaguered presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on ABC's This Week, Sen. Robert Torricelli, D-N.J.,
noted this nation's dominant faith is based on redemption. ``It is
a forgiving country. If there is a contradiction, and it appears
there might be, he has to explain it. But I think he can.''
</P>
<P>
   Lanny Davis, a former White House lawyer, suggested Clinton
address the nation and release a transcript of his videotaped
testimony to avoid having portions of his statements released by
others.
</P>
<P>
   Republican adversaries warned of serious consequences if Clinton
testified less than honestly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ask the president to testify truthfully because, so
help me, if he lies before the grand jury, that would be grounds
for impeachment,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the
Senate Judiciary Committee, during an appearance on NBC's Meet the
Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all that's involved here is the president lying under oath,
which is terribly serious but to protect his wife and daughter from
serious pain, the American public I think will be willing to wait
until the year 2000 to replace him,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton may find little sympathy from the Republican
majority serving on the House Judiciary Committee which would have
to recommend any impeachment proceedings to the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``If at the end of the day I conclude that the president lied
under oath in a court proceeding, I would have a very hard time not
recommending impeachment to the House,'' said Rep. Bill McCollum,
R-Fla, a committee member appearing on CBS's Face the Nation. The
House votes for articles of impeachment while the Senate conducts
the impeachment trial.
</P>
<P>
   The vast speculation about Clinton's testimony prompted his
personal attorney David Kendall to release a terse statement Sunday
afternoon: ``There is apparently an enormous amount of groundless
speculation about the president's testimony tomorrow. The truth is
the truth. Period. And, that's how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and first lady, arm in arm, attended church on
Sunday morning and he spent much of the day huddled with his
personal attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   At noon CDT today, Clinton will enter the Map Room in the White
House, the ground-floor room where President Franklin D. Roosevelt
kept track of troop movements during World War II. It is here for
the first time that a president will testify in a criminal
investigation in which he is the target.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton for the first time will confront prosecutors from
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's office, and perhaps Starr
himself, who has spent four years investigating the president's and
first lady's business and personal dealings.
</P>
<P>
   The White House Communications Agency, the military unit that
provides the communications support for the presidency, will set up
a secure closed-circuit television feed to the federal courthouse
located near the Capitol. Unlike most grand jury witnesses, Clinton
will be allowed to have his personal legal team and White House
counsel Charles Ruff in the room with him.
</P>
<P>
   But political advisers, who have been at odds with Clinton's
legal team, spent the weekend spreading the word that the president
may alter his previous denials of any sexual relationship with
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Such a monumental change would prove painful to Clinton's family
and friends and could severely undermine his credibility even if he
remains in office. The public so far has repeatedly given the
president some of his highest approval ratings while also
indicating a majority believe he did have a sexual relationship
with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president changes his testimony and acknowledges an
improper relationship here, he obviously is going to have to go
through a lot of pain himself, not only in apologizing to his wife
and his family, but obviously to the staff and to those that he
misled and to the American public,'' former Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta said on Meet The Press.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   After seven turbulent months, the sex-and-lies scandal is at a
turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigation began in January when Linda Tripp, a
former Lewinsky friend, provided him with secretly reported
telephone calls in which her co-worker spoke of her affair with
Clinton in graphic detail. Tripp also provided the same information
to attorneys for Paula Jones, the former Arkansas government clerk
who sued Clinton for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   In his deposition in the Jones' case that same month, Clinton
denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky, suggested he had not
been alone with her in the White House and could not recall if he
had given her gifts. As the scandal became public, Clinton also
appeared before television camera to forcefully maintain, ``I did
not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue was not only whether Clinton lied in his deposition but
whether he conspired to cover up the perjury but suggesting ``cover
stories'' for Lewinsky and whether he urged help for Lewinsky's job
quest in an effort to keep her quiet.

   Lewinsky, after holding out for months, recently testified
before the grand jury that she and Clinton did have a sexual affair
and while he suggested hypothetical cover stories that he never
urged her to lie. She also provided a navy blue cocktail dress
reportedly containing DNA proof of a sexual encounter. The results
of that test is Washington's best kept secret.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported that Clinton may concede an
``inappropriate relationship'' with Lewinsky but decline to go into
details. He may also maintain he did not commit perjury in his
initial deposition which rested in a legal definition of sexual
relations provided by Jones' attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   The Washington Post reported Clinton was considering altering
his denial to acknowledge a sexual encounter but found his most
difficult decision was how to inform the first lady, Hillary Rodham
Clinton, and his daughter, Chelsea.
</P>
<P>
   The New York Daily News reported that the president already has
informed the first lady in a ``brutally honest'' discussion. There
was speculation that advisers were floating the trial balloons as a
way of informing Clinton's family.
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton's testimony will not draw the case to an
immediate end. Starr can still recall Lewinsky and continues to
question Secret Service agents about what they may have seen in the
White House. Indeed, there may be months to go before the matter
comes to a rest.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor reportedly will try to complete a report
outlining possible impeachment activities to the House within a
month. The Republican-led House already has geared up its Judiciary
Committee for possible impeachment hearings. McCollum suggested the
panel could take weeks more to review the case.

DIGITAL COMMERCE: IF SOFTWARE CODE IS KEPT SECRET, SECURITY IS AT
RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The trade secrets of commercial software vendors are threatening
the security of the global Internet _ and that threat extends to
the future of electronic commerce as well.
</P>
<P>
   This was not the conclusion that most people would have reached
over the last two weeks as significant security flaws were
disclosed in several popular e-mail packages, including Eudora,
Microsoft Outlook and Netscape Mail.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, most of the focus was on how users could get their
hands on patches, the additional bits of software code that would
spackle over the holes in their vulnerable e-mail programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, network security experts are adamant that the roots
of the problem are fundamental and widespread. They think that the
Internet's structure as it exists today _ the open, freely
available Internet protocols, with overly bulky and/or proprietary
software running atop them _ is impossible to secure, because only
the software vendors know what is in their code.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the recently exposed e-mail flaw that would enable an
intruder to send an electronic message containing a program
intended to damage or steal data. How could a company release
software that would allow such a thing to happen?
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is these gigantic, 10-megabyte Web browsers,''
said Mark Seiden, chief network consultant for Veriguard Inc., a
computer-security concern in Menlo Park, Calif. ``Nobody knows what
flaws are in them. Nobody even knows, really, everything that they
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, he said, we install them without thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Or worse,'' Seiden said, ``you have no choice but to install
them because, in the case of Internet Explorer, they're part of the
operating system. Then there are all the things which are part of
Windows which haven't been looked at, with an eye toward security,
by anybody other than the vendor.''
</P>
<P>
   Any software company that develops software for Windows, for
example, has to trust whatever security defaults Microsoft has
chosen to use, yet ``the developers have no idea what's in them,''
Seiden said. ``There's no way to find out the Windows source
code.''
</P>
<P>
   Until a few months ago, the same was true of Netscape. But
earlier this year, Netscape published its source code to encourage
its use by third-party software developers. Apparently developers
have not had sufficient time to discover all its flaws.
</P>
<P>
   What this means in the end is that the network infrastructure
created by popular Web browsers from Netscape Communications Corp.
and Microsoft Corp. _ and from the scores of other companies that
produce software to work with them _ has not been subjected to the
same rigorous peer review that went into the design of Internet
protocols, the rules that are continually scrutinized by some of
the world's best software engineers.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Seiden said, there is always the possibility,
however remote, that ``any of the stuff that's on your desktop can
be gotten to by hostile programs.''
</P>
<P>
   For today's online consumers, that means exposing bank accounts,
password files _ anything that is in a file on a hard drive
connected to the Internet. But for companies conducting business on
the Internet, that means exposing trade secrets, intellectual
property, product designs, customer databases, marketing strategies
and more.
</P>
<P>
   Seiden recommends encrypting sensitive information on a
vulnerable machine, preferably by using code embedded on a computer
chip, rather than encryption software.
</P>
<P>
   But even if a company follows that recommendation, the incentive
to steal corporate data appears to be increasing at an alarming
rate.
</P>
<P>
   According to the 1997 Global Information Security Survey,
conducted by Ernst &AMP; Young in conjunction with Information Week
magazine, 38 percent of respondents in the United States said their
networks had been compromised for purposes of industrial espionage,
up from 6 percent in 1996. Those reporting malicious acts by
outsiders increased to 42 percent in 1997 from 17 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Although there is no known instance of any intruder actually
exploiting the e-mail security flaws disclosed this month, this
increasing vulnerability alarms security experts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corporate espionage is the fastest-growing sector of the
computer crime business,'' said Thomas Noonan, chairman and chief
executive of Internet Security Systems, an Atlanta-based supplier
of security management systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flaws in the infrastructure are inevitable, a fact of life,''
Noonan said. ``But if electronic commerce is about the ability to
trade ubiquitously in all corners of the globe, one of the huge
challenges for business is how to protect the security and
integrity of my information, which is now the basis of my
competitive advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Noonan, whose clients include some of the world's largest
companies, says corporate information officers realize that
commercial software is ``the source of their vulnerabilities.'' But
though they spend millions of dollars on software every year,
``they feel their hands are tied.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I really think that unless these vendors provide their
customers with a much higher level of comfort for managing security
risks, then a lot less software will be sold, and electronic
commerce will gain a lot less traction than it could have,'' Noonan
said.
</P>
<P>
   If Noonan is right, the industry's very tentative steps toward
open source code _ a la Netscape and the Linux version of the Unix
operating system _ become even more attractive. When a program's
code is open to inspection by everyone, bugs are fixed and quality
improves much more quickly because an entire industry of engineers
is working on them at once.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe one day the software industry will have to embrace the
truth of the old Psychology 101 adage: You're only as sick as your
secrets.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ As hard as Electronic Data Systems has tried to define
itself as something other than the company that Ross Perot founded,
it has never quite escaped his legacy. Fourteen years after Perot
sold the company to General Motors, it is still run by his former
lieutenants.
</P>
<P>
   All that is about to change. The board has pointedly announced
plans to hire a new chairman and chief executive from outside. News
earlier this month of the retirement of Lester Alberthal Jr. and of
the board's intent lifted shares of EDS $5.125, or nearly 14
percent, to $41.8125 in one day. In a choppy market, they have
since settled to $40.50.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the company's ultimate boss is James Baker III, the
former secretary of state and chairman of the board's governance
committee. In discreet maneuvering worthy of Middle East diplomacy,
he arranged for Alberthal to step aside and is now leading the
search for a successor.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, disappointed by EDS, have drawn confidence from
Baker's leadership and the demonstrated independence of a board
Alberthal appointed just two years ago, when General Motors spun
off EDS.
</P>
<P>
   Alberthal's virtues were distinct from those of Perot. Even as
he succeeded in vastly expanding the company, especially abroad,
and helping to redefine the computer services business as an
essential element of corporate strategy, he remained quiet,
cautious and shy. For all the company's efforts to build its own
identity, Alberthal was a reluctant pitchman.
</P>
<P>
   Employees, seeing corporate jets and huge management bonuses
even as profitability and the stock price crashed, grew
disenchanted.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts think that EDS should simply find the best
available person from within the computer services industry. But
some big investors and many employees hope for a marquee name, a
business leader so prominent and capable that the public will have
another name to associate with EDS besides Perot. ``When they
presumably bring in somebody of substance, there's another uptick
to come,'' a person who has been briefed on some of the board's
deliberations said.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, can the new chief see that the uptick becomes a
full-fledged recovery, back toward the peak share price of $63.375
two years ago?
</P>
<P>
   There are already some signs of a turnaround. The company has
booked $16.7 billion in new business over the last four quarters,
up 38 percent from the previous four. Its earnings for the second
quarter exceeded analysts' estimates.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company had to acknowledge that some of its
largest contracts were yielding lower profits than its previous
earnings reports had reflected. As Myrna Vance, a vice president
for investor relations, pointed out, the company has become far
more conservative in reporting profits on new contracts
</P>
<P>
   But for now, there are other risks. These begin with General
Motors, the company's largest customer at $4.3 billion last year,
or about a quarter of EDS revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Damage resulting from the recent GM strike might already be
priced into the computer services company's stock. But as the
automaker looks for ways to cut costs, the first initials that come
up after UAW are EDS. ``The new CEO will have a challenge getting
their arms around the General Motors business,'' said Greg Gould,
an analyst with Goldman, Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   The success of EDS in winning new business has come at the cost
of accepting lower profit margins. Under a new chief, said Stephen
McClellan, a Merrill Lynch analyst, ``cost-cutting has got to play
a major new role''
</P>
<P>
   This year, however, turnover in top management is compromising
the company's ability to take a new direction. Since February, EDS
has been searching, without success, for a chief financial officer.
The new chief executive is bound to remake the rest of the
executive team.
</P>
<P>
   Not that anyone at EDS is looking for a return to the forceful
style of Perot. At least on a smaller scale, his decisive, military
manner can still succeed, as a pending public offering of shares in
his Perot Systems is likely to prove. Perot Systems, too, is run by
executives whose history with Perot goes back decades. But Perot's
prediction in 1988, that having the new company he founded compete
with EDS would be ``like turning a bunch of bulldogs loose on a
bunch of poodles,'' has been proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Poodles? Ever since, Perot's challenge has made Alberthal and
his crew all the more determined. Perot, in the meantime, made EDS'
success a premise of his presidential races. Lacking direct
dealings with consumers, EDS had few chances to tell everyone that
it was no longer a Perot company.
</P>
<P>
   Now EDS has that chance. ``Whomever they pick,'' an EDS manager
said, ``the perception of that person will be the perception of
EDS.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You've been tempted, I know; one can live on
baseball, golf and tennis for only so long without wanting a little
contact in your sports.
</P>
<P>
   But do try to resist the temptation of exhibition football.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition football _ we simply refuse to call it anything else
_ is a lot like watching a Milli Vanilli concert. The crowd seems
into it, but you know these fakers are not what you paid to see.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL, amazingly, still gets people to attend what it
euphemistically calls ``preseason games'' in August. This is a
shrewd marketing move that antedates by many years baseball teams
giving out Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Do not think you are watching the NFL. The players might wear
the uniforms of your favorite team, but in reality they are closer
to the World League than the NFL. Exhibitions feature a bunch of
guys you've never heard of from Middle Tennessee State or somewhere
else where schools' football teams play second fiddle to their
cotton-judging teams.
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition football is about coaches trying out kickers and
third-string quarterbacks, about Dallas Cowboys scandals and about
the John Elways and Barry Sanderses trying not to get hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Do not watch these games on television, do not look for stories
on them in the paper. Glance at the scores as you would look at the
weather forecast. Peek if you must, but be strong. The real games
begin Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   __ Six words no one wants to hear while sitting in the barber's
chair: Michael Irvin will cut your hair.
</P>
<P>
   __ Always thought that when players get cut from training camp
it meant they were off the team, not sliced with scissors. Maybe
that's why I never played high school football.
</P>
<P>
   __ Don't bet on the Buckeyes. Ohio State, which was the
Associated Press' No. 1 team in the preseason poll, has about as
much chance ending up No. 1 as John Cooper does of beating
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   And that reason _ Cooper's failings against the Wolverines _
will guarantee Ohio State will have at least one loss on its
record. Ohio State is 1-8-1 against the Wolverines under Cooper.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 2: The Buckeyes were the No. 1 team five times in
previous preseason polls. They didn't wind up No. 1 in any of those
years.
</P>
<P>
   Reason No. 3: Since the AP began preseason rankings in 1950, no
team has held the top spot from start to finish. Eight teams that
were No. 1 in the preseason ended up No. 1 after the bowls _ the
last was Florida State in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   __ So THAT was USC's problem last year. They had a tight end
playing quarterback. It all makes sense now.
</P>
<P>
   __ When they write the obituary on the Dodgers season _ and
believe me, it's almost complete _ this is one stat to which they
can point: The Dodgers won only three times in a nine-game,
mid-August stretch against Montreal, Pittsburgh and Florida. Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   __ There's no truth to the rumor that O.J. Simpson has stopped
looking for the real killers and is now helping Tommy Lasorda look
for the Dodgers' next general manager.
</P>
<P>
   __ Here's one for the refrigerator door: No one will break Roger
Maris' record this year. Free bonus forecast: The New York Yankees
won't win the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   __ Obscure baseball stat of the week: John Olerud of the New
York Mets is trying to become the first player since Ed Delahanty
in 1902 to win hitting titles in both leagues. Olerud, the 1993 AL
batting champion with Toronto, is hitting .355 after Saturday's
game to lead the NL.
</P>
<P>
   __ Kansas City will wind up with former Crespi High pitcher Jeff
Suppan after he clears waivers, writes Ken Daley of the Dallas
Morning News. Suppan, the second overall pick of the expansion
draft, is going from Arizona to the Mets as the player to be named
in the Willie Blair deal, then is being dealt to the Royals to
complete the trade for Jermaine Allensworth.

   KOTRADIC, Yugoslavia _ ``I am Dr. Mustaf Shala,'' said a shaken,
unshaven man in a dirty shirt. ``The wounded people are in here.
Come quickly _ they are all in serious condition.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind him in a small house, on the floor, with the failing
sunlight barely illuminating them, were a very old man lying
against a large sack of onions and two women, one eight months
pregnant, on mats.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the airplanes,'' Shala said. ``They bombed us with
airplanes until we left Lodja.'' He was speaking of the latest
village to become a target in the Yugoslav military offensive
against rebels in Kosovo Province who are fighting to secede from
Serbia, Yugoslavia's main republic.
</P>
<P>
   The pregnant woman, 23, stared straight ahead, her mouth
silently opening and closing as if she were gulping for air. A
bandage covered her head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was shrapnel from a bomb,'' the doctor said. ``I
took out what I could, but we don't have anything like an X-ray. We
don't even have medicine, except a little for pain. I cried,
because that was all I could do.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as NATO is to begin military exercises on Monday intended
to intimidate the Yugoslav government into stopping its attacks on
civilians in Kosovo, and despite what Western governments call
intense diplomatic pressure, the shelling and burning _ and now
possibly bombing _ are continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Although the government's stated target, the rebels of the
Kosovo Liberation Army, seem to have been hurt in the attacks, the
principal victims are almost certainly civilians. Perhaps 200,000
have fled their homes in recent weeks, and an unknown number have
been killed or wounded.
</P>
<P>
   International aid agencies have been unable to keep up with the
flow of civilians fleeing the offensive, and relief officials fear
that many refugees will die from wounds or disease. The officials
also fear that a slow and disorganized response by the aid groups
will contribute to the refugees' plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The airplanes came at five minutes before six, yesterday
morning,'' said Shala. ``I was in the clinic. I sleep there because
the artillery attacks have come at night for weeks and there are
always wounded.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw two planes coming in from the direction of the
mountains. Then two helicopters began to circle,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other people from Lodja, who had walked to this village carrying
the wounded and some food, were gathered around the doctor and
nodding their heads in agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``The helicopters went away a little, the planes turned and came
back very low and fast,'' the doctor went on. ``Suddenly, there was
a noise like we had never heard before and the whole village was
shaking.''
</P>
<P>
   A government spokesman, police Col. Bozidar Filic, said Sunday
there were no aircraft of any kind used in the attack on Lodja.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 1,500 people in Lodja at the time of the
attack, villagers said. Shala said that two civilians were killed
outright and estimated that he treated another 25 civilians, and
two rebels, for injuries. The elderly man and the second woman were
inside a house when it was bombed, and both suffered serious back
injuries, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She is paralyzed in the left leg, and he is in a coma,'' he
said. ``But she is one I am very worried about,'' he said, walking
over to the pregnant woman. ``There is very little time to get her
help.''
</P>
<P>
   The village of Lodja, abandoned after Saturday's attack and now
occupied by government forces, could be located 20 miles away
Sunday by the black smoke pouring out of its buildings. The pattern
for government forces during the four-week-old offensive has been
to shell civilian towns and villages, force the residents into
flight, and then loot and burn the homes. The practice has not only
increased the terror of refugees, thousands of whom are living in
the open, but also means that many have no place to return.
</P>
<P>
   At midday Sunday, a two-mile-long Yugoslav army column of tanks,
cannons and armored personnel carriers with soldiers waving in
victory passed along the main road from Junik and within half a
mile of the burning village of Lodja. Government forces said Sunday
that on Saturday they had taken control of Junik, a logistical
center for the KLA, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers here in Kotradic, who have taken in the refugees
from Lodja, had a telephone number for the International Red Cross
office in Pristina, the provincial capital, and had been trying to
call for help. They could not get through for most of the day,
however, because the number was changed three weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   When they reached the Red Cross, they said, the villagers were
told this place was too dangerous and Red Cross rules would not
permit sending help. A U.N. refugee relief team was in the village,
learned about the wounded from Lodja and wanted to take the
pregnant woman out because the doctor feared she would die before
morning without medical treatment. But the team said U.N. rules
would not permit them to exceed their mandate and transport the
wounded.
</P>
<P>
   By late Sunday, the woman had been taken to a Pristina hospital,
three hours away, not by relief agencies, but by a reporter.
Doctors at the hospital said her recovery was uncertain.

   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ The day after the deadliest
paramilitary attack in 29 years of sectarian violence in this
British province, dozens of people sat blank-faced or weeping
Sunday afternoon at a community center set up as a command post to
find people still missing.
</P>
<P>
   The attack, at the height of downtown shopping on Saturday,
killed 28 people and wounded more than 200. It stunned Omagh, which
is mostly Roman Catholic, and the rest of this predominantly
Protestant province.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was watching the bombs against America in Africa,''
said Michael MacAnespae, a 54-year-old mushroom farmer. ``We
thought all that was behind us here. But suddenly it's back on your
own doorstep.''
</P>
<P>
   No group has claimed responsibility for the attack, but the
police and political leaders, both Protestant and Catholic, said it
appeared to have been the work of a group calling itself the Real
IRA, a splinter group of the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish
Republican Army. The IRA itself has been observing a cease-fire for
13 months.
</P>
<P>
   Both Catholics, who constitute 70 percent of the population of
the town, and Protestants were killed in the blast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   British Prime Minister Tony Blair interrupted a vacation in
France to fly here Sunday morning. Irish Prime Minister Bertie
Ahern went to Belfast Sunday night to discuss ways of combating the
splinter group.
</P>
<P>
   The object of the attack was clearly to disrupt or destroy the
peace agreement reached by both Protestant and Catholic leaders and
overwhelmingly approved in May referendums in both Northern Ireland
and the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Police had unwittingly herded a crowd of people toward the bomb
because of a misleading telephone warning.
</P>
<P>
   Among those who died in the bombing was 17-year-old Brenda
Logue, who, friends and relatives said, seemed happy on Saturday
morning as she came in from the countryside to this usually calm,
well-scrubbed town on the hills of central Ulster. After days of
mist and ran, the sun had come out.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda and her mother, Mary, strolled by the floats and exhibits
of the annual town festival. They went into a household goods shop
on Market Street that was full of weekend shoppers. While her
mother stayed inside, Brenda left the shop, putting her in the way
of the 500-pound car bomb; her mother was slightly wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda was a good Gaelic football player and had been offered a
job on MacAnespae's farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has a sense of humor, `` said MacAnespae. ``She was
bubbly.''
</P>
<P>
   MacAnespae, a local council member of Sinn Fein, the IRA's
political wing, said he could not understand the attack, apparently
by a Catholic group.
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they want to unite Ireland,'' he said. ``Is this the
way to unite Ireland? It may have been the way long ago, but that
way has been tried and it failed.''
</P>
<P>
   Sinn Fein, and every other party and church, has condemned the
attack.
</P>
<P>
   The police said those who died in the bombing included 14 women,
5 men and 7 children, with two others not yet identified.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 220 people wounded in Omagh, about 100 remained in
hospitals across Northern Ireland on Sunday, including 11 people in
critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of our patients will be disfigured in some way,'' Dr.
Laurence Rocke, a surgeon at Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast,
told The Associated Press. ``Some will be disabled very severely,
and some may not survive.'' .
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   At the information center, people scanned a bulletin board for
new postings identifying the dead and wounded. Most declined
politely to talk to reporters, shaking their heads and lowering
their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Brenda's uncle, Michael Logue, 28, an unemployed salesman, left
Brenda's parents and went into a men's room, where he broke into
unrestrained weeping. ``Just a teen-ager,'' he said. ``I saw it on
TV. It's just like Beirut.''
</P>
<P>
   The others who died included Mary Grimes, 65, her daughter Avril
Monaghan, 30 _ who was pregnant with twins _ and her granddaughter,
Maura, who lived in outlying towns and were visiting Omagh to shop.
</P>
<P>
   A mother of four buying a school uniform for her youngest girl
was also killed, as well as three boys from the Irish Republic
traveling with a 12-year-old Spanish student as part of an exchange
program, and the 24-year-old teacher leading them.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish exchange students had been studying English for a
month in Donegal, in the northwest corner of the Irish Republic.
They made a day trip across the border with some Irish students to
visit the Ulster-American Folk Park near Omagh, and some decided
afterward to shop in town. Eleven members of the group were among
those wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Outside County Tyrone Hospital, where many of the wounded were
treated, two prominent political enemies stood together in the
heavy rain in a show of unity. Seamus Mallon is the Catholic deputy
leader of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, which is to carry out
the peace agreement. He said terrorism would not destroy the
assembly, which is to give Catholics more political power. Ken
Maginnis, a leader of the Protestant Ulster Unionist Party, agreed.

CARTOONIST KARL HUBENTHAL DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Karl Hubenthal, a fine sports and editorial
cartoonist in Los Angeles for 47 years, died last week of cancer at
age 81.
</P>
<P>
   A graduate of Hollywood High, Hubenthal started with the old
L.A. Herald-Express in 1935. The same Hearst newspaper, which once
had the largest evening circulation in America, also produced two
other famous sports cartoonists, Willard Mullin, who preceded
Hubenthal, and Jack Manning, who succeeded him.
</P>
<P>
   Hubenthal reached his peak as a sports cartoonist with Hearst's
morning Examiner, when that paper had the best sports section in
the city. One of his cleverest creations was a portrait of UCLA
football star Paul Cameron _ it was a rooting-section card stunt
with each card and its holder meticulously and patiently drawn.
Another was USC's football season drawn as a jigsaw puzzle, with
the one missing piece the last, yet-to-be-played game: a four-leaf
clover labeled ``Notre Dame.''
</P>
<P>
   He retired to Orange County in 1982 and spent much of his
painting. He attended the annual Reubens award dinner in Pasadena
last April.
</P>
<P>
   According to his family, his papers and most of his drawings are
in collections at the University of Wisconsin, Ohio State
University and the International Museum of Cartoon Art in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Hubenthal leaves his wife of 58 years, Elsie, two daughters and
a brother.

 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You would have had to be looking for it to find
it. But buried in the Aug. 7 edition of The Daily News of Los
Angeles was a disclosure that the newspaper had contributed $60,000
to a group advocating the first step in the San Fernando Valley's
secession from the rest of the city.
</P>
<P>
   The contribution is the largest among known donations to the
group, Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, amounting to
nearly a third of the $200,000 it has received.
</P>
<P>
   The donation has sparked concern among reporters and editors at
the paper that their impartiality on a divisive issue in Los
Angeles has been compromised. The newspaper's management denies
this is the case, and in an open letter to readers published on the
editorial page on Friday, the newspaper said that future stories on
secession would contain a disclosure about the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   The valley group is petitioning for a state study of whether the
secession idea is feasible, and it needs tens of thousands of
signatures by Aug. 27. ``There weren't enough people behind it for
public debate, so they put money in to ensure public debate,'' said
Amy Collins, an assistant city editor.
</P>
<P>
   Dave McNary, a business writer who is president of the paper's
chapter of the Newspaper Guild, said, ``This, for a lot of people
at The Daily News, is difficult, because it's real hard not to come
to the conclusion that this is a partisan issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents of the valley have long complained that, besides
enduring its decidedly unglamorous suburban reputation in northern
Los Angeles, on the far side of the Hollywood Hills, the region
does not get a fair return in services for the tax dollars it pays.
So in recent years, support has grown for the valley to break away
from the city of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The Daily News, a scrappy 205,000-circulation paper based in the
valley and owned by William Dean Singleton's Medianews Group, which
also owns The Denver Post, has long argued on its editorial pages
that the valley does not get its share of services.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, Ike Massey, publisher and chief executive of
The Daily News, said that the integrity of the newsroom was not
compromised by the donation and that he had never asked a reporter
or editor to slant a story in favor of the secession movement.
</P>
<P>
   He also said that other newspapers, including The Los Angeles
Times, made donations to causes. (A spokeswoman for The Times,
Laura Morgan, said it had a policy against contributing to
politicians, parties and ballot initiatives.)
</P>
<P>
   Massey rejected the comparison of the donation to a political
contribution, saying it was made to support only a petition drive
for a secession study, not secession itself. But he acknowledged
that he thought The Daily News would benefit from the valley's
becoming a separate city, saying the newspaper would automatically
become the paper of record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope we played a major role in the success of the petition
drive,'' Massey said. ``I hope we play that role. I'm not going to
apologize for making this contribution. I'm very proud of making
that contribution. I think the study needs to be done so people in
this valley can make their own decisions about how workable and
beneficial it may or not be to break away from L.A. and create a
new city.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Massey nor David Butler, the editor of the newspaper,
would discuss the timing or circumstances of the contribution.
</P>
<P>
   At a 90-minute meeting attended by about 35 reporters and
editors last Tuesday with Butler and Ron Kaye, the managing editor,
staff members raised concerns that the donation took the paper
across the line between reporting the news and making the news, and
that it would hurt the paper's public perception and trust with
readers, McNary said.
</P>
<P>
   He characterized the staff's mood over the donation as one of
resignation and disappointment. Ms. Collins compared the feeling to
what people experience after being betrayed by cheating spouses.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It's very upsetting,'' Ms. Collins said. ``You work hard, you
make a lot of sacrifices, and one day you wake up and find out: `We
deceived you. We lied to you. We're not working for objectivity;
we're working for Valley VOTE.' Or they're working for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, the editor of Columbia Journalism Review, agreed:
``When you write an editorial, readers think you are speaking for
what you believe is in the best interests of the people. But when
you contribute money to a campaign, readers think you are speaking
to what's in the best interests of the company. That's the
distinction.''

AUTHORITIES QUESTIONING SUSPECT IN AFRICAN BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EMBASSYBOMBS-RDP and EMBASSYBOMBS-ALBANIA)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ The Kenyan police and American FBI agents were
questioning a man Sunday whom Pakistani authorities deported to
Kenya because of suspicions that he took part in the bombings of
the U.S. embassies here and in Tanzania, Kenyan officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators declined to say where the man was being held or
what role he is accused of having played in the bombings on Aug. 7.
The simultaneous blasts took more than 250 lives and injured
thousands.
</P>
<P>
   But Pakistani and Kenyan officials confirmed that the suspect,
identified only as Mohammed Sadek Howaida, 32, had arrived in Kenya
on a flight Sunday morning and was being interrogated at a secret
location.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are under orders to be tight-lipped about everything,''
said Hardrick Crawford Jr., the assistant special agent in charge
of the joint Kenya-U.S. task force investigating the Nairobi
bombing, when asked about Howaida. ``Our instructions are to remain
silent.''
</P>
<P>
   In Pakistan, the Foreign Ministry said that Howaida had been
taken into custody soon after his arrival from Nairobi at the
airport in Karachi, Pakistan, the same day the bombs detonated.
</P>
<P>
   He left Nairobi the night before on a Pakistan International
Airways flight. He was initially detained because customs officers
suspected he was traveling under a forged passport, Pakistani
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Although U.S. officials said on Saturday that American
investigators had gone to Pakistan to question the man, it was
unclear Sunday whether the American agents accompanied him to
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement on Sunday, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry took
pains to say that Howaida had been turned over to Kenyan
authorities. One apparent reason is that in the past terrorists
have retaliated against American targets in Pakistan after the
Pakistani police handed suspects over to American investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The Foreign Ministry identified Howaida as an ``Arab national,''
a phrase which means only that he could be from nearly anywhere in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Among other questions, investigators here are looking into
whether there is a link between Howaida and the Saudi
multimillionaire Osama bin Laden, who has been living in
neighboring Afghanistan for the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Bin Laden is a vocal critic of the United States and has been
identified by American law enforcement officials as a major sponsor
of terrorism. From the moment the bombs detonated, investigators
have suspected bin Laden's loose network of Islamic fundamentalist
organizations, which are said to be among the few terrorist
networks with the technical capability and financial resources to
mount simultaneous attacks.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sunday's Pakistani newspapers identified the suspect by a
slightly different name, Mohammed Sadique, and said he had been
detained in Pakistan as he tried to cross the border into
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   One national newspaper, The News, quoted an unnamed government
official as saying that Howaida had confessed to planning the
bombings.
</P>
<P>
   But the Foreign Ministry said in its statement only that Howaida
``was interrogated by our concerned agencies and, on satisfaction
about his involvement in these terrorist acts, he was sent back to
Nairobi and handed over to the Kenyan authorities for appropriate
action under their law.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenyan Foreign Minister Bonaya Godana confirmed that Howaida had
been turned over to the police here and that he was being held in
connection with the car-bomb attacks. He said it was still unclear
if Kenya would turn the suspect over to the United States should
enough evidence be found to charge him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our lawyers will have to look at the subject in greater
detail,'' he said. ``Both countries will have grounds for claiming
jurisdiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Mbuvi, the assistant director of the Kenyan Criminal
Investigation Division, which is working with the FBI on the case,
said he could not comment on the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents who answered the telephone at the headquarters for
the joint investigation also declined to give any details about
Howaida or to explain why he was being held.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not here to answer those kinds of questions,'' one agent
said, before hanging up.

 &HT;    American League Week in Review
 &HT;    (EDITORS: Sunday's games out at the time this story moves to
wires: Orioles-Indians.)
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service

<P>
   EAST
</P>
<P>
   _ Records: Yankees 6-1 (90-30), Orioles 5-1 (65-57 through
Saturday), Red Sox 3-3 (71-50), Blue Jays 4-2 (62-61), Devil Rays
3-4 (48-73).
</P>
<P>
   _ Wild card hunt: Red Sox lead league, Orioles 6 1/2 games back,
Blue Jays 10 games back.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: The Yanks keep rolling. They have led in 45
consecutive games and finished their homestand at 10-1. The Yankees
are 60 games over .500 and just one other team ever got to that
point _ the Orioles in 1969 when they were 108-48.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: The Yankees have batted around 28 times this
year, while Orioles catcher Chris Hoiles became the ninth player in
major league history to hit two grand slams in a game on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: Toronto ace Roger Clemens struck out 15 Saturday
but didn't get a win in what turned out to be a 6-3 loss to the
Angels in 11 innings.
</P>
<P>
   _ The unexpected: The Yankees lost a game last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The injuries: Red Sox DH Reggie Jefferson had his rehab
assignment cut short when he reinjured his back.
</P>
<P>
   _ The scoop: Baltimore's Cal Ripken played in his 2,600th
straight game Saturday, 486 more than Lou Gehrig.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's happening this week: Baltimore could move even closer
to the Red Sox in the wild-card race with games against the Twins
and Devil Rays. Boston opens this week with Texas.
</P>
<P>
   CENTRAL
</P>
<P>
   _ Records: White Sox 4-2 (55-66), Royals 2-4 (55-68), Tigers 2-4
(48-73), Twins 2-5 (54-68), Indians 1-4 (66-55 through Saturday).
</P>
<P>
   _ Wild card hunt: None.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: The Indians signed Cecil Fielder, hoping he can
fill in at first base some and also in the DH spot until Jim Thome
(broken thumb) gets off the DL. Fielders hit .241 with 17 homers
and 68 RBIs with the Angles.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Royals third baseman Dean Palmer has 21 RBIs in
his last 17 games.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: Detroit's Bryce Florie struck out a career-high
10 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   _ The unexpected: The Twins signed a new two-year lease with the
Metrodome, meaning the club will remain in Minnesota at least
through the 2000 season. There are three one-year options that
could extend it through 2003.
</P>
<P>
   _ The injuries: Tigers second baseman Damon Easley will miss
four to five games with a broken finger on his right hand while
Minnesota's Paul Molitor injured his right ankle and may have to go
on the DL.
</P>
<P>
   _ The scoop: The Royals did Glendon Rusch a favor putting him on
the DL. Rusch, with tendinitis in his left shoulder, is tied for
the major-league lead in losses with 15 with Willie Blair of the
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's happening this week: Poor Kansas City. Already 0-8
against the Yankees this season, the Royals have to face them twice
this week.
</P>
<P>
   WEST
</P>
<P>
   _ Records: Angels 5-2 (66-57), Rangers 2-4 (65-57), A's 2-4
(54-69), Mariners 1-4 (55-66).
</P>
<P>
   _ Wild card hunt: Rangers 6 1/2 games back.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big story: The Angels bounced back, taking over the
division lead as the Rangers ran into the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   _ The hot bats: Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. ended a 12-game home
run drought on Saturday, his longest in his career. He now has 42
homers.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: One pitcher that can beat the Yankees is Todd
Stottlemyre of the Yankees, picking up his fourth straight win at
Yankee Stadium on Saturday. His 12 career wins over New York are
his most against any team.
</P>
<P>
   _ The unexpected: A's outfielder Rickey Henderson became the
oldest player to steal 50 bases in a season. He is 39.
</P>
<P>
   _ The injuries: The Angels activated pitcher Jack McDowell off
the DL over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   _ The scoop: Mariners starter Bill Swift doesn't need an extra
day of rest. On five days' rest, he is 3-6 while he is 7-0 on his
regular four days.
</P>
<P>
   _ What's happening this week: A Rangers-Red Sox showdown starts
tonight in Boston.

PHONE FIRMS BEGINNING SUBSIDY FEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By AMY DOAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Starting this month, your phone bill probably will include an extra
charge for the ``Universal Connectivity'' program recently approved
by the Federal Communications Commission. This new initiative
subsidizes the cost of Internet hookups for schools, libraries and
rural health-care facilities.
<TEXT>
<P>
   All telecommunications companies are required to help fund the
program, and &UR;  &LR; they're allowed to recover the cost any way they
want, including passing it along to customers. For example, AT&AMP;T
has added an additional 93 cents to its customers' July bills.
</P>
<P>
   But one AT&AMP;T customer called me to protest the fact that even
low-income customers who qualify for the ``Universal Lifeline''
reduced rates are being forced to pay the extra charge.
</P>
<P>
   An AT&AMP;T representative said its current policy is not to waive
the fee, even in cases of extreme hardship, but that it is
reviewing this policy. You can find out more about the program by
clicking on ``Universal Service'' under the hot-topics section of
the FCC's Web site, www.fcc.gov.
</P>
<P>
   COLLEGE COSTS: From 1980 to 1996, tuition at U.S. colleges and
universities jumped 90 percent, compared with only a 9 percent
increase in average income for families with college-age children,
according to a recent survey by the College Board.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the number of students borrowing for college has
more than doubled during the past decade, says the U.S. Department
of Education.
</P>
<P>
   About 52 percent of all students who graduated from college in
1996 had outstanding loans, with an average total debt of $11,950.
That's up from 35 percent who were debt-ridden at diploma time in
1993.
</P>
<P>
   EDUCATION IRAS: The good news in light of the above is that you
now can invest for a portion of future tuition costs on a
tax-favored basis with an Education IRA, the new investment vehicle
created by Congress this year. You can invest up to $500 per child
per year. The amount doesn't count against the maximums for other
IRAs. There's been discussion in Congress about raising the $500
limit, which to many investors seems too low to make a real dent in
future college bills. Last week, Strong Funds launched
www.education &QL; 
IRA.com, which includes information about these funds, interactive
calculators and educational materials for college planning.

BRITISH AND IRISH GOVERNMENTS VOW TO HUNT DOWN OMAGH CAR BOMBERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With NIRELAND-BOMB) 
(nk) 
 By JAMES F. CLARITY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland _ The British and Irish Republic
governments said Sunday that they would hunt down those responsible
for Saturday's car bombing that killed 28 people and wounded more
than 200 in Omagh, a usually quiet town in the center of Ulster.
</P>
<P>
   The attack was the deadliest in 29 years of sectarian violence
in this predominantly Protestant British province. But in a sense,
it was expected by London and Dublin, sponsors of the peace
agreement designed to give the minority Roman Catholics more power
here and to give the overwhelmingly Catholic Irish Republic more
influence in Northern affairs.
</P>
<P>
   As the peace agreement moved close to approval last spring, both
Prime Ministers _ Tony Blair of Britain and Bertie Ahern of the
Irish Republic _ warned that splinter groups, Catholic and
Protestant, would not honor the cease-fires being observed by the
mostly Catholic Irish Republican Army and two major Protestant
paramilitary groups, the Ulster Volunteer Force and the Ulster
Freedom Fighters.
</P>
<P>
   Their worst fears were realized in Saturday's attack, and Sunday
night they met here to discuss how to catch the killers. The most
intense focus was on a group that calls itself Real IRA, because
most officials and ordinary people believe the group placed the
deadly car bomb on Market Street.
</P>
<P>
   Other Catholic groups, the Irish National Liberation Army and
the Continuity IRA, have not been active in recent weeks, although
they have denounced the peace agreement and the cease-fire. A
particularly violent Protestant group, the Loyalist Volunteer
Force, declared last week that it was ceasing military operations.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and ordinary people continued Sunday to discuss the
tactics in the bombing, in which police were apparently misled in a
phone call that warned the attack would be near the courthouse.
Acting on the warning, police moved hundreds of people to a point
nearer the eventual explosion.
</P>
<P>
   Most people said Sunday that it made no difference whether the
group that carried out the attack deliberately or mistakenly misled
the police.
</P>
<P>
   Irish Republic President Mary McAleese seemed to reflect the
feeling of most people in Omagh, 55 miles west of Belfast, after
she inspected the blood-stained rubble there this morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever planted that bomb knew exactly what they were doing,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Catholic dissidents say that the peace agreement is a sellout
that will not lead to a united Ireland. Protestant dissidents also
say that the agreement is a sellout _ the first step in an eventual
withdrawal of Britain from the island, leaving the North to be
subsumed in the Irish Republic.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA is made up of dissidents who disapprove of the IRA
cease-fire and of the peace agreement involving Sinn Fein, the
IRA's political wing. The splinter group is believed to have about
100 members, some highly skilled in making bombs.
</P>
<P>
   Almost daily, newspapers here and in Dublin report that a
mastermind bomber who is a former ranking IRA official lives near
Dundalk, in the Irish Republic near the border. Security officials
say that they do not have enough evidence to arrest him, even
though police and intelligence officers have information on some of
the small units of the Real IRA
</P>
<P>
   ``The intelligence people always have a lot of information, but
they never have enough,'' said David McKittrick, author of several
books on Northern Ireland. This meant, he said, that the police
might thwart 20 planned operations, but the 21st will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Last Spring, five members of the 32 County Sovereignty
Committee, a mostly Catholic political group, were imprisoned for
attempting to highjack a bank truck in County Wicklow, south of
Dublin. The group is led by Bernadette Sands McKevitt, whose
brother, Bobby Sands, became an IRA martyr when he starved himself
to death in a British prison in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Blair said of the dissident terrorists: ``They are a
small group of people, a tiny fanatic group of people. They have no
political base, they have no votes, they have no support in
Northern Ireland, they have just this capacity for evil and yet, I
am sure that the will of vast majority of people in Northern
Ireland is going to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Said Ahern: ``We are determined to defeat this campaign in short
order. Whatever it is necessary to do, we will do.''

WHEN YOUR FIRM KEEPS REFUNDS TO CUSTOMERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:   I work in a doctor's office where patients often end up with
small credits on their accounts. The office policy is not to refund
the money if it is under $10 unless the patient specifically
requests it. But often, the patients don't even know they have a
credit. Are there any laws that set up guidelines for refunds?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; There's a California law that covers instances where
doctors receive two duplicate payments for the same service _ for
instance, one payment from the patient and one from the patient's
insurance company. That law (Section 732 of the Business &AMP;
Professional Code) requires doctors to refund the patient's
overpayment within four months, unless the patient explicitly asks
to keep the credit on his or her account.
</P>
<P>
   There's no similar law aimed specifically at situations where a
patient simply overpays for a service.
</P>
<P>
   But a judge probably would rule that holding onto patients'
overpayments is a violation of state unfair-trade-practice laws,
according to Richard A. Elbrecht, an attorney with the California
Department of Consumer Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This firm should set up a procedure to notify patients and ask
them what they want to do with their credit,'' Elbrecht said. ``If
it doesn't notify them, a district attorney could make a very
persuasive case for a court order requiring the firm to go through
its records and refund those amounts. They could also face fines of
up to $2,500 per violation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hats off to you for keeping an independent eye out for what's
legal _ and ethical _ at your workplace!
</P>
<P>
   And let's hope the folks who run the office are willing to
listen to your advice and do the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My friend runs a small six-person office. She needs to fire
an employee who's been there for 12 years, but she isn't sure how
to do it. Any advice?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Let's assume these workers are ``at will'' employees,
people who are not covered by a union or individual contract. Your
friend then has a lot of freedom to decide when and whom to fire,
with certain exceptions:
</P>
<P>
   _ She can't terminate people because of age, sex, race, national
origin, religion or sexual preference.
</P>
<P>
   _ She can't fire them for blowing the whistle on illegal company
practices.
</P>
<P>
   _ She may not be able to fire them if they received a written or
verbal promise of job security _ for instance, a manager's
statement that ``if you can handle the work here, you'll have a job
for life.''
</P>
<P>
   Your friend should be especially careful in this case because
she's dealing with such a long-term employee. In some cases, courts
have said that veteran employees who have received a steady stream
of raises and promotions have an ``implied contract'' and may be
fired only for good cause.
</P>
<P>
   To protect herself from potential lawsuits, your friend should
carefully document this employee's performance problems. She should
also provide some warning and some chance for the employee to
improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she's kept this person on for 12 years and suddenly decides
that their work isn't up to snuff, I think she's obliged to give
them some warning,'' said Barbara Kate Repa, a lawyer who has
written several books on employment issues for Nolo Press in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should be very specific and relate it to the employee's
job duties,'' Repa continued. ``She should say something like,
`This is what you need to do differently. If you haven't done it
within two weeks (or some other window of time), we will have to
dismiss you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Want to know more? This is an area where it pays to be very,
very careful _ both to avoid lawsuits and to ensure that employees
are fairly treated.
</P>
<P>
   One excellent resource is ``The Employer's Legal Handbook'' by
Fred Steingold, available from Nolo Press at (800) 992-6656.
</P>
<P>
   Other relevant books are ``The American Bar Association Guide to
Workplace Law'' by Barbara J. Fick (Times Books) and ``Rightful
Termination'' by Ron Visconti and Richard Stiller, which is
available from Crisp Publications at (800) 442-7477. The California
Chamber of Commerce also sells a guidebook on hiring and
terminating employees, at (916) 444-6670.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; What's the point of having sick time or vacation time if
you can't use it? My wife's boss tells her she must ``clean her
desk'' before taking any time off. But there's never an end to the
work she's assigned. The boss complains when she tries to take even
a day or two off. The last time we took a long weekend, my wife got
a letter of reprimand in her file about delaying some project.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Before blaming the boss, consider whether your wife may be
responsible for part of the problem. Has she done enough to train
co-workers to carry the ball while she's gone? Does she organize
her work flow well enough to anticipate problems that could arise
during her time off?
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, does she know how to say ``no'' to her boss?
</P>
<P>
   It can be scary to say, ``I'm sorry, I can't take on this new
project right now because I have a vacation coming up.'' But it
certainly beats taking on the assignment and then flubbing it.
</P>
<P>
   Let's assume that your wife IS great at training colleagues,
organizing her work and saying ``no'' _ but the boss still grumbles
when she takes time off.
</P>
<P>
   Then, the problem may be that your wife's department is
chronically understaffed, suggests Gae Shulman, a small-business
consultant with the Portable Personnel Dept. in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Your wife should ask for a performance review to raise her
concerns, Shulman says. If her immediate boss isn't receptive, try
someone higher up the ladder or in human resources.
</P>
<P>
   ``She should talk about the job description and the company's
expectations of her work,'' Shulman said. ``She should also get a
sense of what's expected from the same job at other companies. It
may be that her boss doesn't realize it's time to add another staff
person.''
</P>
<P>
   There's yet another possibility. Your wife may simply be stuck
with an inflexible, endlessly demanding supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, her only recourse may be to start looking around
for a new job that allows room for a reasonable amount of time off.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR; OVERPAYMENT NOTE: Several weeks ago, I had an item about a
company that had overpaid its workers and was demanding the money
back. Karen Moffitt, a payroll tax analyst at Levi Strauss &AMP; Co.,
offers a tip to employees who have had to return overpayments: Make
sure the overpayment is not counted as part of your income in your
W-2 tax form at the end of the year. After all, you don't want to
pay taxes on money that you've had to give back.

FINDING CELLULAR CALLERS IN AN EMERGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo., Calif., Mo.)  (lb) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Silicon Valley start-up company has begun the
first public-safety trial of a system that will enable
cellular-telephone users to broadcast their locations to 911
emergency-system operators. It has implications, as well, for
commercial enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   The trial _ which is being undertaken by officials of the city
of Denver, Denver County and Adams County, Colo. _ uses special
software inside the cellular handset in combination with a central
office system employing global positioning, or GPS, technology to
determine a caller's location.
</P>
<P>
   In tests in the Denver area, the system is providing accuracy at
distances just over 100 yards, which permits dispatchers to make
better decisions on which public-safety officers should respond to
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   The software-based system was developed by Snaptrack Inc., a San
Jose, Calif.-based company whose approach differs in its
technological design from competing systems being developed by
companies like True Position, Grayson and Sirf Technology, another
Silicon Valley-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Snaptrack embeds software in the phone that takes advantage of a
specialized high-speed chip known as a digital signal processor, or
DSP. All cellular phones employ such chips, but in the Snaptrack
system, the cellular phone's software works in concert with a
central computer that provides additional processing and data to
improve accuracy in determining the phone's location and thus
improves emergency response time.
</P>
<P>
   There is now an industry-wide rush to develop technology for
cellular location detection because the Federal Communications
Commission has required that wireless carriers be able to provide
location information that is accurate within 125 meters _ 136.7
yards _ at least 67 percent of the time by October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Although the FCC's requirement created an instant market for the
technology, a number of commercial applications will follow,
including navigation systems and mobile yellow pages.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts worry that the commission's role in
creating the market may rush the development of a technology that
would otherwise be driven by new commercial applications as prices
drop for GPS receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market is very distorted because it's being driven by the
911 mandate,'' said Ira Brodsky, president of Datacomm Research, a
market research company just outside St. Louis. ``The problem is
that a lot of technology decisions are being made too early.''
</P>
<P>
   Each of the three competing technologies now being tested by
phone manufacturers and wireless carriers has competing strengths
and weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   For example, network-based approaches use software in the
cellular operator's equipment to triangulate the location of a
particular cellular phone by comparing the arrival times of signals
from three different cellular antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Such systems may represent the least expensive approach, and
have the advantage of working with existing cellular phones. But
they have raised privacy concerns because location information will
be held centrally within the wireless network. In addition, it is a
passive technology in that the phone company can locate the user
without his even knowing he is being tracked, as long as his phone
is turned on.
</P>
<P>
   ``Location is an important tool, but you're talking about your
physical person,'' said Ellen Kirk, vice president for marketing
and strategic planning at Snaptrack. ``That's information people
don't want to be collected or broadcast. It's a question of whose
finger is on the button.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In addition to beginning the public trial of its technology in
the Denver region, Snaptrack plans on Monday to announce that its
product will be adopted by a subsidiary of NTT, Japan's
telecommunications giant. The Snaptrack technology will be used
first in a wireless palm computer that the NTT unit plans to
introduce in the second quarter of next year.
</P>
<P>
   It will begin offering the feature in cellular phones sometime
in the second half of next year.
</P>
<P>
   Snaptrack is in a tightly competitive race with Sirf Technology,
which uses a global-positioning receiver chip to place the entire
information-tracking function inside a telephone or other consumer
appliance. Last week, Sirf announced deals with Nokia of Finland
and Ericcson of Sweden, the world's two largest makers of digital
cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   Seven wireless carriers _ Airtouch, Ameritech, Bell Mobility,
GTE, Primeco, Sprint PCS and U S West _ are jointly evaluating the
Snaptrack technology. VLSI Technology is the first chip vendor to
join the testing. Industry reports indicate that cellular-handset
vendors involved in the project include Denso, Hyundai, LG,
Motorola, Nokia and Samsung.
</P>
<P>
   Snaptrack officials said the strengths of their combination
handset and network approach included a cold-start location ability
of only seconds and more precise location accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   One of the principal limitations on GPS technology in the past
has been that the slow rate of data coming down from satellite
transmitters could result in waits as long as 15 minutes to
calculate a precise fix.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Snaptrack technology will use ground-based
transmitters to improve the accuracy of GPS data _ which is
intentionally degraded by the U.S. military _ the technology will
provide best-case location accuracy of five yards or so.

 &HT;    The newest rub for ritzy cars is having them hand-washed while
you socialize
 &HT;    By Jeffry Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Nothing seems so suddenly, and sudsily, chic as the
once-lowly car wash.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, holding a junk-bond portfolio was a sure mark of
affluence. Now it's having somebody hand-wash your quarterpanels in
public, while you nurse a latte.
</P>
<P>
   The International Carwash Association estimates there are 75,000
car washes in America, up 14 percent from a year ago, with $18.2
billion in annual sales.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta has 40 full-service car washes, not counting
scores of mechanical washers in the backs of gas stations and quick
marts.
</P>
<P>
   Nationally, what's spurring the boom, is the increased cost and
lifespan of cars, says Mark Thorsby, ICA's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next to a house, automobiles are Americans' biggest
investment,'' Thorsby says. ``And, 10 years ago the average length
of ownership was 3.2 years. Nowadays it's a little more than eight
years.''
</P>
<P>
   But for many car owners in a city proud of its reputation as
international and nouveau riche, maintaining the four-wheeled
investment may not be the prime motivation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a town where people need to impress each other,'' says
Suzanne Carter.
</P>
<P>
   Carter left her job as an IBM executive and last month bought
the Buckhead Detail Center, which she's begun to refurbish.
</P>
<P>
   She says she's washed just two cars in her life. She's a
marketer. And what she sees in Buckhead is a ripe customer base of
the overpaid and underwashed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their cars are an extension of their personality. They say:
`I'm a success,''' Carter says. ``So it helps if they're clean.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't always been that way. Once, car washing was simply a
chore that needed to be done, as quickly and cheaply if possible.
Even in Atlanta, some people still see it that way.
</P>
<P>
   At the Two Minit Car Wash in Midtown Atlanta , the emphasis is
on speed and price.
</P>
<P>
   The Two Minit is no hand-wash salon. Crews prep cars in the back
and towel-dry them in front, but the bulk of the cleaning is done
by machine. A basic wash takes _ you guessed it _ two minutes.
Cost: $9.95, dollars less than what chic hand-rub places charge.
</P>
<P>
   The Two Minit, which opened in 1955, is probably the city's
oldest car wash.
</P>
<P>
   But it's maybe the last place to be seen if you're concerned
about the scene.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we're about is a good wash in a reasonable amount of
time,'' says second-generation owner Paul Coleman. ``There's more
to life than standing around and staring at the walls of a car
wash.''
</P>
<P>
   At the new-generation car washes, such as Avril's Auto Boutique
in Buckhead, however, customers don't have to just stare. They can
also ogle. On sunny weekends, the outdoor deck takes on the
schmoozy air of a trendy restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Well-heeled customers sit under umbrellas, prop their feet up,
and sip gourmet coffee and juice while crews of mostly college kids
hand-wash and wax their four-wheeled darlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you could say there are bars to be seen in in
Buckhead,'' says Paula Rodgers, 34, on a recent Saturday, watching
her black Lexus SC400 being waxed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This would be the car wash to be seen in.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, like liposuction clinics or toenail salons, even the
fashionable places have something gritty and grotty to contend
with. Blaine Tyler, a manager at Avril's, recalls a customer a few
weeks ago who left her car windows open overnight.
</P>
<P>
   ``A possum crawled in the back seat and had babies,'' he says,
wincing. ``Have you ever smelled a stench like that? It was
unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Esposito Jr., owner of the 1-year-old Mammoth Hand Car
Wash/Detail Salon, says he often deals with the aftermath of
customers ``drinking all night and throwing up in their cars.'' He
recalls some exceptional cases as well: Once his crew had to buff
the scratches out of the finish of a brand-new Mercedes. ``The
owner's kids decided to clean the car for dad,'' says Esposito.
``Unfortunately, they used SOS pads.''
</P>
<P>
   With the proliferation of car washes has come a flood of
marketing gimmicks. The biggest trend is ``adding new profit
centers,'' says ICA's Thorsby, and those range from cellular phone
sales, to cappuccino bars, to fast food and dry cleaning.
</P>
<P>
   Carter is putting in an expensive sound system at her car wash
and will program it accordingly: ``Peaceful music on Sunday
mornings,'' she says. ``And Friday will be more festive.''
</P>
<P>
   Her plans also call for a coffee bar, Ferrari rentals and maybe
mini-massages for customers.
</P>
<P>
   Three months ago Avril's began offering a monthly Club Card for
$44.95, entitling members to an unlimited number of basic washes,
normally $18 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   The card has caught on maybe a little better than hoped. ``Some
people come in every other day,'' Tyler says. ``They'll want the
whole car washed because of a single bird dropping on the
windshield.''
</P>
<P>
   Two Minit's Coleman says he doesn't fret losing business to
fancy swabbie-come-latelys. A quick wash, he says, is like ``fast
food. There's a big demand.''

NEW BUYOUTS ARE OFFERED TO SLACKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Companies have long used voluntary employee buyouts as a way to
trim their workforces with a little less pain than outright
layoffs.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The downside? Sometimes, a company's best employees choose to
jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a small number of firms are experimenting with a new type
of buyout aimed at keeping star employees on board. In effect,
they're targeting their golden parachutes at workers who are poor
performers or just-plain-average performers.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor Co. is offering a generous buyout program to salaried
employees whom it considers underachievers.
</P>
<P>
   And Applied Materials in Santa Clara is in the middle of a
buyout based on a variety of factors _ including a worker's job
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are seeing performance mentioned more and more as a
criteria (in buyouts),'' said John Challenger, with the Chicago
outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray &AMP; Christmas. ``These firms
are doing what every company wants to do _ putting together a plan
to cut costs, limit legal exposure and target people who are the
bottom 10 percent performers.''
</P>
<P>
   Workforce experts note that performance-related buyouts remain
an unusual occurrence. The vast majority of firms offering buyouts
still target them at longtime workers close to retirement.
</P>
<P>
   Experts also caution that performance-related buyouts may create
some unintended and unwanted consequences for companies.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, disgruntled employees could sue for defamation or
discrimination if they feel unjustly targeted for a buyout offer.
Or morale among good employees could suffer if they view the
buyouts as an unfair reward for colleagues who never pulled their
own weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``People could see it as a `failure bonus' _ an incentive to be
a poor performer,'' said Charles King, an employee pay expert with
William M. Mercer in San Francisco. ``This could send a hell of a
message to people who are breaking their necks for the company and
feel underappreciated.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyouts first became common in the 1980s, when corporate mergers
and acquisitions fueled a nationwide wave of staffing cuts that
made the term ``downsizing'' a household word.
</P>
<P>
   Many big companies chose to reduce their ranks through voluntary
buyouts rather than forced layoffs. They saw buyouts as more humane
and less likely to lead to wrongful-termination lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical buyout, a company offers employees who agree to
bail out a package of incentives nicknamed a ``parachute.'' It may
include cash plus other perks, such as job-search help or continued
health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real sensible approach to start out with voluntary
reductions and, if you don't get enough takers, move to involuntary
reductions,'' said Mitchell Marks, a San Francisco management
consultant who specializes in transitions and downsizing. ``There
are hard business reasons, in that people who leave on good terms
are less likely to be litigious. It's also useful from a morale
perspective, with an eye on (continued loyalty from) the
`survivors.' ''
</P>
<P>
   While layoffs commonly are aimed at poor performers, voluntary
buyouts traditionally have been offered on a basis of age and
tenure _ focused on those people closest to retirement. For
instance, a company might offer buyouts to workers whose age and
years of service add up to 80 _ so a 55-year-old with 25 years on
the job would be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   But companies found that this sometimes cost them their most
motivated and skilled employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rule is that your best people take the windfall and go
find another job,'' Challenger said. ``You keep the mediocre
performers, who don't want to take the risk of leaving.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, some companies now try to design buyout plans that
take performance into account.
</P>
<P>
   William Hollett, a severance expert with the outplacement firm
of Drake Beam Morin, has set up about a half-dozen
performance-based buyouts in the past three years for clients.
</P>
<P>
   Hollett uses a system called ``forced rankings,'' in which
managers sit down and privately rank their employees in a range of
skills. Employees are given points for each skill. Then their
overall results are tallied up, and buyouts are offered to those
with the lowest total scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a little more creativity (than a traditional buyout)
to make sure there's no legal exposure, but it's worked well,''
Hollett said.
</P>
<P>
   Applied Materials, the world's largest semiconductor-equipment
manufacturer, started a performance-related buyout program in June
aimed at shedding 1,000 of the firm's 15,000 jobs by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Jeff Lettes declined to give details of the
buyout, which is Applied's first voluntary reduction.
</P>
<P>
   Lettes did say the company selected employees for the buyout on
several criteria _ their particular skills, job function, length of
service and ``relative historical contribution to company
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of that, Applied also considered the one-to-five rating
that it gives all employees during annual performance reviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we want to keep our best people,'' Lettes said.
``But we've got to weigh all these factors with an eye to best
serving our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Ford Motor Co. is putting the final touches on a
performance-based buyout that could eliminate several thousand of
the company's 53,000 nonunion U.S. employees.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford buyout made national headlines last month when an
internal memo was leaked to the press that said the company intends
to target ``low performers'' and ``average/solid employees with
limited potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford's program, which will be officially presented to employees
this fall, is likely to be fairly generous. The Detroit Free Press
reported that employees may receive up to 12 months' ``separation
allowance'' and insurance benefits, a two-year paid lease on a used
Ford vehicle, training or relocation money, cash bonuses and other
perks.
</P>
<P>
   Ford's effort also is particularly unusual in that it seems
aimed at eliminating some average employees as well as
below-average ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many of the folks will be very strong performers who have made
a strong contribution over a period of years,'' said Ford
spokeswoman Francine Romine-MacBride. ``But if there doesn't appear
to be any room for them to improve, this is an opportunity for them
to separate.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers wondered whether Ford was setting a
mathematically impossible, Lake Wobegon-like goal of a workforce
where 100 percent of the people are ``above average.''
</P>
<P>
   Others questioned whether employees who take the buyout will
find their future career prospects clouded.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who do go could face a stigma in the marketplace: `These
people were let go because they're underperformers,' '' said
Challenger.
</P>
<P>
   Observers also said Ford could open itself up to discrimination
lawsuits by relying on subjective criteria like performance rather
than objective ones like retirement eligibility or tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``When clients ask us about using performance as a criteria, we
caution them about the legal implications because I have yet to run
across a company that's 100 percent comfortable with its
performance-evaluation system,'' Hollett said.
</P>
<P>
   Romine-MacBride responded that Ford will use some other criteria
along with performance, such as eligibility for retirement. And she
said the program will be administered fairly and discretely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to walk down the hall and say, `You're a
loser; you're average; you're great _ everyone's who's below
average step forward,' '' Romine-MacBride said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People who try to apply somewhere else may face questions
about whether they were let go for low performance,'' she added.
``But through letters of reference, they can establish what their
strengths and accomplishments were.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Ford's program could end up as a national test case, with
employers around the country watching to see how it works.
</P>
<P>
   And if it does succeed, workers across America increasingly may
see the next round of golden handshakes going to the slacker or
sleeper down the hall.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, it makes good sense,'' said Rick Beal, a
compensation expert with Watson Wyatt Worldwide in San Francisco.
``If you have to cut, you'd always prefer not to take out the
people who are really good performers.''

SMART CARDS ON A ROLL IN GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER SINTON  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Visitors to any of McDonald's 870 outlets in Germany soon will be
able to load up on more than fries, shakes and a Big Mac.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Using technology provided in part by Hewlett-Packard subsidiary
VeriFone, they will be able to electronically download money from
their bank accounts onto plastic ``smart'' cards to quickly pay for
fast food.
</P>
<P>
   The German program, to be announced today, marks the broadest
deployment of smart cards that can be loaded with monetary value to
pay for purchases at a retail or restaurant chain.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a magnetic stripe, these cards are embedded with a
computer chip that can perform many functions, including storing
money, recording financial transactions and tracking frequent-buyer
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Smart cards have been tested in the United States at the Olympic
Games in Atlanta, selected stores in Manhattan and several other
sites including corporate and university campuses. But ``they have
not worked out in any way, shape or form,'' said Dataquest analyst
Allen Weiner.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Europe, smart cards are used to pay for parking,
transportation, phone calls and more. But in the United States,
people are attached to their money. They have not bought the
proposition that there is value not having change rattling around
in your pocket,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   One way to get U.S. consumers on the smart card bandwagon,
Weiner said, is to offer incentives like frequent-flier and other
loyalty programs.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is considering ``customer loyalty and incentive
program offers,'' but nothing has been finalized.
</P>
<P>
   Smart cards, though, are far more commonplace in Europe than in
America. In Germany, for example, the GeldKarte &UR;  &LR; smart card program
has distributed nearly 40 million smart cards since early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   However, users have had to go to banks to transfer monetary
value to their cards. But soon, they will be able to go to any
McDonald's, load value onto their cards at an ATM-like terminal and
then slide their cards through a VeriFone smart card reader to pay
for their meals.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program at 55 McDonald's Deutschland outlets earlier
this year registered 30,000 smart card transactions in the first 10
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect this implementation will help drive smart card
acceptance globally, as other restaurant and retail chains will
want to achieve the same speed of service, efficiencies, security
and marketing advantages McDonald's has today,'' said VeriFone
chief executive Robin Abrams.
</P>
<P>
   Palo Alto-based VeriFone has shipped more than 6 million
electronic-payment systems. Early this year, the Rite Aid drugstore
chain ordered 25,000 VeriFone smart card readers for 3,900 of its
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Although that contract is larger than the McDonald's deal, those
units could deduct purchases only from stored-value cards. They
could not connect with the customer's bank to be reloaded with
cash.

WHITE HOUSE WEIGHS SUING TOBACCO FIRMS FOR HEALTH COSTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (mk) 
 By ROBERT PEAR

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rebuffed by a federal court in their effort to
regulate tobacco products, Clinton administration officials said
Sunday that they were seriously considering lawsuits against
cigarette companies to recover money spent by the federal
government in treating smokers under Medicare and other federal
health programs.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Bob Graham, D-Fla., has repeatedly urged the administration
to file such lawsuits, but White House and Justice Department
officials expressed little interest until a comprehensive tobacco
bill died in the Senate in June.
</P>
<P>
   Now, officials from the White House, the Justice Department and
the Department of Health and Human Services said, they are
seriously considering lawsuits that would seek huge amounts in
damages, possibly tens of billions of dollars. The evolving
strategy was described Sunday in the The Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Rahm Emanuel, senior adviser to President Clinton, said Clinton
``has ordered a top-to-bottom review of the options for federal
lawsuits to recover Medicare costs, the costs we've incurred under
Medicare for tobacco-related illnesses.'' Emanuel said, ``We want
to see if we can recoup these costs, just as some states have won
reimbursement for their Medicaid costs.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for the elderly and disabled.
Medicaid provides care to low-income people.
</P>
<P>
   Another White House official said that federal agencies were
collecting data and information needed for lawsuits against the
tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials are considering similar lawsuits to recover
the federal cost of treating smoking-related illnesses under
veterans' health programs, the Federal Employees Health Benefits
Program and health insurance programs for military personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for five major tobacco companies,
said he had no immediate comment on the possibility of a lawsuit.
But a consultant to the tobacco industry said: ``Federal officials
have known the health effects of cigarette consumption and have
required warning labels for many years. For them to come in now and
say they want to recover damages, after that long involvement,
would be a very difficult case to make.''
</P>
<P>
   A federal health official said that a lawsuit was ``not by any
means our first choice as a course of action.'' Administration
officials said they still hoped Congress would pass a bill raising
cigarette prices and affirming the government's authority to
regulate tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, in Richmond,
Va., ruled that the Food and Drug Administration had no such
authority because Congress never intended that the agency regulate
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Several Justice Department lawyers are working full time on the
issue, trying to identify the strongest arguments to make in
lawsuits against the five big tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   One question, lawyers said, is how to prove the amount of
illness caused by the products of each tobacco company. The
question could be complicated by the fact that some smokers say
they do not remember what brands they smoked, or smoked several
brands. Government lawyers said they hoped to use a ``market
share'' theory, under which each company's responsibility for
smoking-related illnesses would be proportional to its share of the
cigarette market.
</P>
<P>
   Graham has drafted legislation that could help the government by
depriving tobacco companies of some of their legal defenses _ for
example, the argument that smokers contributed to their illnesses
by smoking after they knew the risks. Florida adopted such a
measure, overriding the defenses normally available to defendants
under common law, and that apparently spurred the tobacco companies
to agree to an $11 billion settlement with the state last year.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Graham said he might offer such legislation as an
amendment to appropriations bills next month.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation authorizes an ``injured party'' to sue tobacco
companies for costs incurred in treating tobacco-related illnesses.
Justice Department officials have suggested that ``injured party''
be defined broadly to include Medicare, Medicaid, the Department of
Veterans' Affairs, the Indian Health Service and military health
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials said they did not know if such
legislation was needed. And they could face risks if they
explicitly urged Congress to pass it. For if Congress did not
approve the measure and if the Justice Department filed suit
anyway, the administration would have exposed weaknesses in its
litigation strategy. In other words, tobacco companies could argue,
why would Clinton seek legislation to authorize such lawsuits if
the government already had the right to recover damages, as it
contends?
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers are also studying the use of civil
fraud and racketeering laws as a basis for claims.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they are examining a 1962 law, the Medical Care
Recovery Act, which says the government may recover ``the
reasonable value'' of care and treatment it furnishes to a person
who is injured or suffers a disease as a result of someone else's
negligence. Under this law, the government has recovered the cost
of medical and hospital care provided to members of the armed
services injured in auto accidents.

STARTUP LEAGUE WANTS TO PAY ATHLETES TO PLAY COLLEGE BALL 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Babson College accounting professor Paul McMann has an idea whose
time has come.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Collegiate athletes should get paid to play sports. The
provocative concept is the cornerstone of McMann's proposal for a
new league that melds education with vocation.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Collegiate Professional Basketball League, the
minor-league startup is a refreshingly thoughtful attempt to create
a system that doesn't leave athletes out in the cold long after
their college eligibility has run dry. In fact, less than 40
percent of Division I men basketball players graduate from college.
</P>
<P>
   Under the current system, where our nation's universities have
become de facto farm systems for major-league professional sports
franchises, ``the kids are being taking advantage of and, too
often, they walk away with nothing,'' says McMann, a CPA who once
was a Bay Area employee of then-World Savings.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's not exactly the kind of story line that would
emanate from the press office of the National Collegiate Athletic
Association, the autocratic administrative body that is responsible
for the hypocritical system that exploits college athletes today.
</P>
<P>
   Oh sure, college hoopsters get tuition and room and board for
four years. But playing big-time college basketball is a full-time
job that is nearly year-round, requiring players to miss classes
and cram for final exams in between television interviews and
weight-training sessions.
</P>
<P>
   University athletic departments reap millions of dollars a year
in revenues from television rights, gate receipts and licensing
fees that aren't allowed to trickle down to athletes in even the
most innocuous ways, thanks to ill-conceived NCAA policies.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that less than 1 percent of all college basketball
players make it in the National Basketball Association, there is an
alarmingly high number of ex-basketball players that leave college
without employable skills.
</P>
<P>
   McMann hopes to change that. His league would recruit
college-eligible players and pay them $9,000 a year and give them a
$5,000 signing bonus. Plus, the player would receive free tuition,
room and board for _ not four _ but eight years.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, each player would be required to attend eight
weeks of college classes during the off-season at the University of
Maryland Eastern Shore, an accredited state-run college whose
former president sits on the CPBL's board.
</P>
<P>
   If the player wants to attend a trade school or another
university in addition to the Maryland university, the league will
pay for that as well.
</P>
<P>
   There are incentives, too. Players who complete a degree in four
years would get an additional $10,000 bonus, while those who get
their sheepskin in less than eight years would receive an extra
$2,500.
</P>
<P>
   But what's in it for McMann?
</P>
<P>
   As a business professor for a leading institution well known for
breeding entrepreneurs, this is a chance for McMann to practice
what he has been preaching and start his own company.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he says he has a chance to build a business that
can invoke some positive change. ``I want the kids to get an
education, and we'll provide them with the support system for him
to do that,'' McMann says.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But before we explore the innovative particulars of McMann's
new league, what's the investment angle here?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the school teacher needs to raise cash. With a wife and
two young kids at home in Massachusetts, the professor has put his
money where his mouth is. He has bankrolled the first year of his
startup with savings and credit cards, spending about $300,000 to
date.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has hat in hand. There are two basic ways to take stake
in the CPBL: as an investor or a corporate sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   The league is hoping to land some major equity partners,
concentrating on institutional investors, high net-worth
individuals and corporate partners.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the CPBL would like to lure one to three major
stakeholders who are willing to invest a total of $18 million for
significant equity stakes, says investment banker Richard
Josephberg, a former Goldman, Sachs analyst who is a principal of
his own boutique firm: Josephberg Grosz in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Josephberg says he's talking to fund managers, sports team
investors, entertainment and media companies, and high-net-worth
individuals with a penchant for supporting the advancement of
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping to attract investors who, of course, are looking
to make a substantial economic return,'' but also appreciate ``the
overriding consideration of helping educate the underprivileged,''
Josephberg says.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a slam dunk because potential investors want to know if
McMann can recruit quality players and whether Corporate America
will sign on as sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   The CPBL is based on a marketing-driven business model where
everything from the naming rights of the league are for sale ($5
million for five years) to the names of the teams ($400,000 a
year).
</P>
<P>
   Here's how it would work:
</P>
<P>
   The CPBL is a combination of a European sports league and
minor-league baseball.
</P>
<P>
   At first, the league would have eight teams that play in
moderate-sized arenas during the traditional basketball season on
Saturdays and Sundays. Ticket prices are expected to average about
$7.50 a seat, attempting to make it affordable for families.
Remember: Revenues would be driven by advertising, not gate
receipts.
</P>
<P>
   There are no franchises. The league owns all of the teams, and
the rosters are established by the league's director of operations,
former Golden State Warrior Alfred ``Butch'' Beard. Other former
NBA notables involved with the league are M.L. Carr, who is a
consultant, and JoJo White, who is director of player personnel.
</P>
<P>
   The key will be obtaining television and cable television
exposure, which the league will pay for in the beginning if it
must, McMann says.
</P>
<P>
   League officials met with representatives of a major television
company, which was seriously interested in doing a deal with the
CPBL. But not enough of the building blocks were in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``The league is a nontraditional form of advertising, and I
think they need a marketing powerhouse'' on board before some of
the pieces fall together, says an executive with the company who
requested anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there are significant risks in an unproven sports
league. For one, the NCAA eventually could change its policies and
begin to pay players. Or a major media company or marketing firm
could start its own league.
</P>
<P>
   Barriers to entry aren't that high, and competitors already are
forming new leagues _ such as the International Basketball League.
But the IBL is different in that it doesn't require its players to
go to college.
</P>
<P>
   Education could be one of the CPBL's biggest selling points
among young athletes and their parents. Another strength is its
board of directors, consisting of a solid mix of academicians,
politicians, business people and professional sports figures,
including Chairman George Mikan, a former Minneapolis Lakers star,
coach and general manager. Mikan also served as the first
commissioner of the American Basketball Association, which
eventually merged with the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   The board also includes Bill Gates (no, not the software
magnate), one of the co-stars of the documentary ``Hoop Dreams.''
In addition, Oakland's Audrey Rice Oliver, former mayoral candidate
and chief executive of Integrated Business Solutions, also is a
director.
</P>
<P>
   Oliver thinks that, if given a chance, the league could make a
profound impact on America's youth. ``We need to change the way we
look at sports. There are too many kids who are good ball players
but never get the opportunity to play,'' she says. ``Their
education is the key to their survival.''

FEARS OF VIOLENCE BY ISLAMIC MILITANTS SPUR DIPLOMATS' EVACUATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EMBASSYBOMBS-KENYA and EMBASSYBOMBS-RDP) 
(js) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIRANA, Albania _ Guarded by marines, American diplomats were
removed from here on Sunday in the face of fears of a possible
terrorist attack on the U.S. Embassy by Islamic militants.
</P>
<P>
   The worries were fueled not only by the bombings of the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, but also by a wave of arrests of
Egyptians suspected of links to the militant Islamic Jihad movement
in Egypt. That movement is, in turn, linked to a prime suspect in
the African bombings, the Saudi financier Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   At least five Islamic militants have been arrested here in seven
weeks. In the latest arrest, on Thursday, an Islamic Jihad member
could face execution in Cairo.
</P>
<P>
   At the beginning of August, the group, one of whose splinter
cells assassinated President Anwar el-Sadat in 1981, promised
retaliation against the United States, which it faulted for the
arrests.
</P>
<P>
   That threat was made shortly before the bombings of the
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that left at least 257 dead and
thousands injured, although it is not known whether the blasts were
directly related to the threat.
</P>
<P>
   But it is known that the leader of the Egyptian group, Ayman
al-Zawahry, has close ties with bin Laden and is believed to be
operating with him from hideouts in Afghanistan. Bin Laden, who
fought the Soviets in Afghanistan alongside Islamic guerrillas, has
been building a worldwide terrorist network, Western intelligence
officials said, to wage what he calls a ``holy war against the Jews
and the Crusaders.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who were arrested come from a growing body of Islamic
fundamentalist proselytizers, largely from Egypt and Saudi Arabia,
who have recently arrived here trying to spread their faith by,
among other activities, offering to set up village schools or
medical centers in this poverty-stricken land crippled by years of
Communist isolation. Most Albanians are Muslim, a heritage of the
Ottoman Empire. The Islamic recruiting drive comes at a time when
the the mostly Muslim ethnic Albanians in the neighboring Serbian
province of Kosovo are losing a fight for independence against the
Orthodox Christian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   Most of those seized here belong to the Islamic Revival
Foundation, which describes itself as a charitable group.
</P>
<P>
   An Islamic organization in London reported that a man named
Ahmad Ismail Ossman was arrested on the street here on Thursday and
faced extradition to Egypt, where he is wanted in connection with
an assassination attempt on former Prime Minister Atef Sebki.
Ossman had been sentenced in absentia to death by an Egyptian court
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Ossman was described as ``a volunteer who went to Albania to
help the people,'' by Yasser al-Serri, the president of the Islamic
Observation Center in London, who reported the arrest. Serri
himself is also wanted in Egypt in connection with the attempt on
Sebki. He denies any connection.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The arrests began on June 28 when Interior Ministry police
raided an apartment here, seizing two Egyptians and discovering
apparently official stamps from the Interior Ministry's criminal
police division, customs border crossing posts and the Tirana Bar
Association, along with weapons and ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   The suspects at first appeared to be placed under house arrest
and asked to leave the country. But at the airport they were
handcuffed by Egyptian officials and taken to Cairo. Albanian
officials identified them as Maget Muhamet Mustafa and Muhamet
Rexhap Houda, but said they had used several different names here.
</P>
<P>
   Less is known about the two subsequent arrests. One man was
identified as Mohammed Hamid Hasan Mahmud. The other was Ahmed
Ibrahaim el-Naggar, whom the authorities here said was the
propaganda chief of Islamic Jihad and had been condemned to death
in Cairo last October for plotting to kill Egyptian officials as
well as plotting to revive the outlawed movement.
</P>
<P>
   Albanian newspapers on Sunday contained fragmentary accounts of
detentions of other Egyptians, including three trying to leave the
country by ferry near the town of Durres.
</P>
<P>
   The hulking tan stucco American embassy building was empty on
Sunday. An Albanian teen-ager in an olive T-shirt and a beret and
carrying a worn AK-47 rifle was posted outside its locked gate.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles up the road, the handful of remaining American
diplomats were under guard in their gated residential compound.
Outside the compound's walls, local women, kerchiefs over their
heads, poked at peasant gardens.
</P>
<P>
   A company of marines from the 22nd Marine Expeditionary Unit
aboard the U.S.S. Austin was called in Friday night, breaking off
from a planned NATO exercise in the area to protect the embassy,
the commander of the operation, Maj. Frank Carroll, said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither the marines nor embassy spokespeople would say how many
diplomats left on Sunday. Dependents and nonessential personnel
were evacuated on Friday.

   DuPont May Be Seeking to Sell All of Conoco
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which in May announced plans to sell 20 percent of its
Conoco oil subsidiary to the public, may be looking to sell the
whole thing. Elf Aquitaine, the French oil company, wants to buy
Conoco for $24 billion, according to a report in a London
newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes less than a week after British Petroleum said
it would buy Amoco for $48.2 billion in stock and cash, setting off
speculation that more midsized oil companies may merge so they can
hold down costs in an era of cheap oil.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After interrogating President Clinton's wife,
friends and closest political allies, Kenneth Starr's prosecutors
on Monday confront Clinton himself, the ultimate target of an
inquiry that began four years ago with an Arkansas land deal that
few Americans could fathom and became a sex scandal most Americans
say they would rather forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office has been resolutely secretive
about the approach it will use in questioning under oath a
president with enormous popular resilience and a penchant for
hairsplitting. But lawyers familiar with the case say some hints
about the possible character of the questioning can be gleaned from
the roller coaster ride of the past seven months, when Starr's
inquiry abruptly shifted from the Whitewater real estate venture to
a chatty, love-struck former intern named Monica Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that the prosecutors come to the interrogation
steeled by a sense of the Clinton presidency as a recurring pattern
of evasion, coverup and concealment. They suggest that the
questioners are unlikely to be intimidated by Clinton's office.
They suggest that Starr will come fortified with questions about
allegations of obstruction of justice, ranging well beyond the
intimate details of sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the prosecutors' decision to turn their attention
to the president's alleged sexual appetites may have seemed like a
radical, even desperate, departure from Starr's mandate. But it was
less of a leap for Starr. His many tentacled investigation, which
first focused on events when Clinton was governor of Arkansas,
evolved through the 1992 election campaign and continued into his
presidency, already focused on whether Clinton's intimates had
sought to suppress information by giving less than forthright
accounts or covering up questionable behavior.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Starr and some of his associates, the allegations of evasive
and deceitful behavior in the Lewinsky case were part of a pattern
they believed they had found in Whitewater, the White House travel
office episode, the death of White House deputy counsel Vincent
Foster and related matters.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Lewinsky matter, the independent counsel's
staff of more than 40 prosecutors and investigators was sharply
divided, the lawyers disclosed, over how to handle the allegations
that Clinton had sex with the intern and conspired criminally to
conceal the encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors wanted to give Ms. Lewinsky immunity
immediately and quickly deliver a report to Capitol Hill solely on
the allegations surrounding her alleged affair with the president,
according to the lawyers. Others argued for a much more painstaking
approach, in which the grand jury would subpoena every possible
witness or document, assemble a detailed narrative that could
confirm Ms. Lewinsky's story and also draw parallels to alleged
obstruction of justice investigated in the earlier inquiries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr, the deliberative former judge, who made the
decision. A man with no prosecutorial experience and a tendency to
ponder, Starr ultimately sided with those who wanted to squeeze out
every last bit of evidence about the president's relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, setting the stage for a climactic showdown that poses
a threat of impeachment or a sullied place in history for Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters, Starr has conducted his inquiry as an
old-fashioned, white-collar criminal investigation _ a meticulous
search for facts and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was your typical, very plodding, very methodical criminal
investigation that moved toward gathering evidence that gets you
closer and closer to your ultimate target,'' said Barbara Olson, a
Washington lawyer who is a defender of Starr's. ``If you can't get
witnesses to cooperate _ and only one has cooperated here _ then
you get evidence any way you can, and you take as long as it takes,
and you don't worry about what anybody thinks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to his considerable number of detractors, Starr's decisions
are those of an obsessed inquisitor desperately grasping for
something, anything, that can help him land a blow against a
frustratingly elusive adversary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could possibly perceive Ken Starr as `independent' at this
point?'' asked Nancy Luque, a former federal prosecutor who faults
Starr for lack of discretion in his zeal as independent counsel.
``He has so much riding on his report, a battle to the death. His
ability to continue with credibility in this town hangs on his
ability to get a scalp.''

<P>
   Starr Seeks to Expand Inquiry
</P>
<P>
   The events that will bring Starr to the White House Monday were
set in motion well before Clinton became president. During the 1992
campaign, The New York Times published an article describing the
involvement of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater
Development Co. and the role of their partner, James McDougal, an
Arkansas ally who had once run a failed savings and loan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That article prompted federal regulators to look more closely at
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, and they emerged with suspicions
of criminality in 1993, possibly by the president or his wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fiske was named independent counsel to investigate, and
Starr took over in August 1994. His mandate quickly came to include
investigation of the suicide of Vincent Foster, a White House
deputy counsel, as well as charges that Webster Hubbell, the
associate attorney general, had bilked the Rose law firm in Little
Rock, Ark., where he and Hillary Clinton had worked before coming
to Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the inquiry ground on, the career prosecutors who had been
enlisted in the case became convinced that the Clinton camp was
thwarting their work.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Records of Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison Guaranty, which had
been under subpoena for several years but could not be found,
suddenly turned up in a White House room near the area where the
president resides. Companies with ties to Clinton paid Hubbell
hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees, just as
Hubbell faced a prison sentence and prosecutors were pressuring him
to cooperate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so when Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend,
approached Starr on Jan. 12 of this year with her surreptitiously
recorded tapes and allegations that the president had an affair in
the White House and tried to cover it up, lawyers say Starr's
office saw it as the latest episode in an ongoing pattern of
duplicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators immediately seized on the purported role of Vernon
Jordan, Clinton's close confident, in counseling Ms. Lewinsky and
helping her find a job in New York after she was called as a
witness in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit. Jordan is a
director of Revlon, the company that had hired Hubbell as a
consultant and had agreed to hire Ms. Lewinsky before the
allegations became public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before they went to the Justice Department, investigators
placed a hidden tape recorder on Mrs. Tripp, who recorded Ms.
Lewinsky making further statements about the effort to keep secret
her relationship with Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that, Starr felt he had enough to seek a broadening of his
mandate. And there was something more, the lawyers have now
disclosed, that hinted at a coverup and played a role in the
decision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say that Mrs. Tripp told investigators that when she had
worked as a White House secretary in the counsel's office, she saw
a memorandum with a notation by Hillary Rodham Clinton related to
the dismissal of the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had never seen such a document, suggesting the possibility
that evidence in a case he was investigating had been destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never cited publicly, the alleged missing memorandum became an
important element in Starr's argument to the Justice Department
that there was a multifaceted White House pattern of obstructing
justice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Starr presented the ``talking points'' document, which
Mrs. Tripp told prosecutors Ms. Lewinsky had given her to shape her
testimony in the Paula Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky now says she wrote
the document and had no help from anyone in the White House,
according to those familiar with her account.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Acts Quickly to Appoint Counsel
</P>
<P>
   For Attorney General Janet Reno, the decision to enlarge Starr's
inquiry was easy. She and five or six career and political
appointees agreed: Allegations of subornation of perjury and
obstruction of justice in a case in which the president is being
investigated was more than enough to meet the standard set by the
independent counsel statute of a ``conflict of interest'' for Ms.
Reno to conduct the inquiry, several lawyers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Jan. 16, they agreed that the case had to be
referred to an independent counsel. The only decision left was
whether it should be given to Starr. As one Justice Department
official put it, ``We knew that the president's deposition was the
following day and that it could take weeks for a new independent
counsel to be named. There was no time. And we didn't want people
to think we dragged our feet to help the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the Justice Department had just decided that an
independent counsel would not be appointed to investigate campaign
fund-raising calls from the White House by the president and Vice
President Al Gore. They were especially sensitive to criticism that
the Justice Department had made that decision to protect Clinton
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of first hearing about Monica Lewinsky, Ms. Reno
referred the matter to a three-judge panel, recommending that the
inquiry be led by Starr. The panel quickly agreed.

</P>
<P>
   The Long Delay Over Immunity Issue
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of the inquiry last January, the most
contentious arguments inside Starr's office had to do with Monica
Lewinsky. Some prosecutors wanted to make a deal with her _
immediately. Others wanted to wait. A few others wanted to indict
her, and use the threat of jail to make her talk.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, within hours of getting jurisdiction, Starr's
prosecutors confronted Ms. Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in a
Washington suburb. They made her an offer that symbolized the
aggressiveness of the office: In return for complete immunity from
prosecution, they asked her to help them secretly record
conversations with the president and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   She steadfastly refused, saying she did not want to do to anyone
else what Mrs. Tripp had done to her. Within several days, Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyer, William Ginsburg, made a ``proffer'' of what Ms.
Lewinsky was willing to testify to: She said she had a sexual
relationship with Clinton, but that he did not encourage her to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors were convinced that while Ms. Lewinsky was
trying to get herself out of trouble, she also wanted to protect
the president. A second proffer was made in early February. It
added details, and included an admission that she and Clinton had
discussed cover stories to conceal their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Two prosecutors, according to a Starr ally, advocated accepting
that proffer and concluding the inquiry within 60 days by sending a
report to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But several senior prosecutors prevailed by arguing that the
inquiry should continue and not rely solely on the word of Ms.
Lewinsky, which could easily end in a ``he said-she said'' case.
</P>
<P>
   The office would not seal a deal with Ms. Lewinsky until July
27, after five more months of inquiry that heard from nearly 75
witnesses. When Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury on
Aug. 6, it is not known whether she added any more information than
she had initially provided in her February proffer.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for Ms. Lewinsky to sit down with
prosecutors in late July, she was stunned at how much information
they had. ``They knew everything,'' Ms. Lewinsky told a friend. And
her immunity deal mandated that she tell the whole truth, or face
charges of perjury. A friend said, ``She held nothing back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wide Sweep for Witnesses
</P>
<P>
   The standoff over immunity allowed Clinton's partisans to shift
the fight to the political arena, where they had a considerable
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's approval ratings tumbled toward single digits, his
prosecutors fought back, hauling before the grand jury White House
officials they believed were bad-mouthing the investigation. This
backfired, giving Starr's critics fresh ammunition to attack him as
an abuser, not a defender, of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting creamed,'' a ranking Starr assistant conceded
last March.
</P>
<P>
   At least one decision that was roundly criticized at the time as
a public relations fiasco appears to have paid off. Armed with
several allusions on Mrs. Tripp's tape, the prosecutors subpoened
Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis broke down under the questions and was portrayed by
Clinton defenders as a victim of sex-obsessed prosecutors
pruriently prying into confidences between mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, Ms. Lewinsky had given her mother a
missing piece of evidence, according to those familiar with her
account _ a dress that is being tested at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for DNA evidence that could link it to the president.
That made Ms. Lewis vulnerable to a possible charge of obstruction
of justice, and gave Ms. Lewinsky more incentive to strike a deal
with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Faces Questions
</P>
<P>
   As they were closing the deal with Ms. Lewinsky and her mother,
prosecutors made another important decision: They issued a grand
jury subpoena for testimony from the president of the United
States. The subpoena was never acknowledged by the White House
until the day it was withdrawn and it was announced that the
president would testify voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 10 days that Clinton had the subpoena, Starr made
several bold moves and won several important legal victories. He
forced members of the White House Secret Service detail and Bruce
Lindsey, the president's closest confidant, to testify before the
grand jury. His ethics adviser, Sam Dash, meanwhile, was pushing
hard to wrap up the inquiry and arrange for an immunity deal for
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, the day Clinton's subpoena ordered him to appear
before the grand jury, Ms. Lewinsky, who by now had cut her ties
with Ginsburg and hired new lawyers, stunned Washington with the
announcement that she and her mother had been granted full immunity
for her testimony. News reports said that Ms. Lewinsky would
testify about a sexual relationship. The following day, David
Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, announced that the
president, too, would testify on Aug. 17 from the White House via
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers have said that he is considering
acknowledging that he had sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, a
concession that might deflate talk of impeachment. But prosecutors
are certain to question Clinton about more than sex, and those
answers could prove more significant to the outcome of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They will ask the president if he urged Ms. Lewinsky to return
gifts he had given her after they had been subpoenaed by the Jones
lawyers. They will also ask whether the president had anything to
do with efforts to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York and whether
the efforts to find her a job were made in order to keep her from
truthfully testifying in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a cliche that this investigation was never about
sex, but it really isn't,'' said Barbara Olsen, the Starr partisan.
``It's always been about lies and coverups.''

GOVERNMENT AND REBELS PREPARE FOR BATTLE OVER CAPITAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo _ After several days of relative quiet in their
brief war, both the government and rebel forces here began furious
preparations on Sunday for what each side expects to be a critical
fight for control of this capital city.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels, who independent witnesses on Sunday said are already
firmly in control of the strategic western port city of Matadi and
the nearby Inga Dam, have reportedly cut off fuel and most food
supplies to Kinshasa and are gathering about 150 miles west of the
city.
</P>
<P>
   Vowing to fight to the end, despite a string of major reversals,
the government of President Laurent Kabila said that it had rushed
about 8,000 recently trained troops from a southern military base
toward the capital, where large shipments of weaponry have been
steadily arriving.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-minute effort to shore up his positions, Kabila
reportedly flew to the Angolan capital Sunday for meetings with
that neighboring country's president, Jose Eduardo dos Santos.
Kabila was expected to plead for heavy direct support against the
insurgency.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila returned to Kinshasa Sunday evening, and heavy security
was in force along the route he took from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The president had spent the last several days in Lubumbashi,
capital of his native southern Katanga region. With the rebels
known to be advancing, his absence from this city was seen by many
as a sign of imminent defeat, at least here.
</P>
<P>
   The question of Angola's position in the war _ which pits
Congolese mutineers backed by Rwanda's experienced military
planners and generous logistical support against a larger but
disorganized and poorly trained government army _ has been seen as
critical to the outcome since the war's start two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since the capture of the far western military base at Kitona by
the rebels on Aug. 4, the rebels have deployed large jet transport
planes apparently financed by Rwanda to mass thousands of their
troops in preparation for an assault on the capital.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, Congolese officials and foreign businesspeople
have said that Angola had begun providing heavy air cargo support
to the Congolese army, and had also promised to make available to
Kabila a group of several thousand longtime Congolese exiles, known
as the Katangese Gendarmes, who are veterans of Angola's own
prolonged civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila would undoubtedly like an even more dramatic Angolan
intervention, such as the use of its powerful air force, which was
decisively deployed last June in support of a protagonist in a
civil war in Brazzaville, capital of the neighboring Congo
Republic.
</P>
<P>
   According to African diplomats in this region, Angola
disapproves of Rwanda's second armed intervention in Congolese
politics in as many years, feeling that the east African country is
destabilizing the entire region. It was unclear, however, if
Angola, whose relations with Kabila have been unsteady, would want
to commit its forces heavily in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   With reports from residents and journalists in the west of the
country confirming the worst, Kabila's advisers have dropped the
pretense that the government still controls Matadi, and the crucial
hydroelectric dam at Inga, which supplies the capital and much of
the region with electricity.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them maintained, nonetheless, an air of striking
confidence on Sunday, despite what would appear to be a dire
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not without friends too, and the Rwandans risk learning
that at their expense'' said one of Kabila's senior associates.
``We have begun getting weapons from a lot of places. We have air
transport now, and we have lots of men.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can survive the next couple of days, this will turn into
a debacle for the enemy.''
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's adviser's timetable seemed to accord with recent rebel
claims that insurgents would take Kinshasa as early as Tuesday. In
apparent anticipation of a final push around that date, Washington
closed its embassy here on Saturday for the first time in this
country's turbulent history.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The closing of the embassy has only heightened anxieties here,
among both remaining foreigners and Congolese, of an unprecedented
battle for Kinshasa. Perhaps inadvertently, it also highlighted an
eerie, almost total lack of high-level international diplomacy in
this crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, and much of the West, seemed to approve of a
previous Rwandan-led intervention here that overthrew the longtime
dictator Mobutu Sese Seko and placed the little-known Kabila in
power in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   With a similar Rwandan operation under way now, however, much of
the outside world seems to have washed its hands of the situation,
neither strongly condemning a foreign-sponsored uprising in
Africa's third-largest country, nor supporting Kabila, nor even
pressing for a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why everyone is leaving all at once,'' said
Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi, Kabila's Cabinet director. ``If they
know something special, let them say it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government frantically prepared for a final siege as the
rebels, perhaps sensing imminent victory, began cobbling together a
political organization, which they called the Congolese Rally for
Democracy at a news conference at their provisional eastern capital
of Goma.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is composed of political dissidents, former
senior figures from the Mobutu era and politicians who are known to
be close to the leaders of Rwanda and Uganda, both of which
sponsored Kabila's earlier uprising and appear supportive of the
current one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have called it a rally because we want to bring together
all the Congolese, all of the forces fighting against dictatorship
that are determined to eradicate its roots once and for all,'' said
the organization's leader, Ernest Wamba dia Wamba.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The president's senior advisers late Sunday secured
his agreement to acknowledge to a federal grand jury on Monday that
he engaged in an inappropriate physical relationship with Monica
Lewinsky, but he will deny that he counseled her or anyone else to
lie about their relationship, said an adviser familiar with the
preparations for Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The president will assert that he did not commit perjury in an
earlier sworn deposition in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit, when he denied having ``sexual relations'' or an
``affair'' with Ms. Lewinsky, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser cautioned that Clinton could change his strategy at
the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   But prosecutors are seeking more than a presidential admission
of extramarital sexual activity, said lawyers involved in the case.
Prosecutors from the office of the Whitewater independent counsel,
Kenneth Starr, have spent the past seven months investigating
whether Clinton engaged in obstruction of justice, subornation of
perjury or witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The president is expected to face detailed questions on those
allegations based on testimony from dozens of grand jury witnesses,
said the lawyers. Nothing could be learned Sunday about how Clinton
intends to address those questions, but in the past he has
vehemently denied any effort to silence witnesses or otherwise
impede the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is considering a brief address to the nation following
his grand jury testimony, said a senior White House official. Such
a statement likely would come at 9 p.m. or later and be broadcast
from the White House residence rather than the Oval Office, the
official said. The official added that Clinton will not decide
whether to speak publicly until after his testimony has ended.
</P>
<P>
   The president's approach to his grand jury appearance emerged at
the end of a weekend of painstaking preparations for his testimony
on Monday, a fateful date with his political and historic destiny.
</P>
<P>
   He took a late morning break from his consultations with his
lawyers to attend church with his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
Their daughter, Chelsea, did not accompany them. Clinton, clutching
a Bible in one hand and Mrs. Clinton's hand in the other, waved to
onlookers as he entered the Foundry United Methodist Church near
the White House, but neither of the Clintons spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The only official word from the group cloistered with the
president was a four-sentence statement from Clinton's lead private
attorney, David Kendall, who attempted to hold back a flood of what
he called ``groundless speculation'' about the president's Monday
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is the truth. Period,'' Kendall said. ``And that's
how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   A White House official said that the president was ``confident''
that he was fully prepared for Monday's appearance. ``He knows
exactly what he is going to say, which is the truth,'' the official
said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and his lawyers have spent seven months throwing up a
succession of barriers in the form of privilege claims and
rebuffing numerous requests from Starr that Clinton appear
voluntarily for questioning.
</P>
<P>
   But beginning at 1 p.m. in the White House Map Room, the
president will be confronted by a team of experienced prosecutors
armed with testimony and documents from scores of witnesses, from
the lead agent of Clinton's Secret Service detail to the steward
who brings Clinton his Diet Cokes.
</P>
<P>
   He will become the first sitting president to appear before a
criminal grand jury investigating his actions. He agreed to testify
only after Starr issued a subpoena on July 17 compelling his
appearance, although the subpoena was withdrawn 10 days later when
Clinton agreed to ``voluntarily'' appear on a closed-circuit
television link to the grand jury room in the federal courthouse
here.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about how Clinton will deal with questions about an
alleged sexual affair with Ms. Lewinsky has consumed Washington for
days. But Starr's prosecutors are expected to pursue other lines of
inquiry on Monday that go beyond Clinton's sexual behavior and into
areas that they believe point to allegations of more serious
offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky became the center of Starr's inquiry earlier this
year not because the independent counsel was embarked on an
examination of the President's sex life, lawyers involved in the
inquiry said, but because her story appeared to fit a pattern of
denial and obstruction that Starr had seen in four years of
investigating the multi-faceted Whitewater case.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past several weeks, prosecutors have been preparing
detailed questions about the president's numerous White House
meetings with Ms. Lewinsky, his advice to her on how to testify in
the Jones suit and whether the two of them discussed ways to
conceal evidence of their relationship from Mrs. Jones' attorneys.
</P>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors say they were particularly struck by the efforts
made by Clinton, his secretary, Betty Currie, and Vernon Jordan, a
prominent Washington lawyer and close confidant of the president's,
to find employment for Ms. Lewinsky after she had been subpoenaed
to appear in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors are expected to ask Clinton to explain those
job-hunting efforts, as well as the 37 visits Ms. Lewinsky made to
the White House after she was summarily transferred to a low-level
job in the Pentagon in April 1996 for ``immature and
inappropriate'' behavior around the president.
</P>
<P>
   On most of her visits to the White House, Ms. Lewinsky was
cleared past security by Mrs. Currie. Clinton was asked during his
deposition in the Jones suit in January whether he was alone with
Ms. Lewinsky on any of those occasions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't recall,'' the president replied. But he added that it
was ``possible'' that on one or two occasions they were alone.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's testimony is not corroborated by other
witnesses, most importantly by Mrs. Currie, who testified that
Clinton was alone with Ms. Lewinsky on a number of occasions,
according to lawyers familiar with her testimony. In addition,
Starr's prosecutors have questioned more than a dozen Secret
Service officers who are stationed outside the Oval Office, asking
them if they were aware of occasions on which the president and Ms.
Lewinsky were alone.
</P>
<P>
   Another critical line of questioning concerns the gifts Ms.
Lewinsky has said the president gave her, including a dress, a
brooch, a hatpin and a book of poetry.
</P>
<P>
   In the Jones deposition, Clinton was asked about the gifts. He
said he didn't recall whether he had given her gifts, and asked,
``Do you know what they were?''
</P>
<P>
   When told what they were, he said he ``could have'' given her
such things.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give _ let me just say, I give people a lot of gifts and
when people are around I give a lot of things I have at the White
House away, so I could have given her a gift, but I don't remember
a specific gift,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky has testified that she returned the gifts to Mrs.
Currie at the prompting of the president after they were subpoenaed
by Mrs. Jones' lawyers, said lawyers who have heard her story. It
is not known whether the box containing the gifts was in the
President's possession before Mrs. Currie turned them over to
prosecutors in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's vague answers in the Jones deposition _ he answered
``I don't know'' or ``I don't recall'' dozens of times _ may
protect him from accusations of perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But testimony from Ms. Lewinsky, who was granted broad immunity
from prosecution last month, and physical evidence, including a
blue dress of hers that the FBI has tested for semen stains, could
undercut Clinton's denials of a relationship last January and
narrow his room for maneuvering on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on what the evidence really is, you know,''
Senator Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said on NBC's ``Meet the Press''
Sunday. ``I just asked the president to testify truthfully,
because, so help me, if he lies before the grand jury, that would
be grounds for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hatch continued, ``And I believe that _ you know, I personally
believe he's going to do that, but, you know, President Clinton
does have a reputation as a kind of a serial legal manipulator of
legal terms, and if he goes in there and tries to manipulate the
terms and use lawyer-like language to try and, you know, not tell
the full truth, I think it's going to hurt him.''
</P>
<P>
   Leon Panetta, Clinton's former chief of staff, said on the same
program that Clinton now has an obligation not only to tell the
truth before the grand jury but to level with the American public
about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be easy for the president,'' Panetta
said. ``This is a tough thing to do, when you have to face the
American people and say you made a terrible mistake and that you
apologize for it. But if he has the courage to do that and put it
behind him, hopefully others will be able to follow suit and begin
the healing process in this country from seven months of turmoil.''

ITALIAN INSURER EXPECTED TO SETTLE HOLOCAUST CLAIMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Holocaust survivors and Jewish charities are near an
agreement under which Generali, the giant Italian insurance
company, would pay at least $65 million to settle claims that it
refused to honor the policies of Eastern European Jews after World
War II, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato said Sunday. A spokesman for Generali
confirmed that a settlement was expected in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato, R-NY, said that in settling, Generali would become
``the first company to break the code of silence and the wall of
denial about some egregious practices that have existed for many
years.''
</P>
<P>
   By settling now, he said, Generali would avoid ``a nasty and
protracted legal encounter'' that could harm its business around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Four people who have been briefed on the negotiations to settle
a lawsuit filed last year in U.S. District Court in New York said
Sunday and Saturday that the settlement would affect about
one-third of claims by Jews who lived in Eastern Europe, where
Generali was the largest single seller of life and annuity policies
in the years before the war.
</P>
<P>
   Claims against other insurers and against companies operating in
Western Europe would not be affected by the expected settlement.
</P>
<P>
   What is expected to be the final negotiating session with
Generali is scheduled for Monday in Manhattan, but an official
announcement of the settlement is not expected until at least
Wednesday. The delay is planned, said five people who have been
involved in the negotiations or briefed on them, so that the news
is not overshadowed by coverage of President Clinton's testimony
before a grand jury about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Last week two Swiss banks, Union Bank of Switzerland and Credit
Suisse, said they were settling claims by Jewish depositors and
their heirs who were refused the return of their money after the
war. The banks settled for $1.2 billion, twice the amount that they
previously said was the most they would pay.
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato said there was only ``one last technicality'' to be
worked out before a settlement is signed. The other four people who
know details of the talks said the senator was pressing Generali to
increase significantly the amount it will pay. D'Amato, who has
held hearings on the issue in the Senate Banking Committee, which
he heads, has been in the lead in demanding restitution of assets
stolen from Jews during the war.
</P>
<P>
   Generali's willingness to settle the case increased after it
became widely known in January that in a Trieste warehouse the
company had nearly complete records of all the policies it sold
before the war. A CD-ROM it created with the names of 384,000
people who bought policies closely matched lists of Holocaust
victims compiled in Jerusalem that were developed from Nazi
archives.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The settlement is expected to include the disclosure of
competitive information from the years before the war that would
put pressure on Allianz AG, a German concern that is the world's
biggest insurance company, and other big European insurers to
settle claims by Holocaust survivors and the heirs of victims.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement is expected to clear the way for Holocaust
survivors to press claims in courts in Eastern Europe against the
successor insurance companies.

INVESTIGATORS HOPEFUL THAT SUSPECT WILL PROVIDE KEY TO BOMBINGS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also EMBASSYBOMB-ALBANIA and EMBASSYBOMB-KENYA) 
(js) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Law enforcement officials investigating the
bombings at the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania expressed
optimism Sunday that a man brought back to the Kenyan capital over
the weekend after being detained in Pakistan could help authorities
unravel the plot behind the deadly terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect has been identified by government representatives in
Pakistan and Kenya as Mohammed Sadik Howaida. American officials
said Sunday that they are increasingly certain he played a direct
and possibly key role in the nearly simultaneous bombings on Aug. 7
that killed more than 250 people.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the officials said that one or two other men are in
custody in Pakistan who are also suspected of complicity in the
bombings, possibly helping to arrange clandestine passage for
Howaida and other confederates through Pakistan to the relative
safety of neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said they suspect Howaida of a significant role in
part because he took the risk of remaining in Nairobi, Kenya, until
the day of the bombing. That suggested that his presence was
necessary possibly because he was involved in building the bomb or
in transporting it to the embassy. It is unknown whether anyone saw
him in Nairobi before the bomb exploded.
</P>
<P>
   More broadly, the apprehension of Howaida raised the possibility
of a quick breakthrough in the case and of a highly significant
advance in the United States' often lonely and frustrating effort
to combat international terrorism against Americans.
</P>
<P>
   A rapid end to the investigation would also send a powerful
message to terrorists, in contrast to the long list of cases that
have remained open for years without identifying the perpetrators _
like the 1996 bombing of the U.S. Air Force apartment complex in
Saudi Arabia in which 19 Americans were killed.
</P>
<P>
   But should Howaida be able to name collaborators who may be
hiding in Afghanistan, the United States could face the problem of
trying to apprehend suspects probably living under the protection
of the Taliban, the radical Islamic group that controls most of the
country.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, officials would not elaborate on Howaida's role, but
Pakistani news reports said that he confessed to a role in the
bombings when he was arrested after arriving in Karachi, Pakistan,
from Nairobi on the day of the blasts. He was initially detained
when Pakistani immigration officials noticed that his face did not
match his Yemeni passport and he attempted to bribe authorities to
obtain his release.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said Howaida is suspected of being an associate or
supporter of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi-born millionaire, who, from
a stronghold in Afghanistan, has pledged a holy war on the United
States. From the start, Bin Laden has been the object of intense
scrutiny because of his strident anti-American statements and
because of suspicions that he may have been involved in previous
terrorist acts.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Even though law enforcement officials still have no direct
evidence that Bin Laden was involved in the bombings, he has been
at the center of an intense internal discussion at the FBI over
whether the New York office should take jurisdiction of the bombing
case away from the Washington field office, which has jurisdiction
over crimes against Americans on the African continent.
</P>
<P>
   FBI officials in New York have argued that they have
investigated Bin Laden in connection with the World Trade Center
bombing in 1993, and therefore should take over the Kenya and
Tanzania bombing investigations if he is found to be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Reports that the Pakistani authorities had detained a suspect in
the bombings came as American officials said that Pakistan wanted
to keep a low profile, fearing a domestic backlash of the kind that
followed disclosures that Pakistan had assisted in the 1995 arrest
of Ramzi Ahmed Yousef, the mastermind of the World Trade Center
bombing, and in the 1997 capture of Mir Amal Kansi, the man
convicted of killing CIA employees outside the agency's
headquarters in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Pakistani authorities were vague about how Howaida
was returned to Nairobi. A spokesman for the Pakistani government
in Kenya said that the suspect had been turned over to the custody
of Kenya, not the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Newsweek magazine, in its Monday issue, said that
investigators in Nairobi found a 100-pound steel drive shaft
imprinted with the vehicle identification number of the truck
thought to have carried the bomb. Authorities would not confirm
this, but said that the discovery would be less significant than in
other recent bombings, such as the World Trade Center bombing, when
the identification number led authorities to rental agencies used
by the bombers.

 &HT;    O'Meara hardly a disappointment at PGA
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Not bad for a 41-year-old player who began the
season without a professional major championship win. Not bad for a
guy who started the year being known mainly as Tiger Woods' big
brother.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters and British Open champion, Mark O'Meara, was a
factor Sunday at Sahalee Country Club, tying for fourth at the PGA
Championship and pulling to within two shots of the lead at one
stage, but eventually tied for fourth at 4-under 276 on a closing
68. He was trying to become the first player since Ben Hogan in
1953 to win three majors in a season.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara jumped into serious contention early by draining a
50-foot putt for eagle at the par-5 second hole, then slipped away
with consecutive bogeys on Nos. 6, 7 and 8 ''that really took the
winds out of my sails.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm pleased with my performance,'' said O'Meara, the oldest
player in history to win two majors in a season. ''I wanted to try
to come and play well here. It would have been a tremendous honor
to alongside Ben Hogan's name, but it just wasn't meant to be. I'm
disappointed I didn't win, but it's not easy winning out here on
tour, let alone another major championship.''
</P>
<P>
   Price makes late run
</P>
<P>
   A favorite before it all started at Sahalee Country Club, Nick
Price finally crawled into the elite area of the leader board
Sunday, matching the course record with a bogey-free 5-under-par 65
and finishing at 4-under 276. It was the best finish in a PGA
Championship for Price, 41, a two-time champion, since his
wire-to-wire win at Southern Hills in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''Today was probably the best I putted all year,'' said the
Zimbabwean from Hobe Sound, Fla.,''and that's a good sign. These
lst six moths have been awful.'' . . . Price made four par saves
and five birdies at Sahalee, which has played easier the past two
two days with cool temperatures and softened conditions by light
rain. Price's chance at the course record was a putt that hung on
the lip at the par-3 17th. . . . Atlanta's Billy Andrade failed to
keep this game together for two straight days this week, but didn't
blame the inconsistency on his late arrival as the eighth alternate
at Sahalee. Andrade closed with a 75 Sunday, after rounds of
68-77-68 and finished at 8-over 288. ''The problem is still
putting,'' said Andrade, who averaged 31 per round. ''I'm still
kind of in a funk. I'm scratching and crawling. I'm close to
playing better golf.''

 &HT;    Gritz: Rudolph knows about us
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A retired Green Beret colonol heading a volunteer
search for Eric Robert Rudolph said Sunday that the fugitive knows
of his mission to safely deliver the bombing suspect into the
justice system, and that a man fitting Rudolph's description has
been seen in the Nantahala, N.C. area. ``People very familiar and
close to him tell us he's gotten the word,'' said retired Vietnam
Green Beret Col. James ``Bo'' Gritz on Sunday afternoon at a
Nantahala campground his volunteers are using as a command post.
``But we're going to have to come to him. We're trying to close the
distance.''
</P>
<P>
   That distance is one of not only space, but also one of trust,
since Rudolph could face the death penalty for the Jan. 29 bombing
of a Birmingham abortion clinic that killed an off-duty police
officer and maimed a nurse. He also is wanted for questioning in
the deadly explosion at Centennial Olympic Park during the Olympics
in July 1996; a double-blast bombing at a Sandy Springs abortion
clinic in January 1997; and an explosion at an Atlanta gay
nightclub in February 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a lot closer today than we were yesterday,'' Gritz said.
``We've actually had some (tips) about live sightings now that were
not reported to federal agents. I'm very plussed.'' Gritz arrived
in western North Carolina on Thursday night with Randy Weaver,
whose 1992 stand-off with federal agents at his remote Ruby Ridge,
Idaho, home cost the lives of a U.S. marshall, Weaver's wife and
son over a missed court date on weapons charges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew Weaver would attract information,'' Gritz said.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said reports that Rudolph's hideout is easily accessible
by boat are ``top secret.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't talk about it,'' Gritz said when asked about these
reports. ``It's an operation forthcoming.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz did confirm that a man fitting Rudolph's description with
a ponytail has been seen ``regularly going in and securing food and
coming out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not living alone and he's not living all outside,'' Gritz
added. ``We know that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gritz, 59, who has dubbed his weeklong mission ``Operation
Cross,'' said that a reward up to $1 million for information
leading only to Rudolph's arrest has made the fugitive a ``raffle
ticket'' for bounty hunters. Gritz's volunteers, who have come from
as far away as Washington state, Boston and Florida, were required
to sign a waiver to any claim on the reward because it will be
turned over to Rudolph's designee, possibly to pay for his defense.
John DeCamp, a former Republican Nebraska state senator, said over
the weekend that he will defend Rudolph if asked as long as Gritz's
involvement has been approved by the U.S. attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make sure he has a fair trial and the truth comes
out,'' DeCamp said in a telephone interiew.
</P>
<P>
   ''Operation Cross'' officially began Friday. The group headed up
a steep mountainside Saturday morning for an overnight
''shakedown'' designed to identify those who were too weak or
antagonistic to continue. But new information brought them down to
camp about 5 a.m. Sunday, only to set out again on their secret
mission about 12 hours later.
</P>
<P>
   Gritz said he was asked to make the appeal to Rudolph by Charlie
Stone. Stone is a Georgia Bureau of Investigation agent and
negotiator.

<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a huge secret
underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the
centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear
weapons program, according to officials who have been briefed on
the intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has alarmed officials at the White House and the
Pentagon, who fear that the complex may represent an effort to
break out of a 4-year-old agreement in which North Korea pledged to
give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of
dollars in Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also follows a string of provocations by the North,
including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion of a small
North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off the South Korean
coast this year.
</P>
<P>
   The North has said in recent months that the United States is
reneging on its side of the agreement because Congress has failed
to authorize tens of millions of dollars in fuel shipments for the
North. The shipments are the main American contribution to a $6
billion program, under which South Korea, Japan and other nations
are supposed to finance a major electric energy program as a quid
pro quo for the North's abandonment of its ambitions to develop
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the North had not yet
technically violated that accord, called the Agreed Framework,
because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has begun pouring
cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant that would convert
nuclear waste into bomb-grade plutonium. The accord explicitly bars
that activity.
</P>
<P>
   But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge work
site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where,
until the 1994 accord, the North is believed to have created enough
plutonium to build six or more bombs. Thousands of North Korean
workers are swarming around the new site, burrowing into the
mountainside, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other intelligence, which the officials would not describe, led
the administration in recent weeks to warn important members of
Congress and the South Korean government in classified briefings
that they believed that the North intended to build a new reactor
and reprocessing center under the mountain. Intelligence estimates
of how long it would take to complete the project have ranged from
two to six years, depending in part on how much outside help is
received.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials have played down the finding, officials
said, because they fear undermining President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy'' toward North Korea, an effort to reopen aid and
dialogue with the Stalinist government in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   When Kim went to Washington in the spring he urged President
Clinton to drop sanctions against the North that date from the end
of the Korean War. But the new finding makes it far less likely
that the United States will ease up on the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very serious development,'' said one American
official, who like the others insisted on anonymity, ``to say
nothing of incredibly stupid, because it endangers both the nuclear
accord and humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were clearly concerned that Congress
was now less likely than ever to finance the fuel oil. If Congress
refused to fulfill the American commitment, the officials fear,
that would, in turn, give the North an excuse to abandon the
nuclear agreement officially and, perhaps, to expel inspectors from
the International Atomic Energy Agency who are at Yongbyon. The
North has prohibited inspectors from examining other sites outside
Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting this week between North Korean officials and the
American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, Charles Kartman,
the United States is expected to demand that the North stop all
work at the new site. It is not clear whether the North already
knows that its activity has been detected.
</P>
<P>
   As always in matters involving North Korea, it is virtually
impossible to divine the country's real intentions.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, officials say, that the mysterious North Korean
leader, Kim Jong Il, is trying to rebuild a nuclear program that
the West stopped in 1994. Kim may also be hoping to bolster his
standing with the North Korean military. This may be a particularly
critical time to placate the right wing, because Kim is expected,
next month, to be given all of the titles held by his father, Kim
Il Sung, North Korea's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kim died in July 1994, just weeks after having defused
the confrontation with the United States by telling former
President Carter that he was willing to trade away the nuclear
program in return for Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Kim Jong Il is intending to trade
away the new nuclear complex the way his father traded away the
last one _ if he can extract a high enough price. American
officials note that building a nuclear reactor underground is an
enormously difficult technical task for any country, much less one
that is starving as a result of economic collapse, drought and
floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a nuclear breakout, a hedge, a bargaining chip?''
asked Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. ``It's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nye worked extensively on the North Korean nuclear issue at the
CIA and as a top Pentagon official in the first term of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nye noted that in 1993, as the United States was confronting
North Korea over its efforts to reprocess nuclear waste into
plutonium, the intelligence community was deeply divided on the
question of whether the North wanted a bomb or was simply playing
for aid. ``The majority said the North would never give up the
bomb, but a deal was struck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not necessarily certain that the country would follow
the same pattern today, he and other experts warn. In the four
years since the agreement was reached, the North has grown far
weaker, both economically and militarily.

 &HT;    Gordon ties modern record
 &HT;    By Tom McCollister
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ Miracles appear in the strangest of places.
Jeff Gordon found one Sunday in the blown engine of Ward Burton's
Pontiac, giving him a chance at the victory he thought would not
come.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon locked on to it with six laps to run, charging out of the
Michigan pits to chase down Mark Martin, Jeff Burton, Dale Jarrett
and Ernie Irvan for his season's eighth victory and first ever at
this track.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just a miracle,'' said Gordon, standing in a Victory
Lane for the fourth consecutive week. ``We struggled at times, got
loose, and had our hands full staying on the lead lap. It's nice.
The next time we come here we won't be asked, 'When are you going
to win at Michigan?'''
</P>
<P>
   For 194 laps, it didn't appear it would be this year, either. It
was one of those weeks when Gordon didn't appear to have it. He
never was awful, just good enough to hang around and be there when
the door opened.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the backs of Burtons, Ward and Jeff. Ward for the
blown engine to bring the caution, and Jeff for leaving his pit
with loose lug nuts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real frustrating,'' Jeff Burton said. ``We had a fast car
enough to win the race and took ourselves out of it. The pit crew
feels terrible, but it's not about the pit crew having a bad stop
or me messing up. It's all about us getting it done together, and
we just didn't get it done today.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton had company in that category.
</P>
<P>
   Pole sitter Ernie Irvan was the early rabbit, leading nine times
for 112 laps, but none of the final 35. Martin was in front eight
times for 60, but he faded to fourth over the last nine. Jarrett
plugged along, never out of the top 10, but never in the top three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gave it my best,'' Martin said. ``I dedicate that losing
performance to my dad and Shelley and Sarah (in last week's plane
crash). We just couldn't beat Jeff. When you've got that much
speed, there ain't no holding it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Gordon didn't have all that speed until Burton gave the Rainbow
Warriors one last shot. Two new left side tires were part of the
mix, the removal of a right rear spring rubber, changing the
handling of the car. All in 9.2 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've got nothing to lose, it's kind of easy
sometimes,'' said crew chief Ray Evernham. ``It's a lot harder to
make that call when you've got a good car and you don't want to
screw it up. Our car really wasn't good all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when there's 15 or 20 laps to go and you can put the
leaders in his sight, he's got a sight line like a jet fighter. He
can pick it up a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   And discourage the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like it was going to be Gordon's day,'' Jeff
Burton said. ``It's ridiculous that he won that race.''

 &HT;    Singh captures victory at Sahalee
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ He hit no range balls Sunday night. He remained
off the putting green. For one night at least, Vijay Singh, the
hardest working man in golf, accepted the results and savored his
accomplishment.
</P>
<P>
   Winning what evolved as a head-to-head duel with Steve Stricker
Sunday at Sahalee Country Club, Singh secured the 80th PGA
Championship by two strokes with a score of 9-under-par 271,
closing with a 2-under 68 for the first major of his 16-year
professional career.
</P>
<P>
   Singh, 35, a native of Lautoka, Fiji, who once held a club
professional job in Borneo and earned less than $200 a month,
collected $540,000 Sunday and much more. With a hard rain falling
on Sahalee, Singh enjoyed the sweet result of those thousands of
range balls blasted into a setting sun. His name in Hindu means
``victory.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a dream to win this major, although I've been quiet
about it,'' said Singh, who biggest championship previously came in
the 1997 Memorial. ``It's something I never thought was going to
happen. I'm at a loss for words.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh clinched his chance to hoist the Wanamaker Trophy on the
par-3 17th hole, making a 15-footer for par after depositing a
5-iron into the left greenside bunker. Stricker, who also bunkered,
failed to save par from a similar distance and dropped two strokes
behind Singh to 7-under. Stricker, 31, finished second, earning
$324,000, after starting the day tied with Singh and shooting an
even-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``I put up a good fight,'' said Stricker, who broke down several
times in the post-round interview. ``I struggled. I guess it just
wasn't meant to be. That was really the turning point, when he
missed his up-and-down putt (at 17) and I missed. To win this
tournament would have meant a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the stroke of good fortune that Singh received at
the 11th hole, when his ball struck a tree and bounced onto the
green, Stricker said, ``He got some fortunate breaks, but he also
made some great recovery shots, too. I guess when it's your time to
win, those things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Australian Steve Elkington, after battling sinus surgery and
viral meningitis this year, challenged briefly at the finish for a
second PGA title, but finished third at 274, three shots back, with
a 67. Nick Price matched the Sahalee course record of 65 and tied
for fourth with Mark O'Meara (68), the Masters and British Open
champion, who sought three majors for the first time since Ben
Hogan in 1953.
</P>
<P>
   Sea Island's Davis Love III (70), who started four shots off the
lead, double-bogeyed the fifth hole to drop back and eventually
tied for seventh with Billy Mayfair (70). Tiger Woods tied for 10th
at 1-under-par 279 after a 71.
</P>
<P>
   A smooth, long ballstriker whose putting always kept him from
reaching a major championship level, Singh (171st in PGA Tour
putting last year) finally straightened out his work on the greens.
After trying more than a half dozen putters just this year, Singh
settled on a cross-handed style in June and this week enjoyed ``the
best putting tournament I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never a bad putter,'' Singh said. ``I just wasn't a
great putter.''

 &HT;    Jones regains form in West coast trip
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Chipper Jones never had a road trip like this one.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves played the ninth and final game of their only West
coast swing, Jones went into Sunday night at .500 (16-for-32) with
two doubles, a triple, three homers, two stolen bases and eight
runs scored. Moreover, he had 10 RBI in the first eight games, a
major upgrade. When the Braves left town Aug. 6, Jones had driven
in only one run in his previous 14 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``A big problem I have is I wrap my bat,'' Jones said. ``I get
it back there so far (in a left-handed stance) that I wind up with
the end of my bat pointing at the right fielder, which makes me
susceptible to hard stuff in(side). It takes a conscious effort on
my part just to relax and not get back so much, and make (my swing)
short and quick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We faced the Cardinals in that last homestand and Bobby Witt
and Kent Bottenfield were killing me inside. I knew going on this
trip, with the kind of pitching we were going to be facing, they
were going to be doing mostly the same thing. So you get yourself
in the cage and do the right things over and over until it feels
second nature and it should carry over into the game. Luckily, it
all came together just in time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with his slow two weeks before the trip, Jones came into
play Sunday leading the league in runs (100), tied for seventh in
RBI (94) and tied for eight in homers (29). With 39 games he play,
establishing career-highs in each category seems a certainty (114
runs, set in 1996, 111 RBI set last year, 30 homers in 1996). But
with home run fever gripping attention all year and Andres
Galarraga's homers pacing Atlanta's offense, Jones' year has not
received the public notice it might have.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all going to (Mark) McGwire this year,'' said manager
Bobby Cox. ''Even (Ken) Griffey (Jr.) and (Sammy) Sosa aren't
getting the attention this year. That's the way it is. People come
to think that this is automatic. It's not.''
</P>
<P>
   Over his career, Jones has had trouble playing on the coast,
with a .250 career average in the three NL California cities
entering this year. But Dodger Stadium has been the toughest
(10-for-64) park for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could come in here 20-for-20 and take the collar,'' he said.
``It feels like the pitcher is right on top of you. Tough place to
hit.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood walks
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Millwood anticipates he will make his next start Thursday
as scheduled, though he has yet to test his right ankle which he
sprained badly enough to knock him out of his last game Friday
night just one inning after he injured it running to first.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was instructed not to throw on the side (Sunday),'' he said,
``but we've got the extra day (today's off-day). It'll be
alright.''
</P>
<P>
   Millwood was back to walking without a limp Sunday and is
accustomed to turning his ankles and recovering, after several
similar episodes playing football and basketball at Bessemer City
(N.C.) High School. He has continued with heat-and-ice treatments
to be ready to face the Padres Thursday. Despite the off-day, Cox
had not intended to pass him over and was encouraged to see the
right-hander moving around the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walking and pitching,'' Millwood said, ``are two different
things.''
</P>
<P>
   Springer throws
</P>
<P>
   Russ Springer threw from the mound Sunday (fastballs only) for
the first time since going on the disabled list Aug. 6 and after
today's off-day, he will try again Tuesday (fastballs and breaking
balls) to gauge how cortisone treatment effected the bone spur in
his right elbow. Springer is eligible to come off the DL Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``The signs I have now are better,'' he said.

DUPONT MAY BE SEEKING SALE OF CONOCO 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Del.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DuPont Co., which in May announced plans to sell the public 20
percent of its Conoco Inc. oil subsidiary, may now be looking to
sell all of Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont declined to comment on a report Sunday in a London
newspaper that the French oil company Elf Aquitaine wants to buy
Conoco for $24 billion, but analysts said a sale to Elf or another
middle-sized petroleum company would make strategic sense for
DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   The article in the London newspaper, The Financial Mail, which
said Elf was preparing an offer that would include swapping some
assets with DuPont, said other oil companies were also looking at
Conoco, the ninth-largest oil company in the United States. The
report, citing an unidentified industry official, did not name any
other potential bidders.
</P>
<P>
   The report comes less than a week after British Petroleum PLC
said it would buy Amoco for $48.2 billion in stock and cash,
setting off speculation that more middle-sized oil companies may
merge so they can hold down costs in an era of cheap oil and
compete with the biggest of the oil giants, Exxon and Royal
Dutch/Shell. British Petroleum acquired Standard of Ohio in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Durand, an Elf Aquitaine spokeswoman reached at her
home in Paris, said the company would not comment on ``stock
exchange speculation.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan Gaffney, a DuPont spokeswoman, said the company would not
comment on the report. But nothing in DuPont's planned initial
public offering of Conoco shares would preclude an outright sale of
the company, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, DuPont announced that it would make an initial public
offering for 20 percent of Conoco as part of its strategy to rely
less on its cyclical petrochemicals business. Instead, DuPont wants
to concentrate more on development of genetically engineered
products to generate future growth and existing products, such as
specialty chemicals, that it believes are less subject to wide
swings in demand and price.
</P>
<P>
   DuPont, which has been expected to hold a so-called road show
for potential Conoco investors next month, said in May the IPO was
a step toward divesting itself of Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco was acquired in 1981 to ensure DuPont a steady supply of
oil as a feed stock for its chemicals business in an era of rapidly
rising oil prices and high inflation. Now, with oil selling at a
fraction of the inflation-adjusted price in 1981 and exploration of
offshore fields requiring massive capital investments, owning an
oil company is no longer attractive to DuPont.
</P>
<P>
   If it sold all or part of Conoco, whether for cash outright or
through a public offering, DuPont would be liable for billions of
dollars in capital gains taxes. So an offer that allows for a
tax-free exchange of assets _ as Elf is reportedly proposing _
would be especially attractive, said Theodore Semegran, an analyst
with Brown Brothers Harriman.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Elf is the majority owner of Sanofi, a large French
pharmaceutical company, and it makes perfumes under such brand
names as Oscar de la Renta and Fendi. If these or other assets were
swapped for part of Conoco, the deal could be structured to reduce
DuPont's capital gains taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to make a decision about whether they will get a
greater total return by starting with an IPO and then spinning
Conoco off or by selling it outright,'' Semegran said. ``An offer
that would help them avoid some fairly significant capital gains
taxes would be attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Conoco was worth between $22 billion and $23 billion,
slightly less than the price Elf is reportedly willing to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco has developed large tracts of oil in the North Sea and
Indonesia, and recently off the west coast of Africa. Conoco also
has large refineries and a chain of retail gas stations in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1995 the company tried to arrange a deal to develop two
oil fields in Iran. But that deal fell apart because of opposition
by the Bronfman family, which at the time held the controlling
stake in DuPont, but it has since sold its stake and invested in
MCA, the Hollywood entertainment company.
</P>
<P>
   Elf also has fields in the North Sea which, if combined with
Conoco's, could allow for lower-cost operations there.

ONLY A MODEST ROLE FOR CLINTON GRAND JURORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related stories: CLINTON-STARR-RDP, CLINTON-STARR,
CLINTON-TESTIMONY, CLINTON-PROSECUTORS) 
(lh) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton's image appears on a
television screen on the third floor of the federal courthouse
Monday afternoon, the 23 grand jurors in the room will probably
have little role to play.
</P>
<P>
   Although the presence of the grand jury lends symbolic and legal
gravity to the event, the jurors will be little more than a
backdrop, because it is highly unlikely that they will get to vote
or otherwise pass judgment on the issues covered by President
Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent
counsel, has indicated that he will not have the grand jury
consider whether to indict the president. Instead, Starr's aides
have suggested, he intends to draft a report to Congress, which
then will have the option of considering whether the facts warrant
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors may ask questions of the president, since it is
they who are technically conducting the investigation. But it is
expected that even if the grand jurors pose some questions, the
event will be largely run by the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Most grand juries serve two functions: They investigate under
the direction of prosecutors and then decide what to make of the
investigation. As part of that second function, they may bring
indictments or, in some cases, make presentments, which are usually
reports about broad categories of wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   But this grand jury is unusual in that it no longer has the
second function, because whether a sitting president can be
indicted is an unresolved legal question. Starr's intention to
compile his conclusions in a report to Congress effectively
sidesteps that issue.
</P>
<P>
   The institution of the grand jury is believed by legal
historians to date to the reign of Henry II of England in the 12th
century. At that time, authorities decreed that 12 knights or
``good and lawful men'' out of every 104 men would decide who was
suspected of public offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The concept was imported to the American colonies by the
British. The ideal purpose of a grand jury, according to a famous
1965 opinion by a U.S. Court of Appeals, was as ``both a sword and
a shield, a sword because it is the terror of criminals, a shield
because it is the protection of the innocent against unjust
punishment.''
</P>
<P>
   One advantage of a grand jury for a prosecutor is that it may
compel testimony from reluctant witnesses. Investigators may not on
their own simply demand that people answer their questions, but a
grand jury is allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
   In recent decades, however, the system has collected a host of
critics who argue that grand juries are merely rubber stamps for
prosecutorial decisions. In fact, grand juries that decline to
follow a prosecutor's lead to indict are sometimes called
``runaway'' grand juries.
</P>
<P>
   England, the birthplace of the concept, abolished grand juries
in 1933.

HINGIS FINDS CONSOLATION IN DOUBLES

   MANHATTAN BEACH, Calif. _ Martina Hingis lost the singles final
to Lindsay Davenport, but she had a consolation when she and
Natasha Zvereva beat Tamarine Tanasugarn and Elena Tatarkova 6-4,
6-2 Sunday in the doubles final of the Acura Classic at Manhattan
Country Club.
</P>
<P>
   After the three-set singles final, Hingis returned to the court
for doubles approximately 45 minutes later. The top-ranked player
said she had no fatigue. ``I am kind of used to it now, playing
singles and doubles,'' Hingis said. ``If I didn't play doubles, I
would miss it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Making contact: Hingis missed an overhead late in the third
set against Davenport and was asked if the sun affected her. Hingis
said the sun played no role because she was wearing brown contact
lenses, which make her eyes less sensitive to sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis, whose natural eye color is green, pulled out the brown
contacts for the finals match. In her earlier matches, she said,
``I just had the regular ones.''
</P>
<P>
   __ TV's gone, let's talk: Since the final between Hingis and
Davenport was broadcast on NBC, tournament coordinators had to
postpone the awards ceremonies to allow a commercial. When the
ceremonies continued, Davenport made a terse speech about the
match. Then, when NBC went to another commercial, she said, ``We're
off the air, so we can talk now.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, a Newport Beach resident, then thanked her friends
and family in attendance. She also mentioned a niece, who was
celebrating her first birthday.
</P>
<P>
   __ It's alive!: In a question-and-answer session with the crowd,
Davenport announced on Saturday night that women's serve-and-volley
game is dead. Now, women's tennis is more of a power game, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I took criticism for that as soon as I said it in the locker
room,'' Davenport said. ``Pam Shriver told me the serve-and-volley
game isn't dead. It's just retired.''

OUTSIDE POLITICAL CIRCLES, A DEEP SENSE OF SADNESS AND SHOCK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When President Clinton sits before a closed-circuit
camera in the Map Room of the White House on Monday to give
testimony to a federal grand jury about his involvement with Monica
Lewinsky, he will venture into not only the most politically and
legally hazardous moment of his presidency, but also the most
surreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If some novelist had written this 12 years ago, no one would
have accepted it,'' said David McCullough, who won the Pulitzer
Prize in 1993 for his biography of Harry S. Truman. ``It makes you
feel dizzy _ and sad.''
</P>
<P>
   The widespread feeling expressed in interviews outside political
circles is one of disappointment, sadness and even anger that the
Lewinsky case has reached a new low: A president testifying about
his sexual life before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why are we curious to expose this thing?'' said the playwright
and actress Anna Devere Smith, who is reworking her latest play,
``House Arrest,'' about politics and journalists, to reflect the
Lewinsky scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Just, the former journalist who has written several novels
on Washington political life, said he still could not fathom how a
confluence of seemingly unrelated events and personalities
culminated in the grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like looking at the heavens and you're seeing these
planets up there and they're all spinning around,'' he said. ``But
unlike the universe, there is no coherence to them. This follows no
path. Weird people emerge and then they disappear in six month's
time. Linda Tripp is going to be a trivia question, my guess, in a
year and a half. The Lewinsky thing is a cartoon. As a morality
tale it's not very interesting, even as an immorality tale,
whichever it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Gary Ross, a Hollywood screenwriter who wrote the satire
``Dave,'' about a philandering president replaced by a lookalike,
groused: ``I'm surprised and shocked that we're actually talking
about this sort of thing in public as it relates to the president.
Doesn't it shock and horrify you?''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Carolan, who teaches American Government and Citizenship at
St. Albans, an exclusive preparatory school here whose alumni
include Vice President Al Gore, said he was bracing for awkward
moments when his students return next month because ``we've never
gotten into the thick and dirty of the Lewinsky business.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have to handle it without wallowing in detail,'' Carolan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Woodward, half of The Washington Post reporting team that
helped bring down Richard Nixon in 1974, said the Lewinsky matter
comes nowhere close to the level of Watergate. While the
18-and-a-half-minute gap in the Nixon tapes became an enduring
symbol of Watergate, Woodward noted, Ms. Lewinsky's navy blue dress
may be emblematic of this scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Put the two scandals side by side and go to the question of
motivation and the extent of activity and there is a significant
difference,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward said of the Lewinsky scandal: ``It's like World War I.
What triggered it? Was World War I about militarization? About
German aspirations? Is this about a land deal? Is it about FBI
files? It is about the travel office. It's about all those things,
and it's destabilized the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the concerns that the matter has diminished the
presidency, former Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo., who helped navigate
Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas through the often seamy
elements of his confirmation hearings, said nothing could be more
important than Clinton's grand jury appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is more important than policy,'' Danforth said. ``If what
comes out of this is, `We don't really care, we don't want to be
bothered,' then that is a terrible, terrible outcome. If what comes
out is, `This is wrong and we know it's wrong and we're willing to
forgive it but we don't want it to happen again,' then I think we
have vindicated ourselves as a people who believe in something.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are not so high minded. For three years, Ed Morris, a
government teacher at Walt Whitman High School in Bethesda, Md.,
greeted his students after summer vacation by passing out a slip of
paper with this conversation starter, ``Is O.J. Guilty?'' Now a new
question awaits his students, ``Is Bill Guilty?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll just see where it goes,'' Morris said.

<P>
   CHICAGO _ As a lawyer for the likes of Rodney King, Latrell
Sprewell and Tupac Shakur, John Burris has experience handling
difficult, highly charged cases. But Burris, a prominent California
lawyer, wondered if he had met his match with a client he agreed to
defend two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The client, accused of attempted murder, whiled away strategy
sessions playing with Batman toys and action figures. In court,
Burris recalled, ``he would draw, he would get in his mother's lap,
he would sleep, he would make funny faces.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris found himself struggling with how to best represent his
client.
</P>
<P>
   ``Communicating with a 6-year-old about legal matters is
impossible,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The first-grader was charged with trying to kill a neighbor's
newborn baby by dumping the infant out of his bassinet and
punching, kicking and beating him with a stick. In defending the
boy, Burris became one of a relative handful of lawyers
representing young children accused of deadly crimes.
</P>
<P>
   It is a world of unexplored legal ground, raising a battery of
questions for defense lawyers. Do young children always understand
the charges against them? Can they assist in their own defense?
What happens when parents and lawyers have different definitions of
the child's best interest? If children are too young for juvenile
detention centers, where should they be held? If they confess to
crimes, have they knowingly waived their right to remain silent?
</P>
<P>
   Issues like this came to the fore again last week when two
Chicago boys, ages 7 and 8, were charged with murdering an
11-year-old girl, Ryan Harris, in an apparent attempt to take her
bicycle. Police officials said the boys began throwing rocks and
struck Ryan in the head, causing her to fall off her bicycle,
knocking her unconscious and fracturing her skull. They said at
least one of the boys then molested her with a tubular object, and
suffocated her to death by stuffing her panties in her mouth and
leaves and grass in her nostrils.
</P>
<P>
   In the days since the arrests, defense lawyers have challenged
confessions the police said they obtained from the boys. The
lawyers have complained that parents were not in the room when the
boys were being interviewed and argued that the boys were incapable
of waiving their Miranda rights.
</P>
<P>
   And on Thursday, faced with an Illinois law that bars children
under 10 from being confined in a locked facility, and reports from
psychological experts that the boys did not seem dangerous, a
Juvenile Court judge forged a Solomonic solution. He allowed the
boys to go home with their parents, but ordered them to stay inside
at all times and to wear electronic monitoring bracelets on their
ankles.
</P>
<P>
   Cases like this are uncharted territory, said Robert Schwartz,
executive director of the Juvenile Law Center, a nonprofit legal
service in Philadelphia that represents abused children and
children charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know a whole lot about kids who kill at this age
because there aren't a whole lot of them,'' he said. ``It's not
like kids who set fires, or kid sex offenders, where we know there
are certain patterns. These cases are all different _ in age,
premeditation, the weapon that's used.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the scarcity of meaningful precedents, defense lawyers in
these cases are feeling their way.
</P>
<P>
   Burris, a well-known Oakland civil rights lawyer, said that for
a meeting with his young defendant, he brought in his 8-year-old
son's toys, ``rolled up my sleeves and got on the floor and sought
to communicate that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching the boy knock an action figure down and pop it right up
again, Burris said he could tell the boy had no sense of the
permanence of death. He also said his client ``never understood who
I was. It took him a long time to call me Burris. I was the talking
tall man.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gagen, who represents 11-year-old Joshua Almaguer-Mendez,
charged with killing his 13-year-old neighbor by firing a rifle out
his bedroom window in Antioch, Calif., in June, consulted the
priest in his client's church, who ``came in and talked to Josh
about how it was important to talk to me, and I was a good guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago has had some practice with children accused in killings,
with eight cases in the last 25 years involving children younger
than 11, including the 1994 case of two boys, ages 10 and 11,
accused of dropping a 5-year-old from the 14th floor of a housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   Darron Bowden, until recently the supervising attorney in the
Cook County Public Defender's juvenile criminal division, said
lawyers in his office have used stick figures and sports analogies
(``our team, their team''), and drawn on their own experiences
raising children. Bowden, now in charge of the civil division, says
he tries to involve the child as much as possible with his own
defense, using whatever knowledge the child has. For example, the
child or his family might be able to lead the lawyer to witnesses
who have been identified only by their street names.
</P>
<P>
   To find out more about a client who might be too young to
describe himself, lawyers talk to teachers, coaches, even Cub Scout
leaders, as they try to understand how to frame the child's defense
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Often, defense lawyers wrestle with whether to claim their young
clients are incompetent. There are, first of all, gradations of
competence. Does the child understand right from wrong? Does he
understand that shooting a gun can kill someone? Does he understand
what it means to be on trial?
</P>
<P>
   Burris chose to argue incompetence for the 6-year-old from the
San Francisco suburb of Richmond, convinced that, even though the
charges were reduced to assault with great bodily injury, it was
best to ``get him out of the criminal justice component of the
system.'' A juvenile court referee agreed in July 1996, three
months after the charges were filed, and since then the boy has
been receiving treatment and other social services, Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   Gagen considered taking the same tack with Joshua, but he was
concerned about the time it would involve: weeks for psychiatric
evaluations, months or years in treatment, and, under California
law, the possibility of facing criminal charges once he was deemed
competent (a risk Burris' client also faces). For children this
young, he and other lawyers said, weeks can seem like eons, so
lawyers try to move the cases along as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 10, Joshua was convicted of a lesser charge, involuntary
manslaughter. But Gagen said he was never entirely convinced that
his client understood the magnitude of the legal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't one occasion in a 10-day trial when he leaned
over and asked me something or complimented me about something or
expressed any anger,'' Gagen said. ``I didn't see much interest in
`Are we winning or losing? What are those witnesses saying or our
witnesses saying?'''

</P>
<P>
   William Lansat's client, Nathaniel Abraham, has already been
found competent to stand trial as an adult for fatally shooting an
18-year-old in Pontiac, Mich., last year, when Nathaniel was 11.
Lansat said he was considering a plea of diminished capacity,
claiming that Nathaniel could not have formed the intent to kill
and drawing on evaluations that he says show Nathaniel functions at
the level of a child three to five years younger.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, defense lawyers have trouble dealing with a child's
parents, who may disagree with the lawyer's strategy or may even
wind up unwilling accomplices to a defense that claims the child's
problems were due to parental abuse or neglect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these parents come in and say, `Find my kid guilty. I
want to get him help.''' Lansat said. ``They don't understand that
the role of an attorney is to represent the client.''
</P>
<P>
   Burris came to believe early on that his client should not be
returned to his parents, something the boy's mother, naturally,
objected to.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where were my loyalties here?'' he said he asked himself. ``I
could talk to the mother and the granddad, but I couldn't really
talk to the child.'' He ultimately succeeded in having the child
placed elsewhere. ``In terms of the gravity of what had happened, I
thought it was clear there was something wrong with that
environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Howard, the lawyer for Mitchell Johnson, who pleaded guilty
last week to the school shootings in Jonesboro, Ark., a crime
committed at 13, said he had a difficult time with Mitchell's
parents, who are divorced.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was constant friction between the two, and I was pretty
much in the middle,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Once in court, some lawyers try to showcase the youth of their
clients. The private lawyers defending the 8-year-old charged in
the Ryan Harris case stood him on a chair when one witness was
testifying and, on Thursday, brought a physician's scale into the
courtroom, propped the boy on it, and suggested that a child of 56
pounds and 4 feet 2 1/2 inches could not have committed such a
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Bowden, are wary of going overboard. Often, he
said, a member of the public defender's staff is assigned the job
of calming, distracting and comforting the child in the courtroom.
The lawyers in the Ryan Harris case have kept both boys occupied
with toy cars, candy and coloring books.
</P>
<P>
   Most defense lawyers seek to avoid having their young clients
testify, fearing they could be ``pinned down by the rapid-fire
questions of the prosecutor,'' Bowden said.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these children are too young to be tried in adult court,
even under a rash of new state laws that have lowered the minimum
age. But defense lawyers say that as a result of recent
high-profile juvenile crimes, one of the main official distinctions
between juvenile and adult criminal proceedings _ that the approach
in adult court is adversarial, while juvenile court takes a more
collaborative route to a resolution _ has become a myth when
serious crimes are involved. Juvenile prosecutors are under
pressure to exact a tough price for an egregious crime.
</P>
<P>
   And, Bowden said, ``when you've got a kid who's incarcerated
looking down the barrel of some heavy-duty time, it's everything
but non-adversarial.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   These lawyers say the crucial difference with juvenile court is
that there is usually a judge instead of a jury and that juvenile
court judges have broad discretion in sentencing. And sentencing,
the lawyers say, is a crucial phase, as they try to convince a
judge that locking up a child for his impressionable adolescence
would not be in anyone's interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``With older kids, they tell you `I did three years. I did the
crime.' They develop a philosophy,'' Schwartz said. ``The
7-year-old doesn't develop a philosophy. We have to worry about the
short-term and the long-term issues. Coming out of institutions
today are kids who we put away five or 10 years ago because we
thought they would be a danger to themselves or others.''

 &HT;    Clinton already at a disadvantage, professor says
 &HT;    By Benjamin Kline
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ If she were President Bill Clinton's lawyer at
this point in the proceedings against him, Susan Brenner says she
would advise him to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Brenner, a professor of law at the University of Dayton, doesn't
say that in an old-fashioned, all-American, cannot-tell-a-lie tone,
however.
</P>
<P>
   She says it because she feels the president is in grave danger
of being hung out to dry by Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr and
the federal grand jury investigating the allegations of White House
sex and coverup.
</P>
<P>
   A former defense attorney and co-author of a book on federal
grand juries, Brenner said she thinks Clinton's legal team should
have challenged Starr's subpoena of Clinton ``on some kind of
executive privilege, some kind of immunity. It's very important to
the presidency and the relationship between the executive and
judicial branches.''
</P>
<P>
   But since that didn't happen, Brenner says Clinton's best shot
is to avoid getting caught in a Starr trap, which could happen if
he lies and perjures himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very peculiar situation,'' the professor said.
``Justice (department) guidelines don't normally call in the
targets of an investigation in front of a grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if Clinton has a slight advantage in having his lawyers
present at the White House video testimony he is to make Monday,
he's already at a disadvantage, Brenner said. He'll be going
head-on with a prosecutor who wants to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a prosecutor brings somebody in, he doesn't care about
the information. He wants to try and see if the person will lie,
and then prosecute him for perjury,'' she said. ``There's no reason
to bring Clinton in except to try to trap him into perjury. To lie
in front of a grand jury is the most dangerous thing in the world.
That's why I find this case so fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Clinton's advisers were reportedly urging him to be
firm, succinct _ and vague when needed. Can he safely avoid giving
details of his interaction with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   ``That could be very difficult,'' Brenner said. ``The prosecutor
will ask, `Were you alone together on such and such a date?'
Clinton can say yes or no. Then they can follow up with questions
designed to elicit the details. If Clinton gives very limited
answers, they can ask additional questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Brenner said Clinton attorney David Kendall could challenge a
question on the basis of ``some kind of privilege, including the
Fifth Amendment. But once you answer on a topic, you may have
waived your privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   A controversy over privilege could go before the federal judge
who presides over the grand jury, Brenner said. That would again
delay the process.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has every right to take the Fifth Amendment and refuse
to answer questions, the professor said.
</P>
<P>
   America's founders designed the amendment as a counterweight to
the old English grand jury system, ``a shield for the innocent
against government oppression,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury dates to the 12th century in England. It has
always conducted its work in secret. It has never needed just cause
to issue subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   When someone testifies, normally no defense attorney is present,
no judge decides if a question is relevant, no question is too out
of bounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination makes sense,
Brenner said: ``It's any citizen's right not to cooperate with
someone who is after you.''
</P>
<P>
   Politically, however, she conceded, ``Most Americans see taking
the Fifth as admitting you're guilty, like some mobster using it.''
</P>
<P>
   If a witness refuses to answer a question for reasons other than
the Fifth Amendment, the prosecutor can seek to have the witness
jailed for contempt, for as long as the grand jury sits. That's
what happened to Susan McDougal, who was jailed for 22 months.
</P>
<P>
   People don't understand that a grand jury is not like the trial
juries they see on TV shows, Brenner said. ``It's not like a trial
jury. It's a police investigation.''
</P>

COMMENTARY: CLINTON'S OWN WEB

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Headlines are calling it the moment of truth. We'll
see.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential candidate Bill Clinton went on the ``60 Minutes''
program right after the Super Bowl in late January 1992 to clear up
the Gennifer Flowers mess. The idea was to tell the truth, to be
straight with the American people, and thus save his damaged
candidacy. Here's what happened. With more than 30 million viewers
looking on, and with Hillary Clinton at his side, he lied.
</P>
<P>
   It worked. The Flowers story, replete with taped conversations
between Ms. Flowers and Clinton, was so sordid the press was
uncomfortable with it and the public soon grew sick of it. When
Clinton came in second in the New Hampshire primary in February, he
dubbed himself ``the comeback kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the ``60 Minutes'' appearance, Clinton was
facing new questions about how he had avoided the draft during the
war in Vietnam. He didn't want to be seen as a draft dodger. If he
won the nomination, he would be facing George Bush, who had a
strong record of service in World War II. So, as he so often does,
Clinton gave the truth the slip.
</P>
<P>
   Had he received a draft notice or not? Did he escape simply by
virtue of a high number in the draft lottery or had he pulled
strings? Was he a committed anti-war activist willing to pay a
price for sticking by his principles, or just a coward willing to
let others fight and perhaps die in his place?
</P>
<P>
   Who knew? The candidate told so many stories, crafted so many
evasive answers, came up with so many lame excuses that he gave
everybody a headache. The public got tired of the matter and the
story went away.
</P>
<P>
   It took Clinton years to come up with the classic ``I didn't
inhale'' response to questions about marijuana. He danced around
that issue like Fred Astaire, saying he hadn't broken this law, or
violated that statute. We've gotten used to it. It's as if the idea
of a straight answer to a difficult question is completely alien to
the man.
</P>
<P>
   Now he is going before a federal grand jury in an effort to
salvage what remains of his presidency. Just about every question
he'll be asked will be tough. The danger is that he has woven so
many lies he'll be trapped in his own insidious web.
</P>
<P>
   The issue at the moment is not about impeachment. The
Republicans have neither the clout nor the inclination, based on
what is now known, to remove Clinton from office. Rather than
fiddling with the dangerously unpredictable bomb of impeachment,
the Trent Lotts, Newt Gingriches and Orrin Hatches of the world
would much rather see the president, the hope of so many Democrats,
sitting humiliated in the White House through the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The real issue is the president's relationship with the American
people. Clinton's poll numbers may be high but the nation's sense
of trust in its president is collapsing. He lied about Gennifer
Flowers. He seems to have lied about Monica Lewinsky. Why would it
not be plausible to believe he lied about Paula Jones and Kathleen
Willey? Or, for that matter, about delicate foreign policy issues,
or legislative deal-making, or favors granted to fund-raisers?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's strength in the polls, I think, is the result of an
economy that is going well, the contemptible qualities of so many
of his enemies, the reluctance of a large number of Americans to
turn even more power over to the ideologues in the Republican
Party, and certain personal qualities that have long benefited
Clinton _ his charm, intelligence, good looks, work ethic,
resilience and toughness.
</P>
<P>
   None of this will matter if he lies to the grand jury, or if he
looks the public in the eye and lies again about that woman, Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is getting advice, solicited and unsolicited, from many
quarters. Most of his longtime advisers and close friends are
urging him, directly or indirectly, to tell the full truth to the
grand jury and the public.
</P>
<P>
   Is he capable of telling the truth when the going gets tough?
Who knows. If it turns out he's not, the last two years of his
already damaged presidency won't be worth much. At some point the
public will lose its patience, even with Bill Clinton.

   Following are biographies of Jackie Bennett and Robert Bittman,
two of the chief prosecutors in the office of Whitewater
independent counsel Kenneth Starr, which, after months
investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter, will question President
Clinton on Monday before a federal grand jury. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jackie Bennett
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Jackie M. Bennett Jr. is an overly aggressive
questioner or a principled, straight-shooting public servant,
depending on who ventures an opinion.
</P>
<P>
   One of Kenneth Starr's top deputies, Bennett has questioned some
of the more important witnesses before the grand jury investigating
the Lewinsky matter. Not many lawyers or witnesses would comment on
his tactics.
</P>
<P>
   However, Gloria Cabe, chief of staff for Bill Clinton when he
was governor of Arkansas, would. She recalls that Bennett was
``extraordinarily rude'' to her during a grand jury appearance in
an investigation of the financing of Clinton's 1990 gubernatorial
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Goldstein, a lawyer who won a 1993 courtroom duel in San
Antonio against Bennett, would agree. Bennett was then senior trial
lawyer in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Division.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bully,'' Goldstein said then after winning an acquittal
for a client prosecuted by Bennett. He told The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram that Bennett had used his power to intimidate ``every
potential witness, no matter how large or small.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bennett rode out of San Antonio with a big trophy _ the
racketeering and bribery conviction of former Rep. Albert G.
Bustamante, D-Texas. For that he won the Justice Department's top
honor for prosecutors, the John Marshall Award.
</P>
<P>
   He also won the respect of the trial judge. ``Very
professional,'' said Judge Edward Prado of federal District Court,
a former U.S. Attorney. ``He's tough but he played within the
rules.''
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, who is in his early 40s, is a bulldog in appearance as
well as personality, rather like the offensive tackle he was, for
Hanover College in Indiana. He went on to Indiana University Law
School and became a federal prosecutor in Indiana. His friends say
he is charming and friendly, at least out of court. He and his
wife, Cindy, have four young sons.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bittman
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Though he is only in his mid-30s, Robert J.
Bittman, the youngest of Kenneth Starr's deputies, has instant name
recognition among lawyers. He is the son of William O. Bittman,
nationally known as both a prosecutor and a defense counsel whose
targets included former Teamster boss Jimmy Hoffa and whose clients
have included Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Bittman is known as a dogged researcher willing to put in
long hours to untangle complicated cases. He has been active in the
questioning of witnesses before the Lewinsky grand jury. Early on,
he was opposed to making a deal with Ms. Lewinsky, and instead
advocated a thorough investigation to try to corroborate her
accusations, including questioning Secret Service agents and
officers.
</P>
<P>
   Bittman graduated from the University of Maryland and the
Columbus School of Law at Catholic University in Washington. He
worked for a small firm in Rockville, Md., before joining the
prosecutor's office in Anne Arundel County, Md., in 1988, making
cases against drunks, con men and murderers. He joined Starr in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bittman was described by former Anne Arundel colleagues as
friendly, bright and tireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the kind of lawyer who didn't leave any stone unturned,''
Cynthia Ferris, a former prosecutor whom Bittman considers a
mentor, told The Baltimore Sun recently. ``If there's anything to
be found there, he'll find it.''

DAVENPORT COMES OF AGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANHATTAN BEACH _ Lindsay Davenport stood over six feet by her
Sweet Sixteenth birthday. In those days, her dreams were the only
things about her that weren't oversized.
</P>
<P>
   She had no designs on the No. 1 ranking that Monica Seles had
wrested from Steffi Graf the previous year at the age of 17. All
Davenport wanted from tennis back in 1992 was a free ride to
Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never playing tennis to become a pro-level player,''
Davenport said. ``All I wanted was to get a college scholarship to
Stanford, because my dad said it was too expensive for him (to foot
the bill).''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport laughed at the recollection, reveling in the irony
that is her wonderful life. Because these days, money most
definitely is not keeping her from becoming a coed at Stanford. Her
tennis is.
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old on Sunday upended No. 1-ranked Martina Hingis
4-6, 6-4, 6-3 in the final of the Acura Classic to collect her
third consecutive winner's check. Like a bill collector, Davenport
has traveled up and down her native state this past month, settling
old and imagined debts.
</P>
<P>
   She beat Graf and upstart Venus Williams on her way to the title
at Stanford, Seles and Mary Pierce en route to victory at Carlsbad
and Seles in straight sets in the semifinals here. Davenport,
ranked No. 2 with a bullet, also added wins in doubles up North and
down South, bringing her three-week earnings to $260,750.
</P>
<P>
   That should be enough to pay college tuition, room and board for
herself, her niece Kennedy, who turned 1 on Sunday, all her cousins
and any other nieces, nephews, sons or daughters who come along.
</P>
<P>
   Sons and daughters? That's another funny thing about the place
that Davenport suddenly finds herself. The introverted teen-ager
whose height had would-be male suitors recoiling in fear _ the
world's top female tennis players know the feeling _ now is a
gushing geyser of a woman who has male admirers yelling ``Lindsay,
I love you'' during her matches.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport appreciates the sentiments, even if they are about,
oh, four years too late to ease the social awkwardness that
shadowed her during her days as a student at Murrieta Valley High.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think being so tall so young made me a much stronger
person,'' Davenport said. ``I was so much more sensitive about (my
height) at 16, 17 than I am now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of my height now,'' she said, pulling her shoulders
back and adjusting her posture to its full position of 6 feet 2{.
</P>
<P>
   Before Davenport dropped 30 pounds from her frame, beating her
used to require little more than patience and a deft drop shot.
Players would run Davenport ragged and she'd become enraged at
herself. And next thing she knew, she'd be at the net shaking hands
with her conqueror.
</P>
<P>
   Conditioning and the confidence that comes from
back-to-back-to-back success have made a huge difference in
Davenport's game. On Sunday, after both players held their serve in
the first set, Davenport ran down a ball deep on her backhand side
and, in one fluid move, hit a passing shot for a triple-break
point.
</P>
<P>
   Hingis salvaged the next two points before Davenport put the
game away with a sizzling forehand. Davenport went up 4-2 in the
set before Hingis, helped along by two of her 10 aces and two of
Davenport's three double faults, reeled off the next four games to
take the first set.
</P>
<P>
   Undeterred, Davenport broke Hingis in her second service game of
the second set and ultimately won the set on a botched drop shot by
Hingis. Hingis persisted in hitting short volleys in the third set
and Davenport made her pay, passing her for winners.
</P>
<P>
   Fittingly, the longest point was the last one, with both players
imitating backboards until Davenport unleashed the purest backhand
passing shot this side of Tracy Austin, who, as it so happened, was
doing television commentary on the match a few yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Several of the balls she hit were amazing,'' Hingis said. ``On
the run, she hit corners. What can you do about that?''
</P>
<P>
   If Hingis wants to hang on to her No. 1 ranking, she better hit
the weight room. Granted, Hingis played doubles here while
Davenport concentrated on singles. But the Swiss Miss was sagging
visibly before the singles final was 45 minutes old. At 17, her
energy reserves should be endless.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the No.1 ranking tends to wrap itself around players
like a 10-pound ankle weight. Rare is the athlete who doesn't find
it infinitely harder to stay on top than to get there.
</P>
<P>
   Being a target is tiring. Just ask Hingis, who assumed the top
spot on March 31 of last year. She sounded world-weary when she
said of the third set, ``You get a little tired and you can't
concentrate anymore, or you are not really focused anymore. I
wasn't used to it, because I always had great returns. Whenever I
needed it, I would win or I would break the opponent. So that has
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport might not have set out to become No. 1. But now that
she's closing fast on Hingis, whom she has beaten twice in three
meetings this year, she has her eyes wide open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is harder to be (Number) One,'' she said. ``It is
tough to always stay up and to always be motivated to win every
tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, outside the media tent, she confessed, ``I
don't really want the spotlight. Being Number One has never been
important to me, although it would be unbelievable if it happened.
For me, it's always been about improving and being a consistent
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's game is in such good shape, she's liable to run down
even those things she never dreamed she'd be chasing.

SINGH WINS HIS FIRST MAJOR CHAMPIONSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ As he walked up the 18th fairway Sunday en
route to the most gratifying moment of his career, Vijay Singh was
momentarily engulfed by the gallery rushing to congratulate him.
But then Singh casually emerged from the crowd, calmly separating
himself from everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Unflappable to the end, Singh was alone at the top, winning the
PGA Championship by trusting his newly consistent putting stroke
and his reliable ball-striking, an ability formed through years of
dedication and countless hours of practice. Prevailing over the
challenge of Sahelee Country Club, a world-class field and the
suffocating pressure that comes with Sunday afternoon at a major
championship, Singh won his first major championship.
</P>
<P>
   Shooting a steady and resourceful 2-under-par 68, Singh finished
at 9-under 271 for the tournament, two strokes ahead of Steve
Stricker and three strokes better than Steve Elkington. Stricker
shot a 70 Sunday, and Elkington made a serious run with a
final-round 67.
</P>
<P>
   It was the end of a long journey for Singh, whose career has
carried him from his native Fiji to Malaysia, Nigeria and Morocco
and finally to the PGA Tour, where he has earned a reputation as
one of the game's hardest-working and most consistent players. At
35, Singh felt a major championship was the missing piece in his
career. So after Sunday's victory, he felt a deep sense of
satisfaction, knowing he had paid his dues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe I've won this tournament,'' said Singh,
moments after he had earned the first-place check of $540,000. ``I
was laying awake last night at two o'clock, wondering what would
happen today. My wife said, `Are you asleep?' I said, `Yeah, I'm
asleep.'''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, Singh was wide awake, thinking about his game plan,
and Sunday he executed it. Starting the day tied with Stricker,
Singh took sole possession of the lead for good on the sixth hole,
and while he could never relax until after his final putt dropped,
Singh made pressure shots and avoided the crucial mistakes that led
to the demise of other contenders.
</P>
<P>
   The final turning point of the tournament came on No. 17, a
difficult 215-yard par 3, with water on the right side of the
green, and a bunker on the left. Singh reached No. 17 holding a
one-stroke lead over Stricker, but with 17 and the even more
difficult 18th hole still ahead, the outcome was very much in
doubt.
</P>
<P>
   Both players felt the pressure, hitting their tee shots into the
greenside bunker. But Singh recovered for par, while Stricker did
not. Singh's bunker shot landed about 15 feet short of the pin,
while Stricker hit his bunker shot to within 12 feet. But Singh,
using a new cross-handed putting style that he started last month,
knocked in his putt to save par. Then Stricker missed his attempt
for par just left of the hole, giving Singh a two-stroke lead with
one hole to play. From there, Singh made a routine par at No. 18
and savored the victory, while Stricker thought about the
opportunity that had slipped away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I struggled with my emotions and with my swing,'' said
Stricker, who pushed Singh until the end, and recorded his fifth
top-10 finish in his last six starts. ``I had an opportunity to put
a little pressure on Vijay at No. 17, because I had first tee
there, and I didn't hit a very good shot. ``To win this tournament
would have meant a lot. It's hard not to let those thoughts creep
into your mind. It's a little bit of a consolation finishing
second, but I came here thinking I could win. Then again, I hung in
there and played well.''
</P>
<P>
   With the victory, Singh became the 10th player in the last 11
years to win his first major at the PGA. And the result ended Mark
O'Meara's bid to become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to
win three majors in the same year. O'Meara shot a 68 Sunday and
finished tied for fourth place at 4 under par (276) with Nick
Price, who shot the day's best score (65), and Frank Lickliter, who
shot a 68. O'Meara made an early run, making a 40-foot putt for
eagle at No. 2, then making a birdie on No. 5 to pull within two
strokes of the lead. But O'Meara faltered on the next three holes,
making three consecutive bogeys, and he never seriously threatened
thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a tremendous honor to go alongside Ben
Hogan's name, but it just wasn't meant to be,'' said O'Meara,
winner of this year's Masters and the British Open. ``I'm
disappointed I didn't win, but it was great to see all the people
out here pulling for me.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One by one, the other contenders dropped off like dominos,
leaving Singh and Stricker to decide the final outcome. Price
eagled No. 11 to reach for under par, but he never made another
birdie. Davis Love III, the defending champion, finished tied for
seventh (270), seeing his hopes ruined by a double-bogey at No. 5,
when he hit his tee shot into the water. Tiger Woods never made a
charge and shot a 71 Sunday, finishing tied for 10th (279).
</P>
<P>
   Elkington, the 1995 PGA champion, made a serious bid to win,
getting to within two strokes of the lead when he birdied No. 11,
and almost making an eagle there. Elkington's 15-foot putt attempt
for eagle at No. 11 rimmed out of the cup, forcing him to settle
for birdie. Then Elkington's final hope for victory ended when he
bogeyed No. 18, putting him the clubhouse at 6 under par, while
Singh was still on the course at 9 under. But while Elkington was
disappointed, he was encouraged by his third place finish, in a
season that has been marred by sinus problems and meningitis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm making a comeback,'' said Elkington. ``But Vijay is a good
friend of mine. He has worn that tag of being a good player that
has never won a major. He will be a good champion. It's good to
see. He has had an enormously difficult road to pick up that
trophy.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh showed all his talents Sunday, and he also took advantage
of breaks. On his second shot at the par 5 No. 11, Singh hit an
errant 3-wood that hit a tree to the right of the green, but it
ricocheted left and rolled onto the green, stopping about 25 feet
from the cup. Singh might not have gotten a bounce any better if he
hit that tree 100 times. From there, he two-putted for a birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a relief to see the ball come onto the green,'' said
Singh.
</P>
<P>
   Singh got another break on No. 14 that he made the most of.
After pulling his tee shot deep into the trees, he hit a delicate
wedge shot through a small opening and onto the green, showing his
touch by intentionally hooking the ball left-to-right, the only
shot he had out of the trees. Singh two-putted from 40 feet to save
par, then made a crucial birdie on No. 15, hitting a radar-like
pitching wedge to within 8 feet of the hole, then making the putt.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 14, I just started to concentrate harder on what I was
doing,'' said Singh. ``I didn't want it to slip away.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not. Singh finally had his long-sought major. Vijay means
`victory'' in Hindu. And Sunday, the name fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``To win one of these is like a dream,'' said Singh. ``I have to
wait for it to sink in.''

CORPORATE HEAVYWEIGHTS FIGHT REFORM IN LOS ANGELES CITY GOVERNMENT
</HEADLINE>
 (with BC-REFORM-HISTORY-LADN and BC-REFORM-LIST-LADN, all for use
by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK MCGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With an our-way-or-else ultimatum, a group of
powerful, downtown corporate executives has raised serious doubts
about efforts to reform Los Angeles city government.
</P>
<P>
   Protective of their influence at City Hall and mistrustful of
homeowner organizations, the Los Angeles Business Advisors has
threatened to use its power and money to defeat efforts to reform
the City Charter in next year's city elections if elected, powerful
neighborhood councils are included.
</P>
<P>
   Formed quietly two years ago with $40,000 each from 24
executives _ almost all from downtown corporations such as Times
Mirror, the parent company of the Los Angeles Times _ LABA started
with a vague agenda of improving the local business environment
while working behind the scenes in support of such uncontroversial
civic projects as funding for the Disney Concert Hall.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, with reform of city government at a critical
point, LABA has gone public in a big way, revealing its members'
identities and taking center stage with a clear agenda in a highly
politicized area.
</P>
<P>
   LABA declared war on proposals to shift some of the power from
City Hall to elected neighborhood councils vested with
decision-making authority, put forward its own plan for 35 council
districts and threatened to ``vigorously campaign'' against charter
reform if a plan for neighborhood councils is put before voters.
</P>
<P>
   The threat has sparked widespread suspicion among backers of
neighborhood empowerment _ from public employee unions to homeowner
groups _ that LABA's power and money will turn political reform
into a step back to the past for the city.
</P>
<P>
   LABA has grown to a committee of 26 and the parallels with Los
Angeles' past Committee of 25 _ led by the Chandler family that
owned the Los Angeles Times and Times Mirror _ are unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   With Times Publisher and Times Mirror CEO Mark H. Willes and two
other Times Mirror board members among LABA's leaders, many fear
that a new corporate oligarchy is attempting to reassert control
over civic affairs, much as the old Committee of 25 did for years
until the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are fellow travelers in the corporate boardrooms who
want to further take power from the community and concentrate it
downtown with whatever mayor they can buy,'' said Julie Butcher,
general manager of Local 347 of the Service Employees International
Union, a 10,000-member blue-collar union.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Fine of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon
Associations, a coalition of homeowners groups, said the days when
an elite group of corporate executives can decide what's best for
Los Angeles must not be revived.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a lot of influence and a lot of power,'' Fine said.
``They can get what they want with a few phone calls. Their
predecessors were the same ones that brought us water. But it is
time for the benevolent dictatorship to cease. It's time to give
the people some power.''
</P>
<P>
   Others have a more benign view and don't think LABA will be able
to wield such extensive influence on the charter reform debate.
</P>
<P>
   Still, questions have been raised about LABA's legitimacy and
the role of the Los Angeles Times, the largest newspaper in
California, and the nine corporate members based outside Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly half the LABA members are not residents of the city.

   Willes was on vacation and unavailable for comment, said Mike
Lange, communications manager for the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Lange said Willes is a member as ``a corporate citizen.'' Lange
and other Times representatives said they could not say whether a
donation was made by the corporation or by Willes as an individual.
</P>
<P>
   Although LABA officials acknowledged each member must meet the
$40,000 donation requirement, Lange insisted Times Mirror corporate
policy is not to make contributions to political campaigns or to
donate to people advocating ballot initiatives, such as creation of
the charter reform commission that LABA members backed.
</P>
<P>
   He said any financial involvement at this point in LABA would be
consistent with that policy because the debate on neighborhood
councils has not reached the ballot yet. The initiative required
that a charter reform proposal go on the ballot next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems far removed from the political process,'' Lange said.

U.N. COUNCIL PREPARES MILD REPLY TO IRAQ 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By PAUL LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ The U.N. Security Council is preparing a
low-keyed response to Saddam Hussein's latest attempt to frustrate
its arms inspectors. The response reflects the deep divisions among
members over its approach to Iraq, as well as the unwillingness of
the United States and Britain to threaten military action as they
did during the last standoff, in February.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with Iraq's defiant refusal to cooperate any more with the
U.N. inspectors who are trying to eliminate Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction, the Security Council is scheduled to debate a draft
declaration Monday that acknowledges that its plans to disarm Iraq
have suffered a setback. The draft simply instructs the inspectors
to press ahead with their work and report any further Iraqi
obstruction.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is the alternative?'' said the representative of one of
the five permanent Security Council members, speaking on condition
of anonymity. ``We have no volunteers for military action. Not a
single one.''
</P>
<P>
   The latest conflict between the United Nations and Iraq erupted
last week when the two agencies charged with eliminating Iraq's
nuclear, chemical and biological weapons _ the U.N. Special
Commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency _ told the
Security Council that Iraq's refusal to cooperate had halted their
disarmament activities and threatened the long-term monitoring
crucial to prevent Baghdad from restarting its prohibited weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The draft reply to these agencies' complaint, which the Security
Council will consider Monday and which diplomats say appears to
have widespread support, makes no threats of military action
against Iraq if it continues to defy the inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it recalls that the council has already condemned
Iraq's refusal to cooperate as ``totally unacceptable.'' And it
acknowledges that ``under current circumstances'' the inspectors
cannot assure the council that Iraq will not ``re-establish its
proscribed weapons program.''
</P>
<P>
   But it also reminds them that they still have a mandate to
``carry out a full range of activities including inspections'' and
says they should report back to the Security Council if they are
``hindered in any way from undertaking these activities.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the council expresses hope that the current visit to
Baghdad by a U.N. mediator, Prakash Shah of India, will result in
the ``full resumption of cooperation'' between Iraq and the
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   When the Security Council met informally on Thursday to consider
the standoff, diplomats say, divisions between its members quickly
became apparent. The United States and Britain pushed for an
immediate and firm reply, which they wanted the council to issue
the following day.
</P>
<P>
   But Russia, which leads those in favor of relaxing the sanctions
imposed on Iraq after it invaded Kuwait in 1990, called for a
delay. And in the end a majority of members supported Sweden's
proposal that the council postpone any action until this week to
give Shah more time to pursue his efforts in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Japan circulated the draft reply to the
inspection agencies that the council is to debate Monday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   U.S. and British diplomats acknowledge that the Security Council
has no appetite for a repeat of February's confrontation with
Baghdad, when only a last-minute agreement between Saddam and
Secretary General Kofi Annan prevented new military strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But they say Saddam now appears to have broken that agreement,
which was unanimously endorsed by the Security Council, by saying
he will no longer cooperate with the arms inspectors, although it
is not yet absolutely clear what this means in practical terms.
</P>
<P>
   By avoiding threats and simply telling the arms inspectors to
continue their work as best they can, these diplomats argue that
the council will test Iraq's true intentions and, if Baghdad
remains defiant, eventually force all members to face the fact that
their orders are being flouted.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the inspection agencies say, Iraq is stopping them
from following up fresh intelligence by visiting new sites. Instead
they are limited to around 300 weapons sites, where they have
already found evidence of prohibited weapons production.
</P>
<P>
   Although they say Iraq's nuclear weapons programs have probably
now been effectively dismantled, they continue to have reservations
about the degree of disarmament achieved in the fields of
biological and chemical weaponry.
</P>
<P>
   Traces of the VX nerve gas recently found on missile warheads
cast doubt on Iraq's claim that although it produced some 3.9 tons
of that deadly substance, it never loaded it into a weapon, as well
as raising questions about the total number of special missile
warheads Iraq says it manufactured for delivering other chemical
and biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also refusing to hand over documents arms inspectors
have seen that record its use of chemical weapons during its war
with Iran. The inspection agencies say the documents would help
them verify the scale and nature of its chemical weapons program.

LOS ANGELES: process,'' Lange said.
<TEXT>
<P>
   LABA members said they have no intent to dictate how Los Angeles
will be run and have the city's best interests in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can make a contribution,'' said LABA board member
Eli Broad, chairman and chief executive officer of SunAmerica Inc.,
a $55 billion financial services company specializing in retirement
savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we can use our leadership ability to help make Los
Angeles a better city.''
</P>
<P>
   The CEOs of some of the region's largest companies came together
two years ago to fill a vacuum of leadership in civic affairs by
the business community, according to Broad, a close friend and
adviser of Mayor Richard Riordan, his neighbor in Brentwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no such group,'' Broad recalled. ``The purpose of
getting together was to talk about what was needed in the
community.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the group's organizers included Atlantic Richfield Co.
CEO Mike R. Bowlin, who is now LABA's chairman, and Edison
International CEO John E. Bryson, both of whom are also friends of
the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The LABA board also includes Bruce Karatz, chairman of Kaufman
and Broad. Karatz, who last week hosted President Clinton for a
political fund-raiser at his large home in Santa Monica, is also a
close friend of Riordan's, having chaired the mayor's task force to
raise money to provide computers for the Los Angeles Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Other LABA board members include Tom McKernan, CEO of the Auto
Club of Southern California, and Ronald Burkle, head of The Yucaipa
Cos., which owned Food 4 Less and Ralphs supermarkets. The group
includes CEOs for major corporations including Hilton Hotels Corp.,
BankAmerica Corp., Wells Fargo Bank and H.F. Ahmanson and Co.
</P>
<P>
   Stung by criticism that it was another group of white males, the
group added attorney Joan Payden, a resident of Santa Monica, to
its membership and Japanese executive Yoshio Ishizaka, the head of
Toyota Motor Sales USA Inc., based in Torrance.
</P>
<P>
   The newest member is Los Angeles attorney Warren Christopher,
the former U.S. secretary of state who headed the citizen
commission that investigated the LAPD after the Rodney King
beating.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 26 corporations represented on LABA, 17 are headquartered
in Los Angeles, while two _ Wells Fargo and BankAmerica _ are based
in San Francisco. Two firms have their headquarters in Beverly
Hills, two in Pasadena and one each in Torrance, El Segundo and
Irwindale.
</P>
<P>
   McKernan said LABA's goal is to give business a stronger voice
in civic affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some time now, with all of the changes in the Los Angeles
business community, there's been some criticism that business isn't
as involved as it should be in civic affairs,'' McKernan said.
``There is a vibrant, intelligent group of business leaders that
can at least add to the discussion.''
</P>
<P>
   The original mission statement of the group talked about the
need ``to create an environment in Greater Los Angeles in which
business can succeed and generate jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad said the group has focused on welfare and reform of Los
Angeles' education system among other issues.
</P>
<P>
   On charter reform, the group has retained some of the city's
premier lobbyists and political consultants, including Cerrell
Associates, the Kamber Group and former Deputy Mayor Mike Keeley.
</P>
<P>
   The group fought unsuccessfully behind the scenes against the
city's adoption of a ``living wage'' ordinance and is entering the
fray in support of expansion of Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   LABA was instrumental in the effort to save the foundering
Disney Concert Hall project, which has since achieved its
fund-raising goals.
</P>
<P>
   For most of its first two years, the group worked in a cloak of
secrecy, refusing to reveal its members or budget.

LOS ANGELES: its members or budget.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today, the group still won't talk about its budget and says it's
premature to discuss how much it might spend on the charter reform
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At least 11 board members live outside the city, including two
who live in San Marino, two in Pasadena, two in Santa Monica, one
in Beverly Hills, one in La Canada Flintridge, one in Orange
County, one in Valencia and one in Arcadia, according to voter
registration records and interviews.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Rinehart, who heads the parent company of Home Savings,
lives in Orange County, although he will soon be leaving the group
because of a company merger.
</P>
<P>
   The significant membership from outside the city draws charges
of carpetbagging from Los Angeles activists, including Richard
Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Association and
chairman of Valley Voters Organized Toward Empowerment, the group
petitioning for a study of San Fernando Valley secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because many of them live in Santa Monica and Beverly Hills,
they don't have to live with the consequence of their actions,''
Close said.
</P>
<P>
   Fine said she is outraged that charter reform might be dominated
by people who live and work outside the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have absolutely no business dictating to the city of Los
Angeles how a city of over 3.5 million people should be run,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles, who ran against Riordan
last year, said it is ironic that many of the corporate leaders
already enjoy in their small towns what Los Angeles residents are
seeking, a government that is closer and more accessible.
</P>
<P>
   Living outside Los Angeles destroys their credibility for
participating in the neighborhood council debate, Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people who would be less concerned with neighborhood
issues such as air pollution, traffic congestion and
overdevelopment in Los Angeles because they don't live in these
neighborhoods,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McKernan, a resident of Arcadia, said LABA board members who do
not live in Los Angeles still care about the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``As large employers we have an interest in the future of Los
Angeles,'' said McKernan, whose company employs 6,000 people and is
headquartered in Los Angeles, although it recently moved many of
its offices to Costa Mesa.
</P>
<P>
   He said the group is approaching issues from a regional
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter where you live in Southern California, Los Angeles
has an influence on you,'' McKernan said. ``So we all should
contribute positively to Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Brian D'Arcy, who heads a DWP union, said he is not concerned
that some LABA members live outside Los Angeles. ``They certainly
have an economic interest in the city,'' D'Arcy said, adding that
he also opposes elected neighborhood councils.
</P>
<P>
   Political scientist Fernando Guerra also believes LABA's role is
a positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important,'' said Guerra, who heads Loyola
Marymount University's Center for the Study of Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Since the late 1970s, Los Angeles has lacked a corporate
community with a strong voice, Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of the Los Angeles business community in the past
is that it had distanced itself and disassociated itself from civic
concerns,'' Guerra said. ``They need to reassert themselves. But if
they do it in a way that alienates other stakeholders it's not
productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of style.''

LOS ANGELES: question of style.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKernan dismissed concerns that LABA represents a return to the
old Committee of 25, which would set policy for the city, hand-pick
political candidates and tell them how to vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a different time,'' he said. ``Perhaps Los Angeles
was more monolithic then. It isn't now. I don't think this group
has any delusions that it can control the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad agreed, saying: ``Times have changed. We're advisory.''
</P>
<P>
   Other observers like Guerra said the city is less homogenous
today and less likely to be influenced by a corporate elite.
</P>
<P>
   The old committee represented firms that employed a much higher
percentage of the city's population and generated much more of its
economic output than the new group, Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   He also noted LABA lacks representation from some of the biggest
sectors of the city's economy, including the entertainment
industry, which dilutes its influence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It appears to me that they've annoyed some people on charter
reform by saying, this is our position _ as if they have a veto on
the thing,'' Guerra said.
</P>
<P>
   LABA President Sam Bell angered many people earlier this month
when he announced that the group would use its financial and
political muscle to defeat any proposed city charter that calls for
elected neighborhood councils.
</P>
<P>
   ``If required, we will vigorously campaign against elected
neighborhood councils if they are included in a new city charter
ballot measure,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Erwin Chemerinsky, chairman of the elected Charter Reform
Commission, said the threat is not productive to efforts to reach a
consensus on reform.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are using the rhetoric of threats,'' Chemerinsky said.
``I believe that the business community is very important to pay
attention to, but I do not believe our commission is going to be
intimidated by what they are saying.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Butcher, whose union has been a leading proponent of
powerful neighborhood councils, ``I think it's pretty outrageous
for them to draw this line in the sand at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   While other downtown groups have lined up with LABA, the most
influential Valley group, the Valley Industry and Commerce
Association, voted to back a strong form of neighborhood councils
despite an intense lobbying effort by downtown business interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where the battle lines have been drawn,'' said Scott, a
Woodland Hills attorney and VICA board member. ``They (LABA) are
downtown interests that believe all power and resources should
remain downtown and that the Valley is a colony and we should keep
our mouths shut.''
</P>
<P>
   Broad and McKernan said the whole city will suffer if the city
bureaucracy is expanded to include another level of
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're concerned about creating another layer of government,''
Broad said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have elected neighborhood councils we think it will be a
disaster for the city. You will end up with a lot of political
wanna-bes who want to run for school board or the City Council,
rather than volunteers who care about the city.''

LOS ANGELES: about the city.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   McKernan said the city was not a friendly place to do business
before Riordan won election and streamlined government.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very tough issue. People want more representation. By
the same token, it wasn't too long ago that everyone was
complaining that it took too long to get things done,'' McKernan
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily the concern is balancing more representation and
more input with the ability to move and get things done,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   The LABA plan for charter reform would provide the Mayor's
Office with more authority to run the city on a day-to-day basis
while expanding the City Council from 15 to 35 members to provide
better representation and access.
</P>
<P>
   Despite LABA's public ultimatum, some of its board members said
privately that they might accept advisory neighborhood councils
appointed by the City Council.
</P>
<P>
   Close said LABA's position has put it on a collision course with
many Valley leaders who see neighborhood empowerment as the only
alternative to secession.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (LABA) are a respected, legitimate organization that has
political clout and can raise a lot of money,'' Close said. ``Their
goals are different from the goals of businesses and residents in
the Valley. That worries me a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no question they are the biggest threat to charter
reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Fine agreed, saying, ``They can do a lot of damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the 15-member elected commission, which has tentatively
endorsed elected councils with decision-making over small local
budgets, the 21-member commission appointed by the City Council has
recommended advisory neighborhood councils controlled by City
Council members.
</P>
<P>
   George Kieffer, chairman of the council-appointed Charter Reform
Commission, said his group's backing of advisory neighborhood
councils was a conclusion reached independently of LABA.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never been done anywhere else in the country,'' he said.
``We made our decision about what we were doing before LABA weighed
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Chemerinsky said LABA's threats may be posturing. ``My hope is
that there is still plenty of opportunity for compromise and
conciliation and the will to come up with a positive resolution.''
</P>
<P>
   Union leader Butcher said there is a coalition of labor,
homeowner leaders and average residents who are willing to fight
LABA at the ballot box if it comes to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, frankly, they've already got all the power they
need,'' Butcher said. ``Whether it is as the downtown power elite
operating out of the 37th floor of some building or living in gated
communities of San Marino and Beverly Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're saying is it's time to spread some of the power out
to the communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Close said LABA's hard-nosed tactics could backfire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their bullying tactics may generate backlash on the commission
and get us what we are asking for,'' Close said.
</P>
<P>
   City Councilwoman Rita Walters agreed, saying, ``I think their
threats will probably have the opposite reaction among the
electorate than they desire.
</P>
<P>
   ``The electorate may feel it's special-interest groups
determining for the people what their government will be,'' she
said. ``I think a lot of people feel that business has an
inordinate influence here anyway.''

IN FLORIDA, GOVERNOR `NO' MAKING LAST-YEAR EFFORT TO KEEP GOP AT
BAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By MIREYA NAVARRO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ In his last year in office, Florida Gov.
Lawton Chiles has been busy saying no.
</P>
<P>
   In a flurry of vetoes this summer after the legislative session,
Chiles, a Democrat, struck down bills passed by the Republican
majority that would have required parental notification of a
teen-ager's plans for abortion, made it more difficult for
consumers to sue businesses, and allowed drivers to purchase
special license plates with the message ``Choose Life.''
</P>
<P>
   The 17 vetoes this year did not rank as a record for Chiles; in
1995 he vetoed 28 bills. But they have come at a critical juncture,
only months from an election in which Republicans, who already
control the House and the Senate, are poised to win the
governorship and thereby dominate state government for the first
time this century. Jeb Bush, the Republican nominee, is considered
to have a commanding lead over his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov.
Kenneth MacKay.
</P>
<P>
   In that context, Chiles, who has sparred with a Republican
legislative majority for the last two years and is barred by law
from seeking a third term, is highlighting the conservative
policies that await if voters throw the Democrats out of the
governor's mansion. It is, in short, a statehouse version of the
rationale for divided government so often made in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview at his office here, Chiles asserted: ``The
Republicans tend to be dominated right now by the Christian right,
the moral right, and they tend to force the agenda for those
Republicans. Just look at the things I vetoed. A lot of items like
that tend to balance out a lot better if you have some check.''
</P>
<P>
   Some items, like bills that would have allowed school prayer and
banned late-term abortions, both of which he vetoed in past years
as well, were actually popular. Even so, those vetoes have not
affected Chiles' standing among voters: A poll last month by
Florida Voter, a nonpartisan polling organization in Fort
Lauderdale, showed his approval rating at 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``People believe he's doing it out of conviction and not out of
political gain,'' said Jim Kane, Florida Voter's chief pollster.
</P>
<P>
   The same poll also found that many voters like a division of
power. Asked whether they thought it was very important, somewhat
important or not important at all to make sure that one party does
not have control of both the state Legislature and the governor's
office, 39 percent of respondents answered ``very important'' and
22 percent answered ``somewhat important.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, MacKay is trailing Bush by anywhere from 12 percent to 20
percent in polls.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican legislators say Democrats had their chance in
the nation's fourth-largest state and now it is their turn. They
say Floridians will notice the change in regime on issues like
taxes, family values and approach to businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're saying to the people of Florida, give us a chance,''
said John Thrasher, a Republican from northeast Florida who is
expected to become House speaker next year. There are 66
Republicans in the House and 54 Democrats; in the Senate,
Republicans outnumber Democrats, 25 to 15. ``If we do something
outlandish the voters are going to tell us at the polls,'' Thrasher
said. ``That's the check that works best.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats counter that when they controlled the Legislature
before Republicans achieved the majority in the Senate in 1994 and
won the House two years later, Democratic rule was mostly in the
hands of what Chiles calls ``maverick Democrats,'' conservatives
who can give a moderate like Chiles as much trouble as the
Republicans. Indeed, Chiles, who counts legislation allowing the
state to sue tobacco companies among his major victories but who
has lost battles over health care and taxes, says he has found it
easier to deal with Republicans now that they have a legislative
majority.
</P>
<P>
   While Democrats still have a slight majority in voter
registration in Florida, their decline in power here in Tallahassee
has been attributed to defections from whites and the influx of
Republican newcomers to Florida. Chiles also faults the role of
redistricting in carving out minority legislative districts that
left white areas open for a Republican takeover.
</P>
<P>
   The party's troubles, which are mirrored elsewhere in the South,
deepened this year after a rift with black political leaders about
the selection of a white legislator over a black legislator as the
House speaker-designate. That conflict has yet to heal, and many
Democrats fear it will cost their party black votes this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats always had fights, always had falling outs,'' Chiles
said. ``It's going to be the people that are going to make the
decision.''.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   By the same token, Chiles said he did not despair thinking what
the Republicans would do to Florida if they took over. Only two
Republican governors, Claude Roy Kirk Jr. (1966-1970) and Robert
Martinez (1986-1990), have served Florida in this century.
</P>
<P>
   ``My view of democracy is that it learns through mistakes,''
said Chiles, a Democrat to the core, who after 40 years in public
office plans to retire to hunt, fish and remain active on
children's issues. ``If the people would choose to have a
Republican governor, I think they'll learn something from that, as
they have the last couple of times they've done that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, with his vetoes, Chiles is attempting a few
lessons on his own.

TELEPHONE WORKERS ON STRIKE AGAINST US WEST

   DENVER _ US West and union representatives held no talks Sunday
on the first day of a strike that followed two days of negotiations
with a federal mediator.
</P>
<P>
   The 34,000 members of the Communications Workers of America are
on strike against US West, a regional Baby Bell based in Denver
that provides telephone service to 25 million customers in 14
states. The workers, who represent more than half of the company's
51,000 employees, walked off the job at midnight. They include
operators, customer service representatives and field technicians,
whose three-year contract expired Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Mahon, a federal mediator, has told both sides to ``reassess
their positions'' until he recalls them to negotiations, US West
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The company said that it offered workers an 18 percent wage
increase over five years and a 20 percent pension increase. The
company's 7,100 technicians were also offered a performance-pay
plan that includes a 20 percent bonus, leaving base salaries
untouched, for meeting targets like completing a certain number of
repair calls.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Cordova, president of the Communications Workers of
America Local 7777, said that the union would not accept the offer.
The major issues for the union are a company proposal of
performance-based pay, a change in health benefits and mandated
overtime, Ms. Cordova said at union headquarters Sunday, where
hours earlier dozens of workers had been making picket signs.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for US West said the company was ``dumbfounded'' by
the union's position. ``We feel like we've offered up an incredibly
generous proposal,'' said David Beigie. ``It's clear they don't
understand what we're offering.''
</P>
<P>
   US West is one of the United States' five regional Bell
telephone companies. Three of the others _ Ameritech, BellSouth and
SBC Communications _ have negotiated new union contracts since last
spring. The fourth, Bell Atlantic, came to terms with the
communications workers last week after a two-day strike.
</P>
<P>
   This is the first strike against US West, which provides service
in Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Iowa, Montana, Minnesota, Nebraska,
New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Utah, Washington
and Wyoming. Only Montana will not be affected, because no workers
there are members of the Communications Workers of America.
</P>
<P>
   The company has sent in 15,000 managers to substitute for the
striking workers. Beigie said local and long-distance services
would not be affected because they are mostly automated, but there
could be delays in repairs, installation and directory-assistance
calls.
</P>
<P>
   For the half-dozen people picketing Sunday outside one of US
West's offices in downtown Denver _ the union expects many more on
Monday _ the company's offer clearly was not acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   Performance-based pay is ``quantity over quality,'' said Antonia
Merino, a 52-year-old grandmother who has been with the company for
27 years as a technical consultant. ``They are more concerned with
sales than service.''
</P>
<P>
   US West officials described their contract offer as ``the best
in the telecommunications industry.'' Beigie said that the
performance-based pay, which has been in effect for sales
associates for three years, was only mandatory for employees hired
after Jan. 1, 1999, and was voluntary for current employees.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``In theory that plan sounds good,'' said Ron Livingston, a
technical consultant who has worked with the company for 10 years.
But it puts the base salary at risk, he said. ``Also, they will
raise the bar for what goals need to be met, so it's always harder
to meet the goals,'' he added. Livingston said the plan could
affect the safety of technicians if they felt compelled to work
``fast and furious'' while on poles or in poor weather.
</P>
<P>
   The pay increase did not impress the union members. ``They are
talking about how great the wage increase is,'' Ms. Cordova said,
``and there's nothing great about it. It's standard for the
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   She also said the company's health plan now covers 100 percent
of premiums for selected insurance companies. Under the proposed
contract, the company would pay 100 percent of premiums for only
one insurer _ or workers could choose to pay a portion of their
premiums under other insurance plans.
</P>
<P>
   Another concern for workers is the mandatory overtime. Union
officials said the company wants to eliminate double-time pay and
increase the number of hours worked before time-and-a-half is paid.

YANKS HONOR RUTH BY BEATING TEXAS, 6-5 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees offered a tribute to Babe Ruth
on the 50th anniversary of his death before Sunday's game with the
Texas Rangers, eliciting respectful cheers from 50,304 fans at
Yankee Stadium. The videotape described how important Ruth was to
the Yankees, so renowned that he is credited, figuratively, with
building the stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Then Bernie Williams provided a real-life tribute by
dramatically ending the game with a ninth-inning homer into the
upper deck off Xavier Hernandez, eliciting raucous cheers as the
Yankees snatched a 6-5 victory from the Rangers. It was a perfect
tribute to Ruth, the Hall of Fame home-run hitter. It was also a
perfect ending to the game for the Yankees, and it showed that they
can be less than perfect and still prevail. Even Ruth would adore
this team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good way to end the game,'' Williams said. ``It was
very exciting. It's very coincidental it came up on that date. It's
a great tribute to his memory. We didn't plan it that way, but it
turned out great.''
</P>
<P>
   Most days, everything turns out great for the Yankees. Even when
David Wells, the ultimate Ruth fan who scrawled Ruth's No. 3 on the
back of his baseball cap, is up in the strike zone and gives up
three homers while laboring to last six innings. The Yankees
survived behind Williams' four hits, part of a 17-hit barrage, and
a dependable bullpen. And they eclipsed another major-league record
in the process.
</P>
<P>
   By winning for the 90th time in 120 games, the Yankees became
the fastest team to reach 90 victories, according to the Elias
Sports Bureau. The 1944 St. Louis Cardinals were also 90-30, but
they had three ties that were not reflected in their record, so it
actually took them 123 games to win 90. The Yankees stand by
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does stagger me,'' Torre said. ``It's incredible to think
of 90 wins by the middle of August. It's a heck of a bite. It's not
that easy to do. So many things can go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday proved that. The Yankees coasted to a 3-0 lead after two
innings as Derek Jeter belted a two-run homer into the upper deck
in right field in the first, the day's first Ruthian shot, and
Darryl Strawberry pounded his team-best 22nd homer into the
right-field bleachers in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Jeter offered tribute to Ruth with his shot, a 391-footer to the
opposite field off Esteban Loaiza. Jeter had never even hit one
there during batting practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a long way,'' said Jeter, who extended his career-high
homer total to 15. ``Babe Ruth must have been up there blowing
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said: ``Guys who have played here and been here don't
remember a right-hander hitting a ball there. When he got back to
the dugout, he said, `Wow.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells, who had pitched three straight complete games, did
not have a strong repertory, and the lead vanished. He surrendered
a two-run homer to Roberto Kelly in the third; a two-run shot to
Royce Clayton in the fourth that faded into the right-field seats
in foul territory and would have caused Ruth to smile, too; and
another homer by Kelly in the fifth, which briefly gave the Rangers
a 5-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a storybook outing for a pitcher who had a Babe Ruth
book and a picture of the Bambino in his locker and who wanted the
Yankees to avenge Saturday's 16-5 thrashing by Texas.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``You don't want to get beat that bad,'' said Wells, who allowed
five earned runs and 10 hits as his earned run average against the
Rangers this season ballooned to 12.46. ``We've put a hurt on teams
like that this year and the best thing is to come back and kick
their behinds. That's embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Yankees tied the score, 5-5, on consecutive singles by
Paul O'Neill and Williams and a double-play ground ball by Tino
Martinez in the fifth, Ramiro Mendoza came on to pitch the seventh
and eighth and throttle Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees stranded two runners in the seventh inning and three
during an agonizing eighth. The Rangers loaded the bases with two
out in the top of the ninth against Mariano Rivera, but Will Clark
cued a soft liner that Jeter neatly fielded on a short hop,
throwing to first for the out.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, a former Yankee, started the ninth by striking out
O'Neill and then made Williams' swing look sick with a nasty
split-finger fastball. But Hernandez threw Williams an inside
fastball on the 0-1 count and Williams' bat suddenly looked
healthier. With one swift, compact swing, Williams sent the
baseball rocketing into Ruth's territory for his 18th homer, and
allowed the Yankees to take three of four from a team they might
see again in October. It was his first game-winning homer since
Game 1 of the 1996 league championship series off Baltimore's Randy
Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything he does really doesn't surprise me because he has the
ability to do it from both sides of the plate,'' Torre said. ``You
half expect him to hit a homer when he's up there.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams was embraced at the plate by 24 teammates. He looked
relieved as he flipped his helmet and his shin guard aside. As
chants of ``Bernie, Bernie'' reverberated around the stadium,
Martinez shoved Williams out of the dugout to accept the adulation.
Williams, no Ruth when it comes to lapping up attention, returned
safely to the dugout after one sheepish wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's what baseball is all about,'' Williams said. ``Are you
kidding me? People have dreams of doing things like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the House that Ruth built.

SPORTS COLUMN: SINGH REMEMBERS SANDY GREENS OF EARLY DAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By GEORGE VECSEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It was 2 a.m., and his wife, Ardena Seth, asked
him if he was asleep, and Vijay Singh said, yes, of course he was
asleep. After all, a man who is about to play for his first major
golf title should be getting a good night's sleep, not tossing and
turning and imagining giant fir trees growing new limbs over the
fairways to swat back his shots.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, Singh did not deny he had trouble sleeping. Neither did
his companion on the four-mile walk through the tall timber, Steve
Stricker, who woke up at 5 a.m. and never got back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Four strokes. That was the advantage the two opponents had over
the field in the Professional Golf Association championship. They
would play together, trying to hold off whatever the accomplished
golfers did ahead of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time you're in the lead, you're bound to be nervous,''
Singh admitted later. ``It's good to be nervous. It makes you
concentrate more.''
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh had time to think in the middle of the night. He had
come further than anybody else in this last of the four major
tournaments that constitute the Grand Slam of golf.
</P>
<P>
   He left Fiji when life become difficult for people of Indian
origin in the mid-1980s, and he became a club professional in
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``You teach a few lessons in the morning and practice all
afternoon,'' he recalled Sunday after he won the PGA by two strokes
over Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're hitting the ball in 100-degree heat and trying to make
some money,'' he said. ``I never thought that I'd ever come to
America, anything like that. My wife and I say we came a long way.
Sometimes my wife says maybe we should just go back there, that it
was the best time of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   People often say that when they have worked their way to another
life, another world. They look back with love and respect for what
they had, for who they were. That would have been all right, too.
</P>
<P>
   But Vijay Singh was a good enough golfer that he went out
searching for championships, and the money they would bring. There
were so many strange golf locales that he found it hard to remember
one.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Africa,'' he said Sunday. ``Playing on sand greens in
Nigeria when I won that championship. It was a learning process.''
</P>
<P>
   He moved to London, and competed on the big-time tour, a man
with a name that means ``victory'' in Hindi. When he got to the
United States, and ran into its racial history, the legacy that
makes Tiger Woods such a double-edged phenomenon, Singh wanted none
of it.
</P>
<P>
   He just wanted to play golf, not deal with the racial anxieties
of another society. He'd paid his dues in Fiji.
</P>
<P>
   Sleep or no sleep, Singh was on the course Sunday, in the last
pair to tee off, at high noon. He is tall and full, almost
diffident, with very little tension or energy to him. If he hit a
ball particularly well, and somebody in the crowd yelped ``you the
man'' or ``nice shot,'' Singh did not acknowledge it. The nerves
had translated into something fine, something precise.
</P>
<P>
   On a course of narrow fairways that demanded accuracy over
distance, Singh kept smacking the ball in the right direction. When
he made a particularly good shot, and the crowd cheered, he waved
one hand, briefly.
</P>
<P>
   He putted cross-handed, the way he learned as a child from his
father in Fiji, the way he did it in Malaysia, where he and his
wife met. Along the line, common wisdom said he ought to break the
cross-handed habit, and he did, going from putter to putter, from
style to style the way some people change cars or hair styles.
Earlier this season, his wife suggested he go back to putting the
way he did when they were young.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said I might as well,'' Singh said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   So he putted the old way all this week in the shadow of the huge
fir trees. On Sunday, his wife and their 8-year-old son, Qass Seth,
were walking the course, on their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to have a heart attack before I get to the top of
this hill,'' she said on the 16th, but she was talking about the
steep climb, not the tension. Her husband was well in control. When
he sank the putt that gave him the title, he gave one more modest
wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always set our minds on a major,'' he said later. ``I
always wanted to win one, but you only have four chances every
year.''
</P>
<P>
   He was asked if the people in Fiji would be celebrating his
victory, and he was not sure. ``The biggest sport in Fiji is
rugby,'' he said. ``Golf is just part-time. I hope I'm a hero
there. I haven't been back there in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   His skill has taken him to other places. Now he has won a major
tournament, and some day soon he and his wife may feel that this,
too, was one of the best times in their lives.

DEVASTED NORTHERN IRELAND TOWN EXAMINES ITS LOSS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   OMAGH, Northern Ireland _ Pregnant with twins, Avril Monaghan
was holding her 18-month-old daughter Maura and standing next to
her 65-year-old mother Mary Grimes, thinking they were safe behind
a police line, when the bomb went off.
</P>
<P>
   In a flash, three generations of that family were killed. A
grandmother, a mother, a child, and children not yet born, all were
wiped out in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   What happened to Avril Monaghan, 30, her mother, and her
children captured, in all its horror, the magnitude of the damage
done by a car bomb that exploded Saturday afternoon in the shopping
district of this market town in County Tyrone.
</P>
<P>
   The history books will record that Saturday's bombing was the
worst single act of terrorism in a conflict that has stretched over
30 years and has included great inhumanity. Twenty-eight people
were killed and 220 were injured. Last night, 103 people were still
hospitalized, 11 of them in critical condition.
</P>
<P>
   The prime ministers of Britain and Ireland met Sunday night and
vowed to track down the bombers, believed to be dissident Irish
republicans who call themselves the ``Real IRA'' and who are
dedicated to wrecking the peace process. The prime ministers said
it was especially dastardly that the bombers had called in an
inaccurate warning that led police unwittingly to move civilians,
many of them mothers with children doing back-to-school shopping,
closer to the hidden bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians continued to squabble over how much the bombing had
destabilized the peace process and the accompanying spirit of
cooperation and accommodation.
</P>
<P>
   But Sunday, as weeping relatives and stunned friends tried to
find out if their loved ones had died or had been injured, it was
hard to dwell on the political fallout of the bombing, so immense
was the suffering in this town of 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   If the minutes that followed the bombing were sheer terror,
Sunday's slow, tedious accounting of the dead and injured was sheer
torture. Relatives and friends of the victims flooded Tyrone County
Hospital, where many of the injured were being treated, and the
Omagh Leisure Center, which had been converted into a makeshift
information center, to learn if their loved ones were killed or
hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Silence hung over much of Omagh, but it was occasionally
shattered by a grief-stricken cry, as news of a death or mutilating
injury was passed on.
</P>
<P>
   Police did not officially name the victims, saying that
relatives were still being contacted last night. But Royal Ulster
Constabulary Superintendent Kevin Sheehy did give an account of the
dead, one that underscored the losses felt across Ireland and
beyond.
</P>
<P>
   Fourteen of the dead were women, five were men, three were
girls, and four were boys. Two of the bodies were so badly
mutilated they have not yet been identified. When Sheehy announced
that seven of the dead were children, members of the press corps
gathered at the Omagh Leisure Center gasped.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives and friends put a human face on the victims.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the dead boys _ Sean McLaughlin and James Barker, both
12, and Oran Doherty, 8 _ were from Buncrana, a village in
neighboring Donegal, part of the Irish Republic. They were part of
a group that was hosting Spanish students who for the past 10 years
have visited Buncrana to learn English. One of the Spanish
students, a 12-year-old boy, and one of the Spanish teachers, a
24-year-old woman, both from Madrid, also were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven Spanish students remained hospitalized. Jose Maria San
Pastor, Spain's ambassador in Dublin, drove up to comfort the
injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could do such a thing, to children?'' San Pastor asked.
</P>
<P>
   San Pastor's question reverberated among the locals, who bore
the brunt of the carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Death was cruelly arbitrary in Omagh. The staff at Watterson's
drapery store was evacuated after someone called police and said
the bomb was near the courthouse. Like others evacuated from the
vicinity of the courthouse, the staff at Watterson's were told by
police to stand behind the security cordon at Market Street and
Dublin Road.
</P>
<P>
   But it was at that very corner that a 500-pound bomb exploded in
a maroon Vauxhall sedan that had been stolen from a border town in
the Irish Republic on Thursday. Two of the women who worked at
Watterson's were killed, while another had an arm and leg
amputated. The Watterson's storefront, meanwhile, escaped without a
scratch.
</P>
<P>
   Paddy McGowan, a town councilor, said one of the two saleswomen
killed was his friend, Geraldine Breslin, 35, the mother of a young
girl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get over the irony of it,'' McGowan said. ``Geraldine
thought she was safe, but she was actually moved so that she was
standing just a few feet from the bomb.''
</P>
<P>
   If the ladies at Watterson's thought they had been moved out of
harm's way, Libby Rushe thought she was already safe, working in a
coffee shop behind the police line. Rushe's body was badly
disfigured, and it was not until 24 hours later that her husband
learned of her death. He pushed past reporters, tears streaming
down his cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``The poor man,'' muttered Joe Byrne, the recently elected local
member of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, who like many local
politicians went to the leisure center to comfort their friends and
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   The victims were both Protestant and Catholic. They came mostly
from Omagh and the surrounding countryside, in town on a sunny
Saturday afternoon to shop and to watch a carnival to promote
cross-community relations.
</P>
<P>
   Aidan Gallagher, 21, went in town to buy jeans. He was standing
outside the store when he was killed. Lorraine Wilson, 15, and her
friend, Sandra McFarland, 17, worked in a charity store and were
among those evacuated to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Philomena Skelton had gone shopping for back-to-school clothes
for her children. Her husband, Kevin, found her dead, on top of a
pile of rubble.
</P>
<P>
   Esther Gibson, 30, was a Sunday school teacher whose cousin,
Oliver Gibson, was elected to the assembly as a member of the party
of the Rev. Ian Paisley, the radical unionist. Paisley cited her
death Sunday as proof that the British government's policy of
``appeasing terrorists'' led to the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The misfortunes of the bombing extended beyond this usually
sleepy town. An ambulance transferring one of the more seriously
injured victims to a Belfast hospital collided with a car in
Belfast. The already injured victim survived, but the driver of the
car was killed.
</P>
<P>
   There was almost as much concern for the living as there was for
the dead. Survivors' guilt was said to be developing among many of
those who lived while those around them died.
</P>
<P>
   Godfrey Young, a social worker who is trying to help the
survivors, said among those most traumatized by the bombing was the
bus driver who drove the boys from Buncrana and their Spanish
guests to Omagh for the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids were looking for something to do and the bus driver
suggested they go to Omagh, to the Ulster-American Folk Park. They
had done that and had come into town to walk around the shops,''
Young said. ``Now the driver blames himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Chesters is just 11 years old, but he wonders why he was
spared and so many others were not. Barry and his father, Pat, were
shopping for back-to-school sneakers when the bomb warning came in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Spanish kids and the boys from Donegal were in the sports
store when I was there,'' Barry said. ``The police told me and my
daddy to move. We didn't. We ran up to my granny's house.''
</P>
<P>
   After the bomb, Pat Chesters ran to the scene to help. He found
a 12-year-old schoolmate of Barry's on the ground, his legs blown
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why them,'' 11-year-old Barry Chesters asked, ``and not me?
Why Omagh?''

LOS ANGELES CORPORATE ELITE HAVE PRECEDENT FOR POWER
</HEADLINE>
 (With BC-REFORM-ENEMIES-LADN and BC-REFORM-LIST-LADN for use by
NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK MCGREEVY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The decision by 26 of Los Angeles' current
corporate heads to plunge into the city's civic and political
affairs has a precedent in the 1950s and '60s, when a group called
the Committee of 25 dominated the power structure.
</P>
<P>
   Headed by Asa V. Call, the CEO of Pacific Mutual Life Insurance,
the Committee of 25 was a group of white business CEOs and
prominent attorneys who hand-picked mayors and City Council members
and dictated directions to City Hall from their corporate
boardrooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``They set policy for the city,'' said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a
political science professor who has studied the history of city
government.
</P>
<P>
   Former Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude, who was
elected in the 1960s, remembers going toe-to-toe with Call and
other members of the committee over the budget and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were very, very powerful in the early days,'' Braude
said. ``When I came along, they were still influential but their
power had started to wane.''
</P>
<P>
   The Encyclopedia of the City and County describes the Committee
of 25 as a group of business executives who ``served as a sort of
shadow government, choosing public officials for appointment or
election and setting the agenda for public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee picked mayors and police chiefs and followed its
conservative business leanings to kill tax increases and other
objectionable city policy decisions with a few phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Call, who Braude described as a charming,
eloquent spokesman for Republican causes, the white male group
included James Lin Beebe, an attorney with the powerful downtown
law firm O'Melveny and Myers, as well as University of Southern
California President Norman Topping, University of California, Los
Angeles Chancellor Franklin Murphy and Norman Chandler, publisher
of the Los Angeles Times.
</P>
<P>
   Like the old group, the new Los Angeles Business Advisors
includes the heads of the Times and USC as well &UR;  &LR; as an attorney,
Warren Christopher, from O'Melveny and Myers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It resonates of the Committee of 25, although it does not
appear to be as powerful or as institutional,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   The new committee also is mostly made up of white males,
although a woman and a Japanese auto company executive have been
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a political standpoint, it would be preferable to look
like the Rainbow Coalition, but it looks more like the old
Committee of 25,'' Jeffe said.
</P>
<P>
   The Committee of 25 lost its influence as the demographics of
the city changed in the 1960s and '70s and Latino and
African-Americans rose up in the political system and formed strong
coalitions that had a voice in city government.
</P>
<P>
   ``No question that caused a diminution of their power and
influence,'' Braude said. He also said that more people became
involved in the political process, reducing the role of a select
few.
</P>
<P>
   ``The business community was also broadening out so it just
didn't include downtown businesses,'' Braude said.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Richard Riordan said Call was such a commanding figure
that his death in 1978 marked the end of the Committee of 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was Asa Call who was the dictator,'' Riordan said. ``He
used that (committee) as a front to try to get things done. He
could get anything he wanted done for businesses.''

RUPTURE IN 100-YEAR-OLD WATER MAIN DOES SEVERE DAMAGE IN LIBRARY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ More than 50,000 Boston Public Library reference books,
maps, and documents were damaged or destroyed Sunday after a
rupture in an 1895-vintage water main sent hundreds of thousands of
gallons gushing into the Copley Square building's vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Stunned library officials called the loss one of the most
``devastating'' in the library's history and closed the building at
least through today to drain about 3 feet of water saturating the
first three shelves of almost every basement book stack.
</P>
<P>
   The book ``US Ocean Policy in the 1970s'' floated by several
city workers pumping out the basement through an entry on Boylston
Street Sunday. In the newly renovated library basement, yellowed
books and maps were submerged in murky water in a darkened
government documents room.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, thousands of residents throughout the city felt the
effects of the early-morning water main break when they turned on
faucets Sunday to find rusty _ but safe _ water coming out. Some
residents also felt small declines in water pressure, city
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is fine,'' said John Sullivan, Boston Water and
Sewer chief engineer. ``It's just discolored.''
</P>
<P>
   Water officials were able to contain the roughly 1 a.m. rupture
within three hours by diverting the pipe's water flow into smaller
water mains. No service was disrupted. But because more water than
usual was rushing through the smaller pipes, rust inside them was
carried into homes. Officials said the discoloration should
disappear by today.
</P>
<P>
   There was no warning the 42-inch cast-iron water main behind the
library at the corner of Dartmouth Street and Huntington Avenue was
going to break. The 100-year-old pipe, the largest main bringing
high-pressure water into the city, was relined with cement only 10
years ago and declared safe, city officials said. But shortly after
midnight Sunday, it developed a 4-foot-long jagged crack, pushing
out millions of gallons of water _ 3 feet deep at some spots _ into
Copley Square.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, the Green Line Copley Square inbound MBTA station was
closed because water was still lingering in its entranceway, fire
officials said. The Massachusetts Turnpike Copley Square entrance
ramp was also closed and several streets around the library were
shut down to make room for emergency vehicles and more than a dozen
pumps to drain the library basement. Most of the road closures were
expected to end by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan said he did not know why the pipe burst, but tests in
coming weeks may point to a reason. The main, which runs along
Huntington Avenue to the Boston Common, will be out of service for
three or four days as city officials replace the ruptured section.
</P>
<P>
   The damaged books and materials are replaceable, but library
officials Sunday hesitated to guess at the cost until a full
inventory is conducted this week. Three years ago, the basement
underwent a $20 million renovation, updating reference rooms,
installing new computers, and upgrading machinery that helps run
the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the worst damage I've ever seen,'' said Joe Sarro,
superintendent of city library buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Thomas M. Menino, on his way to a Red Sox game to honor
city children in a BPL reading program when called to assess the
damage, said he was ``frustrated'' by the loss of books. ``This is
the gem of our library system ... the best public research library
in the country,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The library houses about 6 million books and is the region's
best resource for government documents.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 15 percent of the library's science reference
material was damaged or destroyed, said Gunars Rutkovskis,
assistant library director in charge of research material. Many
government patent documents, topographical maps, books, and
encyclopedias were in the flooded McKim building basement, part of
the library's original structure. Sarro said he fears that old LP
record jackets in a sound archive room will have to be thrown away
because of water damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, while we've not seen anything of this magnitude, it
will not affect our ability to serve'' customers, said Rutkovskis.
</P>
<P>
   The library is not open on Sundays during the summer and library
officials said all branches will be open today. Bruce Cole, the
library's chief financial officer, said all programs at the library
will be canceled today and, most likely, tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   While weary police, fire, and sewer officials Sunday dodged
gushing water from pumps and tried to divert traffic and curious
bystanders, they said it appeared that not all realized how deep
the water could get during a large water main break.
</P>
<P>
   One man, driving a Mercedes convertible, ignored police warnings
shortly after the rupture and insisted on driving down Huntington
Avenue, police said. He got only a few hundred yards before water
starting pouring in over the top of his car doors. A few minutes
later, his car stalled. A few minutes after that, he got a $100
ticket.

JETS' LINE NOT INSPIRING QB CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Coach Bill Parcells virtually appointed Glenn Foley Sunday as
the Jets' starter in the annual exhibition game with the Giants on
Thursday. Foley's job is not in jeopardy _ but his health could be.
</P>
<P>
   It remains to be seen how much the offensive line, which had big
problems against the Baltimore defense on Saturday night, will
protect the quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells didn't actually come out and say Foley would start
against the Giants _ whoever is first string in this third
exhibition game will start the season _ but he did tell reporters
on a conference call that nothing has changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said that the whole time, it still stands now,'' Parcells
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said he wanted to tell the quarterbacks that himself.
</P>
<P>
   If Parcells literally means nothing has changed, then Foley,
whom the coach has said for months is his starter unless Vinny
Testaverde plays better, remains No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde started against Baltimore in Saturday night's 33-0
debacle, a move Parcells said was made merely to get him experience
with the Jets' first-string offense.
</P>
<P>
   But Testaverde had to play behind a renovated line and it was
hardly a fair test, even though Curtis Martin made his Jets' debut
and carried 12 times for 40 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Pressured inordinately, Foley did worse.
</P>
<P>
   He was sacked once and two of his passes were intercepted in a
loss in which offense, defense and special teams had one of the
worst performances of the Parcells regime.
</P>
<P>
   Testaverde was dumped three times. He completed six of his 10
pass attempts for 54 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Foley completed only a third of his passes _ five of 15 _ for a
mere 37 yards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our quarterbacks were a little jumpy, and rightfully so
because of mistakes on the offensive line,'' said Parcells.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells is moaning about left tackle Jumbo Elliott's sprained
ankle.
</P>
<P>
   If Elliott cannot play, the quarterback will feel it because
Elliott is usually matched against the opposition's key
pass-rusher.
</P>
<P>
   He was out Saturday, and rookie Kerry Jenkins was overmatched
against Michael McCrary, so much so that Lonnie Palelei eventually
moved over from left guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pass-protection worries me,'' said Parcells. The revamped
line, besides Jenkins, included Palelei at left guard for Todd
Burger, whose pass-protection concerns Parcells, and the rookie
right tackle Jason Fabini.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Parcells, ``With Elliott in there it looks a little
different _ if he doesn't play this week then I really will have a
concern. Then we have only Chicago to get ready for the season. It
would be hard for me to think he'd be ready for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells was indignant that Elliott didn't play _ even though it
was Parcells who kept him on the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really thought he'd probably play,'' Parcells said.
``Looking at him I didn't think he wanted to. If he doesn't feel
good about it then I don't.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells perceived that Elliott was favoring the ankle and
wasn't too happy about playing on it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it only was an exhibition game _ and on grass, to boot.
</P>
<P>
   Martin is happier on artificial turf, which will be in place
when the regular season starts.
</P>
<P>
   So look for Martin to do even better at Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel better on turf,'' said Martin. ``I'm looking forward to
it. I might have been able to break some runs on turf. I felt I was
in the best shape of my career.''
</P>
<P>
   Parcells grudgingly conceded that, well, yes, that really wasn't
his best team out there, especially the special squads.
</P>
<P>
   He promised to play the ``A-team'' against the Giants in hopes
of avoiding another 97-yard punt return. Jermaine Lewis' big play
set the tone against the Jets on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Including the kick-returners and punter, the Jets started 10
players who had been backups when camp started.
</P>
<P>
   Parcells has now seen what they can do. Most will go back to
their second-string status.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Parcells is putting pressure on his assistants.
</P>
<P>
   They were forced to come in three hours earlier than scheduled
Sunday to review films in an attempt to prevent such a drubbing in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think,'' said Parcells, ``practices will be easy this
week.''

UNUSUAL DRAMA WILL BE PLAYED OUT MONDAY
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's grand jury appearance Monday by
closed-circuit television will inject a jolt of drama in federal
court proceedings, legal specialists say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is quite unusual,'' said Paul Cassell, a law professor at
the University of Utah Law School and an advocate for victims'
rights. ``The courts have a strong preference for face-to-face,
in-person testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Televised testimony before a grand jury is virtually
unprecedented, according to Fredric Lederer, a professor at William
and Mary's Marshall White College of Law and a specialist in the
use of technology in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president occupies an anomalous position because this is a
grand jury, and as a rule, the requirements for appearance are
minuscule,'' Lederer said. ``The grand jury could have operated
without Clinton's testimony. It could have considered a written
statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Lederer said Clinton's testimony from the White House and
televised to the grand jury room in the federal courthouse a dozen
blocks away, apparently is a tactical move by independent counsel
Kenneth W. Starr to get the president to answer questions under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors will be able to write questions that are
relayed to prosecutors questioning Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spokesman Michael D. McCurry announced Friday that the
president will testify from the map room in the White House. The
testimony will begin at 1 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   While this will be the first time Clinton testifies before a
grand jury and uses closed-circuit television, he has provided
videotaped testimony three times. Twice he testified via videotape
for trials, of his former political and business associates, that
grew out of the Whitewater portion of Starr's investigation. Those
tapes were played for jurors in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's deposition for the Paula Jones sexual harassment
lawsuit also was videotaped. The lawsuit later was dismissed before
going to trial. But the president's lawyer, David E. Kendall, last
week received permission to review the videotape, which remains
under a court seal.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Starr said Clinton's lawyers will handle the
logistics of the closed-circuit broadcast, including setting the
camera angle and view of the president and the room. Such decisions
could influence the way grand jurors react to Clinton's answers.
</P>
<P>
   If the taped testimony is ever viewed publicly, the image could
have political ramifications. A close-up view of Clinton's face,
for example, could have a different impact than a picture of the
president in a suit and tie sitting behind his desk.
</P>
<P>
   The video signal will be scrambled to foil any outside attempts
to intercept the transmission during the broadcast, partly because
grand jury testimony is secret and largely to prevent anyone from
making a copy of Clinton's testimony.
</P>

   Lederer, who has supervised tests on how televised testimony
affects jurors, said a neutral camera angle does not appear to
affect viewer perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can tell you from experimental work conducted down here in
a normal trial, it appears that normal jurors seem to accept remote
testimony the same way that they accept in-court testimony,'' said
Lederer, director of Courtroom 21, a project on how technology can
improve the operation of the legal system. The effort is conducted
by William and Mary's law school and the National Center for State
Courts.

   ``This is an illustration of the ways in which technology can be
used in the courtroom,'' he said.

A LONG JOURNEY LED TO SHOWDOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Inevitably, it had to come down to this: President
Clinton vs. independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstances are unprecedented: a sitting president
testifying Monday under oath to a grand jury about sex and perjury,
with his political life at stake. But after four years of
shadowboxing, of throwing mean punches but delivering no knockout
blows, these shrewd and stubborn enemies have anticipated this day
and its decisive fight.
</P>
<P>
   How they got here _ how Starr's investigation of a puny and
obscure Arkansas land deal turned into a titillating sex scandal
that has consumed Washington and threatens the president with
impeachment _ is a tale full of twists and turns. Ultimately,
though, it starts and ends with the man in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``What binds it all _ from Whitewater to Travelgate, from Paula
Jones to Monica Lewinsky _ is the whiff of scandal and corrosive
immorality around a president who has character defects and doesn't
seem to tell the truth,'' said Robert Dallek, a Boston University
history professor and the author of ``Flawed Giant,'' a biography
of President Lyndon Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton says he will tell the grand jury the truth
about the nature of his relationship with Lewinsky, a former White
House intern. For days, the suspense has built and stories have
been leaked that the president will try to end this sorry saga by
admitting he lied when he denied having intimate encounters with
her and will publicly apologize.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's defenders blame Starr, as obsessed as Captain Ahab
with snaring the Big One, for not shutting down an investigation
that has produced a dozen indictments of minor figures, cost
taxpayers more than $30 million, intimidated hundreds of innocent
people, and cheapened the public discourse and the presidency with
leaks about stained dresses and oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Recent news stories say Starr's expected impeachment report to
Congress will focus almost entirely on whether the president lied,
or asked others to lie, under oath about an alleged sexual
relationship with Lewinsky. Lanny Davis, a former White House
special counsel, said that would prove the independent counsel has
``come up with nothing'' in everything he investigated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am confident the president did nothing legally wrong, and I
believe the process has been severely compromised by a prosecutor
who has poor judgment and has lost his sense of proportionality,''
Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   Some call Starr a misguided missile on a political mission.
Others think the former judge is a sober truth-seeker thwarted by
White House ducking, delays, and denials. ``The White House has
waged a war to destroy Ken Starr,'' said Theodore Olson, an
assistant attorney general in the Reagan administration. ``I admire
the job he is doing under extraordinarily difficult
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving aside his motives, it is clear that Starr's mandate has
been broadened repeatedly, sometimes not at his request, since he
took over in 1994 from Robert Fiske, the special prosecutor
appointed by Attorney General Janet Reno to look into the
Whitewater land deal.
</P>
<P>
   At issue then was whether Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton and
James and Susan McDougal, their business partners in Whitewater,
personally benefited from an illegal $300,000 federal loan in 1986
for Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, which McDougal owned.
Investigators wanted to know if Clinton, when he was governor of
Arkansas, had helped the McDougals get the loan _ $50,000 of it
ended up in a Whitewater account _ and what the nature of Mrs.
Clinton's legal work in the Rose Law Firm was for Madison, which
later failed.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1994 and 1996, Starr, through his grand jury in Little
Rock, Ark., indicted 10 people connected to Madison, including both
McDougals and Jim Guy Tucker, who succeeded Clinton as governor;
Starr also obtained five guilty pleas.
</P>
<P>
   But the evidence apparently wasn't there on the Clintons,
lawyers say, even though Starr suspected Mrs. Clinton was lying
about the extent of the legal work she did for Madison and for
Castle Grande, a sham real-estate deal that federal regulators
believed had illegally enriched Webster Hubbell, her law partner,
and Hubbell's father-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's suspicions grew only after Mrs. Clinton's long-sought
law firm records mysteriously turned up in the White House
residence in January &UR;  &LR; 1996. In a dramatic confrontation, Starr
subpoenaed Mrs. Clinton to appear before his grand jury in
Washington. She denied any wrongdoing, including hiding documents
or obstructing justice.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's billing records were also the reason Starr's
scope was expanded to the 1993 suicide of Vincent Foster, the
deputy White House counsel who, too, had worked at the Rose Law
Firm. Starr questioned White House aides about the Clintons'
personal papers that allegedly had been removed from Foster's
office after his death. Starr has not brought charges in that case,
and he disappointed conspiracy theorists by confirming Foster's
death was a suicide.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the three-judge panel that oversees independent
counsels gave Starr jurisdiction over two more White House
controversies. In the first, the 1993 firing of the White House
travel office, Starr was asked to determine if any White House
officials or Mrs. Clinton had lied about who ordered the
dismissals.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, the so-called ``Filegate'' case (distinct from
the so-called ``Travelgate'' case), Starr's office probed why the
White House had improperly collected hundreds of personal FBI files
on former appointees in GOP administrations. The independent
counsel also was asked to find out if former White House counsel
Bernard Nussbaum lied to Congress when he said he did not know who
hired Craig Livingstone, an aide in charge of the files.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said mistakes had been made, but no crimes were
committed. Carl Stern, who was spokesman for the attorney general
at the time, said Starr did the investigating ``for efficiency and
economy of effort. His office was up and running.''
</P>
<P>
   No prosecutions came out of either case, and indeed, it appeared
that the independent counsel might be on the verge of filing a
final report finding no crimes or cause for impeachment hearings,
and close up shop. In February 1997, Starr announced he would leave
his post in the fall to become dean of the law school and dean of a
new public policy school at Pepperdine University in California.
</P>
<P>
   That was a turning point: Pundits, the press, and conservative
politicians criticized Starr for giving up. How could he quit, some
asked, while Starr had both Susan McDougal and Webster Hubbell
serving time _ she for contempt of court, he for bilking money from
the Rose Law Firm _ and there was a chance that either still could
turn on the Clintons and cooperate with him? Starr agreed to press
on.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, his office was questioning whether friends of the
Clintons had arranged about $700,000 in income for Hubbell, a
former associate attorney general, to keep him from talking. One of
those friends was Washington lawyer Vernon E. Jordan Jr. When
prosecutors learned early this year that Jordan might be trying to
buy Lewinsky's silence with job offers, they used the
Hubbell-Jordan connection to justify widening the Whitewater probe
to include the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   Linda R. Tripp approached Starr's office on Jan. 12 with
homemade tapes purporting that Lewinsky, her Pentagon coworker, had
had an affair with the president and was asked by him and Jordan to
lie about it in her testimony in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Lewinsky had been subpoenaed by Jones's lawyers,
who were trying to prove a pattern of behavior in the
sexual-harassment case brought against Clinton by Jones, a former
Arkansas state employee who alleged the then-governor asked her to
perform a sex act in a Little Rock hotel room in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 17, Clinton gave his deposition in the Jones case and
denied a sexual relationship with Lewinsky. The deposition took
place just days after Starr got both his expanded investigation
approved by Reno and the three-judge panel as well as a newly taped
conversation between Lewinsky and Tripp, who had been wired by the
FBI. Earlier this month, under a grant of full immunity, Lewinsky
reportedly told Starr's grand jury that she and the president had a
sexual affair but that Clinton did not urge her to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   Even though a federal judge dismissed the Jones lawsuit in
April, the president's deposition has become the focus for a
possible perjury or obstruction-of-justice case. The deposition is
expected to be central to his testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Starr may be able to bolster his case with physical evidence,
including a dress the FBI is examining and gifts the president
allegedly gave Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The civility that the Clintons and Starr maintained through the
early Whitewater years has, of course, been poisoned by the nearly
seven-month Lewinsky probe. James Carville, a Democratic political
operative, says Starr is ``obsessed with sex,'' and Mrs. Clinton
has called him part of a ``right-wing conspiracy.'' Starr says the
White House is a ``culture of lies.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond Washington's war of words, the spin, the scorecard of
who's winning and losing, and the leaks, the public still knows
precious little about the four-year-old Whitewater probe. More, but
far from all, may be known when Starr makes what is expected to be
two reports _ one presenting evidence of possible crimes to
Congress, another wrapping up the other probes for a three-judge
panel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think the independent counsel statute encourages
witchhunts or vendettas,'' said Stephen Gillers, a professor of
legal ethics at New York University School of Law. ``But there is a
human dimension. The White House strategy of demonizing Ken Starr
has probably had the effect of encouraging him to resist the
attack, get all the information he could, and now file the best
report he can.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BETHEL, N.Y. _ The mantra of real estate _ ``location, location,
location'' _ was at the heart of ``A Day in the Garden,'' the
three-day rock festival that started here on Friday. The site is a
gently sloping hillside that was Max Yasgur's alfalfa field and
then, more famously, the amphitheater for the 1969 Woodstock
festival. Two major songwriters who rarely perform, Joni Mitchell
and Pete Townshend, headlined Saturday's concert.
</P>
<P>
   Lou Reed, who also performed on Saturday, said backstage that he
wasn't haunted by ``the ghost of Woodstock.'' But most performers
on Friday and Saturday, including some who appeared at the 1969
festival, measured the distance between then and now: between
idealism and disillusionment, between bravado and practicality,
between youth and middle age.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Ms. Mitchell sang ``Woodstock,'' about the festival
she never saw, as an elegy for a vanished moment. Introducing the
song, she said, ``My generation, which was given a pocket of
liberty like no other generation in a century, did some of the
right things for a short time.''
</P>
<P>
   The festival site has not been used for commercial events since
1969. Woodstock '94 took place in Saugerties, N.Y., and was
presented by Woodstock Ventures, which owns the Woodstock trademark
but not the site. Alan Gerry, a cable-television billionaire,
bought 2,000 acres here in 1997, including the hillside; ``A Day in
the Garden'' was produced by his Gerry Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   After 1969, visiting Yasgur's farm became a pilgrimage for
people who wanted to commemorate the Woodstock legend of
cooperation, idealism and communal pleasure. Melanie, who performed
on Saturday, has been back each year, singing for the tens or
hundreds of people who have shown up on the festival's
anniversaries. ``I left a piece of me in this field,'' she said
from the stage.
</P>
<P>
   With ``A Day in the Garden,'' the site of the unintentionally
free festival of 1969 unveiled its new commercial role as the
center of a projected theme park devoted to American music. It's
surrounded by split-rail fences now, and the festival setup
included souvenir stands, effective security and a magnificently
clear sound system. A second stage, over the crest of the hill,
presented local bands.
</P>
<P>
   The festival sold 12,000 tickets for Friday, 18,000 for Saturday
and more than 25,000 for Sunday. Even with the addition of children
(admitted free), daily attendance was less than one-tenth the size
of the crowds at Woodstock in 1969 or at Woodstock '94. And where
Woodstock was a youth gathering, ``A Day in the Garden'' started
with two days aimed at baby-boomers now in their 40s and 50s.
Sunday had a schedule of seven younger bands, including Joan
Osborne, Third Eye Blind and the Goo Goo Dolls, and lower ticket
prices; that's when the moshing started.
</P>
<P>
   For the festival, concertgoers hauled out the tie-dyed shirts
and peace-symbol jewelry. And nostalgia was the rule as Don Henley,
Stevie Nicks and Ten Years After dispensed their hits on Friday.
With Ziggy Marley sick, his brother Stephen Marley led the Melody
Makers in songs by their father, Bob. Donovan, Melanie and Richie
Havens harked back to the 1960s on Saturday. Melanie sang about
community; Havens sang about freedom and compassion. Bill Perry,
playing lead guitar with Havens, copied Jimi Hendrix's wrenching
version of ``The Star-Spangled Banner,'' now separated from its
context, the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Mitchell only looked back briefly. The bulk of her set
drew from the albums she has made since she released ``Hejira'' in
1976.

</P>
<P>
   They share a private, contemplative style that barely
acknowledges pop's demands. Wispy, attenuated melodies float in
arrangements without edges, built on reverberating guitar chords
and liquid, shifting rhythms. She writes melodies like a jazz
singer's improvisations, using flexibility and fragmentation
instead of pop's repetition and hooks. One of the least abstruse
songs she performed was from Billie Holiday's repertory, ``Comes
Love.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mitchell's lyrics are diaristic, drifting from reflections
on the news to questions about the purpose of life to updates on
romance. In songs from her next album, due in September, Ms.
Mitchell sang about lovers hiding the sounds of passion behind
train whistles, about bringing a new partner home to a disapproving
mother and about how ``lawyers and loan sharks are laying America
to waste.'' Even when her opinions grow cranky, what holds the
songs together is Ms. Mitchell's voice, pearly and assured, making
her free-floating vagaries sound like shared confidences.
</P>
<P>
   In his set, Townshend looked over his shoulder at the 1969
festival. He played two songs popularized by Canned Heat, who
performed at Woodstock in 1969, and for his finale he played the
same song the Who concluded with in 1969: ``Listening to You,''
from ``Tommy,'' this time joined by a gospel choir. Backstage, he
admitted that the Who had prolonged their 1969 set to play at
sunrise; this year, he stretched songs with long vamps that shifted
from meditation to filler, apparently to end past sunset.
</P>
<P>
   His set ambled through his long career, from mid-1960s Who songs
to one from his most recent album, ``Psychoderelict,'' which, he
cheerfully noted, was a ``complete commercial bomb.'' Songs from
his solo career were about a search for love, including divine
love; songs from the Who, including radically rearranged versions
of ``The Kids Are Alright'' and ``Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere,'' were
about youthful energy, and Townshend made them explode when he
finally started playing windmill power chords on electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   Reed, whose 1960s band, the Velvet Underground, wasn't invited
to perform at Woodstock, was a magnificent sore thumb. Amid the
tie-dye, he and his band wore black; amid the greenery, he sang
about urban grit; amid the invocations of love, he sang about
random violence and violent impulses. Mostly, however, his set was
about guitar muscle: lean, wiry guitar riffs, from basic
three-chord rock to a furious funk crescendo. The music was smart,
bruising and elegant, with no wasted motion.
</P>
<P>
   Friday's show could give a younger generation ample reason to
scoff at its elders. Ms. Nicks, playing through the traditional
Woodstock rainstorm, was a model of baby-boomer self-absorption.
``Can we do this again?'' she said after her last song. ``It would
be so good for me.'' Ms. Nicks presented herself as princess,
dreamer and scorned lover; the scratchiness of her voice was once
the earthy balance to her fantasies, but she now sounds mostly
tattered.
</P>
<P>
   Ten Years After trotted out its repertory of leering blues
attached to extended, repetitive jams; in one song, Alvin Lee
played the same speedy guitar lick 26 times in a row. He has
learned one new trick over the last three decades: tapping the
strings with both hands like Eddie Van Halen.
</P>
<P>
   Henley played an indifferent, professional set that reproduced
the album versions of his hits, down to the guitar solos; rather
than introduce any new songs, he sang material by John Hiatt,
Leonard Cohen and Randy Newman. But as the Woodstock site took its
first steps toward becoming a theme park, he did have a song for
the occasion: ``The End of the Innocence.''

NO MATTER WHAT IS SAID, LOOK FOR THE SPIN
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's testimony today to a federal
grand jury has the making of a media extravaganza. There will be
dozens of televised ``special reports,'' countless legal analysts,
and an untold number of journalists on hand.
</P>
<P>
   But will anyone outside a closed-circuit video connection
between the White House and the grand jury room really know what
Clinton says about his alleged sexual relationship with former
intern Monica S. Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   Only one thing is sure: There will be spin, and plenty of it.
</P>
<P>
   This being Washington, there is widespread expectation that
details of the testimony will be leaked by anonymous sources. And
both special prosecutor Kenneth Starr and White House aides will
begin ``spinning'' their versions of Clinton's grand jury testimony
as soon as it is over.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a guide of what to expect under two main scenarios:
 &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton changes story, admits an affair with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   If this happens, look for Democrats to say the story is over.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will respond that Clinton's revised story amounts to
an admission Clinton committed perjury in his deposition in the
Paula Jones sexual-harassment lawsuit, in which Clinton said he did
not have sexual relations with Lewinsky, according to the
definition of a sexual encounter approved by the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will counter that Clinton's contradiction of his
earlier testimony does not amount to an impeachable offense,
because perjury in a civil suit is rarely prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sticks by his story, saying there was no sexual
relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; el2 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will have little choice other than to stand by their
man and hope he is telling the truth. Look for Clinton allies to
feel free to start raising questions about Lewinsky's credibility,
noting that she previously swore she did not have an affair with
Clinton and then changed her story.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Republicans to call for full hearings in Congress on
whether Clinton is telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   The White House spin is especially important because the outcome
for Clinton will likely be determined by the public and Congress,
not by the courts. Starr is expected to send a report within a few
weeks to Congress, which will decide whether to hold impeachment
proceedings. If Clinton can convince the public that he has done
nothing wrong or that he has a reasonable explanation for his
actions, then the House would be less likely to try to impeach him.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton were to admit that he had a sexual relationship with
Lewinsky, it would be in the White House's interest to get that
information out as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is incumbent upon President Clinton to be sure that his
version of events be told quickly and accurately,'' said former
White House special counsel Lanny Davis, one of Washington's
premier spin meisters. Davis, like a number of former White House
officials, has urged Clinton to speak to the nation after the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the first spin on the story is crucial. ``That testimony
is going to be leaked, probably inaccurately and probably
incompletely, by people who do not have his best interest at
heart,'' Davis said. ``That has been our experience to date.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the White House says Clinton told the truth and refuses
to elaborate, that won't answer the question of whether the
president changed his January denial of an affair. After all, it
was Clinton who insisted in 1992 that he did not have an ``affair''
with Gennifer Flowers and then admitted having sex with her once in
1977, all without acknowledging that there was any contradiction
between the two statements. Most reporters covering the story are
likely to ask whether Clinton has found a similar sort of semantic
explanation for what happened with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, if the White House says that Clinton once again
denied having sexual relations with Lewinsky, reporters will ask
how Clinton defined sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton himself may try to control the story with silence,
asserting that he does not want to talk about the matter while it
is under investigation. But this tactic, which Clinton has been
using while remaining silent, is not based on any legal
prohibition. Clinton, or any other witness, is allowed to say
whatever he wants. So if Clinton wants to uphold his promise that
he would explain the matter ``sooner rather than later,'' there are
no legal limits stopping him from discussing his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Selective leaks to the news media are just as significant as
spin. For example, after Clinton agreed to testify to the grand
jury, it was leaked that Lewinsky had provided Starr with a dress
that may or may not contain Clinton's DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Although it has not been confirmed that Clinton's DNA is on the
dress, the reports led to widespread speculation that there may be
independent evidence to corroborate Lewinsky's reported testimony
that she had an affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton changes his story today but refuses to acknowledge it
publicly, it is likely that Starr or his allies will leak that
information, thus setting the stage for a tough report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Other takes on the story are likely to come from a host of
surrogates for Clinton and Starr, as well as legal analysts and
others, who may or may not know something about the testimony. This
will fill the airwaves for hours. But given how much misinformation
and disinformation has come out already in the Lewinsky story, it
may not mean much until the president's own words are made public.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, it's all spin.

CLINTON, STARR PREPARE FOR SHOWDOWN

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton huddled for hours with his
lawyers and family Sunday as he braced for one of the most pivotal
passages in his presidency, an unprecedented session Monday before
a federal grand jury investigating him for possible crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Amid reports that Clinton is poised to retreat from his
longstanding denial of a sexual relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky, the president privately prepared for the crucial legal
and political challenges posed by his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of the potential consequences emerged in a last-minute
frenzy of anticipation by some of Clinton's top foes and allies
alike. Reacting to the possibility Clinton will acknowledge a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky, a former White House intern,
several key supporters expressed bitter disappointment while a
leading rival said the president should resign if he committed
perjury in the deposition he gave in Paula Corbin Jones's civil
suit.
</P>
<P>
   The grand-jury session is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. in the
White House map room. Clinton will be questioned by Kenneth W.
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, and his deputies. The
session, expected to last several hours, will be broadcast by
closed-circuit to 23 grand jurors in a federal courthouse a mile
away.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not going to be easy for the president,'' said former
White House chief of staff Leon Panetta on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president changes his testimony and acknowledges an
improper relationship,'' Panetta said, ``he obviously is going to
have to go through a lot of pain himself, not only in apologizing
to his wife and his family, but to the staff and to those that he
misled and to the American public.''
</P>
<P>
   Close advisers to Clinton were quoted by several news
organizations Sunday as saying they expected the president to
acknowledge engaging in sexual activity with Lewinsky, who was 21
when the affair allegedly began in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Such an admission could contradict Clinton's sworn testimony in
January, when he said during a deposition in the sexual harassment
case involving Jones that he and Lewinsky did not have a sexual
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   The contradiction could lead Starr to conclude that Clinton
committed perjury. Starr is expected to file a report on the matter
with the House, which will consider what action to take, if any.
The most extreme possibility would be impeachment by the House and
a trial in the Senate to determine if he should be removed from
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he lies before the grand jury, that will be grounds for
impeachment,'' said Senator Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican who is
chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   However, polls have shown little public support for impeachment
proceedings related to the case, whose underlying allegation
involves sex between consenting adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The impeachment issue has been largely overblown,'' said
Representative Barney Frank, a Newton Democrat who is a senior
member of the House Judiciary Committee, which is expected to
receive Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it turns out the president is going to say, yes, there was
some sexual activity between him and Monica Lewinsky and he covered
that up to protect his family, herself, himself, et cetera, I think
that will be regrettable but hardly an impeachable offense,'' Frank
said on ``Meet the Press.''
</P>
<P>
   Although few members of either party supported his view, Senator
John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican with presidential aspirations,
said Clinton should step down if he committed perjury or other
crimes involving the Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president is guilty of those things which he's been
accused of doing,'' Ashcroft said on CNN's ``Late Edition,'' ``he
ought to resign.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers, who were quoted on the condition of
anonymity, said the president is expected to deny vigorously that
he broke any laws, including perjury, suborning perjury, and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   During a brief outing Sunday with Hillary Rodham Clinton to the
Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington, Clinton made no
public comment. He entered the church holding Mrs. Clinton's hand
and carrying a Bible.
</P>
<P>
   The couple sat in a front pew as the congregation joined in an
inspirational reading that said in part, ``When we have opposition
and hopeless situations, God bears us up on eagles' wings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the White House, there was no official statement on the
substance of Clinton's pending testimony. ``The lawyers report that
the preparation is going well, that the president is confident
about tomorrow,'' spokesman Joe Lockhart said. ``He knows what he
is going to say.''
</P>
<P>
   As the buzz about the session consumed the morning news shows,
the president's lawyer, David E. Kendall, issued a terse statement:
``There is apparently an enormous amount of groundless speculation
about the president's testimony tomorrow. The truth is the truth.
Period. And that's how the president will testify.''
</P>
<P>
   If the truth is that Clinton did have sex with Lewinsky, he
would need to give the public a speedy explanation in order to
limit the likely backlash, members of both parties said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president were to change his story, I think he needs to
square it with the American people and with the members of
Congress,'' said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Lowell Democrat
who serves on the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be extremely disappointed,'' Meehan said, if Clinton
changed his testimony. ``And I would feel terrible for Mrs. Clinton
and the president's daughter.''
</P>
<P>
   Several of Clinton's top political aides met at the White House
Sunday to discuss how Clinton should address the matter after his
testimony. The options include a televised speech tonight. But
Clinton is not expected to decide how to proceed until his
testimony ends.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Associated Press reported that Starr has gathered
evidence of roughly 75 telephone conversations between Clinton and
Lewinsky. Many of the conversations were initiated by Clinton,
according to people familiar with the investigation, who spoke only
on condition of anonymity.

IN INDIANA TOWN, PEOPLE EXPECT THE TRUTH
</HEADLINE>
 CITY-BOS  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNDA GOROV  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TELL CITY, Ind. _ Surrounded by lamps and chairs and curios,
some of them antique, some of them just old, Scott Dixon laid claim
to values that are as timeless as his merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Don't lie. Don't cheat. And if you do cheat, don't lie about it.
That goes for a small-town merchant as well as the president of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Stressing that he would never stray from his sweetheart of two
years, the 27-year-old Dixon insisted ``a decent person would fess
up if he did.'' He expects no less from Bill Clinton now.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he lied, he ought to just go ahead and admit it,'' said
Dixon, who runs a mom-and-pop antiques store on the edge of town.
``We've got hometown values here, and what he's been saying so far
just don't sound right to us.''
</P>
<P>
   In Tell City, people say they want Clinton to tell the truth in
his testimony before the grand jury Monday. They don't care how he
tells it _ in a quivering voice or in the powerful preacher's
cadence he calls upon from time to time _ as long as he tells it.
Even people who said the president's personal life is none of the
nation's business are waiting to hear his words.
</P>
<P>
   As Josephine Lahee, 64, who helps twist thousands of pretzels a
day at the Tell City Pretzel Co. on Main Street, put it, ``Why cry?
He knew when he said what he said the first time that he was
fibbing. Don't do a Jimmy Swaggart. Just be straightforward and get
it over with already.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why any of this is such a big deal I'll never know,'' said
Sandy Hazelip, 33, a secretary. ``But it's been an issue for long
enough now. He needs to come clean. He better come clean.''
</P>
<P>
   That refrain was heard throughout this town of 8,000 near
Hoosier National Forest on the southern edge of Indiana. It came
from Republicans as well as the Democrats who hold the power in
Perry County, where Tell City was settled by Swiss and German
immigrants who set out from Cincinnati in 1856 to find a new home
along the Ohio River. It came from people who said they appreciate
Clinton the president but despise Clinton the man.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon didn't vote for Clinton, but said he supported him until
the president went on TV in January and adamantly denied having
sexual relations with Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House
intern. Hazelip said she has never cared for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Over a lunch plate of meatloaf, mashed potatoes, and cornbread
at the Freezer Cafe, factory worker Kevin Beaver said he wants
Clinton to tell the truth and apologize.
</P>
<P>
   ``My feeling is he's not a decent person, but he's done a decent
job as president,'' Beaver said. ``I'd like to hear him say, `I did
it and I'm sorry,' then we can go back to judging him on how he
runs the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton presidency has been good for Perry County in general
and Tell City in particular.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, as technology made manufactuirng jobs obsolete,
the unemployment rate in the area soared past 18 percent. Now new
businesses are arriving, among them the Waupaca Foundry and a
General Electric plant, and unemployment is around 4.5 percent. The
turnaround, said Greg Wathen, executive director of the Perry
County Development Corp., has helped keep young adults from leaving
the area. The county population is almost back to its 1979 peak of
19,432, and per capita personal income now stands at about $16,000.
</P>
<P>
   The people who live in Tell City sound like many other
Americans. They are tired of Washington scandals. They want their
tax dollars spent on something other than investigating the
president's private life.
</P>
<P>
   ``What he did or didn't do with that Monica girl don't matter to
me,'' said Paul Vogelman, 52, who has been unemployed since the
chair factory where he worked folded. ``I want to hear about health
care. I want to hear about jobs. Too many other things are going on
in this country to listen to this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Shirley Vogelman, 56, a nurse's aide who, like her
husband, hasn't voted in years, ``That should be between him and
his wife. He should've said, `It's none of your business' in the
first place.''
</P>
<P>
   People also said they are wary of what their neighbors will
think of what they think, and many of those interviewed refused to
be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was elected as a known pathological liar and so that's what
we got,'' a school official who declined to give his name said of
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who expressed fears of losing her federally funded job
if her name was attached to her opinion of Clinton, said, ``I want
to hear the truth, whatever it is ... Not that I expect to get it,
mind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever that truth turns out to be, many residents said they
will try to find it in their hearts to forgive him. As much as
truthfulness, forgiveness is a virtue here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he didn't tell the truth, then I would be really angry,''
said Lahee, the pretzel company worker. ``But we probably won't
ever know, will we?''

GRIFFEY ISN'T COUNTING HOMERS _ HE SAYS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By IRA BERKOW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ The clouds were a murky gray and so low on Saturday
afternoon that they looked like the ceiling of the Kingdome when
George Kenneth Griffey Jr., the once and forever wunderkind of the
Seattle Mariners, hit his 42nd homer of the season in Comiskey
Park.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey leaned into a first-inning pitch from Jaime Navarro of
the White Sox and smacked it into the left-field seats for an
opposite-field home run, thus brightening ever so much baseball's
most dramatic story this season: the pursuit of the single-season
home run record.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, he went hitless in four at-bats, but to seasoned
Junior-watchers, that Saturday smite may have served notice that
the slugger within has awakened. The home run was Griffey's first
in August _ his last blast was on July 30 _ and finally moved him
up a notch toward the season leaders, the increasingly irritable
Mark ``Get Off My Blue Suede Shoes'' McGwire and the ebullient
Sammy ``Embraceable You'' Sosa, both at 47, and the still quite
distant Roger Maris, the champ at 61 homers.
</P>
<P>
   Watching this from his particular vantage point was Frank
Thomas, the White Sox first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not going to happen,'' he said. ``The record won't be broken
this year, I don't think. Now is the time of year when it gets
harder and harder to hit home runs. It gets closer to playoff time,
teams are in the hunt, and every game means something.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pitchers stop pitching to the big bats. Not going to let one
of those guys beat them. And then the hitters start feeling the
pressure _ they're aware everyone's aware of it. And September is
the toughest month of all. A lot different than the first five
months of the season. Happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   In the other locker room, Griffey was taking the position he has
taken regularly, that he's not really a home run hitter _ he did
hit 56 last season, his most valuable player year _ but a hitter
like his dad, Ken Griffey Sr., who played for the Reds and Yankees,
among other teams, and batted .296 in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad hit the ball on the ground and into the holes and the gaps
and ran; that's how I see myself,'' said Junior, who in his 10th
season has 336 home runs, compared with the 152 his father hit in
19 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey said he doesn't check the daily charts about the homer
chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``I don't care about Roger Maris' record.''
</P>
<P>
   This places him squarely in a minority of virtually one among
baseball fans and operatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to help my team win, and play in a World Series,''
he said. ``When you're growing up, you're not dreaming of breaking
the home run record. You're dreaming of playing in a World
Series.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone in Mariners management who asked not to be identified
said Griffey was ``not as interested in breaking the home run
record as some people might think (and) more interested in it than
he says.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners are out of playoff contention, but one of the few
points of interest left in their season is Griffey's hits _ and
home runs. (After a fallow period in early summer when he was down
to .284, he has raised his batting average to close to .291, closer
to his lifetime average of .302.)
</P>
<P>
   Griffey, of course, is aware that fans are as deeply interested
in the home run pursuit as he says he isn't. When he hit his home
run against the White Sox, for example, the enemy crowd of 21,537
gave him a standing ovation. When he is walked on the road, as
often happens when McGwire and Sosa are walked on the road, the
hometown fans boo their own pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``What those fans want,'' said Jamie Moyer, a Seattle pitcher,
who has heard the boos and laughed at the seeming contradiction of
them, ``is history in the making.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It can happen,'' said Thomas, hedging his bet a bit.
``Junior's been in a little funk in recent days, but he can come
out of it and hit 20 homers in September. Sosa hit 20 in May,
didn't he? And McGwire and Sosa can do the same. You never know.
Happens every year.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey says he would rather not talk about the homer chase. He
would rather talk about his two children, his 4-year-old son, Trey
_ ``Trey meaning three. I thought naming him the Third was a little
stuffy'' _ and daughter Taryn, age 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come home and talk about my job with them,'' he said.
``My dad didn't do that with me, either. He just wanted to know how
we were doing, how school was, did I dissect the frog, that kind of
thing. I never knew if he went 0-for-4 or 4-for-4.''
</P>
<P>
   He said Taryn loves basketball. ``She can dribble the ball,'' he
said proudly. ``And when I say she can't play but has to do
something else, she pouts and throws a lip at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Trey loves a lot of sports, Griffey said, but enjoys baseball a
lot. ``And he knows when I got a hit or not because I'm standing on
a base.''
</P>
<P>
   Does he know when Dad hits a home run?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh sure,'' Griffey said, ``because the fireworks go off in the
Kingdome. He's a smart kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Trey, out of the corner of his eye, also just might be checking
out the home run race on a regular basis, like, despite assertions
to the contrary, certain other members of his immediate family.

MOTHER WHO LEFT CHILDREN ALONE AT NIGHT IS ARRESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Alerted by a neighbor who spotted a dazed 3-year-old
boy wandering outside in the middle of the night, the police on
Sunday arrested a Brooklyn woman who they said left her six
children home alone while she went to a party Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The mother, Samantha Stevens, 29, returned home from the party
around 5 a.m. Sunday and found police officers and child welfare
workers in her Bedford-Stuyvesant apartment. She was arrested and
charged with endangering the welfare of her children and with
possession of cocaine, said Theresa Farello, a department
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The children _ ranging in age from 5-month-old twin boys to an
11-year-old girl _ were discovered after the neighbor, Roslyn
Grahme, 41, looked out the window of her first-floor apartment at
709 Lafayette Ave. shortly after 3 a.m. and saw the 3-year-old boy,
clad only in diapers, walking by himself in a courtyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was just standing there shivering,'' she recalled. ``I
tried to give him some comfort. He wouldn't respond. He just kept
looking up.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens was arrested on six counts of endangering the welfare of
a child and one count of drug possession, for a small amount of
cocaine found in her purse. The family had no prior history with
the Administration for Children's Services, said Leonora Wiener, an
agency spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stevens lived in a homeless shelter with the children before
she moved into her apartment in April, said a city official who
spoke on condition of anonymity. The official said Ms. Stevens told
the police that she had thought it was safe to leave the children
in bed when she went to the party around midnight.

MEMORIES OF SILVER, BACK IN FORM, WINS HER SECOND STRAIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. _ Form was served with precision at
Saratoga Sunday, for a change, when Memories of Silver, the clear
favorite, won the $200,000 Ballston Spa Handicap by two lengths and
the second choice, Witchful Thinking, ran second.
</P>
<P>
   The race was only the second this year for Memories of Silver,
who sustained a stress fracture of her right hind leg last
November. Running with two metal screws in her leg, she won her
second straight race. With Jerry Bailey riding, she won for the
eighth time in 17 starts.
</P>
<P>
   The 5-year-old mare, who is trained by James Toner, ran the mile
and a sixteenth on the grass in 1:40 4/5. She returned $3.60 for a
$2 bet to win and earned $126,600 for a career total of $1.2
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just hoping she was the same old Memories of Silver,''
Bailey said, ``and she was.''
</P>
<P>
   NTRA Progress Report
</P>
<P>
   The first 100 days of the new National Thoroughbred Racing
Association were depicted in glowing terms before the racing
industry's most prominent owners and breeders at the Jockey Club's
46th annual Round Table conference Sunday at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   The glow was provided by Tim Smith, the Atlanta lawyer who took
office as commissioner of the NTRA on April 1, and by several of
the vice presidents and marketing people he has hired. They said
they had created a ``league office'' for racing, a national buying
service, a national television plan and, pitching the whole effort
toward a young audience, a new slogan: ``Go, Baby, Go.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort cost racing people $22 million, some of it spent to
buy time on the Fox Sports network for a series of eight races next
year for senior handicap horses. The series will begin on Jan. 30
with the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park, which has been moved up
one week to take advantage of Fox's broadcast of the Super Bowl the
next day.
</P>
<P>
   Points will be awarded to horses, somewhat in the manner of the
American Championship Racing Series, which went out of business
three years ago. The new series will end in August; Smith could not
say whether Saratoga would be involved.
</P>
<P>
   Smith also announced the formation of a committee on racing
integrity and drug testing. It will consist of eight members under
Ogden Mills Phipps, chairman of the Jockey Club, and R.D. Hubbard,
chairman of Hollywood Park. Its chief goal will be to recommend
policies to evaluate and standardize drug-testing procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Cameo for Skip Away
</P>
<P>
   The big gray horse took the track by himself between the fourth
and fifth races Sunday, and the crowd needed no prompting to know
that this was Skip Away, the champion older horse and
second-leading money-winner in racing history. He was dressed in
full battle regalia for his workout, and he even had his regular
jockey, Jerry Bailey, in the saddle as he made a public appearance
booked to soothe people who wanted to see him run at Saratoga.
</P>
<P>
   Both his owner, Carolyn Hine, and his trainer, Sonny Hine, who
is her husband, were watching from the winner's circle, where Skip
Away has appeared seven straight times while running his career
earnings to $8.9 million, just $1 million behind Cigar. His next
performance will be at the Iselin Handicap at Monmouth Park on Aug.
30.
</P>
<P>
   Skip Away was clocked in lightning times: 23 1/5 seconds for the
first quarter-mile, 46 3/5 for the half-mile and 1:10 for
three-quarters of a mile. When he came back to the winner's circle,
Sonny Hine was awarded one of the Skip Away posters given to
spectators as they entered the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``And they say he doesn't like Saratoga,'' Sonny Hine said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have liked to see him go in 1:11, but he always goes
quicker than I want.''

U.S. OPEN HOPES CATERER'S RETURN WILL BE A WINNER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GLENN COLLINS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ These days, as New York City prepares to serve up the
last Grand Slam tournament of the year, are tennis die-hards
focused on whether Patrick Rafter can defend his title? Are they
rooting for Pete Sampras to retrieve his No. 1 ranking? Do they
worry whether Martina Hingis can hold off the Williams sisters yet
again?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly.
</P>
<P>
   This is the U.S. Open at the National Tennis Center in Flushing
Meadows, Queens, the most star-powered fortnight in all of sports.
And naturally, New York's tennis mavens are obsessed with the menu.
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot believe the incredible preoccupation with the food
at the Open,'' said the comedian Alan King, who has attended the
tournament since the 1950s and said that the cuisine has become
``just about as legendary as the tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to some stunning culinary volleys recently, courtside
gourmets will be studying the menu with new urgency at this year's
Open, which begins Aug. 31. Last year, when the newly renovated
National Tennis Center made its debut with much fanfare, there were
howls of protest over slow service and the price of pizza. The
caterer, Sportservice Corp. of Buffalo, resigned in February after
completing only two years of its seven-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   So the U.S. Tennis Association brought back Restaurant
Associates, the street-smart New York food provider that served the
Open from 1976 to 1995, introducing courtside delicacies ranging
from quiche to panini and baguettes.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in spring, Restaurant Associates _ creator of some of New
York's most popular restaurants, including the Four Seasons and the
Brasserie _ was acquired by a British concern that is the world's
largest food-service company, Compass Group PLC. And suddenly, the
Open became the first public test of this new multinational
corporate pairing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Open food'' has been a subject of compulsive scrutiny since
Restaurant Associates introduced quiche Lorraine in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Hard-breathing news bulletins on such introductions as tamarillo
fruit and ciabatta bread, as well as on the price of pizza, have
been one of the longest-running cliches of the coverage of the
Open. ``When they don't have any interesting matches to show, the
TV crews always feel they have to do reports on the food,'' said
Malcolm Knapp, who heads a restaurant consulting concern in
Manhattan that bears his name.
</P>
<P>
   And Restaurant Associates ``will be under the microscope because
they're coming back,'' he added. ``People think the food service
last year stank, so there will be a lot of questions: Is the food
good again? Is it being served on time at parties and in the
suites? Has RA been affected by the acquisition? And what about the
cost?''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the food crews are slaving round the clock at the
Tennis Center, under fierce pressure to prepare for the assault of
the expected 550,000 visitors over 14 days who will buy $12 million
worth of food. Restaurant Associates is putting 1,300 hourly
workers on the front line, and bringing in 200 managers.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the tourney, tennisdom is expected to go through
40,000 pounds of hot dogs, 50,000 pounds of hamburgers, 3 tons of
shrimp, 2,000 gallons of tomato sauce, 12,000 cases of Evian water,
15,000 baguettes and 15 tons of french fries.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like the biggest opening of the biggest show you can
imagine,'' said Nick Valenti, chief executive of Restaurant
Associates. ``You have to stay focused or you'll be overcome.''
</P>
<P>
   While most spectators' perception of the cuisine is shaped by
hamburgers and pizza slices, the ultimate judgments are made by
corporations that have parties for hundreds in their hospitality
suites or entertain clients in the restaurants and private boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stadium restaurants have to look permanent and feel
permanent, and then you shut them down in two weeks after
satisfying the most demanding audience in the world,'' Valenti
said. This year the operations include the five restaurants, 35
concession stands and the Food Village stands as well as the 90
luxury suites and the dining operations for the Open staff, the
umpires, the news media and more than 600 players.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the job for Restaurant Associates is the
unpredictability of the demand for food, which ``ebbs and flows
every day due to the match-ups, the scores and the weather,''
Valenti said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, summer brownouts have shut off the electronic
registers. A near-tornado tore down food tents. Hundred-degree days
have tested soda inventory and 50-degree nights have challenged
hot-coffee delivery. ``When the temperature goes above 90 degrees,
we sell no food,'' said Joe Polidoro, the company's vice president
for special events. ``It's just water, soda and beer.''
</P>
<P>
   Knapp, the consultant, said the Open is always a food gamble
because ``all you need is one or two rain days and your profit is
gone.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment was echoed by Michael Bailey, president and chief
executive of the North American subsidiary of Compass, the new
corporate parent of Restaurant Associates. ``The risks are always
great at sporting events, the uncertainties many,'' he said. ``But
of course, customers aren't interested in the problems of
organizing the event, they just want a good sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for Compass, the dominant force in the
lucrative European event-catering and stadium-service industry,
which acquired Restaurant Associates ``to move us into the
concession market in the United States,'' Bailey said. ``RA will
allow us to seriously bid for more museums, performing arts centers
and sports groups nationwide.''
</P>
<P>
   Also under pressure is the Tennis Association, which was stung
last September by corporate displeasure. ``Some people had a bad
time last year,'' acknowledged Suzanne Maguire, who supervises
food-service operations for the association. ``I hope they'll give
us a chance and give Restaurant Associates a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, corporations are pleased. Recently, Restaurant
Associates held a tasting for suite-holders and
corporate-hospitality planners. ``The presentations were beautiful,
and the choices were smart,'' said Rosemarie Salvatore, a
coordinator of the Open suite for Arthur Andersen, the accounting
and consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to be eating light in summertime,'' she said,
explaining that ``last year they had hot food in chafing dishes,
all wrong for the season.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a shame _ the stadium was gorgeous but the food
was lacking, disorganized and everything was last-minute,'' she
said. ``So many people had food delivered late, and didn't get what
they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   The hiring of Sportservice Corp. in 1996 generated seismic waves
of food-world gossip thanks to the fame of the restaurant companies
involved. The Buffalo caterer took as its local subcontractors two
of the biggest names in New York's food firmament: Joseph Baum &AMP;
Michael Whiteman Co. in Manhattan and Glorious Food, the upscale
caterer for society, celebrities and art galleries.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, Sportservice exercised the exit clause in its
contract. ``We are in business to make money and, unfortunately,
the way our contract with the USTA was structured, that simply
wasn't possible,'' said Nancy Parker, president of Sportservice.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, that was the reason Restaurant Associates decided in
1995 against accepting a stringent contract offered by the tennis
association.
</P>
<P>
   But now that Restaurant Associates is back, Valenti is promising
aficionados better food at a lower price. Slices of pizza will be
$4.25 instead of $5; at $3.25, the all-beef frankfurter on caraway
bun with Grey Poupon mustard will be 25 cents cheaper than its
less-distinguished predecessor last year, and ham and Brie on a
baguette will be a dollar cheaper, at $7.50, than last year's more
ho-hum ham and Swiss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this price-cutting, Knapp said that Restaurant
Associates could make a profit thanks to its ``operating
efficiencies and the economies of scale they have.''
</P>
<P>
   Valenti has no intention of losing money. ``This may be a
high-profile event, but it certainly can't be a loss leader,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But for now his troops are focused less on profit, or loss, than
on doing battle. ``This year Yogi Berra is our philosopher,''
Valenti said. ``It ain't over till it's over.''

 &HT;    Polls just a way to say `We're No. 1'
 &HT;    By Dave George
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ So this year it's Ohio State, unanimous
choice of the media types who order The Associated Press pre-season
poll and the coaches who rank college football teams for USA Today
and ESPN. Works for me, whether the Buckeyes are deserving or not.
</P>
<P>
   After all, the best team will bubble up over the course of an
entire season, not in the collection of one slipshod survey. It is
a law of physics, right after the one that says an object at rest
must remain at rest until the stupid alarm goes off.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State had no business being ranked No. 1 in the AP poll
last August. Neither, in retrospect, did Florida belong atop the
coaches' pre-season poll. Proving the point is simple enough.
</P>
<P>
   Remember how the Nittany Lions and Gators met in the Florida
Citrus Bowl on New Year's Day? Should have been yet another Game of
the Century according to the summer seedings, but it didn't even
qualify as the Game of the Afternoon. Michigan and Washington State
easily earned that honor in a Rose Bowl matchup that promised to
settle at least half of the national championship picture. The
other half belonged to Nebraska and Tennessee in the Orange Bowl,
the Game of the Following Day.
</P>
<P>
   What the polls planted in August, in other words, were apples
and what blossomed in January were oranges. Exotic oranges at that,
a juicy Michigan-Nebraska hybrid that tasted sweet to some and sour
to others.
</P>
<P>
   Always constants
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are a few reliable factors from year to year.
Florida State and Nebraska will live up to their pre-season
billing. Tennessee will not. Notre Dame will get thrown into the
rankings somewhere just because it is Notre Dame. And Air Force or
one of the other service academies will pick up a few by-the-way
votes just because this is America, pilgrim.
</P>
<P>
   Atop this shaky framework a No. 1 team must be tacked every
August. This year it's Ohio State, a team that lost three times
last year and finished at No. 12. Accept that as a coronation or a
curse, but not without reviewing the following list of teams whose
pre-season 1997 rankings varied wildly from the listing that
mattered most, the 1997 put-it-in-granite post-season poll.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State, for openers, dropped 15 spots last year from its
original No. 1 ranking in the AP poll. Michigan, the eventual
national co-champion, climbed from 14th to first in the same poll.
Nebraska started No. 6 on both summer charts, then wound up the
coaches' choice as national champion and second in the AP voting.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA, Washington State and Georgia were the real movers,
however. Completely unranked in August, each wound up in the top
ten.
</P>
<P>
   Even worse, Washington State received one measly vote on the
original AP chart. Incredibly, Rice did, too. Let's face it. Rice
shouldn't start the season on a par with a Rose Bowl team, not even
if Uncle Ben has an AP vote.
</P>
<P>
   It's only paper
</P>
<P>
   Save the indignation, therefore, over FSU being ranked behind an
Ohio State team the Seminoles beat by 17 points in last January's
Sugar Bowl. Save the angst over the Gators starting out behind the
Seminoles, or the Hurricanes being blown off altogether. Save it
all until something significant happens. A kickoff, let's say.
</P>
<P>
   The straw polls of summer may prove to be right about the
Buckeyes and all the rest of it, but you'll need a Ouija board to
convince me just yet.

 &HT;    Marlins fall to Giants 3-2
 &HT;    By Dan Graziano
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Runs can be deceiving, and they sure were for
the Florida Marlins on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, sure, they got two. They scored one in the first on a
bases-loaded single by Derrek Lee, and another in the sixth on a
solo home run by Kevin Orie.
</P>
<P>
   But the story of this game _ which ended in a 3-2 loss to the
San Francisco Giants at 3Com Park _ was the runs they didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been the same story all series,'' Orie said. ``We had our
chances. Usually, if you squander just one opportunity against good
teams you're going to lose. And we had a few today, which makes it
that much more frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Five times in the game, the Marlins had a runner on third base
with less than two outs. Only one of those five scored.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we obviously need to get better at,'' right
fielder Mark Kotsay said. ``Getting that runner in from third with
less than two outs. It's the fundamentals. You do all the little
things right, and you're usually rewarded with a win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Little things. Like scoring more than one run in the first
inning if the first four batters get hits.
</P>
<P>
   Yep, that's right. The first four Marlins hitters singled off
Giants starter Orel Hershiser. Lee's was the fourth of those
singles, and it came on Hershiser's sixth pitch and drove in Todd
Dunwoody from third.
</P>
<P>
   But after that, Cliff Floyd hit a hard line drive to right that
wasn't deep enough to score the runner from third, Orie popped out,
and Gregg Zaun grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the first time in a long time that I can recall a
team getting four hits and only one run in an inning,'' Giants
manager Dusty Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   So when the Giants got two runs in the bottom of the first
against Marlins starter Jesus Sanchez, Hershiser had a lead in
spite of himself. The Giants extended the lead to 3-1 in the bottom
of the fifth against reliever Brian Edmondson, so Orie's homer
simply cut the lead to 3-2.
</P>
<P>
   They could have had more in the sixth, as Luis Castillo singled
with one out and went to third on center fielder Shawon Dunston's
error. But Hershiser struck out Ryan Jackson and Dunwoody to strand
Castillo.
</P>
<P>
   And they could have had at least one in the eighth, when Orie
stood on third with one out. But former Marlin John Johnstone
struck out pinch-hitter John Cangelosi and Dunwoody.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have that many opportunities, you've got to produce
in one of them, at least,'' Dunwoody said. ``There's no excuse.
I've got to perform in that situation.''
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't. And neither did anyone else. Lots of bad things
happened to the Marlins in this one:
</P>
<P>
   _ They failed to get two key sacrifice bunts down, and one of
those failures cost them Sanchez, who left the game in the fourth
inning with a cut on the tip of his index finger where the ball had
hit it on his failed bunt attempt;
</P>
<P>
   _ And they struck out 12 times, including 10 with runners in
scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Jim Leyland's 2,000th game as a major-league manager
turned into his 1,013th loss. And the Marlins lost all three games
in San Francisco to finish their west coast road trip 3-6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrible at-bats,'' Leyland said. ``Terrible at-bats in big
spots. It's the same thing every night.''

 &HT;    Backup job is not Erickson's just yet
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ Craig Erickson's Sunday consisted of meetings, a
brief warmup, a couple snaps during an offensive line drill and an
hour of watching Dan Marino and Damon Huard throwing passes.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why his No. 2 quarterback had spent practice as a
spectator, Miami Dolphins coach Jimmy Johnson didn't answer in
words.
</P>
<P>
   He merely tapped his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing serious,'' Johnson insisted. ``We're just resting
him a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dolphins did play two pre-season games in six days, with
Erickson handling the bulk of the quarterback duties, throwing more
than twice as many passes (25) as Marino (12), Huard (12) or Chad
May (8).
</P>
<P>
   That work hasn't produced the kind of results that Johnson or
Erickson wanted. The seventh-year pro completed only 44 percent of
his passes (11 of 25) and threw two interceptions and no touchdowns
for a passing rating of 20.6.
</P>
<P>
   To top it off, Johnson has refused to name Erickson as the
clear-cut backup to Marino. Johnson says that Huard, a free-agent
who holds the No. 3 spot after the release of Chad May and John
Dutton, still has a shot at moving up the depth chart.
</P>
<P>
   Erickson shrugs this off. As he explains, he's had to deal with
debate about his play for years, dating back to when he was at the
University of Miami and Cardinal Newman High School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try not to let a whole lot bother me,'' he said. ``Believe
me, I've had a lot worse criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Coaches in the dark: Fans and the media aren't the only ones
who wait until cut-down days to see who survives cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant coaches also are kept in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way Johnson wants it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes the coaches want to bring up (who will or won't make
the team) and I am very emphatic with them that they don't
speculate,'' Johnson said. ``That's not their concern. ... I talk
to them about who's playing well, who's not playing well. We do not
discuss who's going to be on the roster.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson discusses that with one person: himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to affect the coaches in a negative way and plant
a negative seed,'' he said. ``I don't think it's really productive
for a coach to be working with a player who thinks he's going to
get cut. And I don't think it's very productive for a player to try
to make our team when he reads in the paper that he's going to get
cut.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Talk about bulletin board material: How about Dan Marino and
David Hasselhoff, separated at birth?
</P>
<P>
   Two sports magazines have noted the resemblance between the
Dolphins' quarterback and the actor. ESPN Magazine noted the
similarity. Sport went one step further, making the two a ``Sport
morph'' _ a line of mug shots that gradually transforms from Marino
on the left to Hasselhoff on the right.
</P>
<P>
   That feature ended up taped to a board in the Dolphins' locker
room.
</P>
<P>
   _ Good deed of the week: The Dolphins brought 2,400
disadvantaged children from South Florida to Pro Player Stadium for
the pre-season home opener Thursday against Tampa Bay.

 &HT;    O'Meara settles for fourth
 &HT;    By Craig Dolch
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ It must have been another Sunday at a major,
because the name ``O'Meara'' was once again moving to the top of
the leader board.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara, bidding to join Ben Hogan as the only golfers to win
three majors in the same year, got within two shots of the early
lead shared Sunday by Vijay Singh and Steve Stricker at the PGA
Championship.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Meara fell back with three straight bogeys. Typically, he
steadied himself to shoot 68 and finish tied for fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been a great dream to go alongside Ben Hogan,
but it just wasn't meant to be,'' O'Meara said. ``Just to be
mentioned in the same breath is pretty amazing,'' O'Meara said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Meara looked to be following the pattern of his victories in
the Masters and British Open when he made a 40-foot eagle on the
second hole and followed that with a birdie on the fifth. But he
missed the green on the next three holes and failed to get
up-and-down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I realized if I got off to a quick start, I had just as good a
chance as anybody else,'' O'Meara said. ``But unfortunately the
bogeys on six, seven and eight really kind of took the wind out of
my sails.''
</P>
<P>
   Price makes run: Jupiter Island's Nick Price made a late move at
winning his third PGA title, going birdie-birdie-eagle from the
ninth through 11th holes to move into third place. But he never got
closer than four shots after finishing with seven consecutive pars.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't give myself much of a chance of winning
because it didn't look like either Vijay or Steve were wavering,''
Price said. ``I felt I had to get it to seven-under, and that's a
tall order on these last six holes.''
</P>
<P>
   Price didn't come away empty, shooting a five-under 65 to match
Greg Kraft's day-old course record. He also finished tied for
fourth, matching his performance at the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about the course record a little bit,'' Price said.
``And I had a great opportunity on 16 (missing an 8-footer) and the
ball hung on the lip on 17. But I putted as well today as I have in
a long time, so that's a good sign.''
</P>
<P>
   Renwick gets caddy hat trick: Singh may have won his first major
Sunday, but this was the third major victory for his caddy, David
Renwick of Scotland. Renwick also won the 1995 PGA with Steve
Elkington and the 1994 Masters with Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the best,'' Renwick said. ``Why? Because of Vijay.
He's a great guy to work for. He never gives you any crap out there
and he listens to you. I know people say he doesn't have a
personality, but that's just the way he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Renwick, 45, started working with Singh 10 months ago. Among the
many players Renwick has worked for during the years was Tequesta's
Jay Townsend on the European Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Noteworthy: With O'Meara winning the two majors, Tiger Woods
will be able to join his close friend in the Grand Slam because
Woods had the best performance in the majors among players who
previously had won a major.
</P>
<P>
   Woods was eighth at the Masters, 18th at the U.S. Open, third at
the British Open and 10th at the PGA. They will be joined by Singh
and U.S. Open winner Lee Janzen.

USC LOOKS RAW IN SCRIMMAGE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVINE, Calif. _ As his first week of training camp concluded,
USC coach Paul Hackett couldn't help but say what he's been
thinking for several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are so young and inexperienced. It's painful almost, what
we have to go through,'' Hackett said. ``It'll be fine in a year or
two, but it doesn't help much now.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett might be thinking long-term, but he was actually more
upbeat about the offense's meek performance in the opening
scrimmage Saturday, after having a day to review the tape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was more pleased than I thought I would be,'' Hackett said.
``We had some good individual performances. We're just not in sync
as a group.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett mentioned freshman tailback Frank Strong and offensive
linemen Jason Grain, Matt Welch and Travis Claridge as players who
stood out.
</P>
<P>
   He also liked freshman quarterback Jason Thomas, who saw his
most extensive action during the scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Jason Thomas played the best he's played since he's
been here,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Decision time: Hackett said he will decide by today or no
later than Tuesday who will back up starting quarterback Mike Van
Raaphorst for the Purdue game. Freshman Carson Palmer appears to be
the heavy favorite for the role.
</P>
<P>
   Several other starting positions, notably along the offensive
line, will probably be announced by midweek. Hackett said Grain is
getting close to locking up the starting position at left guard.
The center and right tackle positions also remain open.
</P>
<P>
   On defense, Ken Haslip seems ahead of Antuan Simmons at
cornerback, and Grant Pearsall is probably going to start ahead of
David Gibson at strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   __ Emergency punters: With freshman Mike MacGillivray the only
true punter, place kicker David Bell and wide receiver Mike
Bastianelli have been recruited as the backups.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury report: Running back Sultan McCullough sat out
Sunday's practice with a sore hip. Offensive lineman Derek Graf of
Agoura has been bothered by a twisted knee for most of training
camp.

 &HT;    Singh finally wins big one on U.S. soil
 &HT;    By Furman Bisher
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   REDMOND, Wash. _ Vijay Singh has now won a golf tournament in 13
countries, and the lucky 13th was the biggest, the sweetest of them
all. And before somebody else says it, let me say the fourth round
of the PGA Championship was a day of Singh-ing in the rain at
Sahalee Country Club, in the suburbs of Seattle. That is to make up
for a week of avoiding any cornball reference to ``Sleepless in
Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   Singh, of course, is the first Fijian to win one of golf's major
championships. Also, the first Asian Indian. Also, the first former
pro from Borneo.
</P>
<P>
   The world has been Singh's tour since he set out from the
islands in the South Pacific, until he finally settled in the
United States in 1993 in Ponte Vedra, Fla. At the advanced age of
30, he became the PGA Tour's ``rookie of the year.'' At the age of
35 he is the champion of the golf pros' world, the PGA of America,
whose members are the guys dealing from the pro shops of your
courses.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday broke at Sahalee with the possibility of several story
lines. Davis Love III had a chance to win again the championship he
won under the prophetic rainbow at Winged Foot last year. No PGA
champion had successfully defended his title since Denny Shute in
1937. Mark O'Meara had the chance of winning his third major of the
year, to go with the Masters and British Open, which hadn't been
done since Ben Hogan in 1953. Steve Stricker could celebrate his
return from oblivion, from 130th rank on tour to PGA champion.
Frank Lickliter, from out of nowhere, could win one for the
``blue-collars.'' Skip Kendall could win one for all the ``Skips''
in the world. And, was Sahalee ``Tiger-proof,'' as advertised? (It
was. Tiger finished tied for 10th.)
</P>
<P>
   Slowly and devastatingly, all the themes began falling apart.
O'Meara moved within two shots of the lead, then bogeyed himself
out of it with three duds in a row. Love had said, ``I needed to
get off to a hot start. I've made enough birdies. I just need to
eliminate the bogeys.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't get off to a hot start again. ``I didn't birdie the
2nd hole and I hit it in the water again on the 5th,'' he said.
``That did it,'' though he picked up three strokes on the back
nine. If he had played the front nine as well as he did the back
nine over the four days, he could have been in the fight. He was
five over on the front nine, five under on the back.
</P>
<P>
   Lickliter managed to hang in and collect a check of $118,000 for
a tie-fourth. Kendall flitted across the board and out of sight.
Nick Price put up the best numbers of the day, a 65 that tied Greg
Kraft's course record, and of course, any record was a record for
all time at Sahalee. Colin Montgomerie went into the weekend just a
stroke off the lead, then crashed.
</P>
<P>
   The main event was taking place in the final pairing, Singh and
Stricker, who began the day tied at 203, seven strokes under
par-70. The 2nd hole is a par-5 playing a short 507 yards, the
green guarded by a pond up front and a bunker left. Singh got the
jump here when Stricker pulled his tee shot into the woods and took
two strokes to escape. Then he birdied the 3rd and 4th holes and
took a lead, but by the turn, Singh was two-up again.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of luck, the defining hole was the 11th, the second
par-5 that threads its way through the trees. Singh pushed his
approach shot into trees right of the green, and miraculously the
ball popped out on the putting surface. When he might have been
looking bogey in the face, he birdied, but so did Stricker.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pretty good coming down the 18th fairway with a
two-stroke lead,'' he said. ``My caddie had told me about the 14th
hole, `Hey, you can do better than this. You're going to lose this
thing if you keep on playing like this.' '' He birdied the 15th
hole, and the rest was pretty academic.
</P>
<P>
   Singh has circled the globe many times trying to find his place
in golf's world, from South Pacific to Asia to South Africa and the
European Tour before coming here. He is somewhat of an introvert,
more dour than droll, sometimes amiable to arrogant. It is a world
in which he has found success, but somehow appears not to get full
enjoyment out of it. It seems he carried a chip on his shoulder
from some dark chapter in his past. This, then, should be the kind
of glorious event that could bring out a personality heretofore
hidden from public view.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After interrogating President Clinton's wife,
friends and closest political allies, Kenneth Starr's prosecutors
on Monday confront Clinton himself, the ultimate target of an
inquiry that began four years ago with an Arkansas land deal that
few Americans could fathom and became a sex scandal most Americans
say they would rather forget. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's office has been resolutely secretive
about the approach it will use in questioning under oath a
president with enormous popular resilience and a penchant for
hairsplitting. But lawyers familiar with the case say some hints
about the possible character of the questioning can be gleaned from
the roller coaster ride of the past seven months, when Starr's
inquiry abruptly shifted from the Whitewater real estate venture to
a chatty, love-struck former intern named Monica Lewinsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They suggest that the prosecutors come to the interrogation
steeled by a sense of the Clinton presidency as a recurring pattern
of evasion, coverup and concealment. They suggest that the
questioners are unlikely to be intimidated by Clinton's office.
They suggest that Starr will come fortified with questions about
allegations of obstruction of justice, ranging well beyond the
intimate details of sexual encounters.
</P>
<P>
   To outsiders, the prosecutors' decision to turn their attention
to the president's alleged sexual appetites may have seemed like a
radical, even desperate, departure from Starr's mandate. But it was
less of a leap for Starr. His many tentacled investigation, which
first focused on events when Clinton was governor of Arkansas,
evolved through the 1992 election campaign and continued into his
presidency, already focused on whether Clinton's intimates had
sought to suppress information by giving less than forthright
accounts or covering up questionable behavior.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To Starr and some of his associates, the allegations of evasive
and deceitful behavior in the Lewinsky case were part of a pattern
they believed they had found in Whitewater, the White House travel
office episode, the death of White House deputy counsel Vincent
Foster and related matters.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of the Lewinsky matter, the independent counsel's
staff of more than 40 prosecutors and investigators was sharply
divided, the lawyers disclosed, over how to handle the allegations
that Clinton had sex with the intern and conspired criminally to
conceal the encounters.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors wanted to give Ms. Lewinsky immunity
immediately and quickly deliver a report to Capitol Hill solely on
the allegations surrounding her alleged affair with the president,
according to the lawyers. Others argued for a much more painstaking
approach, in which the grand jury would subpoena every possible
witness or document, assemble a detailed narrative that could
confirm Ms. Lewinsky's story and also draw parallels to alleged
obstruction of justice investigated in the earlier inquiries. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was Starr, the deliberative former judge, who made the
decision. A man with no prosecutorial experience and a tendency to
ponder, Starr ultimately sided with those who wanted to squeeze out
every last bit of evidence about the president's relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky, setting the stage for a climactic showdown that poses
a threat of impeachment or a sullied place in history for Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   To his supporters, Starr has conducted his inquiry as an
old-fashioned, white-collar criminal investigation _ a meticulous
search for facts and contradictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was your typical, very plodding, very methodical criminal
investigation that moved toward gathering evidence that gets you
closer and closer to your ultimate target,'' said Barbara Olson, a
Washington lawyer who is a defender of Starr's. ``If you can't get
witnesses to cooperate _ and only one has cooperated here _ then
you get evidence any way you can, and you take as long as it takes,
and you don't worry about what anybody thinks.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But to his considerable number of detractors, Starr's decisions
are those of an obsessed inquisitor desperately grasping for
something, anything, that can help him land a blow against a
frustratingly elusive adversary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Who could possibly perceive Ken Starr as `independent' at this
point?'' asked Nancy Luque, a former federal prosecutor who faults
Starr for lack of discretion in his zeal as independent counsel.
``He has so much riding on his report, a battle to the death. His
ability to continue with credibility in this town hangs on his
ability to get a scalp.''

<P>
   Starr Seeks to Expand Inquiry
</P>
<P>
   The events that will bring Starr to the White House Monday were
set in motion well before Clinton became president. During the 1992
campaign, The New York Times published an article describing the
involvement of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Whitewater
Development Co. and the role of their partner, James McDougal, an
Arkansas ally who had once run a failed savings and loan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That article prompted federal regulators to look more closely at
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan, and they emerged with suspicions
of criminality in 1993, possibly by the president or his wife. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Robert Fiske was named independent counsel to investigate, and
Starr took over in August 1994. His mandate quickly came to include
investigation of the suicide of Vincent Foster, a White House
deputy counsel, as well as charges that Webster Hubbell, the
associate attorney general, had bilked the Rose law firm in Little
Rock, Ark., where he and Hillary Clinton had worked before coming
to Washington. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the inquiry ground on, the career prosecutors who had been
enlisted in the case became convinced that the Clinton camp was
thwarting their work.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Records of Mrs. Clinton's work for Madison Guaranty, which had
been under subpoena for several years but could not be found,
suddenly turned up in a White House room near the area where the
president resides. Companies with ties to Clinton paid Hubbell
hundreds of thousands of dollars in consulting fees, just as
Hubbell faced a prison sentence and prosecutors were pressuring him
to cooperate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so when Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend,
approached Starr on Jan. 12 of this year with her surreptitiously
recorded tapes and allegations that the president had an affair in
the White House and tried to cover it up, lawyers say Starr's
office saw it as the latest episode in an ongoing pattern of
duplicity. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Investigators immediately seized on the purported role of Vernon
Jordan, Clinton's close confident, in counseling Ms. Lewinsky and
helping her find a job in New York after she was called as a
witness in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit. Jordan is a
director of Revlon, the company that had hired Hubbell as a
consultant and had agreed to hire Ms. Lewinsky before the
allegations became public. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Even before they went to the Justice Department, investigators
placed a hidden tape recorder on Mrs. Tripp, who recorded Ms.
Lewinsky making further statements about the effort to keep secret
her relationship with Clinton. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With that, Starr felt he had enough to seek a broadening of his
mandate. And there was something more, the lawyers have now
disclosed, that hinted at a coverup and played a role in the
decision. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   They say that Mrs. Tripp told investigators that when she had
worked as a White House secretary in the counsel's office, she saw
a memorandum with a notation by Hillary Rodham Clinton related to
the dismissal of the White House travel office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had never seen such a document, suggesting the possibility
that evidence in a case he was investigating had been destroyed. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Never cited publicly, the alleged missing memorandum became an
important element in Starr's argument to the Justice Department
that there was a multifaceted White House pattern of obstructing
justice. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Starr presented the ``talking points'' document, which
Mrs. Tripp told prosecutors Ms. Lewinsky had given her to shape her
testimony in the Paula Jones case. Ms. Lewinsky now says she wrote
the document and had no help from anyone in the White House,
according to those familiar with her account.
</P>
<P>
   Reno Acts Quickly to Appoint Counsel
</P>
<P>
   For Attorney General Janet Reno, the decision to enlarge Starr's
inquiry was easy. She and five or six career and political
appointees agreed: Allegations of subornation of perjury and
obstruction of justice in a case in which the president is being
investigated was more than enough to meet the standard set by the
independent counsel statute of a ``conflict of interest'' for Ms.
Reno to conduct the inquiry, several lawyers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting on Jan. 16, they agreed that the case had to be
referred to an independent counsel. The only decision left was
whether it should be given to Starr. As one Justice Department
official put it, ``We knew that the president's deposition was the
following day and that it could take weeks for a new independent
counsel to be named. There was no time. And we didn't want people
to think we dragged our feet to help the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in the Justice Department had just decided that an
independent counsel would not be appointed to investigate campaign
fund-raising calls from the White House by the president and Vice
President Al Gore. They were especially sensitive to criticism that
the Justice Department had made that decision to protect Clinton
and Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Within 24 hours of first hearing about Monica Lewinsky, Ms. Reno
referred the matter to a three-judge panel, recommending that the
inquiry be led by Starr. The panel quickly agreed.

</P>
<P>
   The Long Delay Over Immunity Issue
</P>
<P>
   In the first days of the inquiry last January, the most
contentious arguments inside Starr's office had to do with Monica
Lewinsky. Some prosecutors wanted to make a deal with her _
immediately. Others wanted to wait. A few others wanted to indict
her, and use the threat of jail to make her talk.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 16, within hours of getting jurisdiction, Starr's
prosecutors confronted Ms. Lewinsky at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in a
Washington suburb. They made her an offer that symbolized the
aggressiveness of the office: In return for complete immunity from
prosecution, they asked her to help them secretly record
conversations with the president and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   She steadfastly refused, saying she did not want to do to anyone
else what Mrs. Tripp had done to her. Within several days, Ms.
Lewinsky's lawyer, William Ginsburg, made a ``proffer'' of what Ms.
Lewinsky was willing to testify to: She said she had a sexual
relationship with Clinton, but that he did not encourage her to lie
about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   Some prosecutors were convinced that while Ms. Lewinsky was
trying to get herself out of trouble, she also wanted to protect
the president. A second proffer was made in early February. It
added details, and included an admission that she and Clinton had
discussed cover stories to conceal their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Two prosecutors, according to a Starr ally, advocated accepting
that proffer and concluding the inquiry within 60 days by sending a
report to the House of Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   But several senior prosecutors prevailed by arguing that the
inquiry should continue and not rely solely on the word of Ms.
Lewinsky, which could easily end in a ``he said-she said'' case.
</P>
<P>
   The office would not seal a deal with Ms. Lewinsky until July
27, after five more months of inquiry that heard from nearly 75
witnesses. When Ms. Lewinsky testified before the grand jury on
Aug. 6, it is not known whether she added any more information than
she had initially provided in her February proffer.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came time for Ms. Lewinsky to sit down with
prosecutors in late July, she was stunned at how much information
they had. ``They knew everything,'' Ms. Lewinsky told a friend. And
her immunity deal mandated that she tell the whole truth, or face
charges of perjury. A friend said, ``She held nothing back.''
</P>
<P>
   The Wide Sweep for Witnesses
</P>
<P>
   The standoff over immunity allowed Clinton's partisans to shift
the fight to the political arena, where they had a considerable
advantage.
</P>
<P>
   As Starr's approval ratings tumbled toward single digits, his
prosecutors fought back, hauling before the grand jury White House
officials they believed were bad-mouthing the investigation. This
backfired, giving Starr's critics fresh ammunition to attack him as
an abuser, not a defender, of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting creamed,'' a ranking Starr assistant conceded
last March.
</P>
<P>
   At least one decision that was roundly criticized at the time as
a public relations fiasco appears to have paid off. Armed with
several allusions on Mrs. Tripp's tape, the prosecutors subpoened
Ms. Lewinsky's mother, Marcia Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewis broke down under the questions and was portrayed by
Clinton defenders as a victim of sex-obsessed prosecutors
pruriently prying into confidences between mother and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   But as it turned out, Ms. Lewinsky had given her mother a
missing piece of evidence, according to those familiar with her
account _ a dress that is being tested at the Federal Bureau of
Investigation for DNA evidence that could link it to the president.
That made Ms. Lewis vulnerable to a possible charge of obstruction
of justice, and gave Ms. Lewinsky more incentive to strike a deal
with prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton Faces Questions
</P>
<P>
   As they were closing the deal with Ms. Lewinsky and her mother,
prosecutors made another important decision: They issued a grand
jury subpoena for testimony from the president of the United
States. The subpoena was never acknowledged by the White House
until the day it was withdrawn and it was announced that the
president would testify voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   But in the 10 days that Clinton had the subpoena, Starr made
several bold moves and won several important legal victories. He
forced members of the White House Secret Service detail and Bruce
Lindsey, the president's closest confidant, to testify before the
grand jury. His ethics adviser, Sam Dash, meanwhile, was pushing
hard to wrap up the inquiry and arrange for an immunity deal for
Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   On July 27, the day Clinton's subpoena ordered him to appear
before the grand jury, Ms. Lewinsky, who by now had cut her ties
with Ginsburg and hired new lawyers, stunned Washington with the
announcement that she and her mother had been granted full immunity
for her testimony. News reports said that Ms. Lewinsky would
testify about a sexual relationship. The following day, David
Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, announced that the
president, too, would testify on Aug. 17 from the White House via
closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's advisers have said that he is considering
acknowledging that he had sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, a
concession that might deflate talk of impeachment. But prosecutors
are certain to question Clinton about more than sex, and those
answers could prove more significant to the outcome of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   They will ask the president if he urged Ms. Lewinsky to return
gifts he had given her after they had been subpoenaed by the Jones
lawyers. They will also ask whether the president whether an effort
to find Ms. Lewinsky a job in New York was intended to keep her
from truthfully testifying in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has become a cliche that this investigation was never about
sex, but it really isn't,'' said Barbara Olson, the Starr partisan.
``It's always been about lies and coverups.''

JOHNSON, KIRALY SERVE UP ANOTHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BEN VILLA  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HERMOSA BEACH, Calif. _ Adam Johnson played so well on Sunday
that he had Karch Kiraly paying homage to him.
</P>
<P>
   As the three-time Olympic gold medalist and arguably the
greatest player ever to play beach volleyball watched, it was his
partner, Johnson, who carried the top-ranked team to victory. They
defeated the second-seeded team of Jose Loiola and Emanuel Rego
15-11 to defend their title at the 1998 Miller Lite AVP Tour U.S.
Championships in front of one of the biggest crowds ever Sunday at
the Hermosa Beach pier.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the greatest serving performances that I've ever
seen,'' said Kiraly, who won his record eighth tournament title at
Hermosa Beach. ``It seemed like every time Adam went to serve, he
got us a point.''
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Johnson officially had four aces, including the
final point when he aced Loiola and Rego by serving an untouched
ball to the back line that split the defenders.
</P>
<P>
   But it was more than the number of aces that made Johnson so
effective. Only a few serves were passed cleanly and the ones that
didn't go off Loiola or Rego's hands for aces were passed so badly
that the Brazilians could seldom set up their offense. Loiola and
Rego took an early 6-3 lead and later held an 11-9 edge, but the
defending champions kept rallying behind Johnson's serving.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was playing horribly to start the match and I just finally
said, `Hey, I don't want to go out like this,''' Johnson said. ``So
I decided to serve the snot out of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just got in a groove where time _ even when they took
timeouts _ didn't seem to stop. I felt great out there, and I guess
I got into a zone where they couldn't make any clean passes on my
serves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly's win was the 136th of his career on the AVP Tour, just
three behind the all-time record held by Sinjin Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Said Johnson, ``I wish I could have played like that all year
long, but I seem to be peaking at the right moment. Besides, when
you're playing with the best volleyball player ever, you better
hold up your end of the bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Kiraly and Johnson were undefeated in the tournament and split
$10,416. Loiola, who entered as the tour's top-ranked player, split
$5,937 with Rego. The all-Brazilian team reached the final by
beating fellow Brazilians Roberto Lopes and Franco Neto 15-9.
</P>
<P>
   Lopes and Neto, seeded-seventh in their first season on the AVP
Tour, continued to impress. They finished third and scored
victories over Loiola and Rego and Kent Steffes and Mike Whitmarsh,
the tournament's second- and third-seeded teams. Steffes and
Whitmarsh finished fourth.

FASSEL PONDERS A CHANGE AS BARBER'S DROPS ADD UP 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Tiki Barber never thought his second professional
season, a season for which he has held great expectations, could be
disarmed by something so simple: He keeps dropping the ball.
</P>
<P>
   But halfway through the Giants' preseason, after dropping a few
wide-open passes in games and several more passes in practice,
Barber, the starting running back meant to be a multipurpose
offensive weapon, finds himself on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jim Fassel of the Giants said Sunday that he might start
Gary Brown at halfback instead of Barber in Thursday night's
exhibition game with the Jets. Quarterback Danny Kanell has urged
Barber to take extra time catching before and after practice.
Reporters question him repeatedly about how long he has had this
``hands of stone'' problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like any time someone hears my name they're thinking
about me dropping a pass,'' Barber said Sunday. He was the only
player on the practice fields 40 minutes before the afternoon
session was to begin in this final week of training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Barber arrived early to practice _ what else? _ catching passes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've asked myself, `What's wrong with me?''' Barber said. ``I
can't catch the ball. It's so odd because it's something I've never
worried about in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber acknowledges that the problem has become a mental one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I run out of the backfield, the pass is coming my way, and I'm
thinking, `What are going to be the consequences if I drop this
pass?''' he said. ``That's a self-confidence thing. But I will just
have to work a little harder. A couple of good catches in a row
cures a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel sat down with Barber Sunday morning. The coach did all
the talking. ``I did say, `Yes, sir,' a couple of times,'' Barber
said. ``I always let the coaches do the coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel told Barber he also might reduce his role on third downs
on Thursday to take a longer look at the fullbacks Charles Way and
Greg Comella in third-down packages.
</P>
<P>
   That Fassel has been critical of Barber at all is a significant
change in their relationship. Barber has always been one of
Fassel's favorite players, a running back with the kind of
multipurpose skills that Fassel requires for his offense.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel, in fact, was so eager to get Barber that he agonized
when the team took Ike Hilliard in the first round of the draft
last year. Fassel was afraid Barber would not last until the
Giants' second pick. But Barber was still there, and Fassel was
singing his praises the next day.
</P>
<P>
   The compliments have been coming steadily since, until the last
10 days, when the football was too often at Barber's feet and not
in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Barber said he had not been wounded by his coach's criticism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want him to get on me,'' he said. ``It shows that he cares.
He told me that he's seen me make some spectacular catches and some
great plays and I'm not playing up to my abilities right now. And
he's right.''
</P>
<P>
   That Barber has had to spend so much time discussing what's
going wrong with his performance has been a profound disappointment
to him. Injured often during the preseason and during the regular
season last year, Barber had been counting on elevating his play in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   That is because he considers last season _ when he had 810
rushing and receiving yards and quickly became a popular player
because of his darting, elusive running style _ a mediocre year.
</P>
<P>
   ``All during the winter, fans would come up to me and say, `You
had a great year,''' Barber said. ``And I wanted to say, `It was
all right.' It wasn't something I'd go brag about. People saw me do
a few good things, a special run or catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in college, I did that every three plays, not every four
games. I want to be like that again.''
</P>
<P>
   During Sunday afternoon's practice, Barber did not drop a pass
in the team's seven-on-seven passing drills, and he made one
spectacular grab between two defenders.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't something I should have trouble working through,''
Barber said. ``I guess it's just been concentration. I can renew my
commitment to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he expected to be out early for practice again on
Monday, Barber nodded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what I need to do,'' he said. ``I understand the
message.''

EDITORIAL: TERROR IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Aug. 17:
</P>
<P>
   Everyone's worst fears about Northern Ireland were realized on
Saturday when a car bomb exploded in the town of Omagh, killing 28
people.
</P>
<P>
   While the majority of voters endorsed the peace agreement in
May, both Protestant and Catholic splinter groups have threatened
to express their opposition through violence.
</P>
<P>
   Now one of them, suspected to be an Irish Republican Army
splinter group called the Real IRA, has carried out the deadliest
attack in Northern Ireland since the conflict began three decades
ago. The group's aim can only be to provoke the return of violent
clashes by inspiring retaliation by Protestant groups. It is up to
police and politicians to ensure they do not succeed.
</P>
<P>
   The British prime minister, Tony Blair, rightly pointed out that
this bombing takes place in a very different political context from
previous ones. The Real IRA, which is thought to have fewer than
100 members, has no public support. In Omagh, the whole town pulled
together to treat victims, who include both Protestants and
Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the
IRA, said he was ``totally horrified'' by the bomb, adding, ``I
condemn it without any equivocation whatsoever.'' The statement is
a great improvement over Adams' past responses when the IRA or its
splinter groups have been held responsible for bombings. He
repeatedly expressed sorrow for the victims while never blaming the
perpetrators.
</P>
<P>
   The Real IRA, which operates out of the Irish Republic, must be
dealt with through swift and sure police work, not through
retaliation. The Irish police have had some success in catching its
members, though clearly not enough. Their stepped-up efforts must
be consistent with democratic practices, and should not include
internment without trial for suspected guerrillas. The Irish prime
minister, Bertie Ahern, said after the bombing that his government
would not rule out this tactic.
</P>
<P>
   Founded last year, the Real IRA is the most dangerous of three
IRA splinter groups. Police think its commander used to be in
charge of the IRA's weapons.
</P>
<P>
   David Trimble, a Protestant who is first minister of Northern
Ireland's new Assembly, charged after the bombing that it could
have been prevented had the IRA handed in its weapons. Trimble's
rhetoric is overheated, as the bomb appears to be made of products
easily available to a clever terrorist.
</P>
<P>
   No evidence has yet surfaced publicly to support the serious
charge that IRA members are passing weapons to splinter groups. But
to reassure Protestants, avoid further suspicion and prevent the
possibility that the weapons will be used, the IRA should begin to
turn its stockpiles over to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant politicians, especially those with links to
once-violent groups, must do everything they can to head off
retaliatory attacks. All politicians should intensify their efforts
to get the Northern Ireland Assembly going in the fall and then
create the cross-border body linking Northern Ireland and Irish
politicians. They must protect the bomb's real target, peace.

TYSON OFF TO NEVADA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Mike Tyson's little end run around Nevada, and the
New Jersey Athletic Commission's irresponsible complicity in the
move have amounted to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness.
</P>
<P>
   Tyson, who had his license revoked after he bit off a portion of
Evander Holyfield's ear last year in Las Vegas and was eligible to
apply for reinstatement on July 9, decided to try his luck in New
Jersey rather than Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   And New Jersey agreed to consider it _ a move that violated the
spirit of a law that requires commissions to honor the actions of
other states.
</P>
<P>
   The whole thing was a bad idea.
</P>
<P>
   A day before the commission was to announce its decision, it
appeared that Tyson's request for a license would be rejected as a
result of intense media and political pressure to pass the ball
back to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most vocal politicians were New Jersey state Sen.
William Gormley (R-Atlantic City) and U.S. Sen. John McCain of
Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a crusader on behalf of boxing who co-wrote the law New
Jersey violated, strongly reiterated his position.
</P>
<P>
   Gormley agreed, saying Nevada had the rights to this one in
spite of the money New Jersey stood to make if Tyson resumed his
career there. And the fact Gormley is the brother of one of the two
men who would have voted on the application wasn't lost on Tyson's
handlers.
</P>
<P>
   Even New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman reportedly expressed
her disapproval, particularly after Tyson lost his composure _ what
else is new? _ during his July 29 hearing there.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, Tyson and his handers either sensed or were tipped
off that they had made the wrong move and went back to Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   This certainly isn't the route Tyson should have taken. He
should have sought his reinstatement in Nevada from the beginning.
It only makes sense: That's where his despicable transgression took
place; that's where it should be resolved.
</P>
<P>
   However, the important thing is that it ended up there. Now it
can run its proper course.
</P>
<P>
   A hearing will take place within a month, according to Marc
Ratner, director of the Nevada State Athletic Commission. At that
time, the state's five-member board will vote whether to reinstate
Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very pleased,'' Ratner said. ``.... I was very, very
concerned that this could splinter the state commissions.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the sake of boxing, this is the best thing that could've
happened.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Time to go: For Rafael Ruelas, enough is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Kostya Tszyu handed Ruelas the first true beating of his career
in a title-elimination bout Saturday in El Paso, stopping the
former IBF lightweight champion from Studio City in the ninth
round.
</P>
<P>
   Tszyu was much too quick, much too strong and much too good for
Ruelas. Ruelas' battered, bruised face was irrefutable evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ruelas never stopped fighting, which is his nature. He's
a fighter in the literal sense of the word.
</P>
<P>
   He beat all but four of his opponents as much with his fighter's
heart as his boxing skills. Ironically, it's that admirable quality
that could cost him in the long run: Sometimes it's the fighter who
refuses to fall who gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, if Ruelas decides to continue, it could take him years
to position himself for a title shot and the big money. And there
are no guarantees he'll ever work his way back to the top.
</P>
<P>
   What's the point?
</P>
<P>
   No fighter ever made more of his limited natural ability than
Ruelas. No fighter ever had more determination and courage. And no
fighter ever had more class.
</P>
<P>
   If he hangs around too long, his legacy could suffer. And so
might his health.
</P>
<P>
   He should walk away now, with his mind intact, a good chunk of
change in the bank and the admiration of all who were fortunate
enough to follow his career.
</P>
<P>
   __ Rabbit punches: The HBO card on Saturday is strong.
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Vargas of Oxnard by the IBF, will face Darren Maciunski
in a 10-round junior middleweight bout on the undercard of the
Arturo Gatti-Ivan Robinson lightweight main event.
</P>
<P>
   Also, talented welterweight Jose Luis Lopez faces Ed Goins....
</P>
<P>
   Promoter Peter Broudy is negotiating to match P.J. Goossen and
Hector ``Macho'' Camacho in October somewhere in the San Fernando
Valley, possibly at the Valley College stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Broudy also is trying to match Jimmy ``The Stump'' Buffo, a
former Valley College football player, against Eric ``Butterbean''
Esch in a four-round bout on the card.
</P>
<P>
   Goossen will face Stacy Lane Goodson on the Sept. 9 card at the
Country Club in Reseda.

WITH NELSON HURTING, YANKS IN SEARCH OF RELIEF 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jeff Nelson said last week that he would consider
concealing from the Yankees any new pain from the bulging disk in
his lower back if he did not think it would prevent him from
pitching effectively. But when Nelson woke up Sunday and felt some
pain in his upper left leg, he did not hide it. Nelson reported it
to the Yankees and they grimaced.
</P>
<P>
   Both Manager Joe Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman spoke
Sunday about the possibility that Nelson might miss the rest of the
season, and both said they must prepare as if that is a likelihood.
Nelson has not pitched in a game since June 24, when he said he
felt ``pain shooting down my legs'' from the bulging disk.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday Nelson said: ``I hope I can come back. You always
have some kind of twitch and you always have a sense it's going to
come back. That's the biggest fear.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a fear the Yankees have privately harbored about the
future of Nelson, a 31-year-old reliever, and their post-season
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, even though the doctors felt he'd always be back,
I've got to take the position that he won't be back, and try to
strengthen that position,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   Cashman's pursuit of a reliever surely intensified after
Sunday's development. It increased the chances that the Yankees
would acquire Brian Boehringer or Jim Bruske, both right-handers,
from the San Diego Padres. A baseball official said the Padres were
expected to review their position on the matter Monday and might
ask the Yankees for Shea Morenz, a Class AA outfielder, for one of
the pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if the Yankees added Boehringer, a former Yankee, or
Bruske, who is at Class AAA Las Vegas, neither would replace the
more valuable Nelson. Without Nelson, the Yankees would probably
fill the role of right-handed setup man during the post-season with
Ramiro Mendoza or Mike Buddie, or even one of the starters, Orlando
Hernandez or Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a high probability,'' Cashman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be very difficult for us to get a guy of Nelson's
caliber anywhere. Because we're in a trade deadline period where
waivers are required, the odds are remote. It won't be for a lack
of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   While Nelson is 5-3 with a 4.54 earned run average, and has
permitted a .291 average to right-handed batters, his sidearm
motion and wicked slider helped him limit right-handers to a .168
mark last season and .245 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   If Torre needs a reliever to retire Juan Gonzalez of Texas or
Manny Ramirez of Cleveland in the eighth inning in October, he
wants Nelson. But there seems less of a chance of that happening
now that Nelson's rehabilitation has slowed.
</P>
<P>
   The pitcher will be re-examined Monday and the Yankees hope the
pain vanishes as quickly as it appeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could just be stiffness from throwing off the mound on
Friday,'' said Dr. Stuart Hershon, the team physician. ``We'll have
to see how he is.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he was preparing for not having Nelson, Torre said:
``Sure. Hopefully, we can get help. You can't rely on that,
basically because of the rules of the league and waivers and stuff.
If you can't get that, you have to see how you can offset it
in-house.''
</P>
<P>
   Cashman said there was a possibility that Nelson could return by
Sept. 1, but it is also possible that Nelson and Darren Holmes, who
also has a bulging disk in his back, may not be on the postseason
roster. Losing Holmes is not a major concern, but losing Nelson is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you put yourself in a playoff atmosphere and you've got a
right-handed hitter coming up, there's not anyone in the world
you'd rather have face him than Nellie,'' Paul O'Neill said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's nasty.''
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch to Miss Some Time
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch had his left calf elevated and wrapped in a
device designed to reduce swelling before Sunday's game. Joe Torre
said Knoblauch, who fouled a ball off his calf in Saturday's game,
would miss at least two days because of the injury. Homer Bush
started for Knoblauch Sunday and was 2-for-5 with a run scored.
``He only plays once a month and he still stays aggressive,'' Torre
said of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Davis to Return in Kansas City
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Chili Davis, who is hitting .278 with two runs
batted in in five games for Class AAA Columbus, will join the
Yankees in Kansas City Monday or Tuesday. Since Davis will be the
DH, Darryl Strawberry must play left field to play regularly. That
is where Joe Torre said Strawberry would play Tuesday.

NORTH KOREA HIDING BIG NUCLEAR COMPLEX, U.S. OFFICIALS SAY

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   U.S. intelligence agencies have detected a huge secret
underground complex in North Korea that they believe is the
centerpiece of an effort to revive the country's frozen nuclear
weapons program, according to officials who have been briefed on
the intelligence information.
</P>
<P>
   The finding has alarmed officials at the White House and the
Pentagon, who fear that the complex may represent an effort to
break out of a 4-year-old agreement in which North Korea pledged to
give up its nuclear weapons program in exchange for billions of
dollars in Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   The finding also follows a string of provocations by the North,
including missile sales to Pakistan and the incursion of a small
North Korean submarine carrying nine commandos off the South Korean
coast this year.
</P>
<P>
   The North has said in recent months that the United States is
reneging on its side of the agreement because Congress has failed
to authorize tens of millions of dollars in fuel shipments for the
North. The shipments are the main American contribution to a $6
billion program, under which South Korea, Japan and other nations
are supposed to finance a major electric energy program as a quid
pro quo for the North's abandonment of its ambitions to develop
nuclear arms.
</P>
<P>
   A senior administration official said the North had not yet
technically violated that accord, called the Agreed Framework,
because there is no evidence that Pyongyang has begun pouring
cement for a new reactor or a reprocessing plant that would convert
nuclear waste into bomb-grade plutonium. The accord explicitly bars
that activity.
</P>
<P>
   But spy satellites have extensively photographed a huge work
site 25 miles northeast of Yongbyon, the nuclear center where,
until the 1994 accord, the North is believed to have created enough
plutonium to build six or more bombs. Thousands of North Korean
workers are swarming around the new site, burrowing into the
mountainside, American officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Other intelligence, which the officials would not describe, led
the administration in recent weeks to warn important members of
Congress and the South Korean government in classified briefings
that they believed that the North intended to build a new reactor
and reprocessing center under the mountain. Intelligence estimates
of how long it would take to complete the project have ranged from
two to six years, depending in part on how much outside help is
received.
</P>
<P>
   South Korean officials have played down the finding, officials
said, because they fear undermining President Kim Dae-jung's
``sunshine policy'' toward North Korea, an effort to reopen aid and
dialogue with the Stalinist government in Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
   When Kim went to Washington in the spring he urged President
Clinton to drop sanctions against the North that date from the end
of the Korean War. But the new finding makes it far less likely
that the United States will ease up on the North.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very, very serious development,'' said one American
official, who like the others insisted on anonymity, ``to say
nothing of incredibly stupid, because it endangers both the nuclear
accord and humanitarian aid.''
</P>
<P>
   Other officials said they were clearly concerned that Congress
was now less likely than ever to finance the fuel oil. If Congress
refused to fulfill the American commitment, the officials fear,
that would, in turn, give the North an excuse to abandon the
nuclear agreement officially and, perhaps, to expel inspectors from
the International Atomic Energy Agency who are at Yongbyon. The
North has prohibited inspectors from examining other sites outside
Yongbyon.
</P>
<P>
   At a meeting this week between North Korean officials and the
American special envoy for Korean nuclear issues, Charles Kartman,
the United States is expected to demand that the North stop all
work at the new site. It is not clear whether the North already
knows that its activity has been detected.
</P>
<P>
   As always in matters involving North Korea, it is virtually
impossible to divine the country's real intentions.
</P>
<P>
   It is possible, officials say, that the mysterious North Korean
leader, Kim Jong Il, is trying to rebuild a nuclear program that
the West stopped in 1994. Kim may also be hoping to bolster his
standing with the North Korean military. This may be a particularly
critical time to placate the right wing, because Kim is expected,
next month, to be given all of the titles held by his father, Kim
Il Sung, North Korea's founder.
</P>
<P>
   The elder Kim died in July 1994, just weeks after having defused
the confrontation with the United States by telling former
President Carter that he was willing to trade away the nuclear
program in return for Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   Another possibility is that Kim Jong Il is intending to trade
away the new nuclear complex the way his father traded away the
last one _ if he can extract a high enough price. American
officials note that building a nuclear reactor underground is an
enormously difficult technical task for any country, much less one
that is starving as a result of economic collapse, drought and
floods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this a nuclear breakout, a hedge, a bargaining chip?''
asked Joseph Nye, dean of the Kennedy School of Government at
Harvard University. ``It's hard to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nye worked extensively on the North Korean nuclear issue at the
CIA and as a top Pentagon official in the first term of the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Nye noted that in 1993, as the United States was confronting
North Korea over its efforts to reprocess nuclear waste into
plutonium, the intelligence community was deeply divided on the
question of whether the North wanted a bomb or was simply playing
for aid. ``The majority said the North would never give up the
bomb, but a deal was struck,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not necessarily certain that the country would follow
the same pattern today, he and other experts warn. In the four
years since the agreement was reached, the North has grown far
weaker, both economically and militarily.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger is that the weaker they become, the less willing
they are to bargain,'' he said. ``While that may seem
counterintuitive, the North Koreans usually get tougher as they get
cornered. In cultural terms, they may be more willing to accept
risks in a situation of desperation.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, a number of experts and former officials, along
with many inside the administration, are warning that the United
States should once again be alert to the possibility that the North
could strike out across the demilitarized zone that separates North
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the United States, which has 37,000 troops
stationed in South Korea, has gradually increased its defensive
posture, including new antimissile and antimortar artillery
intended to suppress an attack on Seoul, which is within 30 miles
of the border.
</P>
<P>
   But the North has also improved its ability to inflict a
tremendous _ if short-lived _ artillery attack on the South Korean
capital.
