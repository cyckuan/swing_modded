<HEADLINE> Chinese Ambassador Calls for Sound, Stable Sino-U.S. Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese ambassador to the
United States, Li Zhaoxing, Saturday urged all peace-loving
Americans to take actions to defeat the Taiwan Security
Enhancement Act (TSEA) and help secure congressional approval of
permanent Normal Trade Relations (NTR) for China.
</P>
<P>
He also asked Americans to oppose U.S. arms sales to Taiwan and
other actions that go against the spirit of the three joint
communiques between Beijing and Washington so as to ensure a sound
and stable relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, including the compatriots in Taiwan,
enshrine peace and treasure the Sino-U.S. relations, and so do the
American people, Li said.
</P>
<P>
"Normal bilateral ties on the basis of the three Sino-U.S.
communiques and bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality and
mutual benefit are conducive to peace and prosperity in the Asia-
Pacific region and the whole world at large," the Chinese
ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remarks at a reception in the Chinese Embassy on
Saturday evening in honor of 20 American governors who were here
for the annual meeting of the National Governors' Association (NGA)
over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1999 witnessed ups and downs in Sino-U.S. relations,
Li said. Fortunately, thanks to joint efforts by the two
governments, bilateral ties, which suffered a serious setback due
to the U.S.-led NATO's bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade
last May, was gradually brought back on track, especially after
the meeting between Chinese President Jiang Zemin and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Aukland, New Zealand, last September.
</P>
<P>
However, Li said, whenever Sino-U.S. ties make some headway,
there are always a handful of American politicians who cannot wait
to jump to their feet and revert the healthy trend. Those people
try every means to interfere in China's internal affairs and
encroach upon its sovereignty, using all kinds of pretexts they
cook up, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Those politicians are now defiling the white paper on the
Taiwan issue recently published by the Chinese government as a "
provocation" which they say may lead to higher tensions in the
Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
It is simply because of those politicians, who fanned up the so-
called "China threat" and pushed Congress hard to pass the TSEA
and approve the sale to Taiwan of large quantities of advanced
weapons, that separatists in the island have been encouraged, thus
creating tensions in the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
"This is the real root cause for the deteriorating situation in
the Taiwan Straits."
</P>
<P>
Michael O. Leavitt, governor of Utah, who heads the NGA, said
the fact that so many governors are gathering in the Chinese
Embassy sends an important message to China -- "We love China and
respect the Chinese people" and the development of U.S.-China
relations is crucial to the peoples of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Leavitt said he understood the concern of the Chinese
government over the Taiwan issue, which he believed should in no
way impede the growth of relations between the United States and
China.
</P>
<P>
He also voiced his support for expanded trade with China and
for giving China a permanent NTR. His stand was echoed by other
governors present at the reception.

<HEADLINE> Bayi Rockets Takes 2-0 Lead Over Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NINGBO, Zhejiang Province, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Defending
champion Bayi Rockets soared into a 2-0 lead over Shandong Flaming
Bulls with a 132-100 overwhelming victory in the second game of
the best of five semifinals round in the Chinese Basketball League
here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In the other semifinal game, Guangdong Hongyuan took the home
advantage and beat Shanghai Dongfang 108-81 to tie it 1-1.
</P>
<P>
Li Nan led the Bayi Rockets with 41 points, pouring in 12 3-
pointers from 14 attempts. The Rockets hit a total of 23 3-
pointers to keep the leading margin by 30 points from the end of
the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
The Rockets center Wang Zhizhi, who scored 31 points and 12
rebounds in the first game three days ago, was seriously injured
in the ankle and rushed to hospital. The returning is a day-to-
day case for Wang, who was selected by the Dallas Mavericks in
1999 NBA draft.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old and 2,25-meter Yao Ming scored 17 points for
Shanghai in the first quarter but was held to only 2 in the rest
as his team went down to the host Hongyuan 108-81.
</P>
<P>
With sharp shooting from the mid range and better defense,
Guangdong Hongyan built a 55-38 lead in the halftime and went on
to capture the win by 27 points.

<HEADLINE> 2 Israeli Soldiers, Lebanese Civilian Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Two Israeli soldiers and a
Lebanese civilian were lightly injured on Monday in attacks
launched by Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas on Israeli military
positions in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has confirmed the
attacks.
</P>
<P>
The two soldiers, who were very lightly injured in a mortar
attack, were treated on the spot, said an Israeli military
spokesman in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
And the Lebanese civilian, also slightly wounded in the attack,
has been taken to Israel for treatment, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli army retaliated later by firing two missiles at
targets in the mountainous Iqlim al-Tuffah, which is believed to
serve as an Hezbollah stronghold to launch attacks against Israeli
troops and their allied South Lebanon Army (SLA).
</P>
<P>
Israeli jets fired another missile on a valley near the front-
line village of Majdel Silim. However, there was no immediate word
of casualties from the air strikes, which have entered the fourth
day.
</P>
<P>
Monday's attacks came a day after Hezbollah guerrillas detonated
a roadside bomb in south Lebanon which injured three SLA
militiamen.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a self-styled security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with a claimed aim of protecting its northern border areas
from cross-border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Hezbollah has been spearheading a guerrilla war to
oust Israeli troops and the SLA from the country.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Personal Income, Spending Rise in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Federal pay rises and
subsidies helped Americans' personal income rise at a faster pace
than spending in January, the Commerce Department reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Personal spending in January rose 0.5 percent to a seasonally
adjusted annual rate of 6.531 trillion U.S. dollars following a 1.
1 percent gain in December. Incomes gained a stronger 0.7 percent
to 8.053 trillion dollars after a 0.3 percent increase in December.
</P>
<P>
January's income growth was not only the strongest since
October but also marked the first time since that month that
income outpaced spending growth. At the same time, the 0.5 percent
gain in spending was the slowest pace since October.
</P>
<P>
The government said a number of factors boosted income last
month including cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security
payments and other government benefits programs; pay raises for
federal workers and military personnel; and federal subsidy
payments to farmers.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the personal savings rate, savings as a percentage
of after-tax income, rose to 1.4 percent in January, following a
monthly record low of 1 percent in December. December's savings
rate was even worse than the 1.5 percent all-time low the
government originally estimated one month ago.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates four times
since June to slow the supercharged economy and keep inflation
from escalating. While those actions raised borrowing costs for
consumers and businesses, the higher rates still haven't
significantly slowed the economy, which grew by a breakneck 6.9
percent rate in the last three months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Given that, many analysts believe the Fed will boost rates
again in March and in May.
</P>
<P>
Monday's report shows that Americans' wages grew by a sizable 0.
8 percent in January following a solid 0.7 percent gain the month
before. And farm proprietors' income rose by 1.3 percent in
January after a sharp plunge in December.
</P>
<P>
Spending on non-durable goods, such as food and fuel, fell by 0.
4 percent in January, reflecting in part consumers pulling back
after hoarding groceries, drug-store-type goods and other items in
December to prepare for possible problems related to the year 2000
computer changeover. In December, spending on non-durable goods
rose by a sizable 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But for durable goods, big-ticket manufactured items expected
to last at least three years such as washing machines and cars,
spending increased by a brisk 0.7 percent in January, following a
1.2 percent gain the month before.

<HEADLINE> Greece: Situation in Kosovo Still Tense </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Greece Monday expressed once
again its concern over the developments in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, saying that the situation in the region was tense.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing, Greek government spokesman
Dimitris Reppas said that Kosovo continued to constitute a source
of concern ,but he did not see it possible to turn into a war
crisis like that of last year.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Greece has a strong battalion of 1,200 men
participating in the NATO-led multinational peacekeeping force in
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200 Greek soldiers have been stationed in Urosevac and
Polje in southern Kosovo, but a Greek company of 120 men was set
to transfer to the northern Kosovo town of Mitrovica, which has
seen rising violence in recent days between French peacekeepers
and ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
The Greek troops are expected to stay in the area until March 5,
and Greece's national defense general staff described the Greek
company's redeployment as part of a normal rotation of units
serving in the peacekeeping force.
</P>
<P>
Greece has made it clear that Athens hopes the Kosovo problem
could be resolved with full respect for the human rights of all
those living in the region, and in the framework of the existing
borders of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Supreme Court Upholds Deportation of Nazi Guard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Supreme Court
Monday upheld the deportation of a 78-year-old retired foundry
supervisor found to be a Nazi guard.
</P>
<P>
The court, without comment, rejected an appeal by Ferdinand
Hammer, who has served as a guard at two Nazi concentration camps
during World War II.
</P>
<P>
Hammer in the appeal argued that immigration officials should
have to show he actively participated in persecution of the camps'
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Hammer, from Michigan, has admitted that he was a member of the
German army during the war but has denied being part of a
battalion that served at concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
He came to the United States in 1955 and became a naturalized
citizen in 1963. He was stripped of his citizenship by a federal
judge in 1996 for lying about his past.
</P>
<P>
An immigration judge ordered him deported in 1997. The U.S.
Board of Immigration Appeals upheld that order, as did the 6th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals last November. Hammer finally appealed to
the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> IDB Borrows Record 9 Billion Dollars in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB), which remains the leading source of
multilateral financing for economic and social development in
Latin America and the Caribbean, raised 9 billion U.S. dollars in
international capital markets during 1999, the largest total in
its history, up from the 5.8 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Washington-based bank expects to repeat the record volume
in 2000 by borrowing the equivalent of 9 billion dollars,
according to its Capital Markets Division Chief, Stephen Abrahams.
The larger-than-usual borrowing program will be largely driven by
a new credit line the IDB established late in 1998 to help
borrowing countries weather international financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
"As in previous years, the borrowings will be done as straight
U.S. dollar bond offerings or as offerings in other currencies
swapped into U.S. dollars. We also have need for some 1 billion of
euros this year on an after-swap basis," Abrahams said.
</P>
<P>
The IDB, which has had a triple A credit rating for its debt
ever since its first bond issue in 1962, regularly turns to
capital markets to seek the lowest cost financing for its funding
program.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the bank carried out 27 borrowing transactions. The
average maturity of the borrowings was six years, with maturities
of individual transactions ranging from two years to twenty years.

<HEADLINE> Botswana to Supply Zimbabwe, Mozambique With Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Botswanan government
will send fuel worth 4.8 million U.S. dollars to Zimbabwe and
Mozambique to help them cope with devastating floods, South
African Press Association reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Botswana's Foreign Minister Mompati Merafhe
as saying that Botswana was responding to a request from the
Zimbabwean government after Cyclone Eline swept southern Africa
last week, intensifying the worst flooding in the region in 50
years.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe, already suffering from a fuel shortage as a result of
its economic crisis, had asked for 10 million liters of diesel,
five million liters of petrol and five million liters of jet fuel.
</P>
<P>
The fuel shortage was worsened by the floods which prevented
tankers from docking in the badly-affected Mozambican port of
Beira, from where fuel is pumped to Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
Botswana had agreed to supply the fuel to Zimbabwe on credit,
Merafhe said.
</P>
<P>
The Botswanan government will however donate a million liters
of fuel to Mozambique to assist rescue operations in submerged
parts of the country where helicopters have been plucking stranded
people from rooftops and trees.
</P>
<P>
Merafhe said though Botswana had also been affected by the
flooding " the problem in the neighboring countries are far worse
and ... we feel obliged to assist."
</P>
<P>
He said the diesel and petrol would be sent to Zimbabwe by
rail immediately, while Botswana would source jet fuel from
elsewhere to send to its neighbor.

<HEADLINE> Teachers Important for Mozambique's Education: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Teachers are the main factor
for the development of education in Mozambique, Education Minister
Alcido Nguenha said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks at a conference of teachers from
the Portuguese-speaking African countries, the Mozambique News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The minister acknowledged that working conditions for teachers
are very poor and some teachers even do not have buildings for the
classes they are to teach.
</P>
<P>
Domingos Ferrao, Secretary-general of the Mozambican Teachers
Union, said that his organization's objective is to defend public
education and the teachers' interests.
</P>
<P>
"Working conditions, particularly in the rural areas, are very
poor", Ferrao said, adding that they were often paid months later.
</P>
<P>
He urged the teachers to join their trade union in order to
receive the necessary help to solve their problems.
</P>
<P>
Of the 59,000 teachers in the southern African country, only
about 20, 000 are members of the union.
</P>
<P>
Emanvel Fantoma, representative of Education International,
teachers also face classes that contain far too many pupils, and
the training period for teachers is too short. The result is poor
lessons for the pupils.
</P>
<P>
"When education is not successful, teachers are blamed",
Fantoma said, stressing the need to work out strategies to
overcome these problems.
</P>
<P>
Teachers from the Portuguese-speaking African countries are
said to be facing similar problems that include undervaluing by
their respective governments, poor working conditions and low
wages.
</P>
<P>
Mozambique and Angola are two major Portuguese-speaking
countries in Africa.

<P>
HARARE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Monday pledged that his government will provide
humanitarian aid to people without discrimination in parts of the
areas which were ravaged by Cyclone Eline.
</P>
<P>
"Be rest assured that the government will assist you in all
possible ways," Mugabe said during his tour to parts of the areas
in Masvingo and Manicaland provinces that were ravaged by the
tropical cyclone.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone who was affected is entitled to get assistance from
the government regardless of any religion, party or creed," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Masvingo Governor Josiah Hungwe told Mugabe that people were
in desperate need of food, particularly in the Sengwe, Malipati
and Lundi areas where floods damaged houses, roads, livestock,
water pipes and crop fields.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that efforts are being made to assist people
affected by the most serious floods in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
Cyclone Eline hit the southern and eastern parts of Zimbabwe
last week.
</P>
<P>
In neighboring Mozambique, at least 164 people have already
been killed by this month's floods, the Zimbabwe News Agency

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The departing U.N.
humanitarian coordinator, Von Sponeck, will brief U.N. Secretary-
General Kofi Annan on the U.N. oil-for-food program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, the fifth humanitarian coordinator to run the program,
will leave the post on March 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
On many occasions, Sponeck has criticized the program's
failure to meet the minimum requirements of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
He also said the nine-year-long sanctions against the country
have resulted in "a true human tragedy" in Iraq and urged the
lifting of the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck has also complained that the oil-for-food program
suffered from the holds placed on Iraqi imports.
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. officials, the United States has frozen 1,
000 contract requests worth more than 1 billion U.S. dollars for
oil industry spare parts, electricity equipment and many other
goods.
</P>
<P>
The United States has accused him of siding with Iraq in a
propaganda battle over who is to blame for the suffering of the
Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program began to be implemented in late 1996,
which allows Iraq to sell oil and purchase food, medicine and
other goods under tight U.N. supervision.

LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- World wheat production is
estimated to be 1 million higher than last month at 580 million
tons in February, according to the latest Grain Market Report by
the International Grains Council (IGC).
</P>
<P>
The report also shows the figure for world wheat trade is 1
million lower at 99 million tons, resulting from reductions for
Russia and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The estimates for exports by the European Commission (EC) and
the United States are both 0.5 million tons down, and that for
Australia is raised by the same amount.
</P>
<P>
The IGC expects world wheat consumption will be 2 million
higher at 593 million tons, due mainly to increased estimates for
feed use in the EC and Australia.
</P>
<P>
The forecast for world wheat stocks is unchanged at 116 million
tons.

BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- European Union finance
ministers unanimously agreed Monday to back a German candidate for

managing director of the IMF."
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, declared his bid
to replace the outgoing Michel Camdessus at the IMF helm three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Competing with Koch-Weser for the top IMF job are two other
candidates -- the IMF's acting Managing Director Stanley Fischer
and Japanese Finance Ministry official Eisuke Sakakibara.
</P>
<P>
The executive board of the IMF meets Tuesday in Washington for
an informal discussion on the candidates before appointing a
managing director.

<HEADLINE> DRC Minister Hails Tanzania's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February (Xinhua) - The visiting Interior
Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has praised
Tanzania for playing a key role in the signing and keeping of the
Lusaka peace pact, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After paying a tribute to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
and delivered him a message from the DRC President Laurent Kabila
in Tanzania's central town of Dodoma over the weekend, Gratian
Kakudji told the Daily News newspaper he was impressed by the
Tanzania government's commitment and readiness to step in whenever
her assistance was sought to see the peace pact being implemented.
</P>
<P>
The minister said their two-day special mission was to inform
President Mkapa on the state of the peace process in DRC and seek
his advice and views, which they regard as crucial, after the
Lusaka-DRC pact evaluation summit by DRC war belligerents last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kakudji cautiously commended the UN decision to send over 5,000
troops to DRC to protect UN military observers there so that they
establish the actual situation on the ground before peacekeepers
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes at this stage occupational forces from Rwanda
and Uganda will feel obliged to leave DRC territory to enable the
Congolese settle peacefully and work for their nation's progress.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's government has been keeping good relations with
Tanzania, partly due to his gratitude to the neighbor for offering
him accommodation before he seized power in 1997. Tanzania now
hosts more than 100,000 Congolese refugees in its western region.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Navy's top officer is challenging Pentagon plans to
rely solely on land-based interceptors to shield the United States
against missile attacks, urging that ship-launched interceptors
also be used to knock enemy warheads out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO officials are growing increasingly concerned that
ethnic Albanians who fought to separate Kosovo from Serbia are now
trying to orchestrate the political independence of another chunk
of Serbian land, exacerbating tensions along Kosovo's eastern
border.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Words of anger, frustration and bewilderment rose from
pulpits across New York City on Sunday, while more than 1,000
demonstrators took to the streets for a third day of prayer and
protest, evidence of the still rolling emotions after the
acquittal of four officers on Friday in the shooting death of
Amadou Diallo.
</P>
<P>
-- The Pentagon, because of the risk to soldiers, has refused
to allow American troops to return to northern Mitrovica, the
section dominated by Serbs in the divided town that has become a
flash point of ethnic tension in Kosovo, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- GM, FORD and DaimlerChrysler agreed to create a single auto-
parts exchange on the Internet. Once fully operational, the
exchange is expected to handle 240 billion dollars in annual world-
wide spending by the three car makers. The exchange will be an
independent company with plans for an IPO. One analyst estimated
such a venture eventually would have a market cap of 30 billion to
40 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's cabinet held its first comprehensive debate on
ending the occupation of Lebanon, but announced no decisions after
the seven-hour session. On Saturday, Palestinian students in the
West Bank stoned visiting French Prime Minister Jospin for his
remarks describing the Lebanese guerrilla group Hizbollah as "
terrorists."

<HEADLINE> Shareh, Hoss Discuss Middle East Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Faruk
Shareh called Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss on Monday to
discuss the latest developments of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views on the situation in the region,
according to Arab Syrian News Agency, but no details were released.
Shareh made the call soon after his return here from a visit to
Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Shareh briefed Hoss on the positive results of his tour of Saudi
Arabia during which he handed a message from Syrian President Hafez
al-Assad to Saudi Monarch King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak admitted for the
first time that late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin promised the U.S.
administration to pull out Israeli troops from the Golan Heights,
captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war, in return for
certain security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration conveyed the promise to the Syrians in
time, Barak told a cabinet meeting, pointing out the previous
government of Benjamin Netanyahu recognized the June 4, 1967 border
lines between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Barak government used to rule out such a promise while Syria
asserted repeatedly its existence. The two sides resumed peace
talks late last year, only to find the negotiations broke down
after two rounds.
</P>
<P>
The Syrians now demand that Israel make a written commitment to
returning in full the Golan before they come back to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Political observers here believed that Barak's statement was a
positive development that would lead to the resumption of the
Syrian-Israeli peace talks stalled in January.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Frees Three Pro-Kurdish Mayors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Three pro-Kurdish mayors, who
were earlier detained on charges of colluding with Turkey's
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), were freed on bail on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Diyarbakir State Security Court (DGM) decided earlier in the
day that the mayors from the People's Democracy Party (HADEP),
should be set free pending trial on charges of aiding PKK, which
has been fighting since 1984 for an independent Kurdish state in
the mainly Kurdish southeast.
</P>
<P>
Lawyers for the three former mayors from Diyarbakir, Bingol and
Siirt in the southeast presented their deposition to the DGM three
days ago, objecting to their arrest.
</P>
<P>
The court decided to release the mayors "considering their
incomes and social positions," the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
"They are not in a position to destroy the evidences in their
files," the semi-official news agency added.
</P>
<P>
The detentions of the three, who have been campaigning for
cultural rights for Turkey's estimated 12 million Kurds, sparked
concerns both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
The United States said that the arrest was "deeply puzzling and
disturbing" while the European Union issued a statement calling for
their release.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Turkish authorities fear that the HADEP may
become a "political wing" of the PKK under the cover of
legitimation. The party swept the board in local elections in the
southeast last April.

<P>
CAIRO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The state-run Turkish Railroad Company (TCDD) will put
out tenders in March for the modernization project of the Ankara-
Istanbul railway, reported the Anatolia News Agency on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rehabilitation of the present railway between Ankara and
Istanbul will be financed by a foreign loan of 250 million U.S.
dollars. The tender will be done in three stages and the TCDD will
evaluate the bids and choose a company in a short time.
</P>
<P>
The TCDD is also planning to build a double line railway between
Ankara and Istanbul, a project which has been under consideration
for almost two decades. The project is expected to cost 7 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- The first meeting of the Turkey-Vietnam Joint Economic
Commission began in Hanoi on Monday, reported the Anatolia News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Turkish State Minister Mehmet Ali Irtemcelik flew to Hanoi
Sunday at the head of the Turkish delegation. The Vietnamese side
will be headed by Trade Minister Vu Khoan.
</P>
<P>
A cooperation agreement on science, technology and environment
will be signed and an agreement on reciprocal encouragement and
protection of investments will be negotiated at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation will also submit to the Vietnamese side a
list of commodities that can be exported to Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- A prominent Turkish businessman, Sarik Tara, said that
the trade volume between Turkey and Greece will most possibly reach
20 billion U.S. dollars in a five-year term, reported Turkish Daily
News.
</P>
<P>
Tara made the prediction at a joint meeting of the Turkey-Greece
Business Council held in Istanbul over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The co-chairmen of the council, Tara and his Greek counterpart
Panayotis Koutsikos, expressed optimism about the future
profitability of trade cooperation between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
The current trade volume between Turkey and Greece stands at
about one billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
GAZA -- The World Bank's International Financing Institution
(IFI) said the total value of funds allocated for implementing
projects in the Palestinian self-rule areas from 1997 to the end of
1999 were estimated at 76 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IFI indicated that the funded projects belong to both the
public and the private sectors.
</P>
<P>
In a bulletin issued by the World Bank on Sunday, the IFI
stated that among the prominent projects it funded, the
Intercontinental hotel is the first project constructed according
to the international standards on the Palestinian territories.

<HEADLINE> Israeli FM Issues Another Militant Warning Against Hezbollah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy on Monday issued another warning of fighting tit-for-tat
against Lebanese Hezbollah guerrillas, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Defending the government and himself in a no-confidence motion
debate in the Knesset (Parliament), Levy said he will not retract
any word he had spoken against Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that if Hezbollah guerrillas continue killing
Israeli soldiers and "force us to bear our death, then they will
bear their death." Israel, he added, will not tie its own hands to
defend its soldiers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion was submitted by Arab Knesset members
regarding Levy's "wild incitement against Arab MKs" and his plenum
address last week that Israel would retaliate "blood for blood...
child for child" if Hezbollah guerrillas attack northern Israel.
</P>
<P>
Arab legislators termed the child-for-child speech as a
primitive, fundamentalist and dangerous expression for legitimizing
the murder of Lebanese children.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of Arab nations in the region also harshly condemned
Levy's incitements, saying that the foreign minister's comments
followed his controversial warning earlier in the month that "if
Israeli northern settlements burn, Lebanese soil will burn."
</P>
<P>
Even the United States, the major patron of Israel in the world
political arena, also criticized Levy. "This kind of comment is
inappropriate. We don't need rhetoric from anybody that inflames
the situation," U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
However, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak came out publicly
supporting his foreign minister, saying that Levy's comments only
stressed just how great the Israeli government views its
responsibility for safeguarding national security.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Likud party, a right-wing faction in the Knesset,
had announced that its MKs will vote against Monday's no-confidence
motion. Thus, the motion is expected to be defeated easily.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a buffer zone in south Lebanon in 1985 with a
self-declared purpose of protecting its northern border areas from
cross-border guerrilla attacks. 
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanese Shiite Muslim militant group Hezbollah, or
Party of God, has been fighting to end the Israeli occupation
there.

<HEADLINE> Iran Continues War Games in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iranian armed forces on Monday
conducted anti-submarine exercises on the 5th day of the "Vahdat
(Unity) 78" war games launched in the Gulf waters.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the maneuver Admiral Manavi said that Iranian
frigates equipped with sonar and anti-submarine armaments conducted
sophisticated operations against submarines of a hypothetical
enemy.
</P>
<P>
Manavi told the Islamic Republic News Agency that vessels of the
Iranian army and the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC),
using various defensive tactics, repelled attacks by the
hypothetical enemy from air, ground and sea.
</P>
<P>
The missile boats involved in the exercises also launched search
operations and intercepted vessels of the hypothetical enemy, he
said, and the vessels then headed for international waters in the
Gulf of Oman to carry on other operations.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day maneuver was kicked off on Thursday with the
participation of the ground and naval forces of the army and the
IRGC. It was scheduled to proceed in five stages in an area of 64,
000 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 vessels, 120 gunboats, 30 helicopters, 15 warplanes and
several submarines were involved in the war games, including
military exercises in the sea, submarine operations and exercises
to apply digital system in steering the vessels and other modern
means in the naval hardware, including air-to-surface missiles.
</P>
<P>
Commander of the Navy Forces of the Army Admiral Abbas Mohtaj
said earlier that the maneuver was aimed at boosting the readiness
of the Iranian armed forces and unity between the army and the
IRGC.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian armed forces under the command of the supreme leader
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei comprise the army, the IRGC and the security
forces or police. Both the army and the IRGC have their own ground,
naval and air forces.

<HEADLINE> Canadian National Defense Ministry Fights Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Canada's Department of National
Defense is creating a new unit to help hunt down cyberspace
intruders, the Ottawa Citizen reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
A team of scientists and computer specialists has been formed
at the Defense Research Establishment Ottawa to work out new
protective measures against hackers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
One of the key jobs for the team is to imitate the cyberspace
intruders and create new computer viruses to study in order to
find effective defenses against them.
</P>
<P>
The team will also be developing new ways to track down hackers,
the Defense Research Establishment was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Defense Research Prakash Bhartia said the
department hired 14 researchers and computer scientists last year
for the new team, which may be expanded to 20 members in place.
</P>
<P>
The researchers have already simulated a recent hack attack,
which disabled Yahoo.com, eBay and other U.S.-based sites, so as
to better understand how it was created.
</P>
<P>
The team is intensifying its work after the FBI from the United
States linked a Canadian using "mafiaboy" to the cyberspace attack.
</P>
<P>
Statistics for 1999 also show the sites of at least nine
federal agencies of Canada, as well as several provincial
government institutions, were penetrated and altered by hackers,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
To this, Bhartia acknowledged that federal government computers
"are pretty vulnerable," but said "luckily these are not too
serious because most of it involved regular information."
</P>
<P>
He warned "people could conveivably hack into payroll" and "
those are the things that really worry us."

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Committee Meets for U.N. Conference on Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A preparatory committee
Monday began its first session here for the U.N. conference on
illicit trade in small arms and light weapons, which is slated for
2001.
</P>
<P>
The Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on
the Illicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its
Aspects held the session, which is scheduled to end on March 3, to
decide the dates and venue of the 2001 conference as well as on
the dates and venues of its subsequent sessions.
</P>
<P>
During the first two days of the session, the committee will
elect the members of its bureau and hold its general debate, after
which it will exchange views on the agenda items concerned.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Dos Santos, who is from Mozambique, has been nominated
by the Group of African States to serve as chairman of the
Preparatory Committee, which has been requested to take a decision
on the modalities of attendance by non-governmental organizations
at its sessions and to make recommendations to the proposed U.N.
conference on all relevant matters, including the objective, a
draft agenda, draft rules of procedure and draft final documents.
</P>
<P>
The draft final documents are expected to contain a program of
action, U.N. officials said.
</P>
<P>
The issue of the proliferation of small arms and light weapons
first appeared on the international political agenda in December
1995 when the General Assembly requested the U.N. secretary-
general, with the assistance of a panel of experts, to report on
the nature and causes of their accumulation and transfer, and on
ways and means to prevent and reduce them.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, a number of global and regional initiatives have
emerged to curb the destabilizing accumulation and transfer of
small arms. Those include a moratorium on the importation,
exportation and manufacturing of small arms and light weapons in
West Africa by the Economic Community of West African States.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations are also under way in Vienna to elaborate an
international convention against transnational crime, including a
revised draft protocol against the illicit manufacturing of and
trafficking in firearms, ammunition and other relevant materials.
Those negotiations are expected to conclude later in the year.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland, Albania to Sign Refugee Repatriation Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Switzerland and Albania are
expected to sign an accord on the repatriation of refugees this
week when Albanian Justice Minister Spartak Poci pays a two-day
visit to Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
The deal was drafted in January during a visit to Albania by
Swiss Justice Minister Ruth Metzler. Ruth and Poci will put their
signatures on the agreement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The accord provides for the return to Albania of refugees whose
requests for asylum have been turned down. It also allows Berne to
send Kosovo Albanians home via Albania.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 Kosovars were given temporary shelter in
Switzerland during last year's conflict, and are due to be "
forcibly" repatriated if they have not returned to Kosovo by the
end of May, according to Swiss Radio International.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers are also due to discuss strengthening
cooperation in the fight against organized crime. Switzerland has
indicated it is willing to help train the Albanian police force.

<HEADLINE> BIS: Int'l Financial Markets Focus on Prospects for Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- International financial markets
in 1999 turned their attention to prospects for the future while
regaining a measure of calm after an autumn of turmoil in 1998,
said the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in a report
Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its overview of global financial developments, the BIS noted
that for much of the year of 1999, bond prices fell in Europe and
the United States while equity prices rose in most of the world.
</P>
<P>
"This was in marked contrast with the pattern of most the 1990s,
in which rises in equity prices were generally supported by
declining bond yields," the BIS said. "The unusual market behavior
appears to have reflected new expectations about the global
economy."
</P>
<P>
Market participants saw not only improved growth prospects in
most regions but they also seemed assured about the ability of
central banks to keep inflation in check without pushing the
economies into recession, said the BIS.
</P>
<P>
The BIS said that Japan had seen a significant stock market
rally and flat bond yields, suggesting expectations of stable
monetary policy in the context of an incipient recovery and some
confidence in corporate and financial restructuring.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth quarter of 1999, concerns that the millennium
date change might disrupt market functioning overshadowed market
activity, leading to a broad decline in trading volumes and
financing activity, said the BIS. In the event, the new millennium
arrived without major disruption to markets or increased liquidity
demands.
</P>
<P>
In an analysis of spot and forward foreign exchange (FX)
trading volumes, the BIS found that the introduction of the euro
has not to date caused major changes in FX market activity.
Results from an informal survey among market participants and
information from electronic brokers indicate that the importance
of the new currency in FX trading roughly matches that of the
Deutsche mark before 1999.

<HEADLINE> Russia's Communist Candidate Vows Double State Budget Income </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian Communist Party
Chairman and presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov Monday
announced a draft election program on doubling federal budget
revenues.
</P>
<P>
This program would bring 860 billion rubles (30.7 billion U.S.
dollars) more to the Russian government budget, Zyuganov told a
news conference in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
It is possible, Zyuganov said, to bring in 320 more billion
rubles (11.4 billion dollars) by stopping the illegal export of
capital, 110 billion rubles (3.9 billion dollars) by the
nationalization of oil and gas exports and 90 billion rubles (3.2
billion dollars) by bringing order to Unified Energy Systems of
Russia, Gazprom (the biggest gas company in Russia), the Railroad
Ministry and other state monopolies.
</P>
<P>
A state monopoly on vodka could bring in another 60 billion
rubles (2.1 billion dollars), and more than 100 billion rubles (3.
6 billion dollars) could be realized by normalizing cash
circulation, solving the problem of bad debts and ruling out the
use of surrogate money in settlements, Zyuganov noted.
</P>
<P>
The communist leader also suggested the use of reserves amassed
in the killing of "unfounded tax benefits for importers and
loopholes in the payment of tax duties," and the transfer of all
Central Bank revenues to the federal budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
The program also stipulates a value-added tax (VAT) on
importers of services.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov is the strongest rival of acting Russian President
Vladimir Putin in the coming March 26 presidential elections,
although public opinion surveys show Putin is the most likely one
of all 11 candidates to win the race.

The ban on the legal trade in ivory by CITES in 1989 had little
effect on the illegal trade, SADC Wildlife Sector said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
However, the SADC believed that the experimental ivory trade to
Japan by Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia had raised necessary funds
for elephant conservation.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the SADC supported South Africa's proposal that
CITES should allow for an experimental quota of stockpiled ivory
from South Africa's Kruger National Park to be sold to Japan.
</P>
<P>
If the proposal is accepted, over 20,000 kilograms of ivory
from the Kruger National Park stockpile will be sold to raise over
16 million rand (about 2.54 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The fund will be used to implement a new elephant management
program in the Kruger National Park and help control the illegal
hunting of elephants and create protected areas large enough for
elephants to be re-established in parts of their former range.

<HEADLINE> SADC Members Urged to Undertake Census Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC) have been urged to undertake
national population censuses in 2000-2001 to develop common
approaches for population data collection and processing.
</P>
<P>
The population data will lay a foundation for the harmonization
of concepts and definitions, Newton Ng'uni, Zambian Deputy
Minister of Finance and Economic Development, said at SADC 2000
Census Training Workshop in Lusaka Monday.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister said that data systems in the 14-member
community will be the basis for achieving standardization of
census procedures and data presentations.
</P>
<P>
Ng'uni said the experience of Zambia which started its first
census in 1969 has shown that a population and housing census is
the backbone of any national statistical system.
</P>
<P>
It provides essential data for apportioning political
representation, planning, resource allocation, development of
sampling frames for surveys and measurement of national
development, he added.
</P>
<P>
The deputy minister assured that the Zambian government will
have the census data for the year 2000 collected, processed,
analyzed and disseminated within the shortest possible time.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African
Development Community (SADC) agrees that there are conditions for
South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Botswana to sell elephant
products without endangering the species in the region, Mozambique
News Agency reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This conclusion was reached during a session of the SADC
Technical Committee for the Coordination of Wildlife that took
place here last week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The move aims to support a proposal by those four countries,
which is to be submitted to the forthcoming 11th Conference of the
International Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) in
April in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
According to Mozambican National Director of Forests and
Wildlife Arlito Cuco, Mozambique is in favor of the sale of ivory
on the international market, but in a sustainable manner.
</P>
<P>
He said most countries defending this position have stocks of
ivory, resulting from both natural death of elephants and and
monitoring programs.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we think that there is no risk of products
of poaching, that exists on a small scale in most of our
countries, entering the legal international market," he said. "We
are for the establishment of solid rules for the marketing of
produce from endangered species."
</P>
<P>
Cuco said that the four countries seeking a renewal of their
licences to sell ivory, obtained two years ago, have all the
conditions, thus deserving the support of SADC, though they may
have to face opposition from other countries from outside the
region.

JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Four Namibians have been
killed and six others wounded by gunmen at the northeastern
Namibian region bordering Angola in the past few days, South
African Press Association reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Namibia's northeastern border regions have been subject to
increasing attacks from groups of gunmen suspected to be Angolan
rebels since December, following a major offensive against the
rebels by the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian security forces have come under pressure for not
having " realized the seriousness of the situation in the
northeastern border regions" and not making enough effort to
ensure the safety of people living in and traveling through the
area.
</P>
<P>
The Namibian government last year decided to allow the Angolan
government to use its territory to launch attacks on the rebels of
the National Union for Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
The Angolan government has been using Namibian territory to
move arms and troops into southeastern Angola.

JOHANNESBURG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- New Visa cards issued in
South Africa showed a growth rate of 16 percent for 1999 from 1.6
million to 1.9 million cards with a total expenditure of 3.6
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Visa International announced here on Monday that South Africans
are also using their Visa cards with more frequency when
travelling outside the country's borders. Last year South Africans
spent 190 million dollars on their Visa cards when travelling
overseas.
</P>
<P>
In Zimbabwe, Kenya, Mauritius and the Seychelles combined, Visa
also has achieved a positive growth in business over the last 12
months with an increase in card numbers of 13 percent and
cardholder expenditure up 22 percent. But specific amount was not
given.
</P>
<P>
The company said in a statement that "our continually positive
growth of Visa card umbers highlights that South Africa and the
rest of southern Africa are definitely embracing payment cards as
a convenient, reliable and safe alternative to traditional payment
methods when conducting their financial affairs."
</P>
<P>
The statement said the company was encouraged by this long term
steady upward growth in Visa card numbers.
</P>
<P>
The company is now looking forward to making inroads into the
debit card market in South Africa with the launch of a Visa
Electron on Monday, it said.

<HEADLINE> DRC Minister Hails Tanzania's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The visiting Interior
Minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has praised
Tanzania for playing a key role in the signing and keeping of the
Lusaka peace pact, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
After paying a tribute to Tanzanian President Benjamin Mkapa
and delivered him a message from the DRC President Laurent Kabila
in Tanzania's central town of Dodoma over the weekend, Gratian
Kakudji told the Daily News newspaper he was impressed by the
Tanzania government's commitment and readiness to step in whenever
her assistance was sought to see the peace pact being implemented.
</P>
<P>
The minister said their two-day special mission was to inform
President Mkapa on the state of the peace process in DRC and seek
his advice and views, which they regard as crucial, after the
Lusaka-DRC pact evaluation summit by DRC war belligerents last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Kakudji cautiously commended the UN decision to send over 5,000
troops to DRC to protect UN military observers there so that they
establish the actual situation on the ground before peacekeepers
are deployed.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes at this stage occupational forces from Rwanda
and Uganda will feel obliged to leave DRC territory to enable the
Congolese settle peacefully and work for their nation's progress.
</P>
<P>
Kabila's government has been keeping good relations with
Tanzania, partly due to his gratitude to the neighbor for offering
him accommodation before he seized power in 1997. Tanzania now
hosts more than 100,000 Congolese refugees in its western region.

<HEADLINE> Japan to Supply Angola with Zinc Sheets for House-building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Japan has agreed to supply
Angola with some 937,500 zinc sheets as support for a
house-building program in the southern African country, Angola's
official news agency Angop said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The governments of Japan and Angola signed a protocol of
understanding on the zinc sheets in the Angolan capital Luanda at
the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The zinc plates are intended for the phased construction of
24,000 houses for the war-displaced population, said Junior Joao,
Vice Minister of the Angolan Ministry of Social Assistance and
Reintegration.
</P>
<P>
In the first phase, which started in January 1999, some 8,000
houses were built in the outskirts of Luanda; and in the second
phase to be started next month, the same number of houses will be
built all over the country, the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the representative of the supplier, the zinc
sheets will arrive in Angola as soon as possible after a similar
agreement is signed in Japan by an Angolan delegation and the
Japanese government.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Japanese government has donated Angola over 70
tons of rice in 1999, the Angop said.
</P>
<P>
Japan is one of the biggest oil consumer country in the world
while Angola is currently the second largest oil-producing country
in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia's Bread Basket Threatened by Sorghum Chafer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Grain crops in central and
southern Ethiopia have been suffering from sorghum chafer and
other destructive insects, a senior government official said here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The production of sorghum and other crops is seriously
threatened by chafer in the major sorghum growing areas of the
Amhara, Afar and Oromia states, Vice Minister of Agriculture Belay
Ejigu told a seminar on pest control.
</P>
<P>
Belay said the crop loss due to the infestation of sorghum
chafer has been estimated to be as high as 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the efforts geared to prevent beetle
infestation, farmers in the infestation-prone areas have been
practising traditional pest control methods such as bending of
stalks of sorghum, smoking, hand collection of adult beetles and
baiting.
</P>
<P>
However, the traditional methods have their own limitations in
attaining the desired goal of controlling the pest infestation,
the vice minister said.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the year 1993 witnessed the first outbreak
of sorghum chafer in Ethiopia.

<HEADLINE> India Alleges Taliban's Complicity in Hijacking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government
alleged on Monday that the Taliban authorities in Afghanistan had
played a complicit role in the hijacking of an Indian Airlines
plane at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Throughout the hijacking incident, the Taliban authorities had
"consistently and clearly had their sympathies with the hijackers
and their other supporters and acted accordingly" even while
adopting the attitude of "correct facilitators," Indian External
Affairs Minister Jaswant Singh said in a statement tabled in the
upper house of parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the first official comment on the incident by the Indian
government, the statement said there was a "triangular
coordination" between the hijackers, the Taliban, the militant
organization Harkat-ul-Mujahedeen (HUM) and Pakistan's
intelligence agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI).
</P>
<P>
It was the first time for the Indian government to put part of
the blame for the hijacking incident on the Taliban authorities.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, the Taliban, while dealing with the
hijackers, did not press on them to give up their demand for the
release of "terrorists" jailed in India.
</P>
<P>
It was also the Taliban's own decision to give the hijackers
and the released "terrorists" 10 hours to leave Afghanistan,
regardless of India's explicit request that both the hijackers and
the released "terrorists" should be treated as criminals in
conformity with law, Singh added.
</P>
<P>
Kandahar was possibly "the most adverse location" for India to
address the situation after the hijacking occurred, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also said the hijacking had once again proved the complicity
of Pakistan and of organizations patronized and supported by it,
as the interrogation of four HUM operatives in Mumbai subsequently
had established that the hijacking was masterminded by the ISI.
</P>
<P>
Singh went on to defend the Indian government's decision to
trade three jailed "terrorists" for hostages on the hijacked plane,
claiming that it had been made "entirely on account of logistical
compulsions."
</P>
<P>
The final outcome of the incident that had been achieved was
the "best possible" in a basket of worst alternatives, he said.

<P>
OTTAWA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Cuban envoy Jose Imperatori is
in Ottawa protesting against the "major slander" by the U.S.
authorities, which expelled him on spy charges Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old former vice-consul at Cuba's Interests Section
was taken into custody by the U.S. authorities and flown to
Montreal before arriving at the Cuban Embassy in Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
"I have become the victim of a major slander," he said in a
statement, reiterating that "the accusation brought against me is
absolutely false."
</P>
<P>
Imperatori said he wants to return to the United States to face
his accusers and will remain on a hunger strike until he is
allowed to do so.
</P>
<P>
"His intention is to continue until he can go back to the
United States to clear his name," according to a statement by the
Cuban Embassy.
</P>
<P>
The Cuban government has accused the U.S. authorities of
escalating the dispute over the fate of six-year-old Elian
Gonzalez to the expulsion of its diplomat and involving a third
country by flying Imperatori to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
Ottawa agrees to "facilitate" both sides by allowing Imperatori
to enter Canada to travel home, since there are no flights between
the U.S. and Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs said Sunday that
they expected Imperatori to leave for Havana "shortly" in abidance
by the conditions of his entry.

eating contaminated beef, although this has never been formally

<HEADLINE> EU Enjoys Trade Surplus Last December </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
enjoyed a 4.7-billion-euro (about 4.5 billion U.S. dollars) trade
surplus in December, 1999, Eurostat reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Luxembourg-based statistical bureau of the European
community said that the surplus gave an estimated year-long total
surplus of 58.1 billion euros (55.7 billion dollars) for 1999,
dropping from the 81.7 billion euros (78.4 billion dollars) in
1998. Eurostat attributed the decrease to increased imports by EU
nations.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the EU member states imported 7 percent more than
they did in the previous year while they exported only 4 percent
more than they did in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In December 1998, the EU posted a trade surplus of 6.5 billion
euros (6.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to Eurostat, EU exports were weak across all product
groupings except for chemicals and energy, while imports grew in
all groupings except for food and drinks and crude materials.
</P>

<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) - Cyclist Wong Kam Po was
crowned as the Hong Kong's Sports Star of the year here on Monday.
</P>

The 26-year-old Wong enjoyed a fruitful year, earning himself
the ticket to the Sydney Olympics later this year, a new Hong Kong
record for 4km pursuit in Asian Championships and many other
titles in international tournaments.
</P>
<P>
He beat 47 nominees from the Hong Kong SAR's 29 sports
associations. It is the second time for him to obtain the title
since his participation in the awards scheme in 1991.
</P>
<P>
"I am not expected to win the title because the other award
winners have also paid out," said Wong.
</P>
<P>
The other five sports stars awards went to Olympic wind-surfer
gold medalist Lee Lai Shan, rower Ng Gar Loc, world 14th ranked
snooker talent Fu Ka Chun, fencer Fung Ying Ki, and Wushu world
champion Li Fai.
</P>
<P>
Entering its 14th year, the awards scheme received a record
high of 101 entries with 199 athletes nominated by 34 Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> China Launches Sweeping Reform of Rural Economy (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China formally kicked off the
reform of the rural economy with its recent announcement to reduce
agricultural output for the year, indicating an end to the decades-
long policy of pushing crop production to its highest limit.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the Chinese government has lowered its
target for agricultural output since New China was founded in 1949,
meaning that the government is determined to secure a wholly
market-oriented rural economy, economists here say.
</P>
<P>
The government hopes that the reform will enable agricultural
production to meet market demand, improve the efficiency of the
rural economy, and raise farmers' income enough to stimulate
domestic demand, they say.
</P>
<P>
China's crop harvests for five years running have brought the
country's store of grain, cotton and other key products to record
highs, with the grain output standing at about 500 million tons,
leading to an oversupply in the market and steadily dropping
prices and slow growth of farmers' income.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute this to the government's years of emphasis on
high-yield farming without consideration of quality and market
demand.
</P>
<P>
Since the founding of the People's Republic, the government,
fearing a food shortage for the largest population of the world,
focused almost all of its resources on boosting grain production.
</P>
<P>
In the 1980s, the government stuck to the policy of putting
grain production first while developing cash crops, and this
approach solved the problem of providing food and clothing for the
huge population.
</P>
<P>
However with the improvement of life in China, the Chinese
people have placed higher standards on the quality of the food and
clothing they buy, and they refuse to purchase poor quality
agricultural products that glut the market.

<TEXT>
<P>
At first, farmers weren't worried, as the government promised
to buy all the grain at a protected price, which was higher than
market prices.
</P>
<P>
But the subsidies allocated to State-owned grain enterprises
for purchasing the grain eventually created financial pressure.
Meanwhile, the approaching date for China's entry into the World
Trade Organization also reminded authorities of the competition
that would come from the international market.
</P>
<P>
Against this background, the Chinese government decided to
reform the rural economy under a comprehensive plan. And
economists agree that the conditions for the reform are ripe.
</P>
<P>
As an important part of the reform, the government abandoned
the protected price for grain purchasing and encouraged farmers to
expand those products that are well received on the market by
substantially raising the price for quality agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government spent more on agro-technology and
encouraged the development processing industries, hoping to
benefit farmers.
</P>
<P>
The government is also fully aware of the surplus rural labor
force that has emerged as a result of the reform. A recent report
by a think-tank under the Ministry of Agriculture predicts that by
2005, there will be some 600 million laborers in the rural areas,
but only 168 million of them will be needed in agricultural
production.

<TEXT>
<P>
The development of rural industries and towns since the late
1970s has indeed proved successful. Statistics show that some 140
million farmers are working in rural enterprises, and more than
100 million farmers live in towns.
</P>
<P>
But rural economic reform does not mean that China will loosen
up on grain production. Experts predict that over the next 30
years, China's population will increase to 1.6 billion from the
current 1.2 billion, which means that China has to produce 30
percent more grain to feed its people.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government, sober on this point, has called on
localities to preserve grain production capacity to prepare for
emergencies. Meanwhile it has taken advantage of the opening-up of
the western regions to plan environmental protection centered on
returning cultivated land to forest, tree and grass planting, and
soil erosion control which would ensure the sustainable
development of rural economy.
</P>
<P>
Economists predict that substantial changes will take place in
China's rural economy in the near future, as the reform is based
on the long-term development of the rural and national economies
and follows the trend of economic globalization and trade
liberalization.

<HEADLINE> Audio-visual Piracy, Prostitution Plague Entertainment Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Rampant piracy of audio-visual
products and prostitution are the knottiest problems facing the
Chinese entertainment market today.
</P>
<P>
Minister of Culture Sun Jiazheng detailed the situation in his
report on the state of the entertainment market here today at the
14th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature.
</P>
<P>
He said trouble is an outgrowth of the development of the
market. Illegal audio-visual publications and prostitution are
still widespread though crackdowns have been launched.
</P>
<P>
The cheap smuggled and pirated products are causing a decline
in the sales of legal items, he said, adding that the limited
supply of legal publications, a lack of wide intellectual property
awareness and mismanagement of the market make room for the
appearance of unlawful products.
</P>
<P>
He pointed to illegally-operated entertainment places and local
protectionism as the reason for the high number of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
He said steps should be taken to develop the entertainment
market in a healthy way. He suggested laws and regulations be
passed in addition to the seasonal crackdowns.

<HEADLINE> HSBC Sees Notable Growth in 1999 Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- HSBC Holdings Plc posted a
pre-tax profit of 7.982 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, a jump of 21
percent over 1998, according to HSBC's 1999 annual results
released Monday.
</P>
<P>
The net profit of the banking giant soared by a quarter to 5.4
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provisions for bad and doubtful debts fell by 21
percent to two billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
HSBC Group Chief Executive Keith Whitson said the result
reflected an economic improvement in Asia with stabilization and
credit quality and with lower provisions required in Malaysia and
China's inland areas.
</P>
<P>
The sustained growth in the U.S. economy and Asia's continued
recovery will hold the key to the group's performance this year,
said Whitson.
</P>
<P>
HSBC's subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Monday reported a 22.7 percent
rise in its pre-tax profit to 1.25 billion U.S. dollars in 1999
largely due to a substantial reduction in loan loss provisions.
</P>
<P>
Provisions for bad and doubtful debts of Hang Seng in 1998 fell
by 42.7 percent to 182 million U.S. dollars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hang Seng Bank recorded a higher net profit of 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars, an increase of 22 percent over 1998.

<HEADLINE> India's Economic Growth Slows Down In 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- India's economy has been
projected to grow by 5.9 percent in 1999-2000 rather than 6.8
percent as estimated a year earlier due to slower agricultural
growth, the Ministry of Finance said in its economic survey tabled
before parliament Monday.
</P>
<P>
The survey for the financial year warned that a "daunting"
fiscal deficit is set to exceed 8.5 percent of the Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) and called for "hard decisions" to push up the
slowdown in economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Worse still, it said, the deficit "is expected to rise further
in the coming year" and the growth in tax collections is below
target.
</P>
<P>
On economic management, the survey said, administrative
practices had remained unchanged since "colonial times" and a
start should be made by abolishing redundant economic laws.
</P>
<P>
But the Finance Ministry said the balance of payment survived
the twin shocks of the East Asian crisis and the nuclear tests in
May 1998 with a low current account deficit and sufficient capital
inflows, shown by the continuing rise in foreign exchange reserves
by over 2.4 billion U.S. dollars till the end of January and a
relatively stable exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
Exports went up by 12.9 percent during April-December last year
as against a fall of 2.9 percent in the corresponding period of
1998, due partly to the revival of world trade on the heels of the
East Asian recovery and a modest recovery in some global commodity
prices, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
Despite a 57.8 percent growth in oil imports in terms of U.S.
dollars during the same period, overall import growth remained at
9 percent, which the ministry termed as "manageable."
</P>
<P>
Annual inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index, was
2.9 percent, dramatically down from a peak of 8.8 percent on
September 25, 1998, and the drop in inflation as measured by the
consumer price index for industrial workers was even more dramatic,
falling to zero last November from a peak of 19.7 percent a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
The financial year ended with India's food grains output
crossing 200 million tons, slight down from 203 million tons in
1998-99 and the country has also emerged as a marginal exporter of
food grains (2 to 4 million tons).
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that industrial growth firmly recovered last
year with a growth rate of 6.2 percent as compared to only 3.7
percent in April-December 1998.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Burns 2.02 Mln Dollars Worth of Illicit Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Some 2.02 million U.S.
dollars worth of illicit drugs were burned Monday in Phnom Penh to
show Cambodia's determination to combat and eliminate drugs.
</P>
<P>
Sar Kheng, a deputy prime minister and chairman of the National
Authority for Combating Drugs (NACD), attended the burning
ceremony. Also present were Justice Minister Uk Vithun, Phnom Penh
Governor Chea Sophara and Secretary General of NACD Em Sam An and
other government officials, as well as representatives from
international organizations.
</P>
<P>
The burned up drugs, only a part of those seized since 1994,
included 5.5 kilograms of heroin, 1.51 kilograms of opium
alkaloids and several thousand tablets of amphetamine, as well as
other kinds of drugs worth a total of 2.02 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The event shows the determination of our Royal Government to
combat and to eliminate illegal production, trafficking, and the
use of illicit drugs," said Em Sam An.
</P>
<P>
Hok Lundy, director general of National Police, told a press
conference Monday that Cambodia is becoming the target for drug
criminals using Cambodia as transit bases for drug trafficking.
And in the first two months of 2000, the government authorities
had already arrested 23 people and confiscated 12,222 tablets of
amphetamine, morphine and marijuana.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, Hok Lundy said, Cambodian authorities seized 5 tons of
marijuana, 6.2 kilograms of hashish oil, 970 grams of heroin, 1,
110 grams of opium, and over 20,000 tablets of amphetamine.
</P>
<P>
"In order to firmly participate in the fight against illicit
drugs, the Royal Government of Cambodia has appointed a task force
to control, destroy and prevent the production, use, as well as
illegal cultivation of illicit drugs," Hok Lundy added.
</P>
<P>
In recent crackdown operations, the Cambodian government had
chopped down and destroyed approximately 31 hectares of fresh
marijuana plants, confiscated and burned 9.5 tons of dried
marijuana and seized 10 kilograms of marijuana seeds.

<HEADLINE> Somalis Raise Funds for Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, February 28 (Xinhua) -- More than 70 local
Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and civil groups in Somalia
decided Sunday night to open a donation account for the Djibouti
reconciliation conference that is aimed to establish a Somali
government for the first time in more than nine years.
</P>
<P>
The resolution followed intensive and extensive meetings of the
Somali civil society groups throughout the country and Djibouti,
said Hassan Shireh Sheikh, current rotating chairman of the Somali
Peace and Human Rights Network, on Monday in his office.
</P>
<P>
He said that a Fund-Raising Task Force for the Djibouti
conference has already been established.
</P>
<P>
The Somalis will not attend the conference bare handed, they
will come up with material support, he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime target of the local organizations is to raise five
million U.S. dollars to support the conference. If their efforts
fall shorter, even three million U.S. dollars would do, Sheikh
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about how this large sum of money would be collected,
Sheikh said the contributors would also include generous friends
of Somalia in the Arabian countries, Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
"The fund raising has already begun within each of the Somali
civil society groups,"he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time within this month that the Somali civil
society groups are opening accounts for fund raising. Funds and
food are flowing into the former Martini hospital, now the home of
110 Somali war veterans disabled during the fighting between
Somalia and Ethiopia in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The Djibouti conference is scheduled to begin on April 20 and
end on May 5.

<HEADLINE> Euro Zone Finance Ministers Not Bothered By Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The euro zone finance
ministers Monday seemed not to have been bothered by the single
currency that had dipped to its 14-month low on exchange markets.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, meeting right before a routine council meeting
of the finance ministers of all the 15 European Union (EU) member
states, decided not to discuss the exchange rate of the euro or
make any new statement.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Finnish Finance Minister Sauli Niinisto said
they would stick to what they had stated previously.
</P>
<P>
The euro zone finance ministers said after their last month's
meeting that the single currency had the potential to appreciate.
</P>
<P>
The euro, the single currency for 11 European Union member
states, was hit by its biggest one-day sell-off in Tokyo, plunging
3.6 percent to well below its previous all-time low of 0.9665 euro
to the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
The new low, though temporary, of 0.9390 to the dollar in the
hectic Asian session of trading, prompted small talks that the
European Central Bank (ECB) might raise interest rates again on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
ECB Governor Wim Duisenberg, however, left the meeting of the
euro zone finance ministers without making any comment on the
single currency which made its way back to 0.9710 to the dollar in
Europe by mid Monday morning. The recovery helped ease market
pressure.
</P>
<P>
Some local observers attributed the slide of the euro against
the dollar to the gap of economic growth in the United States and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. gross domestic product data showed that the American
economy was growing at 6.9 percent in the fourth quarter of last
year whereas the EU statistical bureau projected a just over 2-
percent growth for the 15-nation bloc this year.

<HEADLINE> Unilever Launches Research Center in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Anglo-Dutch consumer products
giant Unilever (ULVR.L) today initiated its sixth global research
and development center in China's economic powerhouse of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Unilever China Research and Development Center, built at a cost
of 166 million yuan, is situated inside Minhang Economic and
Technological Development Zone. It covers 3,000 sq m and will
employ 150 workers this year.
</P>
<P>
Rudolph Markham, a member on the board of directors for
Unilever's global strategy and technology, was in Shanghai for
today's opening of the center.
</P>
<P>
He said traditional herbal medicine is one of China's strong
points. Applying modern science and technology to making
traditional Chinese medicines will help Unilever develop more herb-
based products that will suit Chinese consumers' habits and needs
and win a greater market for Unilever in China.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the new center will help expand Unilever's
cooperation with China's scientific and technological communities,
and spread information about traditional Chinese medicine
throughout the world so that more people outside China will buy
herbal products from this country.
</P>
<P>
Unilever, with products ranging from food to detergent, first
set up a soap factory in Shanghai in 1923. It has so far invested
800 million U.S. dollars in China since it resumed business in the
country in 1980, and has started up five solely-invested and joint
ventures. Two years ago, Unilever set up a conglomerate with
headquarters in Shanghai responsible for business operations in
greater China.
</P>
<P>
In addition to its research and development of mixtures for new
detergents and cosmetics, the new center will also explore
potential for herbal food products such as tea and sauces.
</P>
<P>
Before setting up the new center, Unilever built a lab together
with the Shanghai Institute of Organic Chemistry, and carried out
wide-scale cooperation with Shanghai Institute of Materia Medica,
Zhangzhou Tea Research Institute and Wuxi University.
</P>
<P>
Unilever operates five other R&AMP;D centers in Britain, the
Netherlands, India and the United States. It is said that Unilever
pumps up one billion U.S. dollars for global R&AMP;D each year, and
the China center will get 60 million yuan (7.22 million U.S.
dollars) as this year's research budget.

<HEADLINE> Millions of Chinese Study for College at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 28 (Xinhua) -- For millions of Chinese,
getting a bachelor's degree doesn't mean a four-year stay on
campus: A new non-traditional, student-friendly program lets them
take all their classes at home.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Education (MOE) announced today that the
country's independent study program (ISP) has become the leading
form of higher education in China, as opposed to traditional
campus-based education.
</P>
<P>
About 90 million people registered to attend ISP examinations
in the past 20 years, 2.4 million of them earning university
diplomas.
</P>
<P>
Education Minister Chen Zhili called ISP an "irreplaceable"
part of the country's higher education system, which also includes
campus-based education and adult education.
</P>
<P>
An ISP student chooses a major, studies at home from a set
course, can receive tutoring if necessary, and then takes the
national examination on the road to a diploma.
</P>
<P>
The program provides convenient access to the same courses that
are taught on the campus proper, while costing much less, and
helps millions make their "university dream" come true, Chen said
at a national meeting on ISP today.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of 1999, a record 6.5 million people
registered for ISP examinations.
</P>
<P>
The MOE plans to continually update the program to keep it
contemporary. Multi-media technology will be used to expand the
service to the vast rural areas, where young people usually have
fewer opportunities to go to college than city youth.

<HEADLINE> Wild Tigers Spotted in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese zoologists have found
snatches of fur from wild South China tigers in the mountainous
region of east China's Jiangxi Province, and say that the group of
the endangered beasts are able to propagate.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the provincial nature reserve department announced
today that there are at least five wild tigers including one adult
female, one adult male and three young tigers living in the
Yihuang County at the south of the province.
</P>
<P>
This is the third report of traces of wild tigers after other
sightings in Hunan and Zhejiang provinces this month.
</P>
<P>
In July of 1999, a local resident of the county died after he
was bitten by a wild animal which experts believed to be a tiger.
The accident caught the attention of zoologists.
</P>
<P>
Not far from the site of biting, zoologists found footprints
which proved to be those of a female South China tiger. And more
than 50 specimins of black, white and yellowish animal fur were
recovered from the site.
</P>
<P>
The fur was sent to a research lab under the State Forestry
Bureau, where scientists determined it was tiger fur.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time we found tiger hairs, and it is a very
compelling proof that the rare tigers still exist," said Jing
Yansong, one of China's leading tiger authorities from Northeast
China Forestry University.
</P>
<P>
In years past there have been several reports of South China
tigers in the county. Some local farmers said they saw several
young tigers in the mountains and heard the animals roar. In 1992,
poachers killed a young tiger in the region.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists say they have the evidence that at least three young
tigers are still living there.
</P>
<P>
The South China tiger, one of the ten most endangered species
in the world, is unique to China and is under State-level
protection. The beasts live mainly in Fujian, Hunan, Guangdong and
Jiangxi provinces.
</P>
<P>
Currently, over 50 South China tigers are living in zoos.
Experts worry that the beast will become extinct in the coming 50
years because of inbreeding.
</P>
<P>
Experts believe that the sparsely populated Yihuang County with
a mild and humid climate and plentiful preys is a suitable living
place for South China tigers.
</P>
<P>
A State-level tiger protection zone covering over 58,600
hectares will be designated in the county.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Historians Support Former Japanese Soldier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese historians held a
symposium here today to show their support for a former Japanese
soldier determined to tell the truth about the war crimes
committed by Japanese troops in Nanjing in 1937.
</P>
<P>
Azuma Shiro, 88, was a soldier in the Japanese brigade that
occupied Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In
the following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians and he recorded the atrocities in a secret
diary.
</P>
<P>
He published this diary in April 1996 and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken against
him.
</P>
<P>
Shiro took his case to a higher court but his appeal was denied
in December, 1998.
</P>
<P>
At today's gathering, the experts, who specialized in the study
of the War of Resistance Against Japan (1937-1945), accused the
Japanese court of attempting to prevent more former Japanese
soldiers from telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
They said recent rally of right-wing activists in Japan sounded
an alarm against Japanese militarism, and the Chinese people
should never relax their vigilance.
</P>
<P>
Shiro will continue his tour in the cities of Shenyang and
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Israel Denies Possible Resumption of Talks With Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy said Monday the deadlocked Israeli-Syrian negotiations
will not resume in the near future as speculated by the media.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting with European Commission President Romano Prodi,
Levy said any reports of possible resumption between the two
counties
are speculation.
</P>
<P>
Prodi, a former Italian prime minister, arrived in Israel on
Sunday on a two-day visit, his first as the Commission's president.
He is expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
President Ezer Weizman to convey European Union's desire to have a
great role in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Levy said Syria has yet to prove its intentions to peace and
Israel will not renew the talks on the basis of "dictation and
incitement."
</P>
<P>
Levy cited "waves of anti-Israeli campaign" in Syria in the past
few weeks, which compared Israel to Nazi Germany and Levy to Adolf
Hitler, as the evidence of "dictation and incitement".
</P>
<P>
Levy's remarks threw cold water upon media speculations about
the possible resumption of the talks, that surfaced earlier in the
day from Barak's speech at Sunday's cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Barak told his ministers that the four former prime ministers
all held talks with Syria somehow under the assumption that Israel
will fully withdraw from the Golan Heights to the June 4, 1967
lines.
</P>
<P>
Barak revealed former prime minister Yitzhak Shamir had agreed
to a Golan withdrawal by virtue of attending the 1991 Madrid Middle
East peace conference on the basis of United Nations resolutions
which call for such a pullback.
</P>
<P>
Yitzhak Rabin, Barak added, gave U.S. officials an oral promise,
which was then passed to the Syrians, that Israel would withdraw to
the June 4 lines. Shimon Peres had conducted negotiations with the
same promise on the table, he said.
</P>
<P>
In regard to the secret negotiations Benjamin Netanyahu
conducted with the Syrians, Barak said the talks through U.S.
businessman Ron Lauder did the same.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu Monday denied he had ever agreed to mark a future
border with Syria. He said the only agreement he reached with
Damascus during the indirect talks was a long-term Israeli presence
at an early warning station on Mount Hermon.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, in a context that Israel used to deny these
commitments, Barak's remarks had made some analysts speculate that
he will concede to Syria's demand for a written promise about the
Golan Heights withdrawal before their negotiations could resume.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that the U.S. administration has informed
Israel that Syrian showed an inclination in the past few days to
renew the peace talks according to certain formulation.
</P>
<P>
In this proposed plan, Israel will agree to demarcate the June 4
lines as the borderline between the two counties, in return for
Syria's clarification about their position regarding normalization
and security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, EU Middle East special envoy Miguel Moratinos also
announced Monday that the chances are good that a new round of
Israeli-Syrian talks will begin soon. Moratinos just returned from
Damascus Sunday after meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian-Israeli peace talks, which resumed last December
after a 45-month break, hit a snag again earlier this year only
after two rounds of talks due to differences over Israeli troops
withdrawal form the Golan Heights, which was occupied by Israel in
the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel's written pledge to a full withdrawal
to the June 4, 1967 borders. But Israel insisted on discussion of
security arrangements and normalization of bilateral ties first.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Government Welcomes Fisheries Pact With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government on
Monday welcomed an agreement signed Sunday with China to make
their bilateral fisheries pact effective from June, settling
differences over zoning in the East China Sea that had hindered
implementation of the accord since it was signed in November 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It is one step forward that this agreement established a new
fishing order and the basis of controlling marine resources under
the U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea," Japanese Chief Cabinet
Secretary Mikio Aoki told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Noting that it is delightful that one pending issue was
resolved from a viewpoint of the entire Japan-China relationship,
the top government spokesman said the Japanese government will
make efforts to further develop bilateral relations with China.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Chinese Agriculture Minister Chen Yaobang and
Japanese Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Tokuichiro
Tamazawa signed the agreement in Beijing following talks on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, China and Japan agreed to establish a free
fisheries zone between 127 degrees 30 minutes east longitude and
124 degrees 45 minutes east longitude, where boats of the two
countries may catch fish without prior approval from their
respective governments.
</P>
<P>
The new agreement, which was originally signed in November 1997,
replaced a 1975 bilateral fisheries treaty and followed the two
countries' ratification of the U.N. Convention on the Law of the
Sea in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Implementation had been delayed partly due to differences over
drawing the zoning line and over conditions of operation in part
of the East China Sea the two countries had agreed to put under
joint control.

<HEADLINE> Switzerland Decides Not to Ban Blood Donors in CJD Fears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Federal Health Office
has decided not to ban people living in Britain between 1980 and
1986 from giving blood, Swiss Radio International reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The decision came despite claims that a ban could help control
the spread of Creuzveldt Jacob Disease (CJD), which is the human
variant of BSE, commonly known as mad cow disease, a fatal brain
disorder in cattle. It is thought humans can contract CJD by
eating contaminated beef, although this has never been formally
proven.
</P>
<P>
The Swiss health authorities believed that existing blood
filtration systems had provided sufficient protection for patients,
adding that a ban on donations from former British residents is
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
It admitted, however, this method does not provide a 100
percent guarantee that blood products are safe, saying this would
require a new test capable of detecting the infectious agents
which cause BSE and CJD.
</P>
<P>
As a further precaution, donors will be asked if there have
been cases of CJD within their families, and to state whether they
have undergone corneal implants.
</P>
<P>
Britain was badly hit by the BSE epidemic. As a result, the
United States and Canada have imposed bans on blood donations from
people who were living in Britain when the disease was at its
height.
</P>
<P>
Although they hope these precautions will help limit the spread
of CJD, experts admit the benefits of such bans are impossible to
quantify as it is not yet known whether the disease can actually
be transmitted through blood products.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Begins State Visit to Netherlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
left Paris Monday morning for a state visit to The Netherlands,
the first by a French head of state since 1984.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is due to meet Queen Beatrix and will make a speech on
ethics at the Royal Academy of Sciences in Amsterdam on Monday,
said sources of the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He will hold talks with Dutch Prime Minister Wim Kok on Tuesday
in the Hague and will visit the International Court of Justice and
the International Criminal Tribunal in charge of pursuing war
crimes in former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Relations between France and The Netherlands were strained in
the mid-1990s because of Dutch protest against the resumption of
French nuclear tests in the South Pacific and France's criticism
of The Netherlands' drug policy.

<HEADLINE> Swede Wins Women's High Jump With Personal Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENT, Belgium, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Erica Johansson hit a 6.
89-meter long jump on her first outing on Sunday to win the women'
s title at the European indoor athletic championships.
</P>
<P>
What was more for her was that her winning distance was just
three centimeters farther away than Heike Drechsler, the German
sprinter and long jumper 10 years her senior, who has been
dominating the long jump pit this season on the European circuit.
</P>
<P>
Drechsler also hit a good jump on her first outing with a 6.80
but fouled on her four later attempts. The 35-year-old German
veteran adjusted her approach run-up on her sixth and last outing
to pull off a 6.86 to secure the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria got the bronze with a clearance of 6.
80 meters.
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Szabo of Romania, the best woman athlete of 1999, won
her speciality of 3,000 meters with a clocking of eight minutes 42.
06 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian won most of the races she took part in last year
and she was selected as the best woman athlete of the year by the
European sportswriters union.
</P>
<P>
Pavla Hamackova of the Czech Republic won the women's pole vaul
event with a clearance of 4.40 meters. She then tried three times
at the height of 4.50 meters but failed.
</P>
<P>
Yelena Belyakova of Russia and Christine Adams of Germany
finished a dead-heat for the silver medal with an identical height
of 4.35 meters. The two pole vaulted exactly the same on their
way on to the medal podium.
</P>
<P>
Jason Gardener of Britain lived up to his expectation as the
sprinting king of the championships as he won the men's 60-meter
race with a championship record-equalling time.
</P>
<P>
The Briton clocked 6.49 seconds for the distance, equaling the
championship mark held by compatriot Colin Jackson since March
1994.
</P>
<P>
Two Greeks, G. Theodoridis and Angelos Pavlakakis, proved their
insight in the sprinting discipline as they finished runner-up and
third place respectively.
</P>
<P>
Three men ended up at the same height only to have their medal
positions decided by their progressive performance. They all
cleared 2.34 meters but Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia got the gold
medal of the men's high jump event with less failed attempt.
</P>
<P>
Martin Buss of Germany and Dragutin Topic from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia got the silver and bronze medals
respectively all with the clearance of 2.34 meters.
</P>
<P>
Russia closed its grip over the indoor track and field events
as the country scooped up four more gold medals from Sunday's
competition. Russian athletes won the men's high jump, women's
4x400-meter relay, men's 800 meters and women's 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
Russia finished its championship appearance with six gold
medals in all.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, February 27 (Xinhua) -- South African national
soccer team Bafana Bafana will play World Cup champion France here
in October, senior official of South African Football Association
(SAFA) president Molefi Oliphant said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Oliphant said the SAFA will meet the French Football
Federation next week to finalize the details of the match.
</P>
<P>
Bafana Bafana took on the French team for the first time at the
Felix Bollaet Stadium in Lens on October 11, 1997 when the French
won 2-1. There was an understanding at that time that the French
would play a return match in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The two teams again met on June 12, 1998 in a World Cup Group C
match at the Velodrome Stadium in Marseilles with the French
winning 3-0.
</P>
<P>
Oliphant also said SAFA had received a report from its
technical committee at the African Cup of Nations and would decide
next week whether to retain current coach Trott Moloto or appoint
a new coach.

<HEADLINE> China, Thailand to Promote All-Round Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Li
Lanqing told Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul in a
meeting this evening that China hopes to further develop its
cooperation with Thailand in economic, scientific, technological,
educational and cultural areas.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his visit to Thailand and participation in the
opening ceremony of the 13th Asian Games at the end of 1998, Li
said that the two countries are good neighbors, and Sino-Thai
cooperation has been progressing.
</P>
<P>
Li said this year marks 25th anniversary of the establishment
of Sino-Thai diplomatic relations, and the Chinese government will
extend a welcome to Thai Princess Maha Chakri Sirindhorn, who is
expected to visit China soon, and also is eager for the various
celebrations that will be hosted by the two countries.
</P>
<P>
He expressed his appreciation for Thailand's success in
overcoming the financial crisis, and said that the Asian economy
has recovered from recession through reform.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Asian economic future is promising," Li
said.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai Rattakul said that the two countries have a familial
relationship, and frequent exchanges of visits between the two
countries' leaders have helped promote friendship and cooperation,
adding that they have also had fruitful cooperation in a variety
of areas.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two countries will expand mutual
investment, trade and technological ties in the years ahead.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Meets Thai Deputy PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji
told visiting Thai Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul that he
hoped China and Thailand will expand cooperation this year -- the
25th anniversary of their diplomatic ties -- so as to advance the
bilateral relationship.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in a meeting with the Thai guests here this
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhu noted that the Sino-Thai relationship is growing soundly,
and "there is no urgent problem waiting to be solved between our
two countries." During the past two and half decades, he said,
China and Thailand have cooperated successfully in such fields as
politics, the economy, culture, science and technology and defense.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also maintained good cooperation in global
and regional affairs, according to the Chinese premier.
</P>
<P>
"With the concerted efforts of both sides, bilateral ties have
entered the more mature development phase," Zhu said, adding that
China is confident in the future of the China-Thailand link.
</P>
<P>
Zhu described China and Thailand as "intimate friends." The
successful state visit paid by Chinese President Jiang Zemin to
Thailand last year laid a solid foundation for the all-round
friendly cooperation in the new century, the Chinese premier said.
</P>
<P>
The close political relationship also lays solid groundwork for
the promotion of Sino-Thai economic and trade cooperation, he said.
Under such circumstances, both sides can find new ways for further
expanding the economic and trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that China is grateful for Thailand's adherence to the
"one China" policy and asked Bhichai to give his regards to his
Thai counterpart Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
Bhichai conveyed greeting from Chuan Leekpai to Zhu. Since the
two countries established diplomatic ties 25 years ago, he said,
bilateral ties witnessed smooth growth. Thailand's royal family,
government and people all are committed to the friendship between
the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Thai government, he also expressed gratitude
for China's purchase of agricultural produce from Thailand, saying
that provided vital support for Thailand's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also exchanged views on expanding cooperation in
tourism and other areas.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies' Proposals Answered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press release issued prior to the NPC annual session,
which is to open on March 5, the NPC General Office said that it
collected 3,040 proposals, criticisms and opinions from deputies
during last year's annual session, and transferred all of them to
the appropriate government and judicial departments to solve.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 2,149 or 70.69 percent have been or are being
handled by relevant departments; 672 proposals, which are too
complicated to implement at present, have been listed as tasks for
the future, and 219 opinions have been set back for future
reference.
</P>
<P>
Government departments have paid considerable attention to some
of the suggestions. For instance, in response to a proposal
presented by NPC deputies, five ministries and commissions of the
State Council formed a joint team last year and conducted
extensive field surveys to solve the urban heating problem in
areas of high altitude and latitude in the winter.
</P>
<P>
The NPC General Office said that proposals, criticisms and
opinions from deputies have been sharply increasing in recent
years and many are reasonable but will require great effort to
make happen.
</P>
<P>
The generally satisfactory results of the handling of such
proposals and opinions are because of the coordinated efforts of
the NPC and the government and judicial organizations, the NPC
said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Paper Urges Written Commitment Over Golan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Syrian pro-government
newspaper has urged Israel to provide a written document to confirm
the former Israeli leaders' pledge to fully withdrawal from the
Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Terming Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak's oral admission of
pullout promise as inadequate, the Baath daily, organ of the ruling
Socialist Arab Party, Monday asked for a written commitment.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said Barak told ministers that past Israeli
governments had made commitments to the United States for a total
pullback from the Golan Heights in return for security measures on
the strategic plateau captured from Syria in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"We cannot erase the past," Israel Radio quoted Barak as saying
in reference to the reported pledges which Syria has insisted are
binding on his administration.
</P>
<P>
The paper in its editorial said "Barak, who, for the first time
admitted the pledge of former Israeli premiers, should get out of
the circle of his contradictions and prove that he is serious in
achieving a just and comprehensive peace and therefore, admission
itself is not sufficient."
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio Sunday also said time is running out and the
opportunity available now must be seized so as to reach a peace
accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel had previously repeatedly denied Barak's predecessors had
made such promises.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Students Clash With Israeli Troops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian students clashed
with Israeli soldiers in the West Bank city of Bethlehem on Monday,
but there were no reports on injuries on both sides so far,
according to the Jerusalem Media and Communication Center (JMCC).
</P>
<P>
The clash erupted Monday morning when a large group of Bethlehem
University students demonstrated near the Rachel Tomb in the city
to show solidarity with the university students in Ramallah who
stoned visiting French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin for his remarks
against Lebanese anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Jospin, after meeting with Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak in Jerusalem, termed Hezbollah's military activities
against Israeli occupation troops in south Lebanon as "terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Jospin's remarks angered the Arab world and he was widely
criticized by most Arab and Islamic countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Syrian- and Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, which has
been spearheading a guerrilla war to oust Israeli occupation troops
from the country, have recently stepped up its attacks on Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a border strip in 1985 with a claimed aim of
protecting its north from Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has condemned the attack of the
Birzeit university students and the university was closed for three
days while around 15 students were arrested.
</P>
<P>
In Monday's clash, the Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at
the Israeli troops guarding the tomb, and the Israeli troops hit
back with rubber-coated bullets at the students.
</P>
<P>
The clash is still going on and a number of Palestinian security
forces were called to the site to maintain order.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Workers Protest Against Labor Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Scores of Iranian workers
gathered in front of the premises of the Majlis (Parliament) Monday
morning in protest against a bill passed by the legislature to ease
the Labor Law.
</P>
<P>
The protesters left only after some labor officials made
promises to make investigations into the case, the Islamic Republic
News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The bill, passed on Sunday, provides that firms with a workforce
of five or below are exempted from certain regulations in the Labor
Law for a period of six years up to the end of the third economic
development plan in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The measure is part of a drive by the current conservatives-
controlled parliament to encourage investment and end a chronic
unemployment problem. However, it will make it easy for small firms
to fire workers and pay them as little money as possible, a
protester pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Law, introduced after the 1979 Islamic revolution to
help the economic underclass, makes it almost impossible to fire
workers and imposes employee benefits.
</P>
<P>
The new bill has met opposition from organizations representing
labor interests, IRNA said.
</P>
<P>
The Labor Welfare Islamic Party, in a statement, termed Sunday's
approval of the bill as contrary to social justice and the
Constitution, saying that the bill not only deals a blow on job
security of workers but also ignores the basic rights of millions
of workers.
</P>
<P>
Announcing its opposition to the approval of the bill, the party
called for its rejection by relevant organizations.
</P>
<P>
The Labor House and the High Court for Islamic labor Councils,
in separate statements, called the Majlis action as a severe,
intolerable blow on the labor community.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, four members of the Labor and Social Affairs
Commission of the Majlis, Alireza Mahjoob, Abolqassem Sarhadizah,
Rahman Tajeddin and Soheila Jelodarzadeh, in a joint statement,
criticized the bill and stressed that the legal rights of workers
can only be restored in accordance with law.

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Vietnamese government Monday
officially announced the state president's decision on the special
amnesty for this year.
</P>
<P>
The decision, announced by Director of Vietnamese State
President's Office Nguyen Canh Dinh, said that conducting the
special amnesty would show the lenient policy of the Vietnamese
Party and State and the country's tradition of human rights.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision, signed by State President Tran Duc
Luong on Wednesday, the special amnesty will be conducted on the
25th anniversary of the liberation of South Vietnam on April 30,
and the 55th anniversary of the National Day on September 2 this
year.
</P>
<P>
Dinh refused to give the exact number of convicts who will
enjoy the special amnesty. However, he said the number of convicts
enjoying the special amnesty will be larger than that in 1998,
when Vietnam released 7,800 prisoners.

<HEADLINE> Mayon Volcano Explodes Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Mount Mayon exploded Monday
afternoon in a huge mushroom of dark clouds shooting up the sky
resembling a mini atomic bomb, and covering its slopes down to its
base, Philippine News Agency (PNA) said.
</P>
<P>
Describing the special scenario, the PNA said local people
gasped in fear and vehicles stopped on the streets as the fearsome
curtain of dark clouds loomed over them for minutes.
</P>
<P>
Volcanologists said it was a series of explosions, and despite
the strong winds the pillar of ash-laden clouds stayed on for
about 15 minutes in the sky dragging slowly to the west.
</P>
<P>
The blast which occurred at about 5:45 p.m. local time was
accompanied by a rumbling sound reverberating underground, they
added.
</P>
<P>
Raymundo Punongbayan, director of the Philippine Institute of
Volcanology and Seismology (Phivolcs), was quoted as saying that
it would be classified as a major eruption if its emissions exceed
35,000 cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Punongbayan said the lava and pyroclastic flows now rushing
down Mt. Mayon's slopes is 9 times hotter than boiling water.

<P>
SINGAPORE, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Singapore enjoyed a
historical high of 637,619 visitor arrivals last month, picking up
by 11.8 percent year-on-year after a 11.7 percent hike in receipts
in 1999, the Singapore Tourism Board (STB) said in a press release
Monday.
</P>
<P>
STB said the country's tourism receipts hit 10.013 billion
Singapore dollars (about 6 billion U.S. dollars) for 1999.
</P>
<P>
STB said visitor traffic from Asia in January registered an
encouraging growth of 16.8 percent and that from Africa, the
Americas and Europe in the month showed moderate increases of 5.3
percent, 4.8 percent and 3.6 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, STB added, the Oceania market contracted by 4.1
percent.
</P>
<P>
The number of visitors from South Korea soared by 89.4 percent
year-on-year in January, continuing to stage a strong recovery
spurred by robust economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Indonesian visitor arrivals surged up by 31 percent year-on-

</P>
<P>
Traffic from India remained buoyant, increasing 21.7 percent in

<P>
Visitors from Taiwan continued to dive in January with a
decline of 26.5 percent over a year ago and STB attributed the

<HEADLINE> Pilot Dies, Three Survive in Philippine Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Three passengers survived when
a private aircraft made an emergency landing Monday at a beach
resort south of Manila, but the pilot died of heart attack while
the plane was still 7,500 feet up in the air, the Philippine Air
Transportation Office (ATO) said.
</P>
<P>
The ATO said in a report that the aircraft, a six-seater Cessna
206 with tail No. RPC 1987, crash-landed at a beach resort in
Batangas city, some 10 nautical miles south of Manila, at about 11:
19 a.m.
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from Caticlan Airport in the Visayas
province of Aklan for Manila.
</P>
<P>
On board the aircraft were three passengers and Perfecto
Maglinte, the pilot.
</P>
<P>
A source of the Philippine Air Force said that while flying the
aircraft, Maglinte was able to communicate through radio with an
Asian Spirit pilot identified as Capt. Galvez who noticed the
abnormal speed of the Cessna.
</P>
<P>
Galvez learned that Maglinte suffered a heart attack and
expired, prompting the passengers to panic and get nervous.
</P>
<P>
Through the radio conversation, Galvez reportedly gave one of
the Cessna passengers, who was called Consunji, instructions on
how to safely land the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Consunji, anticipating the trouble they would create if they
land at the Manila Domestic Airport, decided to make a "force
landing" upon seeing the white sand beach resort in Batangas.
</P>
<P>
Fishermen in the area who saw the plane crash came to the
rescue of the survivors.

<HEADLINE> 21,600 Burundi Refugee Babies Born in Tanzania Annually </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, February 28 (Xinhua) - An average of 21,600
Burundian babies are born annually to the refugee camps in
Tanzania's western Kigoma Region, local media reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Between 200 and 400 new babies are being registered by the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) each month
in each of the six camps in the region, the report quoted Lucas
Machibya, a UNHCR nutrition expert as saying.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR registers between 1,200 and 2,400 newborn babies in
all the six camps each month, he said.
</P>
<P>
The expert described the birth rate in these camps as too high
and that some measures should be taken to reverse the trend.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the trend, which was threatening both the welfare
and security of the local people, especially those living close to
the camps, to the refugees' reluctance to adopt family planning
methods.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the camps, the high birth rate was
partly due to the refugees' desire to increase their population to
bridge the gap caused by those killed in ethnic fightings going on
in the central African country.
</P>
<P>
The other reason is that in having more babies, the refugees
thought they could obtain larger shares of food and other supplies
from UNHCR, said an official from the local government.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR statistics show Burundi refugees live in six out of the
nine refugee camps, comprising 70 percent of about 500,000
registered refugees in the region.

investors hesitant to take strong positions.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Seize Opportunities and Meet Challenges of WTO Entry: Article (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into the World
Trade Organization (WTO) will mean both opportunities and
challenges, and the country should get well prepared to seize the
opportunities and meet the challenges, the People's Daily said
today.
</P>
<P>
In a signed article titled "Get To Know the Pros and Cons of
China's Entry Into the WTO," the leading national newspaper said
that the Chinese people should be aware of the importance of China
becoming a WTO member, familiarize themselves with its rules and
regulations and implement counter-measures to protect China from
the pressures and challenges from becoming a WTO member.
</P>
<P>
China should protect and support its agriculture, strive to
sharpen the competitive edge of industrial companies, open the
service trade market step by step, and improve the supervision and
management of its cultural product market.
</P>
<P>
The article also stated that managers of state-owned
enterprises should keep up with the times and abide by the rules
of the market-oriented economy. China should make amendments to
present laws and regulations on economic activities involving
foreign business people.
</P>
<P>
China should train a large number of WTO specialists who have
good command of foreign languages, are familiar with China's
specific conditions and can use their WTO expertise to protect the
country's interests.

<HEADLINE> Seize Opportunities and Meet Challenges From WTO Entry: Article (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The article listed five advantages that China will gain by
becoming a WTO member:
</P>
<P>
-- It will enable China to further expand its exports and
create more favorable conditions to attract overseas investments;
</P>
<P>
-- It will enable China to accelerate the restructuring of its
domestic industries;
</P>
<P>
-- It will further promote China's economic restructuring and
help the country build a market economic system;
</P>
<P>
-- It will enable China to participate in formulating new rules
concerning international trade, thus safeguarding China's
interests and raising China's international status; and
</P>
<P>
-- It will be favorable for China's participation in economic
globalization.
</P>
<P>
The article also listed several challenges. They include:
</P>
<P>
-- More fierce competition for some domestic enterprises and
industries after China further opens the market;
</P>
<P>
-- The work style of staff and managers of state-owned
enterprises is still far from ideal for meeting the requirements
of WTO rules; and
</P>
<P>
-- The multilateral trade disputes settlement regime may
produce unfavorable conditions because China still needs to become
a full market economy and be familiar with the WTO.
</P>
<P>
The article stressed that in the long term, China will gain
more from its entry into the WTO, although from in the short term,
it will encounter numerous challenges.

On behalf of the entire Cambodian people, Sihanouk extended

<HEADLINE> Clampdown on Escorts and Prostitutes At Entertainment Venues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Excessive development and cut-
throat competition in China's entertainment industry have turned
some of the venues into sex businesses, a senior official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering a report on China's entertainment locales such as
dance halls and Kara OK clubs to the 14th meeting of the Standing
Committee of the National People's Congress, Minister of Culture
Sun Jiazheng said there are more than 3,000 ballrooms in the city
of Taiyuan in north China's Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
"Even in the west, you won't find as many places as these in
China," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Sun said that too many entertainment venues have attracted all
kinds of pernicious influences. Proprietors have lured customers
with escorts or as they are commonly called in Chinese "three
accompanied ladies", because they accompany clients while singing,
dancing and drinking.
</P>
<P>
The rise of these escorts coincides with the development of
Kara OK bars. However, these escorts were soon dining with clients
and providing a "coffee companion" while swimming and bathing,
taking a sauna or having a massage. Some ballrooms have becomes
dens of prostitution, Sun added. "A number of local government
departments take part in and encourage these illegal activities."
</P>
<P>
Sun promised that his Ministry will support and cooperate with
the public security department to crack down on prostitution and
other unhealthy tendencies at ballrooms and other entertainment
venues across the country.

Paper on the issue of Taiwan, voicing their support for the "one

</P>
<P>
About 100 representatives from the municipal committee of the

Self-Government League and others attended the forum.
</P>
<P>
They held that the document was both timely and of great

</P>
<P>
The one-China principle forms the foundation of the Chinese
government's policy toward Taiwan and is the basis of the peaceful
reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
It also marks a new beginning in the relaxation and development
of cross-Straits relations and is the guarantee for the
fundamental interests of the Taiwan compatriots, they said.
</P>
<P>
The White Paper exposed and criticized the splittist attempts
of Lee Teng-hui of Taiwan, and will help the Taiwan compatriots
see through the lies of the island's separatist forces and make
the wise decision on the future cross-Straits relations, they
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities should set greater store by the national
interests and the happiness of the Taiwan compatriots, return to
the one-China stand, not interfere with world peace and
development, and ultimately be condemned by history, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Not Involved in Separatist Movement in  Indonesia, Says Kissinger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States has never
been involved in the separatist movement in the Indonesian
province of Irian Jaya, former U.S. secretary of state Henry
Kissinger said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. has never given its support to parties who want to
separate from Indonesia," visiting Kissinger told the House of
Representatives' defense commission here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Irian Jaya, with a population of 2 million, has been demanding
for independence from Indonesia. Clamors for independence have
been mounting in the territory, especially as growing accusations
of human rights abuses grow.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said personally, he wants to see a strong and united
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"If a province separates (from Indonesia), it will be followed
by the others," he was quoted as saying by chairman of the House's
commission Yasril Ananta Baharuddin.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger said the experience of Yugoslavia and the former USSR
(Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) also began from sporadic
separatist movements such as what Indonesia has been facing.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, who is also a commissioner of the giant mining
company PT Freeport Indonesia, also gave assurances that the
company will not interfere in Indonesia's domestic affairs,
including in Irian Jaya, the base of Freeport's mining operations.
</P>
<P>
If such an interference occurs, Kissinger vowed to resign from
the company.
</P>
<P>
Besides meeting with the House leaders, Kissinger who arrived
here on Saturday on a three days visit, also met with President
Abdurrahman Wahid and Vice President Megawati Soekarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
The president asked Kissinger to be his adviser on general
affairs, Foreign Affairs Minister Alwi Shihad told reporters after
accompanying Kissinger in a meeting with Wahid on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kissinger, in response, expressed his readiness, saying he
wanted to help Indonesia.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam Refuses U.S. Human Rights Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam has refuted the recent U.
S. human rights report, saying that by releasing this report, U.S.
was in fact interfering in the domestic affairs of Vietnam and
other countries.
</P>
<P>
Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister Nguyen Tam Chien made the
remarks at a conference here Monday in response to the U.S. State
Department human rights report of the year 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chien said that Vietnam refuses the U.S. human rights report.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam, he said, holds that the U.S. human rights report was
interfering in the domestic affairs of Vietnam and other countries
and did not conform to the international practices.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnamese Deputy Foreign Minister urged that the United
States should concern itself about its own human rights situation.
</P>
<P>
Chien affirmed that the situation on Vietnam's human rights
described in the U.S. State Department human rights report was not
correct and that the report was harmful to the development of the
relations between the United States and Vietnam, as well as other
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chien said that Vietnam has been sparing no efforts to
protecting the human rights in the country, namely freedom of
press, speech and religious belief.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Appeal Court Hearing Anwar's Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Anwar's leading defence counsel Raja Aziz Addruse told the
Court of Appeal Monday that the four corruption charges against
Anwar that led to his six-year jail sentence did not exist.
</P>
<P>
He said Section 2(1) of the Emergency (Essential Powers)
Ordinance No 22 of 1970 under which Anwar was charged was annulled
by Parliament on October 22, 1998 and retrospectively effective
from January 8, 1998, making the charges non-existent.
</P>
<P>
The defence counsel said the court had the discretion to quash
the conviction and sentence as the prosecution's action in framing
the charges against Anwar under the ordinance amounted to an abuse
of the court process.
</P>
<P>
Court of Appeal President Lamin Yunus was sitting with Justices
Ahmad Fairuz Sheikh Abdul Halim and Mokhtar Sidin to hear Anwar's
appeal.
</P>
<P>
Anwar, 52, who was sacked in September 1998, were sentenced on
April 14 to six-years' jail on each of four charges of corrupt
practices with the sentences to run concurrently from that day,
when Justice S. Augustine Paul found Anwar guilty of interfering
in police investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct
against him.
</P>
<P>
Anwar filed on May 22 last year his petition of appeal, listing
29 grounds, including calling the six-year jail sentence
manifestly excessive.
</P>
<P>
Anwar is now on trial for allegedly sodomizing his wife's
former driver Azizan Abu Bakar.

</P>
<P>
The report said that 7,608 children, under the age of five, died
of diarrhea, pneumonia, respiratory infections and malnutrition,
while 7,999 over five and elderly people died of hypertension,
diabetes and malignant neoplasms.
</P>
<P>
This has brought to the total number of mortality to 1,280,554,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that such a high mortality was a direct result
of malnutrition and medical shortage caused by the decade-long
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called for the U.N. to lift the trade
embargo, and has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal by deliberately blocking the approval of its
contracts for purchasing humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak accused
Washington and London of blocking 15 medical contracts Iraq signed
with foreign companies last month under the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
The minister condemned the conduct as " a war of genocide
against the entire population of Iraq and all peace-loving
nations."
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell limited
amount of oil and use part of the revenues, under U.N. supervision,
to buy humanitarian supplies for its people.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Ross Meeting Ends Without Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A meeting between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross
Monday aimed at reviving the stalled Palestinian-Israeli talks
reached no fruition.
</P>
<P>
Ross said after the two-hour meeting in Arafat's office in Gaza
that he will go back to Washington Monday evening to report the
situation in the region to U.S. President Bill Clinton and
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian side reiterated in the talks that Israel
immediately implements the third-stage troops withdrawal from the
West Bank mandated in a September interim peace deal, Israel must
promise to consult with the Palestinians for further troops
pullback from the West Bank and it should respect the September 20
deadline for a permanent peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last week to try to give the sluggish
Mideast peace process a push. But he has achieved no tangible
results in his week-long diplomatic shuttle.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli peace talks stalled three weeks ago
following an unsuccessful summit between Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak. The two leaders failed to iron out their
differences over a delayed transfer to the Palestinian rule of the
West Bank land.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator in the final status talks Yasser
Abed Rabbo said Monday all the proposals they have received from
Israel are not acceptable and they were not in line with signed
agreements between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Barak of wasting time and harboring an attempt
of freezing the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Israel Sunday offered a compromise through Ross over the land
transfer. Under the proposal Israel is allowing the Palestinians to
choose the 6.1 percent due to be transferred out of a 10 percent
area laid out by Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side said the latest offer did not include
the land near Jerusalem as the Palestinian side demanded.
</P>
<P>
On a parallel track, the Palestinians and Israel are negotiating
solutions to some thorniest issues such as the fate of Jerusalem,
the future of Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and borders.
But no tangible progress has been made so far and the two sides
have missed the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement,
which is scheduled to precede a permanent peace deal in September.

CANBERRA, February 8 (Xinhua) --The Australian dollar fell to a
new 13-month low Monday and ended almost a third of a US cent down
from 61.73 at the close of trade Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the balance on
goods and services (BOGS) was a deficit of 830.27 million U.S.
dollars in January. The trade deficit figure was seen as worse-
than-expected and sent bond prices lower on market fears that the
Reserve Bank of Australia might have another reason to raise
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was at 0.6410 euro from 0.6225 at the
close Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S., OAU Official in Eritrea for mediation talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) - U.S. special envoy Anthony Lake
and special envoy for the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Ahmed Ouyahia were in Asmara Monday to mediate between Eritrea and
Ethiopia, countries at war with each other for 22 months, a report
from the Eritrean capital said.
</P>
<P>
The mediators were thought to be explaining Ethiopia's demands
for proposed amendments to elements of a peace plan drawn up by
the OAU, diplomats in Asmara said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU had previously said the peace plan could not be
changed, and nothing has been said about the talks.
</P>
<P>
Asmara has signed the three-part peace plan while Addis Ababa
has said the third section, concerning the "Technical Arrangements,
" is "unsatisfactory" because it does not ensure the return of
disputed territories to the status in place before the war began
in May 1998.
</P>
<P>
"The OAU had said they would not even change a comma. If they
change their opinion now, we shall see," Yemane Ghebremeskel,
spokesman for the Eritrean president's office, was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, no fighting has been reported between the
warring countries since last Wednesday's dawn attack on the Burie
front. Each accused the other of starting the battle, which broke
an eight-month lull in fighting.
</P>
<P>
Since the war broke out in 1998, tens of thousands of soldiers
have been killed and hundreds of thousands of civilians displaced
along the 1,000-kilometer border.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Official Pessimistic About Breakthrough In Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GAZA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian senior official
Monday expressed pessimism about the talks between Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. Mideast peace envoy Dennis Ross,
saying they can not break the impasse in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Arafat-Ross meeting is going on in Arafat's office in Gaza,
aimed at revive the Palestinian-Israeli peace talks that have been
stalled for three weeks.
</P>
<P>
Just minutes before the meeting, Palestinian chief negotiator in
the final status talks Yasser Abed Rabbo said "I do not think that
we will witness today or tomorrow such a breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
The sticking point is that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak do
not want to unfreeze the deadlocked Palestinian-Israeli peace
talks, which hit a snag on further West Bank land transfer.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians rejected maps on lands that should have been
handed over to the Palestinian rule on January 20 on the grounds
that Israel failed to consult them before deciding the maps.
</P>
<P>
Rabbo added that all the proposals they have received are not
acceptable and they were not in line with signed agreements between
the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He also accused Barak of wasting time because he actually wants
to freeze the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Israel Sunday offered a compromise through Ross over the long-
delayed land transfer. Under the proposal Israel is allowing the
Palestinians to choose the 6.1 percent due to be transferred out of
a 10 percent area laid out by Barak's government.
</P>
<P>
But the Palestinian side said the latest offer did not include
the land near Jerusalem as the Palestinian side demanded.
</P>
<P>
On a parallel track, the Palestinians and Israel are negotiating
solutions to some thorniest issues such as the fate of Jerusalem,
the future of Jewish settlements, Palestinian refugees and borders.
But no tangible progress has been made so far and the two sides
have missed the February 13 deadline for a framework agreement,
which is scheduled to precede a permanent peace deal in September.
</P>
<P>
Ross arrived in the region last week to try to give a push to
the sluggish Mideast peace process, but he who is scheduled to
return home Monday evening has failed to secure a revival of the
peace drive so far.

<P>
"Indonesia's economic growth has shown progress," Horiguchi
told reporters after meeting with President Abdurrahman Wahid here
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia has introduced appropriate policies in its effort to
get out of the crisis, he said, adding that the country's economic
growth will reach 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Horiguchi has just replaced Hubert Neiss who has retired from
the Washington-based financial organization.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand, South Korea, the Philippines and Malaysia,
which had also been hard hit by the Asian financial crisis, have
also begun recovering from the economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
According to Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and
Industry Kwik Kian Gie, Horiguchi and a visiting IMF's team will
talk further about the latest agreement which Indonesia and the
IMF reached last month.
</P>
<P>
The team has submitted its report to IMF Deputy Managing
Director Stanley Fischer, but Kwik Kian Gie said he does not know
the amount of the loan the IMF would release to Indonesia in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia and IMF have signed several agreements on Indonesia's
economic situation and the fund's aid package to the country since
the start of the Asian monetary crisis in mid 1997. IMF had
offered a 43 billion U.S. dollars loan to Indonesia to help
overcome economic crisis in the country.

reformist, has backed the suspension of General Wiranto from his
position as Coordinating Minister for Political and Security
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The Kostrad's task, the spokesman said, is to launch strategic
operations necessary in maintaining peace in the country, thus it
has to continue practicing, whether or not there is a threat.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Diplomat Calls for Actions to Stop U.S. Senate Passing TSEA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Consul-General in
Los Angeles An Wenbin Sunday called for actions to dissuade the U.
S. Senate from passing the Taiwan Security Enhancement Act (TSEA).
</P>
<P>
"The TSEA threatens to destroy the very basis of Sino-U.S.
relations which six U.S. administrations, both Democrat and
Republican, have worked long and hard to build," said An at the
symposium "U.S.-China Relations at the Crossroads".
</P>
<P>
He said the TSEA, passed by U.S. House of Representatives last
month despite China's strong opposition, will pose a severe threat
to China's security and increase the chances of military
confrontation across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, hosted by the Center for Chinese Studies at the
University of California at Los Angeles, was attended by more than
300 scholars and students including former deputy chief of U.S.
mission in Beijing, Chas. W. Freeman and former minister-
counsellor of Chinese mission in U.S., Ji Chaozhu.
</P>
<P>
An said both relations between China and the United States and
relations across the Taiwan Straits are at a critical juncture. "
Words and actions by the United States on the Taiwan issue have a
direct impact on the development of China-U.S. relations as well
as on peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits and the Asia
Pacific region."
</P>
<P>
U.S. government leaders have, on many occasions, reaffirmed
continued U.S. commitments on the Taiwan issue. They include the "
one China policy," adherence to the three China-U.S. Joint
Communiques, and the pledge to render no support to the
independence of Taiwan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, however, the U.S. side has more than once
taken actions to embolden the separatist forces on the Taiwan
island and set stumbling-blocks on the road of China's
reunification.
</P>
<P>
An believed the formula of "peaceful reunification" based on "
one country, two systems," and the recently published white paper -
- The One-China Principle and the Taiwan Issue -- are consistent
policy and concrete plans of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
"At their very heart is the principle of One China," he pointed
out, saying that is the basis and premise of peaceful
reunification.
</P>
<P>
An also urged the United States to work with China to build a
peaceful, stable and prosperous world in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Being the largest developing country and developed country,
according to An, China and the United States share not only a
responsibility in maintaining peace and stability in Asia-Pacific
and the rest of the world, but also in promoting global economic
prosperity, improving global environment and other important
issues.
</P>
<P>
An called the "China threat theory", spread first in Japan and
later in the United States, "cold war thinking in today's context,
" pointing to the fact that China has never occupied a single inch
of foreign soil, nor has it stationed a single soldier abroad.
</P>
<P>
What China desires most, An stressed, is a peaceful
international environment, so that it can focus on economic
development and improve the life of its 1.2 billion people.

ministers on mergers, as the first step in reforms to transform
the operation of competition policy.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, State Administration for Entry-
Exit Inspection (SAIQ) and General Administration of Customs have
jointly issued a circular calling for concerted efforts to tighten
the inspection of small household electrical appliances for export.
</P>
<P>
Exports of the small electrical appliances are found in markets
around the world and have increased on an year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
Accidents caused by electrical household appliances such as
dish washers, vacuum cleaners, blenders, juice extractors and
automatic shavers have seriously damaged the credibility of
Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
Customs bureaus will strictly follow inspection procedures set
out by the SAIQ. Only products that have been officially endorsed
by the SAIQ will be exported, according to the circular.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Energy Development for 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China is striving to improve
its energy reserve development to meet energy resources demands in
the new century, so as to guarantee a sustainable economic
development.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Energy Research Society, China will
launch a series of drives in the 21st century. For example, China'
s coal production will shift westward and greater efforts will be
made to expand the Shenfu and Dongsheng coalfields and ease coal
transportation.
</P>
<P>
China will accelerate the development of hydroelectric power at
different gradient steps of river valleys and thermal power
stations at the head of coal mines.
</P>
<P>
In the petroleum industry, prominence will be given to oil and
gas exploitation in the western part of China as well as in the
country's offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
These projects are aimed to develop energy supply bases across
the country. Shanxi, Shaanxi, Heilongjiang and Guizhou provinces
and the western part of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region will
become major coal suppliers. The Daqing and Shengli oifields as
well as the oilfields in the western part of China will continue
to be the mainstay of the country's oil resources.
</P>
<P>
According to experts from the China Energy Research Institute,
the upper, middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River will
become bases for supplying hydropower nationwide.

<P>
Along with the development of conventional energy resources,
China will also develop geothermal, wind, solar and tidal energy
to optimize the structure of energy consumption.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that China will achieve a balance between supply
and demand for energy resources. The current net export volume of
30 million tons of coal will be further developed. The net import
of oil, however, will show no marked increase.
</P>
<P>
The total consumption of China's unrenewable energy resources
will be the equivalent of 1.38 billion tons of coal by next year.
The country's annual oil and gas production will top 150 million
tons and 25 billion cu m. Major power grids will be interconnected
across China to increase power supplies.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, experts expect significant nuclear power development
in China in the new century. By the year 2010, China's nuclear
power generating capacity will reach 20 million kilowatts. By 2020,
its generating capacity should reach 40 million kilowatts,
Production of nuclear power should increase to five percent from
the existing one percent.

<HEADLINE> China's Economy Expects To Grow Faster Than Last Year (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese economy is
expected to grow faster this year than last year figure of 7.1
percent, Liu Hong, director of the National Bureau of Statistics,
said here today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference held by the Information Office of the
State Council, Liu noted that China's GDP grew 7.1 percent to
reach 8.2054 trillion yuan (988.6 billion US dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Investment contributed two percent to China's GDP, while
domestic consumer demand was 5.5 percent. Overseas demand was
minus 0.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's fixed-asset investment grew 5.2 percent from
1998 to reach 2,987.6 billion yuan last year, much lower than
expected. But Liu further noted that thanks to successful state
policies in expanding both domestic investment and consumer demand,
the country still achieved its overall economic target for 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique released today by the National Bureau
of Statistics, China's grain output dropped by 0.8 percent, or 3.
97 million tons, to 508 million tons in 1999. Industry output
increased by 3.5357 trillion yuan, an increase of 8.5 percent,
while import and export volume amounted to 360.7 billion yuan, or
a rise of 11.3 percent. Imports and exports generated a trade
surplus of 29.1 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the country's foreign exchange reserve hit 154.7
billion US dollars by the end of 1999.

<P>
As the global economy and international trade on speedy rise,
Liu said, China's export volume is also expected to grow steadily
this year.
</P>
<P>
China's retail sales rose by 6.8 percent to reach 3.1135
trillion yuan (375.1 billion US dollars) in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The central government will accelerate state-owned enterprise
reform, he said. And the production and profit situation of the
state-owned enterprises is expected to be better still this year.
</P>
<P>
Acknowledging that the state-owned enterprise profits reported
a 77.7 percents increase, whereas the losses were reduced by 15.9
percents in 1999, Liu said that by the end of the year, there were
a total of 6.5 million laid-off workers from the state-owned
enterprises in China and that the ratio of the unemployed
registered in cities and towns was 3.1 percent. Moreover, Liu
added, additional 5 million workers would possibly be laid-off
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, Liu noted, developing China's western regions will
also greatly add to the confidence and zeal of the investors.

<HEADLINE> WTO Entry: Double-edged Sword for Traditional Chinese Medicine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- China's entry into World Trade
Organization (WTO) may be a double-edged sword for its traditional
medicine industry, market analysts said today.
</P>
<P>
The industry will have more opportunities to increase exports
due to the growing demand for natural medicines in the
international market. And it will also undoubtedly be challenged
by imported products of a higher quality.
</P>
<P>
"But the situation of traditional Chinese medicine is much
better because almost all products are self-developed," says
analyst Zhou Zhikuan. "WTO entry won't impose much negative
impacts on the industry."
</P>
<P>
Zhou is also confident that traditional Chinese medicine will
find a niche on the international market as natural therapies and
medicines have become popular around the world.
</P>
<P>
China produces about more than 8,000 kinds of traditional
medicinal and is the world's largest producer and consumer.
</P>
<P>
Because of enormous money is involved in developing new
chemical drugs, pharmaceutical companies are paying more attention
to traditional and natural medicines, Zhou said, stressing that
this means a good development for the development of domestic
producers of traditional Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
However, problems still exist concerning quality, packaging and
marketing strategies. High-quality overseas traditional medicines
will also occupy the domestic market and make competition fiercer
as China's WTO entry will widen market accessibility, Zhou said.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has offered Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat a compromise regarding the delayed West Bank
withdrawal, by offering blocks of land amounting to 10 percent of
the areas to be returned, out of which the Palestinians would
choose 6.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The compromise was relayed by U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross,
who is tentatively scheduled to leave the region Monday evening
after a week of shuttle diplomacy aimed at getting talks with the
Palestinians back on track.
</P>
<P>
There were rumors in Gaza that Palestinians negotiator Saeb
Erekat and Gaza Preventive Security Service chief Mohammed Dahlan
met with an envoy from Barak and Ross to try and break the
deadlock, prior to a meeting between Ross and Arafat Monday.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The journals of the executed Nazi War criminal Adolph
Eichmann, which he wrote in an Israeli prison at the beginning of
the 1960s, are being made public.
</P>
<P>
The state archives will transfer copies of the journals to the
representative for Professor Deborah Lipstadt in London, which will
help Libstadt's defense in her trial for defaming a Holocaust
denier.
</P>
<P>
The charges were brought against her by historian David Irving,
who claims that Lipstadt and her publisher, Penguin Books, have
caused considerable harm to his reputation and finances by labeling
him a "dangerous spokesman in the service of Holocaust deniers".
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and Israel have begun to draft a strategic
agreement that stops short of a full-fledged defense treaty and
would accompany a peace deal with Syria, Deputy Defense Minister
Ephraim Sneh said Sunday during his visit to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Sneh told reporters that there are some drafts of future MOA
(memoranda of agreement) or MOU (memoranda of understanding), not
exactly a defense treaty as some media reports had speculated.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel's negotiations with the U.S. are still at a
preliminary stage, but that Israel's wish list had already been
fleshed out.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The prime ministers who preceded Barak held talks with Syria
on the basis of a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights to
the line of June 4, 1967, Barak told the cabinet Sunday at its
weekly meeting.
</P>

<HEADLINE> 61 Agricultural Contracts Blocked by U.S., Britain: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Minister of Agriculture
Abdul Ellah Hameed accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking 61
agricultural contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries under the
oil-for-food program, the official newspaper Al-Jumhuriya reported
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to Al-Jumhuriya, the minister said the U.S. and
British delegates at the U.N. Sanctions Committee premeditated to
place obstacles to cripple the implementation of the contracts
under fragile pretexts, aiming to inflict more damage and harm on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Washington and London put on hold very
necessary contracts for the agricultural sector, representing a war
of mass murder against the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has long accused the U.S. and Britain of impeding the
implementation of the oil-for-food deal by deliberately blocking
the approval of its contracts for purchasing humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to sell limited amount of oil and use the revenue, under U.
N. supervision, to buy humanitarian goods for its people, who have
been under sanctions ever since Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by Iraq's health ministry
recently, as many as 1.27 million people, mostly children and the
elderly, have died as a direct result of malnutrition and medical
shortages caused by the decade-long sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Following are the highlights
of major foreign trade-related news in China in the past week (
February 21-27):
</P>
<P>
China's Efforts for WTO Entry
</P>
<P>
-- China's Chief Negotiator Long Yongtu said here last Thursday
following the conclusion of the latest round of China-EU talks on
China's entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) that China
and the EU have "come very close" in their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
-- China and India signed a bilateral agreement on China's
entry into the WTO here last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
-- State Councilor Wu Yi expressed her gratitude to India for
its support to China's bid to enter the WTO when meeting last
Tuesday with Indian Minister of Commerce and Industry Murasoli
Maran.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral Trade Relations
</P>
<P>
-- China last Tuesday urged the United States to grant it the
normal trading relations (NTR) status, saying that it is the basis
of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
China believes the U.S. government should grant China such a
status "completely and unconditionally," and should not attach any
conditions.
</P>
<P>
-- Chinese Minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation
Shi Guangsheng last Monday expressed confidence in the potential
of Sino-Indian bilateral trade, saying that bilateral trade volume
can double with efforts from both sides.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade volume stood at two billion U.S. dollars last
year.

<P>
-- Trade between China and Japan has undergone noticeable
changes in recent years as total trade volume between the two East
Asian countries rose 16 percent in 1999 to reach 66.2 billion U.S.
dollars. A major factor leading to the increase is that China's
exports to Japan are no longer restricted to raw materials and
primary products.
</P>
<P>
-- The two-way trade between China and Japan is expected to
continue its growth this year to reach 70 billion U.S. dollars
from 66.17 billion U.S. dollars in 1999, according to trade expert
Xu Changwen.
</P>
<P>
-- China hopes that the International Monetary Fund will choose
its new managing director as soon as possible to replace the

<HEADLINE> Malawian President Dismisses His Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi dismissed his nine-month-old cabinet in a surprise move
Sunday, according to information from Blantyre on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Until a new cabinet is named, all ministerial affairs shall be
handled by the President's Office, the State House was quoted as
saying in a terse statement.
</P>
<P>
However, it gave no details about the dismissal. The
announcement of a new cabinet is tentatively set for mid this
week.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute Muluzi's surprise move to the pressure from
donors and his ruling United Democratic Front party, following
rampant reports of grand corruption in high places.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Corruption Bureau was reportedly probing into the role
Finance Minister Cassim Chilumpha played in the suspicious
awarding of a pre- shipment contract to a British firm, Intertek
Testing Services, instead of the Swiss Societe Generalle de
Surveillance (SGS) as recommended by an assessment committee.
</P>
<P>
Pre-shipment agents are used by government, especially from
developing countries, to prevent capital flight and customs duty
evasion by businesses.
</P>
<P>
SGS is said to be the world's largest pre-shipment agent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the president had to compromise as an
emergency cabinet meeting Thursday turned acrimonious.
</P>
<P>
One camp advised the president that his retention of Chilumpha
in the cabinet did not augur well with his promise not to shield
any of his ministers caught in corruption, while the other said
that citizens should be content with Chilumpha's denial of any
wrong-doing in the pre-shipment affair.
</P>
<P>
Chilumpha, still reeling from negative publicity after he
awarded a crucial state contract to a British company, has denied
receiving any kickbacks from the British company.

NAIROBI, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi dismissed his nine-month-old cabinet in a surprise move
Sunday, according to information from Blantyre on Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Until a new cabinet is named, all ministerial affairs shall be
handled by the President's Office, the State House was quoted as
saying in a terse statement.
</P>
<P>
However, it gave no details about the dismissal. The
announcement of a new cabinet is tentatively set for mid this
week.
</P>
<P>
Observers attribute Muluzi's surprise move to the pressure from
donors and his ruling United Democratic Front party, following
rampant reports of grand corruption in high places.
</P>
<P>
The Anti-Corruption Bureau was reportedly probing into the role
Finance Minister Cassim Chilumpha played in the suspicious
awarding of a pre- shipment contract to a British firm, Intertek
Testing Services, instead of the Swiss Societe Generalle de
Surveillance (SGS) as recommended by an assessment committee.
</P>
<P>
Pre-shipment agents are used by government, especially from
developing countries, to prevent capital flight and customs duty
evasion by businesses.
</P>
<P>
SGS is said to be the world's largest pre-shipment agent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the president had to compromise as an
emergency cabinet meeting Thursday turned acrimonious.
</P>
<P>
One camp advised the president that his retention of Chilumpha
in the cabinet did not augur well with his promise not to shield
any of his ministers caught in corruption, while the other said
that citizens should be content with Chilumpha's denial of any
wrong-doing in the pre-shipment affair.
</P>
<P>
Chilumpha, still reeling from negative publicity after he
awarded a crucial state contract to a British company, has denied
receiving any kickbacks from the British company.

<HEADLINE> China's Retail Sales Up 6.8 Percent in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Boosted by the government's
macro-economic policies to stimulate domestic consumption, China's
market sales grew steadily in 1999, with retail sales hitting 3.
1135 trillion yuan, or an increase of 6.8 percent, over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
According to the annual economic and cultural communique
released by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) today, retail
sales actually grew by 10.1 percent in real terms if declining
retail price index (RPI) is taken into consideration.
</P>
<P>
The communique attributes the steady growth to increase in
incomes of urban and rural residents, expansion of credit loans,
interest rates cuts and abolishment of consumption restrictions.
</P>
<P>
Urban retail sales climbed up 7.1 percent to reach 1.9092
trillion yuan, while that of the rural areas rose 6.3 percent to
1.2043 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The food and beverage sector reported the fastest growth of 13.
6 percent, and whole sales and retail sales trade grew 7.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The domestic sales of basic means of production, such as cement,
building materials, rose 7.8 percent to reach 939.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
However, the economic returns of major retail and wholesale
enterprises were still on the fall, with the total net sales
revenue of the country's 1,300 key enterprises edged up only by
only one percent to reach 335.6 billion yuan and the total net
profit dropping 40 percent to stand at 1.2 billion yuan.

more alcohol, but few cigarettes last year.

The Figures recently released by Statistics New Zealand showed
the volume of alcoholic beverage available for consumption in 1999
was two percent higher than in 1998.
</P>
<P>
This is the second year of increase following three years of
decline. Industry reports attributed the rise in 1999 to the
country's changes in the liquor laws, celebrations associated with
the new millennium and the America's Cup yachting event.
</P>
<P>
According to the government statistical department, the number
of cigarettes made available for consumption fell 4.4 percent to 3,
119 million in 1999, compared with the previous year.

The availability of cigarettes for consumption in New Zealand
is now at its lowest level since the series began in 1973.

percent during the same period.

<HEADLINE> EU to Shift Aid to Bangladesh from Food to Cash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
will increase cash flow instead of food assistance in financing
development-oriented food security projects in Bangladesh,
Ambassador of the EC delegation in Bangladesh was quoted Monday by
newspapers here as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The new European Union food aid strategy which has shifted the
emphasis on the cash from food will provide greater flexibility in
the choice for Bangladesh and eventually be more beneficial to
poverty alleviation of the country," said Ambassador of the EC
delegation Antonio de Souza Menezes.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the policy, Ambassador Menezes said that the new
policy will give support to programs aiming at an improved and
sustainable food production and to projects that will ensure
increase in level of income for the poorest and the most
vulnerable as well.
</P>
<P>
Menezes attributed the policy shift to comparative advantage of
cash-based program in creating investment and its higher cost-
effectiveness. The cooperation strategy which is adopted by the EC
in Bangladesh will now focus on development-oriented activities,
Menezes added.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Names Enzo Trossero as Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The Swiss Soccer Federation (
ASF) appointed Argentina's Enzo Trossero as coach of the national
team on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Trossero, who guided Sion to the Swiss championship in 1992, is
expected to sign a contract with the Swiss federation in the next
few days. He will take over the post after completing his current
contract with Independitente of Buenos Aires.
</P>
<P>
The predecessor Gilbert Gress left on July 1 after he failed to
reach consensus on a new contract with the ASF.
</P>
<P>
The ASF had conducted an exhaustive search for a replacement.
</P>
<P>
Grasshoppers coach Roy Hodgson, who guided Switzerland to the
1994 World Cup finals and former Tottenham Hotspur manager
Christian Gross, now back in Switzerland coaching Basle, were
rumoured to be among the leading candidates for the position. Both
flatly turned down the job.
</P>
<P>
The 47-year-old Trossero becomes the fifth coach in five years
to manage the Swiss, who failed to qualify for either the 1998
World Cup or Euro 2000 championships, their FIFA world ranking
plunging to 51st.

<HEADLINE> Rafter Makes Comeback after Six-month Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Two-time US Open champion
Patrick Rafter ends his six-month layoff as he makes a long-
awaited return to ATP action as the top seed at Delray Beach,
Florida.
</P>
<P>
The event opens Monday on a new hardcourt surface rather than
its former clay base, but the city has happy memories for
Australians, who have won the past five titles here.
</P>
<P>
Rafter ranked number one in the world for a week last summer
before a shoulder injury required surgery and lengthy
rehabilitation. He last played singles in the first round of the
US Open in late August.
</P>
<P>
Quitting in pain against Frenchman Cedric Pioline at the start
of the fifth set, Rafter spent months trying to get fit before
submitting to surgery in October.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old made a tentative comeback in Sydney last month,
reaching the semi-finals in doubles with Davis Cup teammate Wayne
Arthurs.
</P>
<P>
But in the interest of medical caution, Bermuda-based Rafter
delayed a return until now.

WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- American Monica Seles
defeated Nathalie Dechy of France in straight sets Sunday to greet
her return from a foot injury in the final of the 180,000 U.S.
dollars IGA SuperThrift Tennis Classic at Oklahoma City.
</P>
<P>
Seles, ranked No.14 in the world, took 75 minutes to claim a
victory 6-1, 7-6 (3) over Dechy who had not dropped a set before
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The win capped a week in which Seles didn't lose a set and was
broken just twice. Sunday's match was the only one of her four
that lasted more than an hour.
</P>
<P>
The number two seed had not played in a tournament since losing
the final of the Princess Cup in Tokyo to Lindsay Davenport in
late September. Since then, she has been recovering from a stress
fracture in her right foot.
</P>
<P>
Dechy, seeded No. 5 and ranked 26th worldwide, lost all three
of her service games in the first set, which ended in just 24
minutes.
</P>
<P>
The two stayed on serve until the sixth game of the second set,
when Dechy broke Seles to take a 4-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
Trailing 3-5, Seles broke Dechy at love to get the set back on
serve. She took control of the tie-breaker by winning the first
three games and eased to the victory.

Seles was a late replacement for two-time defending champion
Venus Williams, who withdrew due to injury.

WASHINGTON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Canada scored a stunning 2-
0 victory over Colombia Sunday in the final to cap an unlikely
title run through the 12-team Gold Cup at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
Canada played two draws in round-robin play, advancing only by
winning a coin flip over South Korea. Then Canada stunned three-
time Cup champion Mexico and blanked Trinidad and Tobago on a
golden goal to reach the final.
</P>
<P>
Canadian captain Jason DeVos headed home a goal during first-
half injury time before Carlo Corazzin added a second-half penalty
kick.
</P>
<P>
Colombia had its own chances as they slid a dangerous ball
across the front of the Canadian goal in the 80th minute but no
one was in place to tap it home.
</P>
<P>
The South Americans' final chance came on a penalty kick in the
85th minute, but Canada goalkeeper Craig Forrest dived to his
right and grabbed the shot to deny Colombia's Faustino Asprilla.
</P>
<P>
Canada, which entered the event with a 85th ranking in the
world, lost their only prior match with Colombia 3-0 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
The Canadians achieved their best-ever showing in international
play, surpassing their 1984 Olympic quarter-final effort. Canada
went goal-less and winless at the 1986 World Cup.

<P>
LONDON, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Two goals from Scottish
international defender Matt Elliott gave Leicester City a 2-1 win
over 10-man Tranmere Rovers of the first division in the League
Cup final on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Elliott headed a Steve Guppy corner in the 29th minute and
Leicester appeared to be cruising for a 1-0 victory after Tranmere
midfielder Clint Hill was sent off in the 64th minute for a foul
on Emile Heskey.
</P>
<P>
The dismissal, however, spurred the Merseysiders into renewed
efforts and 35-year-old David Kelly equalised in the 78th minute,
only for Leicester to regain the lead three minutes later with a
near carbon-copy of their first goal.

<HEADLINE> Swede Wins Women's High Jump With Personal Best  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENT, Belgium, February 27 (Xinhua) -- Erica Johansson hit a 6.
89-meter long jump on her first outing on Sunday to win the women'
s title at the European indoor athletic championships.
</P>
<P>
What was more for her was that her winning distance was just
three centimeters farther away than Heike Drechsler, the German
sprinter and long jumper 10 years her senior, who has been
dominating the long jump pit this season on the European circuit.
</P>
<P>
Drechsler also hit a good jump on her first outing with a 6.80
but fouled on her four later attempts. The 35-year-old German
veteran adjusted her approach run-up on her sixth and last outing
to pull off a 6.86 to secure the silver medal.
</P>
<P>
Iva Prandzheva of Bulgaria got the bronze with a clearance of 6.
80 meters.
</P>
<P>
Gabriela Szabo of Romania, the best woman athlete of 1999, won
her speciality of 3,000 meters with a clocking of eight minutes 42.
06 seconds.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian won most of the races she took part in last year
and she was selected as the best woman athlete of the year by the
European sportswriters union.
</P>
<P>
Pavla Hamackova of the Czech Republic won the women's pole vaul
event with a clearance of 4.40 meters. She then tried three times
at the height of 4.50 meters but failed.
</P>
<P>
Yelena Belyakova of Russia and Christine Adams of Germany
finished a dead-heat for the silver medal with an identical height
of 4.35 meters. The two pole vaulted exactly the same on theirree
men ended up at the same height only to have their medal positions
decided by their progressive performance. They all cleared 2.34
meters but Vyacheslav Voronin of Russia got the gold medal of the
men's high jump event with less failed attempt.
</P>
<P>
Martin Buss of Germany and Dragutin Topic from the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia got the silver and bronze medals
respectively all with the clearance of 2.34 meters.
</P>
<P>
Russia closed its grip over the indoor track and field events
as the country scooped up four more gold medals from Sunday's
competition. Russian athletes won the men's high jump, women's
4x400-meter relay, men's 800 meters and women's 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
Russia finished its championship appearance with six gold
medals in all.

<HEADLINE> Turkish, Greek Diplomats Meet on Ankara's EU Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Turkish and Greek diplomats in
the European Union (EU) Working Group met here Monday to discuss
Turkey's bid for EU membership, a new development that showcased a
political rapprochement between the two neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish delegation was led by deputy undersecretary of the
Foreign Ministry Uluc Ozulker while Greek Foreign Ministry
Secretary-General Stelios Perrakis headed the Greek delegation,
reported the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Eight Greek ambassadors, including ambassador to Ankara Lonnis
Corantis, participated in the EU Working Group. The decision to
found the group was made during Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreu's visit to Turkey last month.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that Greek diplomats conveyed their experience
of relations with the EU to their Turkish counterparts. In this way
Greece, which became a full member of the European club in 1981,
may lend a hand to Turkey, a country that was named a candidate for
membership at EU's Helsinki summit last December, in its effort to
reorganize its state structures along EU lines.
</P>
<P>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs announced that
a second five-member U.N. Disaster Assessment Coordination Team
was deployed this morning and is scheduled to arrive in Maputo,
capital of Mozambique, Tuesday in what came as the strengthened U.
N. efforts to assist the African country to fight against floods,
the worst in 30 years, a U.N. spokesman said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, the U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that
the U.N. team will assist with the coordination of national and
international response.
</P>
<P>
Also Monday, the World Food Program released 2 million U.S.
dollars to support the rescue operation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has asked Ross
Mountain, the assistant emergency relief coordinator, to travel
immediately to Mozambique to serve as his special humanitarian
envoy to the country. He also authorized the release of resources
from the Central Emergency Revolving Fund to reinforce the
continuing relief efforts being undertaken by U.N. agencies on the
ground, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations stepped up relief efforts as Mozambique
warned Monday that a wave of water moving down the swollen Limpopo
River threatened to engulf a new area as aid agencies hunted for
more helicopters to rescue victims form trees and roof tops.
</P>
<P>
At least 350 people have died, more than 650,000 have been

<HEADLINE> Britain in New Moves to Save Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Northern Ireland
Secretary Peter Mandelson Monday sought advice from the leader of
the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party over the
faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
It followed separate meetings between Mandelson and delegations
from the Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein which failed to
produce new proposals to resolve the impasse.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the SDLP confirmed that Mandelson spoke by
telephone to SDLP leader John Hume on Monday seeking advice on the
way forward.
</P>
<P>
The power-sharing executive set up in December was suspended
earlier this month due to the impasse over paramilitary weapons.
</P>
<P>
After meeting Mandelson earlier, former Sinn Fein health
minister Bairbre de Brun said he gave no indication if and when he
would restart the province's power-sharing institutions.
</P>
<P>
Following his meeting with Mandelson, Ulster Unionist leader
David Trimble said the only way to "cure" the suspension was for
the republican movement to deliver on the arms issue.
</P>
<P>
He also said suggestions by Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams that
republicans could secure a better deal in a new agreement were"
unhelpful
</P>
<P>
"What we are concentrating on is the implementation of the
agreement we have rather than a new one," he said.
</P>
<P>
He dismissed proposals for a round table meeting involving the
pro-agreement parties and weapons body chief, General de
Chastelain.
</P>
<P>
The talks came a day after Adams said the 1998 Good Friday
Agreement was now in tatters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking ahead of Monday's meeting on BBC Radio Ulster, Sinn
Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin warned a solution may never be
found to the current deadlock unless confidence is restored in the
political process.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to a special party conference in Dublin on Sunday,
Adams said the handling of what he called the "crisis issue" by
Mandelson had made it more difficult to secure a resolution in the
future.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, relatives of people killed and injured by security
forces mounted a protest at the talks venue in Stormont.
</P>
<P>
The group, relatives for Justice, launched a poster which
highlighted alleged human rights violations by the police and army.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Opposes EU Choice of German to Head IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Clinton administration
said on Monday it would not support the European Union's (EU)
candidate to head the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
pledged to work with Europe to find a strong European candidate
who is able to command broad support.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said
that Europe's candidate, German Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-
Weser, did not meet the criteria for a strong candidate of maximum
stature who would be able to command broad support from around the
world.
</P>
<P>
"The president (Bill Clinton) spoke to Chancellor (Gerhard)
Schroeder on Saturday on the telephone. In that call he stressed
the importance of the IMF managing director position and the need
for a strong candidate of maximum stature who would be able to
command broad support around the world," Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
"In that context, the president told Chancellor Schroeder that
the United States is not prepared to support the German candidate,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
The post of IMF managing director, which has traditionally gone
to a European, has been vacant since France's Michel Camdessus
stepped down ahead of schedule two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
Koch-Weser, a former World Bank official, had struggled for
months to win Europe's endorsement for the high-profile position,
amid serious doubts in France and Britain about whether a better
candidate might yet emerge.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. decision to oppose Koch-Weser came within hours of
European finance ministers endorsing his candidacy on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The European delays frustrated other IMF member states and
developing countries last week put up their own candidate, acting
IMF Managing Director Stanley Fischer, a naturalized American born
in what is now Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Japan separately nominated Eisuke Sakakibara, a former finance
ministry official known as "Mr. Yen" for his ability to move
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
But none of the three declared candidates has a realistic
chance of winning without support from the United States, which is
the IMF's largest shareholder with 18 percent of the votes.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said he did not know Washington would support any of
the candidates.
</P>
<P>
"Our objective remains to work with Europe to find a strong
European candidate who is able to command broad support, including
from the emerging market countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's board, responsible for making a decision, is due to
debate the vacant post on Tuesday.

<P>
MOSCOW, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Russian acting President
Vladimir Putin on Monday pledged to adopt state regulation on
economy and to achieve much political equality in the country if
he is elected Russian president in the March 26 elections.
</P>
<P>
State regulation is vital to national economy, and the state
will not be strong unless it regulates its economy, but state
regulation must not choke the market, Putin told a meeting of his
election campaign supporters in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Law and constitutional discipline must be binding on everybody,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whoever shares in the country's political and economic life
must have equal opportunities so that nobody who takes power from
the left or right could impose his own conditions," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the importance of the anti-corruption fight,
noting that it is aimed at creating a new image for the country.
Without this, normal investments will not be made in the Russian
economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is extremely important to create equal conditions for
everyone who takes part in our political life. We must rule out
cases of fastening onto power for selfish ends," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Chechen issue, he said the anti-terrorist campaign in the
rebel republic will be completed very soon, but its end will not
be related to the current presidential election campaign.
</P>
<P>
"I am certain we must bring this to an end for the sake of
Russia, for the sake of the Chechen people. If we fear terrorist
acts or consequences for your candidate, if we allow anybody to
blackmail us even for a moment, we will lose," Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He vowed to pursue the anti-terrorist operation to completion"
regardless of election campaigns."

ADDIS ABABA, February 28 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia is almost
self-sufficient in plastic products, Ethiopia News Agency reported
Monday.

<P>
Ninety percent of the plastic products available at the

<P>
"We will not comment tonight. It would be inappropriate to
comment until we know the full facts of the resignation," a
Reuters report quoted a Foreign Office spokesman as saying.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, when Haider's Freedom Party entered into
Austria's new coalition government, Britain has joined other
European Union members in condemning that move.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Party officials said in Vienna on Monday that
Haider had announced his resignation as head of the party and that
he would be replaced by Susanne Riess-Passer, vice-chancellor in
the new centre-right government that was sworn in on Feb. 4.
</P>
<P>
The Freedom Party is a coalition partner in Austria's new
government led by Chancellor Wolfgang Schuessel, which has faced a
barrage of international criticism since Haider's party was taken
on as coalition partner -- even though he is not in the new
cabinet himself.
</P>
<P>
Media reports in Vienna said that Haider would keep on playing a
role similar to that of a corporate "supervisory board" in the
party.

<HEADLINE> Dow Index Rebounds Above 10,000 On Wall Street </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The Dow Jones industrial
average rebounded above the psychological 10,000 mark on Wall
Street Monday after falling below the five digital milestone
Friday.
</P>
<P>
At the close of session, the index rose 176.53 or by 1.7
percent at 10,038.65. The blue chip index lost 230.51 at 9,862.12
in the previous session, falling below 10,000 for the first time
since last April.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were mixed. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index rose 14.69 at 1,348.05 but the technology heavy Nasdaq
composite index fell 12.65 at 4,577.85.
</P>
<P>
The Dow rallied as investors hunted bargains on the market
following last week's big selloff. The index dropped 357.38 points
or by 3.5 percent in the week on fears of higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan warned twice in the
past two weeks that more hikes in rates are possible if the robust
U.S. economy and hot stocks will not cool down quickly. The
Federal Reserve has raised rates four times since last June in
efforts to keep inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Investors put aside Greenspan's warnings today and took
advantage of the cheap prices available following the sharp
decline in financial services and retail stocks last week.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE index rose 7.78 at 584.20 and the American Stock
Exchange index rose 20.84 at 964.38. The Russell 2000 index of
smaller companies also rose 0.94 at 557.68.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with 1,496 up, 1,478 down and 523
unchanged.
</P>
<P>
NYSE volume declined to 1.022 billion shares from 1.955 billion
in the previous session.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Programme reports No New Oil Contracts Last Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Office of the
Iraq Programme on Monday reported that no oil sales contracts were
approved by the U.N. sanctions committee last week.
</P>
<P>
The Office said the number of oil sales contracts approved
under the current phase stands at 96, for a total volume of 268.3
million barrels.
</P>
<P>
During the same reporting period, eight loadings were completed
of a total of 10.2 million barrels of oil, at an estimated value
of 272 million U.S. dollars, the Office said.
</P>
<P>
The revenue generated since the beginning of Phase Seven of the
oil-for-food programme is estimated, at current prices, to be
about 3.283 billion U.S. dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The departing U.N.Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, Von Sponeck,
briefed U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the implementation of
the programme.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who resigns to protest the sanctions against Iraq, has
criticized that the programme was not even meeting minimum
requirements of the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
The programme began to be implemented in late 1996 under which
Iraq could sell oil to import food, medicine and other necessities
to help offset the affect of the U.N. sanctions.

<HEADLINE> Analysis: U.N. Oil-For-Food Fails to Achieve Its Aim By Xie Meihua </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, February 27 (Xinhua) -- The departing U.N.
Humanitarian Coordinator in Iraq, Hans Von Sponeck, on Monday
briefed U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on the U.N. oil-for-food
program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who was appointed to his post on October 26, 1998, the
fifth humanitarian coordinator to run the program, will leave the
job on March 31, 2000 to protest the sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
On occasions, Sponeck has said the humanitarian program was not
even meeting minimum requirements of the Iraqi people and the nine-
year long sanctions against Iraq had resulted in "a true human
tragedy".
</P>
<P>
He is the first high-ranking U.N. official who has so frankly
and strongly criticized the program which was supposed to ease the
deteriorating humanitarian situation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program, which began to be implemented in late
1996, allows Iraq to sell a certain amount of oil in every six
months to buy food, medicine and other necessities to help offset
the effects of the stringent U.N. sanctions which has been in
place since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
A total of six phases of the oil-for-food program has been
implemented and the phase seven will end in June 2000. It is
widely seen here that the following aspects have impeded the
program from being effective.
</P>
<P>
The limitation of the oil-for-food itself was the main reason
that leads to the failure. According to a U.N. Security Council
resolution adopted in 1995, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion U.S
dollars worth of oil in every six months to import the necessities
for its people and the amount was raised to 5.2 billion U.S.
dollars by a Council resolution in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Under the resolutions , Iraq can only draw about 60 percent
from the oil revenues to buy humanitarian goods and the rest must
go to an account monitored by the United Nations to pay war
compensations and to cover the administrative costs of U.N.
agencies and staff in Iraq, including the U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq said that the oil-for-food program could only cover half
of the basic humanitarian needs of its People, thus leaving the
other half in short.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions has created true human tragedy in Iraq. According
to statistics, 56 children under the age of five died out of every
1,000 children in 1991, and that the number has now risen to 131
children per thousand.
</P>
<P>
The dilapidated oil industry of Iraq weakens its capacity to
sell the amount of oil set by the U.N. Security Council. Iraq's
main oil fields and oil equipment were severely damaged during the
Gulf War which have not gotten repaired and recovered due to the
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has kept complaining that it cannot sell so much oil
unless it is allowed to draw 800 million U.S. dollars from the oil
revenues in every six months to import the necessary spare parts
and equipment to improve its current conditions of the oil
industry and to enhance its capacity of producing oil.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Council adopted a resolution in early 1998 which
allowed Iraq to draw 300 million U.S dollars from its oil revenues
in every six months to import the spare parts and equipment in
urgent need.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. estimates there will be no substantial improvement in
Iraq's capacity of producing oil until late 2000, even though
every contract of importing spare parts and equipment can be
approved by the U.N. sanctions committee and they can be shipped
to Iraq in time.
</P>
<P>
According to U.N. officials, the United States and Britain, two
of the members of U.N. sanctions committee which is composed of
the members of the Security Council, has so far frozen contract
requests about 300 million U.S. dollars for oil industry spare
parts and equipment. The blockade of the two countries has further
weakened Iraq's capacity of producing oil.
</P>
<P>
The review and approval of Iraq's contracts for humanitarian
goods are politicized which contributed significantly to the
worsening humanitarian crisis in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's contract requests for humanitarian goods must be
reviewed and approved by the U.N. sanctions committee before they
get implemented. So far, there are more than 1,000 worth more than
1 billion U.S. dollars for oil industry spare part, electricity
equipment and many other goods have been put on hold by the United
States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The contracts are often blocked under the pretexts such as "
dual-use", "noncompliance of items with the distribution plan", "
need to identify the end-use or end-user" or "request for the
technical specifications of items".
</P>
<P>
Sponeck's open comments on the oil-for-food program shocked
the United Nations. U.N.Secretary-General Kofi Annan has promised
to review the entire mechanism of the program and step up
necessary measures to improve it. But analysts here said that
lifting the sanctions is the only effective way to ease the
humanitarian crisis in Iraq.

anti-foreigner statements and praise of Nazi policies, resigned
Monday as head of the far-right Freedom Party, the Austria Press
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The move was seen as an attempt to reduce international
criticism of the new coalition government between Haider's
rightists and the center-right Austrian People's Party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Much Work to Be Done for Resumption of Syrian-Israeli Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, February 28 (Xinhua) -- The United States conceded
on Monday that there was much work to be done before Syrian-
Israeli peace talks could resume.
</P>
<P>
"there's still an enormous amount of work to be done," State
Department spokesman James Rubin told a regular briefing. "We've
had a problem where each side wants its needs to be met first. And
that had made it not possible, as yet, to restart talks formally."
</P>
<P>
He said President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Middle East envoy Dennis Ross had been working
intensively on the Syrian track for weeks. But he declined to
discuss the contacts in detail, saying the secrecy would make it
easier to make progress.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel suspended their talks in Shepherdstown, West
Virginia, last January, as both sides stressed to first discuss
their own demand. Syria said Israel must first pull out of the
Golan Heights, captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast War, before
it should consider normalization of their relations while Israel
asked for security requirements for its withdrawal from the
strategic plateau.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, a close aide to both Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and late Israeli leader Yitzhak Rabin disclosed that Rabin
told Washington in 1993 he would be willing to cede the Golan
Heights to Syria in return for a full peace.
</P>
<P>
Danny Yatom, who was Rabin's military secretary until his 1995
assassination, quoted Rabin's talks with then U.S. Secretary of
State Warren Christopher as saying: "If all of Israel's needs are
fulfilled, then Israel does not rule out the possibility of
withdrawing to the June 4 1967 line, and will consider it along
with other lines."
</P>
<P>
It was the first official confirmation of Syrian claims
regarding Rabin's statement, and also an indirect signal Barak
showing to Damascus for his willingness to pull out of the Golan
Heights.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. official said the indirect confirmations of this kind
may not be enough to convince the Syrians, who have asked for a
formal assurance of full Israeli withdrawal from the Gold Heights.
