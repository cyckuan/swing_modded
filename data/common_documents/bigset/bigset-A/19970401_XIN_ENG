<HEADLINE> French Extreme Right Party Proposes Constitutional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- France's extreme right party, the
National Front (FN), today called for a constitutional reform to
adding what it called "the principle of national preference"
into the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Holding in Strasbourg its 10th national congress session which
was strongly protested over the past two days, the FN also
presented a dozen other "projects of law" to show its
determination to share government power in the future, reported
the Agence France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
Among the proposals are a call for the revival of the death
penalty, the establishment of a "parent's income" for families
with at least one French parent, tightening of conditions for
naturalization of foreigners, and limiting the right of foreigners
to reside in France.
</P>
<P>
The FN also proposed to impose taxes on companies employing
foreign workers, and to scrap the principle of free trade by
installing "customs sampling for French employment" restricting
imports of foreign goods.
</P>
<P>
The party of Jean-Marie Le Pen also proposed the clause on
"referendum of popular initiative at national and local level"
in the constitution.
</P>
<P>
It called for the abolition of the 1972 Pleven law on cracking
down on offenses in provocating racial and religious
discrimination, hatred, and violence.
</P>
<P>
Since several trade unions controlled by the FN were outlawed
in the past, the FN called for "establishment and guarantee of
real union liberty."
</P>
<P>
It called for abolishing the system of what it called
"presumption of representativity" in unions, and suggested a 5
percent votes in professional elections as the starting line
for being represented in unions.

<HEADLINE> Chip Makers Fall into Tense Competition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)
Company will launch its K6 chip, which comes closer than ever to
matching or beating the performance of Intel chips, according to a
report of the USA Today Monday.
</P>
<P>
The new computer chip is expected to enhance the competition of
the Central Processing Unit (CPU) market, about 85 percent of
which is dominated by Intel.
</P>
<P>
AMD has not released pricing yet, the paper said. But analysts
expect the K6 to be 20 percent to 25 percent cheaper than
comparable Intel chips. That should make it attractive to
personal-computer makers, who have almost no alternative other
than Intel.
</P>
<P>
The "Intel Inside" label on PCs has brought great benefits to
the Intel Corp. Consumers often refer to PCs as "Intel" PCs --
instead of naming the actual PC-maker.
</P>
<P>
The California-based AMD has been struggling. It and
Texas-based Cyrix split the 15 percent that Intel doesn't own. The
K6 is AMD's equivalent of Intel's Pentium II, which will be
introduced next month. According to the magazine of PC World, a
233-megahertz K6 comes close to matching the performance of a
266-MHz Intel Pentium II.
</P>
<P>
With performance that close, the K6's lower price could make it
attractive. As another cost-saver, the K6 fits into existing PC
motherboards, the board that holds a PC's chips. Pentium II will
need new motherboard designs.

<HEADLINE> Black Rhino Population Increasing in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The population of Zimbabwe's black
rhino which had been reduced drastically due to poaching activities
is now increasing by more than 10 percent annually due to an
improved habitat and stepping up of security activities, local
press reported said today.
</P>
<P>
Norman English, a warden for Sinamatella Intensive Protection Zone
Camp in the Hwange National Park in western Zimbabwe where most of the
black rhino in Zimbabwe is located, said high security activities had
resulted in zero anti-poaching activities in the area for the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
However, he could not disclose the current number of black rhino in
the area for security reason, although the whole country was
estimated to have about 300 of the animals, which used to number
more than 2,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
''The national parks department and its associates are effectively
monioring poaching activities using helicopters and foot patrols,''
he said. enditem

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Prepares for Peace Talks on Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 31 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is making
preparations for proposed peace talks between the Zairean government
and rebels, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
Arrangements for the peace talks are going ahead but there is
still no confirmation about where and when the talks will be
held, said the source.
</P>
<P>
Spokesman for the Department of Foreign Affairs Pieter
Swanepoel said in Cape Town today that officials from his
department had been in contact with the two warring parties, and
received the go-ahead to make preparations for the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, Swanepoel did not elaborate on what would be
discussed at the talks.
</P>
<P>
"We are providing a venue. Further than that we cannot
comment," he said.
</P>
<P>
During his three-day state visit to India last week, President
Nelson Mandela announced that South Africa is to host the Zaire
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
A rebel spokesman, Kongolo Mwenze, said in Goma, eastern Zaire
on Sunday that they were willing to hold preliminary peace talks
as early as Thursday in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Mwenze said the proposed talks, if taking place this week,
would focus on setting up a meeting between President Mobutu
Sese Seko and rebel leader Laurent-Desire Kabila.
</P>
<P>
The Zairean government did not make any comment on the rebel
remarks. enditem

<HEADLINE> Arabs Vow to Make Good on Freezing Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League's resolution to
halt steps to normalize ties with Israel, which sends a clear
signal to the U.S. and Israel that peace cannot be played with,
will be implemented immediately, Arab ministers said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Syria-sponsored resolution, approved at a closed-door
session Sunday night, recommended Arab states reactivate the
economic boycott of Israel, stop normalization steps, close
Israeli offices and missions and pull out of multilateral talks
on aspects of Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
It will be included in a joint communique at the end of the
two-day meeting as a joint Arab response to Israel's Judaization
attempt on Jerusalem through building Jewish settlement on the
Arab sector of the city.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz said the decision "sent
a clear signal to Israel to deal with peace genuinely."
</P>
<P>
"It is also a message to the U.S. to return to the principles
of the peace process as an honest broker," he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters on the second day of the Arab League's
107th ministerial session, Boueiz said the decision will be set in
motion immediately, and the activities of the six Arab missions
and agencies in Israel will be halted.
</P>
<P>
Israel has diplomatic ties with Egypt and Jordan and set up
trade links with Morocco, Tunisia, Qatar and Oman.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to implement the decision at this particular
grave phase," he said, terming the recent Israeli practices as a
devastation to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The resolution recommended Arab countries to resume the
economic embargo imposed on Israel since 1948 and partially eased
after the 1993 Palestinian-Israeli peace accords. Multilateral
peace talks on water, economic cooperation, Palestinian refugees,
the environment and disarmament would be shelved, too.
</P>
<P>
Syria supports the idea and said the resolution does not require
the consent of Arab leaders because it fits in the scope of the
recent Arab summit resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the sidelines of the meeting today, Syrian Foreign
Minister Farouq al-Shara said that Arab leaders at the summit
last June linked normalization with Israel to progress on the
peace track.
</P>
<P>
"Arab foreign ministers are following the instructions of
their leaders, namely that multilateral negotiations be
suspended until Israel halts its destructive practices against
peace," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Vow to Make Good on Freezing Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian
official in charge of Jerusalem affairs, today lauded the Arab
League's decision to freeze normalization with Israel, which came
after a fiery appeal by Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
He termed the two-day discussions at the meetings as very
serious in a pre-departure statement after attending the foreign
ministerial session.
</P>
<P>
"The decision to halt multilateral talks and normalization
with Israel could affect the latter's peace policy," he added.
</P>
<P>
He also dismissed Israeli charges that the Palestinian
National Authority had given the green light to violence in
Israel and pinned the blame on Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has damaged the credibility of the peace process and
offered the proper climate to those who wanted to act separately
against peace on grounds that the process had become obsolete, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian official also regretted the U.S. use of its
veto power twice in a month in favor of Israel's settlement
policy.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, America has contributed to the damaging of the
credibility of the peace process and is thus poisoning the
climate in the Middle East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Israel's biggest Arab partner, today criticized
Israel's reaction to the Arab resolution as a mere "diatribe"
that is part of "violent verbal attacks."
</P>
<P>
Israel has shrugged off Arab League decision, saying that
Israel will not be deterred by the "threats made in Cairo and
Rabat," where a similar resolution was adopted at the Islamic
countries' Jerusalem Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, speaking to reporters at
the League headquarters, urged Israel to see that the Arabs
really meant it when they made the decision. "It is better for
Israel to realize the actual situation," he added.
</P>
<P>
Moussa expressed the hope that such a stance could make
Washington change its position in the interest of peace.
</P>
<P>
"Now Washington knows our viewpoint and the peace process has
to go forward because the situation is very bad," he added.
</P>
<P>
Omani Foreign Minister Yusef Ben-Alawi told the press that
the Arabs were "serious" about halting normalization with Israel
if it did not change its policy toward peace.
</P>
<P>
It is up to Israel, he said, to chose normalization with the
Arabs or continue its "inflexible policies."
</P>
<P>
Israel's ground-breaking for a 6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood
in East Jerusalem has stalled peace talks and sparked 12 days of
Palestinian riots.

<HEADLINE> 6th Conference of African Ministers of Finance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The sixth session of the
Conference of African Ministers of Finance opened today at the
U.N. Conference Center here.
</P>
<P>
In his opening address, Ethiopian Deputy Prime Minister Kassu
Ilala said Sub-Saharan Africa's gross domestic product (GDP) rose
by four percent in 1995, compared to the averaging 1.4 percent
increase in the period 1991-1995.
</P>
<P>
"This was the first time in more than a decade that Africa
registered a positive growth in its per capita income. Forecasts
for 1996 point to an even more buoyant outcome," Kassu said.
</P>
<P>
He said he believed that the "encouraging trend is a result of
the serious choices and sometimes the painful economic measures
taken by" African countries.
</P>
<P>
Kassu said Sub-Saharan Africa's debt to export ratio reached
270 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"The debt situation seriously impedes Africa's chances for
sustainable growth and development," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In some extreme cases, debt servicing is taking up to 90
percent of budgetary resources and in spite of all efforts to
repay what we can, arrears continue to accumulate," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said he hoped the conference will focus on the critical
thematic issues -- financial reforms, debt management and
exchange rate mechanisms -- that will support Africa's effort to
maintain this momentum and meet the challenges of sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
K.Y. Amoako, the U.N. Under Secretary General and Executive
Secretary of the Economic Commission for Africa, said "In
Sub-Saharan Africa official development assistance accounts for a
higher proportion of external financial flows than to any other
developing region."
</P>
<P>
Amoako noted that while official development assistance is
declining worldwide, record levels of private capital are flowing
to developing countries, adding private capital flows to the
developing world soared from 44 billion U.S. Dollars in 1990 to
244 billion Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that "the flows to Africa are lower,
as a percentage of GDP than all other developing regions. Only
about three percent of all the flows of private capital go to
sub-Saharan Africa."
</P>
<P>
Secretary General of the Organization of African Unity Salim
Ahmed Salim told participants: "The sound management of money
and finance is key to the success of any economic endeavor".
</P>
<P>
"Unfortunately, for reasons both internal and external, most
of our countries have not been able to ensure a sound management
of this important sector," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim stressed that "as we are engaged in reforming our
economies to meet the challenges of globalization and
competitiveness, it is imperative to reform our financial systems
taking into account the new realities of international economic
relations''.
</P>
<P>
Referring to African debt crisis, he said that "the stock of
Africa's debt is today estimated at more than 340 billion
Dollars, while the debt servicing payments amount to 24 billion
Dollars."
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will discuss growth and development
finance in Africa at the turn of the century and the role for
the multilateral financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
Among topics are financial sector reforms in Africa,
challenges of the African debt problem and emerging capital
markets in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will adopt resolutions and declaration proposed by
experts meeting which was held here last week. enditem

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Denounces Arab Decision to Freeze Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today strongly denounced the decision by Arab
countries to freeze ties with Israel, forecasting that it would
not work.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was reacting to the resolution adopted by the
meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Arab League in Cairo, which
called for freezing ties with Israel to protest its policies of
building settlements in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He denounced the resolution as "absurd," saying Israel as a
strong and modern economy would not be cowed by such coercion.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think these sort of attempts to reconstitute boycott
can go anywhere. It did not go anywhere when Israel was a
fledgling country with small economy, and today we are a very
strong country with very strong economy with international
technological power. It did not work then, it won't work now,"
he told the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee.
</P>
<P>
He said that the only way to resolve the differences between
Israel and Arab countries was to negotiate. "We cannot accept
the concept of peace in which we are coerced by political
warfare or by threats of terror and threats of violence," he
added.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the state-run Israel Radio, Netanyahu
reiterated his tough stance on the issue of building settlements
in East Jerusalem or elsewhere on the Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel would not halt the controversial
construction in Har Homa of East Jerusalem, because he would
never allow Jerusalem to be redivided like the German city of
Berlin during the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu expressed deep disappointment with Egypt, the first
Arab country to make peace with Israel, for initiating the Arab
boycott. "I think the Egyptians have to make up their mind about
a Middle East of peace or a Middle East of perpetual conflicts,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Arab boycott came against the backdrop that the
Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations were stalled because of
Israel's decision to build the Har Homa settlement. The deadlock
has led to a rising tension between the two sides as
stone-throwing Palestinian protesters have been clashing with
Israeli soldiers across the territories for the past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
Following the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv on March 21, which
killed four people and wounded dozens of others, Israel has
toughened its position against the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA) by conditioning the resumption of peace talks on the PNA's
promise to launch long-term crackdown on terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli opposition parties today blasted Netanyahu's
hardline policies for leading to Israel's isolation and
deterioration in ties with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Ehud Barak, heir-apparent of the Labor Party, said he was
deeply disturbed by the current situation. He criticized
Netanyahu for having destroyed the mutual Israeli-Arab confidence
which was painstakingly built by the previous Labor
government. He urged Netanyahu to "stop the escalation and find a
way to restore contacts with Arab leaders."
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid also expressed concern about what
he described as "total collapse" of Israeli-Arab peace process
in the region. He blamed the Netanyahu government for creating
the current "miserable and bad situation".

<HEADLINE> Le Pen Claims "Historic Mission" of Extreme Right Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Jean-Marie Le Pen, the president of
France's extreme-right National Front (FN) party, today claimed a
"historic mission toward France and the Frenchmen" by his party
and made a violent attack on the government and all political
establishments of the country.
</P>
<P>
In a speech at the closing of the 10th FN national congress
today in Strasbourg, Le Pen said that he was "meditating" on the
"historic model" with which General Charles de Gaulle replaced
the 4th Republic of France with the 5th Republic.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old FN president ended his one-hour-and-a-half
speech with "Vive the 6th Republic !" according to the Agence
France-Presse (AFP).
</P>
<P>
"Fifty years ago, in Strasbourg, General de Gaulle appealed
for the rally of the French people against the regime of the
parties. His efforts failed. But several years later, he founded
the 5th Republic on the debris of the 4th (Republic). This is a
historic model that many should meditate," AFP quoted Le Pen as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen was re-elected president of FN by presenting himself as
the single candidate for the post on Sunday, the second day of the
national congress which triggered a large-scale protest on
Saturday by more than 50,000 people in Strasbourg.
</P>
<P>
Claiming himself as "neither racist nor anti-Semite," Le Pen
said, "We don't accept to be aggressed or insulted by anyone, no
matter whites or Catholics, Jews or blacks, crooks or
scribblers."
</P>
<P>
On the financial scandals of the country, including that of the
Credit Lyonnais, Le Pen said that the bank is "the cave of 400
thiefs" who stole 8,000 to 10,000 francs from each French family.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that under the old regimes, the ministers of
finances were often hanged.

<HEADLINE> Landslide Destroys Village in Northwest Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A landslide has destroyed 70
percent of a village in Iran's northwestern province of East
Azarbaijan province, Iran's official news agency IRNA reported
today.
</P>
<P>
IRNA said 30 of 65 families living in the Nasir-Abad village,
about 700 kilometers northwest of Tehran, have been forced to
evacuate their homes and live in Tabriz temporarily.
</P>
<P>
There are no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the remaining 35 families have taken
shelter in the neighboring Mehtarlu village.
</P>
<P>
However, the report did not mention when the landslide
happened.
</P>
<P>
Landslide has intensified in the region since a deadly
earthquake shook the nearby Ardebil province on February 28, which
killed about 1,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the Nasir-Abad village cannot be
reconstructed and its inhabitants should be transferred to safe
area.
</P>
<P>
The affected families will receive free plots of land and soft
loans worth 2,200 U.S. dollars to build their new homes in other
areas.

<HEADLINE> Calm Comes in Angola Except Northern Cabinda: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Angolan Defence Minister Pedro
Sebastiao said here today that the southern African country has
calmed down except its northern Cabinda Province where
separatists created chaos.
</P>
<P>
The Angolan army now controls the country on the whole and has
taken actions in Cabinda to quell turmoil, restore stability and
ensure the security of local residents, he said in an interview
with the national radio.
</P>
<P>
Sebastiao expressed concern about the slow progress in the
formation of a unified army. Under an agreement signed by the
government and the former rebel National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola, a total of 26,300 former rebels should
join the unified army, but only 6,000 have so far been enroled.
</P>
<P>
On the on-going military exercise in Zimbabwe, the minister
said, since the peace in Angola needs to be further strengthened,
the country did not take part in the military exercise.
</P>
<P>
South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe,
all members of the Southern Africa Development Community, are
participating in the exercise, local reports said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Likely to Postpone British Missile Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait may postpone a
British missile deal as the parliament today advised the
government to do so.
</P>
<P>
Adnan Abdel Samad, spokesman of the Committee for the
Protection of Public Funds of the National Assembly, said today
that the deal was on the parliament agenda to reconsider the
report of the Defense Ministry's technical committee regarding the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Several parliamentary members opposed to the deal have asked
the government to launch investigation into the deal.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait is preparing to buy some surface-to-surface missiles to
be mounted on its French-made patrol boats. Both France and
Britain were competing to gain the deal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The deal was estimated at about 100 million U.S. dollars. It
sparked a dispute between the government and the National
Assembly after reports claimed that the British offer was favored
to a better French deal.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti previous parliament which ended its term in October,
1996 was told that the French offer was cheaper and better and the
French missiles fit better on the French-made gunboats. It asked
Kuwaiti Defense Ministry to form a new committee to study the two
offers and select the best.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti Defense Ministry initialed the contract with the
British government, maintaining that the British Seaskua missile
were better than the French MM15.
</P>
<P>
Some cabinet ministers said the deal has not been finalized
yet.

Lagos, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has created
more than 5,000 jobs for former faction fighters and civilians in
Liberia to help rebuild the war-ravaged country, a report reaching
here said today.
</P>
<P>
Under the UN's Civil Reconstruction Team's program launched last

The Resident Representative of the United Nations Development
Program in Liberia, Adama Guido said, "Getting former combatants off

</P>
<P>
Guido said that since the first team was set up in December last
year, an average of 300 jobs have been created on a weekly basis, and
there are now a total of 43 teams working in Lofa, Bong, Grqnd Bassa,

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Minister: Contacts for Arab Summit Underway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Arab countries are contacting with
each other for a summit, Lebanese Foreign Minister Farez Boueiz
announced here this evening.
</P>
<P>
Boueiz, who returned home today after attending the two-day
107th conference of the Arab League Council held in the Egyptian
capital of Cairo Sunday and Monday, also stressed the necessity to
"unify the Arab rank" within this framework.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters at the Beirut International Airport, he
confirmed that there are also contacts in the entire Arab world to
press for a role of the United States as a "just intermediary and
pushing power" in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
A just role of the U.S. "constitutes a basic pillar of the
peace process and the peace process can not continue without
this role," the Lebanese foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
"There are contacts and messages asking the U.S. to return to
this role if it really wants the peace process to be saved from
the present crisis," Boueiz added.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question on a recent tour of U.S. Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross in Rabat, Morocco and Israel, Boueiz said, "if
there is any new U.S. move, we hope that his move will be serious
and will be that of an impartial mediator and a pushing power."
</P>
<P>
"We are still seeking a real peace, and we are still asking the
U.S. to fully play its role," the foreign minister reiterated.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the decisions adopted by the Arab League
Council conference, the foreign minister said that the message
from these decisions was "very clear."
</P>
<P>
In its final declaration, the council called on all the Arab
states to freeze the normalization of ties with Israel and to
close their representative offices in the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to make the Israelis to understand and to know
that it impossibly obtains all the peace benefits meanwhile
abrogates the benefits of others," Boueiz underlined.
</P>
<P>
The first thing the Arabs should do from now on is to "reunify
their positions and to re-establish the Arab solidarity out of the
belief that the peace is either to be comprehensive or not to be,"
he added.

<HEADLINE> Liberia's Taylor Against Change in Election Date </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Liberian presidential candidate and
former warlord, Charles Taylor, has joined in the chorus of the
international community for efforts to hold the country's elections on
May 30 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Anything that would warrant changing the election date, which would
lead to so many complexities, must be avoided, said Taylor, who many
observers believe is one of the strongmen in the race for presidency.
</P>
<P>
"If the election date is shifted forward, it means I will have to
return to the Council (of State) and start all over again, in spite of
the fact that I have met my own part of the agreement," he said,
quoted by the News Agency of Nigeria today.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, along with two other major former warlords Alhaji Kromah
and George Boley, resigned the post of vice-chairman of the ruling
Council of State a month ago to contest for the presidency in
elections.
</P>
<P>
With only two months to go, the slow pace of preparations for the
May 30 polls, particularly the delay in the induction of Liberia's
election commission and supreme court, has aroused concern from the
international community over whether the election can be held as
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Both United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Nigerian Head
of State General Sani Abacha, who is also chairman of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), have called on the Liberian
Council of State for efforts to avoid a postponement of the elections.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with visiting Nigerian journalists in Monrovia, the
Liberian capital, over the weekend, Taylor disclosed that he had
called for an emergency meeting of the council to settle the dispute
over the chairmanship of the electoral commission.
</P>
<P>
It must be settled by April 1 and the body inaugurated by April 2
as recommended by ECOWAS, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
As for the claims that the election period was too short, Taylor
said "Liberia's situation is not a normal one and no sound mind should
expect the normal thing to happen. Everyone is now interested in
re-building the society and putting the past behind."
</P>
<P>
According to the revised Abuja peace accord, signed last August to
end the seven-year-old civil war in Liberia, general and presidential
elections should be held on May 30 and a new democratic government
installed on June 15.
</P>
<P>
Taylor also pledged to support the ECOWAS peace-keeping plan if he
became the president of Liberia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Post-election Liberia should be one of healing old wounds and
re-integration of everyone in the society, he said, adding that
re-distribution of wealth was no necessary in the country.
</P>
<P>
The concentration of wealth in the hands of just about 0.2 percent
of the population was the cause of the crisis in the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, presidential candidate of the National Patriotic Party,
said the alliance of seven other parties in the election was not a
threat to him.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Adopt Resolutions on Jerusalem and Other </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League Council ended its
107th meeting here this evening after adopting several
resolutions on Jerusalem, Libya, Somalia and other hot spots
while postponing four other resolutions for further examination.
</P>
<P>
The delayed resolutions are related to the statute of the Arab
Court of Justice, the code of honor for Arab security and
cooperation, the mechanism for administering and settling Arab
disputes and Arab Union project.
</P>
<P>
In a final joint communique issued at the end of the two-day
ministerial meeting, the Arab League urged countries building
ties with Israel to reconsider the normalization steps and resume
the economic embargo imposed on Israel since 1948 and partially
eased after the 1993 Palestinian-Israeli peace accords.
</P>
<P>
While trade links with Tunisia, Morocco, Qatar and Oman might
be cut, Israel's peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan and a
string of agreements with the Palestinians would not be affected.
</P>
<P>
It also urged a suspension of multilateral peace talks on
water, economic cooperation, Palestinian refugees, the
environment and disarmament, in protest against Israel's breaking
ground for a 6,500-unit Jewish neighborhood in Arab East
Jerusalem, captured in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
The resolution, approved during a closed-door session Sunday
night, shaped up the common Arab stance in response to Israel's
controversial Jewish housing project that has stalled the peace
process and sparked 12 days of Palestinian rioting.
</P>
<P>
The Syria-sponsored resolution denounced the Israeli
Judaization attempt on Jerusalem before promised talks on final
status of the occupied Palestinian lands. Palestinians want the
Arab sector of the city as a future capital while Israel wants it
undivided under Israeli sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon Russia and the U.S., the two co-sponsors
of the Mideast peace process to push Israel to "abide by U.N.
Security Council resolutions 252 and 476 that consider Israeli
measures in Jerusalem as null and void."
</P>
<P>
Arab ministers have made clear that they will set the
resolution in motion immediately and thus send a clear signal to
Israel and the U.S. that peace can not be tampered with.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, the Palestinian official in charge of the
Jerusalem affairs, expressed the hope that the decision to halt
multilateral talks and normalization with Israel "could sway the
latter's peace policy."
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa urged Israel to realize
that Arabs really mean it when they made the decision and
overhaul its settlement decision.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Lebanon both expected the resolution would help
"return the U.S. back to the principles of the peace process as
an honest broker."
</P>
<P>
Despite the Arab appeal, Israel has shrugged off the decision,
saying that it will not be deterred by "the threats made in Cairo
and Rabat," where a similar resolution was adopted at the Islamic
countries' Jerusalem Committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
While shedding limelight on Jerusalem, the Arab League Council
also gives recommendations on the Somali conflicts, calling upon
all factions to immediately stop fighting and settle their
differences by means of dialogue and within the framework of
national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
In another move, the Council reiterated its solidarity with
Libya and called for the U.N. Security Council to hold
a special session to decide on a peaceful end to the crisis
facing the country.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations imposed overall sanctions on Libya in April
1992 after Libya refused to surrender suspects in the 1988
bombing of Pan America Flight 103 jet over Lockbie, Scotland,
killing 270 people.

<HEADLINE> S. African Accused of Trying to Sell Mozambique's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Head of the Mozambican National
Tourism Department (DNT) Arlindo Langa here today accused a South
African, Richard Makin, of attempting to sell Mozambique's
Paraiso Island.
</P>
<P>
Makin has advertised the island, located in Vilanculos
County, Inhambane Province in southern Mozambique, for sale at
the price of 3.5 million U.S. Dollars through South African and
international media, Langa said.
</P>
<P>
Makin in 1995 got the licenses from the Mozambican government
to run two dilapidated hotels named Dona Ana and Santa Carolina
on the island on condition that he should renovate them first,
Langa said.
</P>
<P>
However, it was said that Makin received foreign tourists in
the two hotels with no repairs made and the Mozambican side
blamed him for staining the country's image.
</P>
<P>
Then, the Mozambican government revoked Makin's licenses and
fined him 10 million Meticais (870 Dollars).
</P>
<P>
In response, Makin lodged legal suits in both Mozambique and
South Africa against his partners -- the DNT and the Mozambican
Popular Development Bank (BPD).
</P>
<P>
Under a court decision in South Africa last year, the banking
accounts of the DNT and BPD in South Africa, worth about two
million Dollars, were frozen.
</P>
<P>
Makin is not the owner of the island or the hotels and he has
no rights to sell the island which belongs to Mozambique, said
Langa.
</P>
<P>
Makin's move is aimed to hinder the development of
Mozambique's tourism, Langa charged. enditem

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The Attorney General of the
Egyptian State Security Prosecution today ordered the detention of
five Cairo University students for breaching public order during
the anti-Israeli demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
The students, jailed for 15 days pending investigations, were
accused of distributing leaflets instigating violence and
breaching the peace during the anti-Israeli protest.
</P>
<P>
They were seized last week during or after a string of campus
protests against Israel's plans to build a Jewish housing project
in Arab East Jerusalem, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
During the two-day demonstrations on campus early last week,
Cairo University students denounced the Abu Ghneim or Har Homa
project and Israeli attempts to Judaize Jerusalem, which is holy
to Christians, Muslims and Jews alike.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators held banners and shouted slogans such as
"Jerusalem is Arab," and burned the national flag of Israel. They
also called for expelling the Israeli ambassador here and
withdrawing the Egyptian ambassador from Tel Aviv.
</P>
<P>
During the past week, thousands of Alexandria University
students, members of trade unions and opposition parties as well
as woman activists have staged separate demonstrations in protest
of the Israeli settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
Arabs are infuriated by the Israeli housing project for Jews,
which they said caused a breakdown of Palestinian-Israeli
relations.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, together with 21 other Arab countries, Sunday endorsed a
draft resolution during the ongoing Arab League Council meetings
calling for an immediate freeze of normalization steps with Israel
and suspending the Middle East multilateral cooperation.

WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The trial in the 1995 Oklahoma
City bombing got under way today in the U.S. District Court in
Denver, with judge Richard Matsch delivering a brief explanation
of the jury selection process.
</P>
<P>
In the packed courtroom were defendant Timothy McVeigh, his
legal team led by Oklahoma lawyer Stephen Jones, and U.S. Attorney
Joseph Hartzler's prosecution unit, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Matsch interviewed the first of 352 prospective jurors, from
which a jury of 12 and six alternates will be chosen to hear
months of testimony.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh is charged with the worst case of domestic terrorism in
U.S. history -- the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal
Building on April 19, 1995, that killed 168 and injured 500.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of journalists are in Denver for the start of the
trial but the number is expected to dwindle as Matsch and lawyers
on both sides go through the jury selection process.
</P>
<P>
If McVeigh is convicted, whether he is sentenced to death will
be up to the jury. Under federal law, anyone opposed to the death
penalty in all circumstances cannot serve as a juror in a capital
case.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Trade Deficit Hits 7.43 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit reached
7.43 billion U.S. dollars in the first three months, up 78.3
percent over a year ago, the Industry and Energy Ministry reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Exports totaled 29.809 billion dollars and imports 37.239
billion dollars respectively, according to the ministry's trade
estimates.
</P>
<P>
However, the deficit was better than the projected 7.7 billion
dollars, thanks to a slight recovery in the semiconductor sector
and the increasing exports of other items.
</P>
<P>
Deficit in the first three months were 3.466 billion dollars,
2.088 billion dollars and 1.876 billion dollars respectively.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter's trade deficit surpassed half of the
government's 14-billion-dollar projection for the whole year,
raising fears that it would be an even worse year than the
previous one when the nation suffered its worst-ever trade loss of
more than 15 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Ministry forecast that the trade deficit will
gradually improve, as the export is decreasing at a more slow
pace, from 8.7 percent in January to 4.8 percent in February and
2.9 percent in March.
</P>
<P>
While exports to the developed nations declined 15.3 percent to
10.504 billion dollars, those to the developing countries
increased 3.3 percent to 13.767 billion dollars, the report said.

KUNMING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Construction of the extension
project of Kunming Airport, a State Council-approved major
construction project during the 1996-2000 period, began here today.
</P>
<P>
Situated in the southern suburb of Kunming, capital of
southwest China's Yunnan Province, the airport is the main airport
in southwest China and an air transportation hub of Yunnan.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the expansion work, the airport will be
able to handle seven million passengers and 100,000 tons of goods
annually, according to an airport authority.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996, the airport handled 4.01 million
passengers and 58,300 tons of goods.
</P>
<P>
At present, the floor space of the Kunming airport terminal
is 17,000 square meters, and that of its warehouse
is 2,200 square meters. It has four boarding gates and a
handling capacity of two million passengers.
</P>
<P>
This can not meet the need of the province's economic
development, especially for the world horticulture exposition to
be held from May 1 to October 31 in 1999, which is expected to
attract eight to ten million tourists.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the extension project will not affect the
regular air service of the airport, according to project sources.

million florin (about 52.6 million U.S. dollars), and we are
pleased. All Barings operations have contributed to profit."
</P>

<HEADLINE> China to Introduce Accidental Injury Insurance For Coal Miners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's six million coal miners
will have better protected rights and interests after July 1, when
China requires mining managements to buy accidental injury
insurance.
</P>
<P>
China is putting the final touches on a set of regulations to
introduce this type of insurance coverage in the coal industry,
said Wang Xiaoqi, general director of the Social Insurance
Management Bureau of the Ministry of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that the regulations are made in accordance with the
coal mining law issued last year, and that the new rules make it
mandatory for all coal mining companies to provide the coverage
for their workers.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the coal mining industry sees the
highest death tolls and numbers of injuries among all industrial
sectors in the country, but the workers are receiving very low
financial compensation.
</P>
<P>
"The financial compensation for killed or injured coal miners
is largely paid in accordance with the regulations set in 1953,"
he said, adding that the new regulations will enable relatives of
a worker killed in a mining accident to receive around 50,000
yuan, more than 20 times the amount of compensation they receive
now.
</P>
<P>
He said that the coal industry has set different insurance
costs for coal mining companies in keeping with their
profitability and the levels of their workers' salaries.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the insurance fee set by the ministry is still
inadequate, because the entire coal industry is still losing money.
</P>
<P>
China's major state-owned coal mines employ 3.26 million
workers -- about half of the country's total coal mining workforce
-- and also provide welfare for 1.17 million retired workers.

<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria today increased electricity
and heating prices by 30 percent and 70 percent respectively,
local press reported.
</P>
<P>
It is the third time this year that the government has lifted
fuel prices drastically.
</P>
<P>
The government said the price hikes were part of a price reform
rather than a decision under the pressure of inflation. The aim is
to make power prices closer to the standard set by the World Bank
for receiving its loans.
</P>
<P>
Official forecasts show that the price of bread, Bulgarians'
staple food, will rise by 10.2 percent due to the power price
hikes.
</P>
<P>
Currency devaluation and inflation has prompted the government
to raise the prices for power, coal, gas and oil by 45 percent and
48 percent respectively in January and February. But the
government said inflation has been brought under control last
month.
</P>
<P>
Subsidies will be given to poor families.

During his visit, Siazon will meet Chief Executive of the Hong

Siazon has expressed confidence in sustained friendly and close
cooperation between Manila and the future Hong Kong SAR government

extended visa-free entry and a seven-day stay in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Siazon said this arrangement reflects the confidence of the
Philippine government in the integrity of the Hong Kong SAR

beyond 1997.

<HEADLINE> HK Police Earn Big Bonanza by Hiring out Officers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong police made 12 million
HK dollars (1.54 million US dollars) in the past financial year by
hiring out officers, today's Hong Kong Standard reported.
</P>
<P>
The earnings, up 16 percent over the previous financial year,
are credited to the Police Welfare Fund.
</P>
<P>
The hourly rate is 125 HK dollars (16 US dollars) for a
constable, 189 HK dollars for a sergeant (24 US dollars), 398 HK
dollars (51 US dollars) for an inspectorate officer and 731 HK
dollars (94 US dollars) for a superintendent with a minimum charge
of four hours, the English-language newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
One of the leading clients is the Hong Kong Jockey Club which
has to pay for the deployment of police officers at race courses
for every meeting.
</P>
<P>
A club spokesman said: "We need the deployment of police
officers for crowd control and cash custody. Their presence is
good for us and the race-goers."
</P>
<P>
And the Hong Kong Stadium's management company, Wembley
International, said police were usually hired in case of sporting
events.
</P>
<P>
The aim of charging was to stop people abusing the services of
police, according to a police spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Under Police General Orders, "the principle governing a
decision as to whether police may be hired is that the function is
private or commercial and attracting public attendance."

<HEADLINE> EDS-more details added Chinese President Meets Australian PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin, in
meeting with visiting Australian Prime Minister John Howard today,
said that China and Australia should further their cooperation
based on mutual respect and with an eye to the future.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the wish during a meeting with Howard here
today at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Howard, who is on his first official
visit to China as Australian Prime Minister, Jiang said he
believes that this visit is of great significance to the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Recalling their meeting last November in Manila during the APEC
informal summit, Jiang said that positive results came of their
talks, and stressed that continued contact between leaders of the
two sides has played an important role in deepening mutual
understanding, dissolving disputes, developing cooperation, and
guiding the direction of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Howard said he was pleased to meet with Jiang again, adding
that their meeting in Manila left him with beautiful
memories. Yesterday, he and Chinese Premier Li Peng discussed all
aspects of bilateral ties and agreed to continue expanding mutual
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Howard reiterated the Australian government's invitation for
Jiang to pay an official visit to Australia, for which Jiang
expressed appreciation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang pointed out that a sound political relationship
constitutes a reliable guarantee for the sustained and steady
development of comprehensive Sino-Australian relations.
</P>
<P>
This year marks the 25th anniversary of Sino-Australian
diplomatic relations. Jiang said that during the past 25 years,
bilateral relations have enjoyed sound development in general and
cooperation in various fields is expected to make greater progress
this year.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the world is moving towards
multi-polarization, Jiang said that there cannot be one single
development pattern in the world.
</P>
<P>
Countries should choose their own development paths in line
with their own conditions, and develop cooperation with each other
on the basis of equality and mutual respect, Jiang said. For
disputes, he added, they should conduct consultation and
discussion, and seek common ground while reserving differences, so
as to handle the problems in a proper manner.
</P>
<P>
It is in this spirit that China handles relations with
countries whose social systems are different from that of China,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that both China and Australia are influential countries
in the Asia-Pacific region, Jiang said that China hopes to
steadily and smoothly develop cooperative relations of mutual
benefit with Australia.
</P>
<P>
However, Jiang noted, the development of Sino-Australian
relations should not be limited to a bilateral perspective.
Instead, cooperation should be conducted with a strategic point of
view to the future and to the overall interests, and with the aim
to safeguard and promote peace, stability and prosperity in the
entire Asia-Pacific region. Thus, the two countries will make the
most of their respective advantages, and face up together to
challenges of the 21st century, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang stressed that China will continue to march along the path
of building socialism with Chinese characteristics mapped out by
Comrade Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
China remains a developing country with a large population, a
weak economic foundation, and a difficult task of modernization,
Jiang said, adding that it will take long-term efforts to achieve
national prosperity.
</P>
<P>
For that, he said, China needs a stable and peaceful
international environment.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that China's economic development represents
an important contribution to peace and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific and the world at large. The more China develops, the
more benefits it will bring to the Asia-Pacific and the world, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Noting that Australia supports China's modernization, Howard
said that with their highly complementary economies, the two
countries should develop bilateral cooperation in all fields on
the basis of mutual benefit and mutual respect for each other's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Australia believes that China poses no threat to any country,
and that China's reform and opening-up has offered opportunities
for economic and trade cooperation for other countries, he said,
adding that Australia is willing to do more in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Also, Australia stands for an early settlement of the issue of
China's entry into the World Trade Organization, Howard said.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Leftist Party Make Headway in Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
today substantial progress has been made in its peace talks with
the leftist National Democratic Front (NDF) held last month in the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Howard Dee, the government's chief negotiator in the talks with
the NDF, told reporters the government is "very hopeful" to wrap
up three agreements with the NDF by June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
During the talks held in the Netherlands on March 18-24, Dee
said, the two sides were close to reaching agreement on security,
human rights and international humanitarian laws.
</P>
<P>
Dee said that one or two members of the NDF negotiating panel
might come home soon to consult their local leaders about the
on-going talks with the government.
</P>
<P>
The government panel will then go back to the Netherlands in
two weeks in a bid to complete the three agreements, he said.
</P>
<P>
The National Democratic Front, a leftist alliance led by the
Philippine Communist Party, has been engaged in armed conflict
with the government since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
During the early 1990s, some of the NDF's leaders were forced
to flee to the Netherlands after its military wing, the New
People's Army, suffered a series of major military setbacks during
its guerrilla war with the government forces.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 200 university students
hope to make dreams of parenthood come true for a gosling-less
pair of wild geese.
</P>
<P>
Every March since 1993, the goose couple flies into Zizhuyuan
Park in Beijing, stays for several months, befriends many of the
park's regular visitors, then flies south in the fall.
</P>
<P>
Year after year, according to park watchers, the couple's eggs
fall from the nest or are broken.
</P>
<P>
This year, when the geese arrived for their fifth park stay,
more than 200 students from the China Forestry University in
Beijing volunteered to nest-watch 'round-the-clock, and last
Sunday pitched a tent near the hatching site.
</P>
<P>
"We will take turns working around the clock until the baby
geese are hatched," said Yanjun, one of the volunteers.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the improvement in ecological environment, the
capital city has become home to more and more wild birds. On March
27, a wild swan flew into the city's Qingnianhu Park, after a
group of swans settled at a reservior in the suburbs. Endiem

BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Thai Ministry of Commerce said
today it would file a petition with the World Trade Organization
(WTO) over what it called Egypt's protectionism, the Thai news
agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian government demanded that all documents attached to
each shipment issued by the Thai government or agencies be further
certified by the Egyptian embassy in Thailand, the Thai embassy in
Cairo or the Egyptian foreign ministry.
</P>
<P>
These measures might be considered as disguised trade
protectionism, the news agency quoted Thai commercial counsellor
to Egypt Mongkol Somkane as saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports failing to meet extra conditions, such as
certificates of original country, sanitary standards and details
of products, will also be banned from entering Egypt, Mongkol said.
</P>
<P>
Under international trade practices, shipments attached with
the required documents issued by the government agencies or
authorized agencies of the exporting countries are considered
justified, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mongkol accused the Egyptian government of taking the new
measures to cost Thai exporters more time and unnecessary
expenses.

continuing.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Congress party President Sitaram Kesri himself

else, Kumar said, "I cannot say at what level it is there. But
negotiations are on."

On the possibility of a snap poll in the country, Kumar said,
"The Congress party has already staked its claim to form a

<HEADLINE> S. Korea to Establish Economic Revival Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
and opposition leaders agreed today to establish an economic
consultative body to revive the nation's sagging economy.
</P>
<P>
The council, to be composed of leaders from various walks of
life and members of the ruling and opposition parties, will map
out measures to revitalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached at a joint meeting between President
Kim, major opposition National Congress for New Politics chief Kim
Dae-jung, minor opposition United Liberal Democrats leader Kim
Jong-pil and ruling New Korea Party chairman Lee Hoi-chang.
</P>
<P>
An announcement made by the four leaders after the meeting
appealed to South Koreans to share the burden of reviving the
nation's economy, saying the council will open inter-party
consultations as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The four leaders pledged to draw lessons from the recent Hanbo
scandal, hasten financial reforms and cooperate in promoting
savings and employment and stablizing wages and prices.
</P>
<P>
They promised to help small and medium-sized business groups in
solving fund shortages and encourage major corporations to take
part in international competition.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to continue negotiations on improving the real-name
financial system, foreign currency policy and other economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the Hanbo scandal, they agreed to conduct a
thorough investigation to reveal all facts of the scandal.
</P>
<P>
The leaders agreed that the current economic crisis basically
stemmed from public distrust in government and resulted in
socio-political unrests.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the government should regain public trust by
taking necessary measures, including clearing all suspicions
surrounding the Hanbo scandal and other issues.

Consultative Conference (CPPCC), met today with Robert W. Galvin,
chairman of the Executive Committee of the Motorola Inc., who is
here to attend a series of celebrations marking the 10th
anniversary of Motorola's investment in China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Li said he was pleased to see the progress
that Motorola has made in China over the past decade, especially
in the Economic and Technical Development Zone located in north
China's port city of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Inc. has so far invested 1 billion US dollars in the
port city.
</P>
<P>
Li said this development zone, one of the first of the kind in
the country, has unique advantages, adding that the late Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping inspected the Tianjin zone in August of 1986,
to see for himself if the idea had worked.
</P>
<P>
During his inspection, Deng said that opening up should
continue and there was great promise for the development zone.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident of making the development zone a success and
of our cooperation" with Motorola, Li noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that Motorola's advanced technology has been a great
help in pushing forward the development of China's
telecommunications industry.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Inc. has cooperated favorably with the development
zone, Li noted, saying that this has resulted in noticeable
economic gains to Motorola while also contributing to
society.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed the hope that the Motorola will expand its
business in China and further its cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Galvin said he was honored that his company was connected with
the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and the development zone,
and that "mutual trust" has been an invaluable part of bilateral
cooperation over the past ten years, providing opportunities for
Motorola to expand its businesses in China.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin Mayor Zhang Lichang also attended the meeting.

BRUSSELS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today it would request formal consultations with Japan in the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Japan's exclusion of European

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Share prices fell sharply on the
Hong Kong stock market today, hurt by drops for two consecutive
trading days on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
The Hang Seng Index, the key indicator of Hong Kong's blue
chips, shed 460 points, or 3.67 percent, to close at 12,074
points, a slide that was the ninth largest in history in point
terms.
</P>
<P>
The sub-index for properties led the decline, losing 1,133
points, while finance counters dipped 446 points, utilities slid
286 points, and commerce and industry dropped 283 points.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of the four-day Easter holidays, today is the first
trading day in the new financial year.
</P>
<P>
In morning trading the Hang Seng Index once broke the 12,000
mark to slip to 11,951 points, the lowest point the market has
traded the year, but bargain-hunting activities thereafter
narrowed the losses.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attributed the plunge on the local bourse to Wall
Street's weakness. The Dow Jones industrial average lost close to
300 points for the past two trading days on heightened jitters
over the continued rise in long-term interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Measures announced last week by the Hong Kong government to
curb property prices also depressed the market, they said.

BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji
said here today that the current visit of Australian Prime
Minister John Howard is a significant contribution to the steadily
developing friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark in talks this afternoon with Howard at the

</P>
<P>
Welcoming Howard and the Australian government officials and
businessmen in his delegation, Zhu pointed out that
Sino-Australian ties are oriented to the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled the warm reception he received when he visited
Australia five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his pleasure at meeting with Zhu, Howard said that
never before has such a big business delegation accompanied an
Australian leader on a visit abroad. This shows that the
Australian government and business people are keen on developing
bilateral economic and trade cooperation, he said.

<P>
He noted that Australia has its advantages in a number of
industries, and there is vast potential for expanding cooperation
with China in these fields.

Zhu said that the Sino-Australian economic and trade
relationship, the cornerstone for bilateral friendly relations,
has developed rapidly over the past few years, and bilateral trade
volume witnessed an annual increase rate of over 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government's policy on Asia and China's reform
and opening policy have turned the two countries into important
trade and investment partners, and both are highly attentive to
bilateral cooperation of mutual benefit, Zhu said, adding that
this is encouraging.
</P>
<P>
Zhu also briefed Howard on the reform and development of
China's economy, overseas investment and finance.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Zhu and Howard heard plans of Australian
entrepreneurs to further bilateral cooperation in energy, mining
industry, finance, insurance and livestock products.
</P>
<P>
They also discussed cooperative possibilities in environmental
protection, sanitation, wool products and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Both Zhu and Howard hold that the two governments should
further encourage their business people to strengthen mutual
cooperation in various industries, while facing the international
market and raising bilateral economic and trade relations to a new
level.
</P>
<P>
This evening, Howard met here with Vice-Minister of State
Education Commission Wei Yu and dozens of students from
Beijing University.
</P>
<P>

JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
today asked the people who will nominate him for another term of
office to take his age into account.
</P>
<P>
"Please take my age into account because I will be 77," the
chairman of the Indonesian National Youth Committee (KNPI),
Maulana Isman, quoted Soeharto as saying, after their meeting.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto will be 77 next year when the People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR) convenes to elect the president for the 1998-2002
term.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto was responding to the committee's wish to nominate him
for another term of office.
</P>
<P>
He said the committee's proposal to nominate him could generate
assumptions among foreigners that the nomination has been
engineered to maintain the "status quo."
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government is preparing the May 29 general
election during which the three political parties -- the ruling
Golkar, the United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) are vying for 425 of the 500 seats of the
House of Representatives. The remaining 75 are reserved for the
armed forces, whose members do not vote in the election.
</P>
<P>
Soeharto became acting president in 1967 and assumed full
leadership the following year. In 1972, he was elected as
president by the People's Consultative Assembly which was
established by the 1971 general election.
</P>
<P>
So far, Soeharto has been elected five times.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Algeria's security forces have since
last Saturday been launching a large operation against a jungle
used as a hiding place by Islamic militants, the Agence
France-Presse (AFP) reported.
</P>
<P>
The jungle is near Tizi-ouzou, 100 kilometers east of the
Algerian capital city of Algiers.
</P>
<P>
AFP quoted travelers as saying that military helicopters were
used to bomb the Islamists hiding in the Sidi Ali Bounab jungle
overlooking the communes of Naciria, Tadmait and Draa Ben-Khedda,
all of which were surrounded by the security forces.
</P>
<P>
The Sidi Ali Bounab jungle is known to be a hiding place of the
Islamists who take shelter in the dense forests there and use the
place as a base to launch terrorist attacks in Algiers.
</P>
<P>
Security forces have already launched a number of operations
there.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security forces killed about 20 Islamists in another
operation which is still going on today in an undisclosed place,
the Algerian daily El Watan said.
</P>
<P>
Algeria's security forces have been attacking Islamic militants
since February, sometimes accompanied with bombings upon alleged
targets of Islamists in the regions of Medea in the south, Saida
and Sidi Bel Abbes in the southwest, and Tlemcen in the west.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian government has published no official reports on
the casualties of these operations, but the number of people
killed are estimated at hundreds.
</P>
<P>
Algeria will hold legislative elections on June 5.

<HEADLINE> One More Palestinian Killed By Israelis in West Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- One more Palestinian university
student was killed by Israeli soldiers in the West Bank today,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Al-Najah University student, the third Palestinian youth
killed by Israeli soldiers with a week, was participating in an
anti-Israeli demonstration near Qouseen Village at the junction
between Nablus and Qalqilya.
</P>
<P>
During the clashes between the Palestinian protesters and
Israeli solders, the student, whose name is not yet identified,
was killed and 11 others were injured by live ammunition and tear
gas fired by Israeli sodliers.
</P>
<P>
Kamel Sidqi Zarou, a 20-year-old resident of Hebron, was
shot dead by Israeli soldiers near the Kiryat Arba Settlement
outside Hebron earlier today.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Abdullah Salah, a 20-year-old Bir Zeit University
student of engineering, was killed by Israeli gunshots at the
Arak Checkpoint near the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Today's killings came after Arab League foreign ministers
recommended, at their annual meeting in the Egyptian capital of
Cairo Monday, the Arab states to cease the normalization of
relations with Israel and restore the economic boycott of the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
The decision shows that the Arab-Israeli relations, the
Palestinian-Israeli ties in particular, have sunk into a deep
crisis as a result of the Israeli government's policy of
settlement.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government last month gave the green light to the
ground-breaking of 6,500 new Jewish homes in Har Homa of East
Jerusalem, arousing protest and anger of the Arabs and the
Palestinians in particular. The Palestinians want to have
Jerusalem as the capital of their future independent Palestinian
state.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Emergency Humanitarian Aid for Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC) said
today it would provide Albania with a package of humanitarian aid
worth 2 million ECU (about 2.28 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Some Albanians have been suffering from extreme hardship over
the past few weeks due to a crisis in Albania, which is the
poorest country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
A mission send by the European Union (EU) to Albania has found
that the people living in state institutions such as hospitals,
orphanages and homes for the elderly or the handicapped, are
suffering most.
</P>
<P>
The EC promised food, medicine and medical supplies for about
10,000 Albanians, adding that foodstuffs including wheat, rice,
sugar and pasta would be distributed to more people in need across
the country.
</P>
<P>
The aid is expected to be managed by the EC Humanitarian
Office, with the coordination of the International Committee of
the Red Cross and the Albanian Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
The EU has been deeply concerned over security problems in its
humanitarian operations in Albania after an Italian medical staff
was reportedly held hostage by unidentified rebels in the southern
port of Vlore.
</P>
<P>
The EC stressed that the supplies for Albania would be
protected from looting and the safety of relief staff must be
guaranteed.

<HEADLINE> Privatization Earnings Rise in Arab States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Earnings from privatization in the
Arab countries soared by almost 50 percent of the 1995 figure
thanks to their successful restructuring of the state companies.
</P>
<P>
The total revenue increased to 138 billion U.S. dollars in
1996 from 94 billion dollars in 1995, according to a report of
the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The IMF report has been drafted by its regional bureau in the
Egyptian capital of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian Middle East News Agency (MENA) quoted today the
report by the world financial body as attributing the
phenomenal performance to the success by a big number of Arab
countries in restructuring their companies thus investors have
been attracted to purchase them.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Fund sounded alarm against the spiraling
capital outflows of the Arab world, which stood at 78 billion
dollars in 1996, a 9.4 percent rise over that in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The European Union countries took the best part of the cake,
followed by the United States while some African states came the
third in this respect.
</P>
<P>
Financial inflows into the Arab countries registered only a
slight increase of 2 percent, reaching 52 billion dollars in
1996, according to the report.

<P>
FREETOWN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- There ''have still not been any
demand or statement'' from the breakaway Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) group which captured five top members of the rebel
movement Saturday in eastern Sierra Leone, a RUF member here said
today.
</P>
<P>
Also captured were Sierra Leone's Ambassador to Guinea Mohamed
Diaby and four Guinean security officials, Ms Agnes Deen Jalloh,
a RUF member in Freetown, disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources said the men are being held at a heavily
fortified rebel base in the Kailahun district by field commanders
who back Foray Sankoh who is now under house arrest in Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh was sacked by senior RUF members as the leader of the
rebel group and the commanders lured them into a trap and seized
them as hostages, earlier reports said.
</P>
<P>
According to Deen Jalloh, ''the situation is disturbing but we
hope for a settlement soon.''
</P>
<P>
''Although there has not been any direct contact, all those
captured are still alive and have not been molested,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Commission for the Consolidation of Peace
(CCP) Desmond Luke said in an interview with Xinhua, ''the
situation is being closely monitored by the governments of Sierra
Leone, Guinea and Cote d'Ivoire.''
</P>
<P>
''We look forward to a breakthrough and get the peace process
back on track. This is an unfortunate development, '' he added.
</P>
<P>
The CCP was set up after the signing of the Abidjan accord
last November to monitor and work out modalities for peace in the
west African state after six years of rebel war.

<HEADLINE> Australian Prime Minister Sees China Trip Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister John
Howard said here today that his visit to China has been "highly
successful," with achievements in expanding links between the two
countries both at government and business levels.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference in the Diayutai State Guesthouse
that China and Australia have "strong, sensible relations" built
on the twin pillars of mutual interest and mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
"Australia's national interests lie in sensibly and
realistically fostering these relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the highest priority of his first visit to China
as Prime Minister was to establish and strengthen personal
relations with the Chinese leaders, including Premier Li Peng and
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
"Economic links between the two countries have been greatly
deepened and broadened as a consequence of the visit," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of the senior business delegation
accompanying him have established and furthered contact with their
Chinese counterparts. Bilateral economic cooperation has been
expanded from the traditional fields of primary products and
manufacturing to service industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that many aspects of Sino-Australian cooperation can be
attributed to the fact that the two countries' economies are
highly complementary. Australia has always been a strong and
reliable supplier of raw materials to China, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Australian government and the Australian
business sector will work together to pursue trade interests in
dealing with governments and businesses of other countries.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Australia does not view China as a
threat. He said that the two countries should have an effective
framework to deal with possible difficulties and differences in a
way that does not damage their broad relations.

<HEADLINE> Senior Official Urges Science to Marry With Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Chinese State Councillor Chen
Junsheng has called on scientists to do more to help poor people
shed poverty and improve their quality of life.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an ongoing conference on the use of science and
technology in the work to help the needy, Chen urged scientific
and technological circles to plunge into the nationwide campaign
against poverty, and give full rein to the two fields as the
primary means of changing the patterns of economic growth in poor
areas.
</P>
<P>
China now has a poor population of 58 million, mainly
distributed over remote or stony mountainous areas, cold areas,
the Loess Plateau and regions plagued by natural disasters, adding
to the difficulty of poverty relief, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts must be redoubled to help 17 million people out of
poverty annually in the next three-plus years, he said. It is far
from adequate just to send science and technology to poor areas --
raising the ability of poor people to develop themselves by
relying on science and technology is most important, he said.
</P>
<P>
Steps should be taken to help poor areas work out scientific
plans for economic development, to transform and upgrade their
traditional industry and product mix, and to turn their natural
resources into economic results, he said.
</P>
<P>
New industrial systems should be set up in poor areas to link
small production to big markets, thus speeding up the process of
the projects to help the needy, he said.

<HEADLINE> Kevin Johnson Named NBA Player of Week </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Kevin Johnson of the Phoenix Suns
was on Tuesday named the Nation Basketball Association (NBA)
player of the Week for last week.
</P>
<P>
Johnson led Phoenix to a 4-0 record during the week by
averaging 27.5 points, 9.0 assists and 3.8 rebounds per game, the
NBA said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
He was .480 (12 for 25) from three-point range and .968 (30 for
31) from the free throw line. He ranked fourth in scoring and tied
for eighth in assists among league leaders for the week.
</P>
<P>
Johnson began the week's competition last Tuesday with 28
points, 10 assists, six rebounds and two blocked shots as Phoenix
beat Milwaukee 117-112.
</P>
<P>
The 10-year veteran made a career high six three-point field
goals last Wednesday, had a game-high 31 points as the Suns won at
Seattle and had a season-high 38 points in the victory against
Golden State on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Phoenix, which began the season 0-13, had won six consecutive
games and has the seventh-best record (33-39) din the Western
Conference, two games behind Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
If Phoenix maintains its position and qualifies for the
playoffs, the Suns will surpass the 1967-68 Chicago Bulls (0-9)
and 1984-85 Cleveland Cavaliers (0-9) for the worst start in NBA
history for any team that proceeded to make the playoffs.

<HEADLINE> Motorola Finances Dropouts in China's Poor Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Motorola, one of the leading US
electronics and telecommunications suppliers, today donated three
million yuan to Project Hope, a non-governmental charity that
supports millions of dropouts in China's poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
The Motorola donation will be used to set up 19 Hope schools in
underdeveloped areas and train teachers there.
</P>
<P>
Xu Yongguang, secretary general of the China Youth Development
Foundation which is responsible for promoting the project
nationwide, said at the donation ceremony that since it was kicked
off in 1989, Project Hope has helped 1.5 million children return
to school, and built more than 3,600 Hope primary schools.
</P>
<P>
Donations to the program from inside China and overseas have
amounted to about one billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the project plans to expand its funding scale and
give more extensive support to the school dropouts during the next
four years, when the country will "basically resolve the poverty
problem and realize the goal of universal compulsory nine-year
education."
</P>
<P>
"We hope to get more support from both in China and overseas,
and will take good care of every donation and every project to
ensure that the donors' goodwill will be cherished and fully
realized." Xu said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that among the school-age population
of 6 to 14-year-olds there remain 30 million youngsters who don't
go to school.
</P>
<P>
Richard Galvin, chairman of the Motorola executive committee,
said that before this donation, Motorola had poured six million
yuan into Project Hope. Such contributions to China's education
and welfare sectors will be further extended as the company
continues its long-term development in China.
</P>
<P>
At another donation ceremony here today, Motorola announced the
launching of a special scholarship in eight Chinese universities,
including the prestigious Beijing, Qinghua and Fudan universities,
and provided them with a combined two million yuan-worth of
PowerPCs, one of the most sophisticated personal computer brands.

<HEADLINE> Ganges Water Flow Hits Season's Low in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The water flow to Bangladesh of the
river Ganges has hit a new low during the current season and there
is no apparent sign of improvement in the availability of water,
according to Water Development Board sources.
</P>
<P>
The availability of water during the last 10-day slot of March
was not more than 12 to 13 cusecs (cubic per seconds) on an
average while as per the Ganges water sharing treaty signed on
last December Bangladesh is supposed to get an average of 29,688
cusecs per day during the period, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
On March 27 this year, the water flow at the Hardinge bridge
point was only 6,457 cusecs, while it was 9,313 cusecs on March
29, the sources said, adding the available data shows that the
water flow during these two days last year was 27,934 cusecs and
26,733 cusecs respectively.
</P>
<P>
A joint river commission official told reporters that
investigation was going on in this regard to determine why the
availability of water had fallen below the expected level.
</P>
<P>
The matter would be brought to the notice of the Indian Water
Resources Minister during his forthcoming visit to Dhaka from
April 9, the official added.
</P>
<P>
India agreed to duly share the Ganges water flow with
Bangladesh in a "historic" 30-year water sharing treaty when
Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina visited New Delhi in last
December.

<HEADLINE> West African Peacekeepers in Liberia Underpaid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- West African peacekeepers operating
in Liberia, known as ECOMOG, from commander to private, are each
paid five U.S. Dollars per day, according to the Nigerian Tribune
today.
</P>
<P>
This compares with the 200-Dollar daily payment for members of
the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL).
</P>
<P>
As a result of the sharp contrast in allowances, reported
Chris Agbambu, a Nigerian Tribune correspondent who just came
back from Monrovia, the Liberian capital, the UNOMIL troops are
living in great affluence while ECOMOG soldiers just make ends
meet.
</P>
<P>
The wide disparity in allowances is also responsible for the
different attitudes of both contingents to the disarmament
process.
</P>
<P>
The UN team is said to be disposed towards longer stay in the
war-torn country, while the Nigeria-led ECOMOG has insisted on
finishing the task at hand leaving Liberia.
</P>
<P>
According to the independent daily newspaper, only a week to
the November 22, 1996 disarmament date, the UNOMIL suggested to
postpone the exercise till January 1997.
</P>
<P>
But ECOMOG Commander Major-General Victor Maly insisted to go
ahead even by ECOMOG itself if the UN mission was not ready,
because "the six West African countries that make up ECOMOG are
not as comfortable as they (UNOMIL) are in Liberia," it said,
quoting the Nigerian general.
</P>
<P>
To date, disarmament of Liberia's more than 30,000 former
factional fighters has been completed successfully, and the
country's general and presidential elections will be held on May
30 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UNOMIL will extend its stay in Liberia until
after the May 30 polls so that it can monitor the elections
together with the Organization of African Unity and the Economic
Community of West African States.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Adopts 1997 Investment Priorities Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government today
approved the 1997 Investment Priorities Plan, which is aimed at
further boosting the economy.
</P>
<P>
President Fidel Ramos gave the go-signal for the plan "subject
to some refinements in certain areas following the discussions
during this afternoon's cabinet meeting," the presidential palace
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The plan contains 32 areas of preferred economic activities,
including export industries, manufacturing, agriculture, food and
forestry, textiles, chemical products, infrastructure development,
environment protection and mining, it said.
</P>
<P>
Of the 32 areas, the presidential palace said, 28 are carried
over from the 1996 plan. The four new inclusions are feeds
production, pulp and paper, book publishing and fish production,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Investments in the Philippines last year rose to 490 billion
pesos (18.6 billion U.S. dollars), an increase of 20 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The government attributed the increase to the favorable
investment climate in the country and the surging economy.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has scaled down its investment growth
target of this year to 13 percent, almost 3 percentage points
below the 1996 target.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Foreign Debt Likely to Hit Record High in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, April 1 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's foreign debt in 1997
is predicted to reach 144.4 billion U.S. dollars, surpassing
Mexico's 1994 figure in a foreign debt crisis, a private research
institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The Hyundai Research Institute predicted that the country's
foreign debt for this year would increase 30.1 percent over last
year and account for 25-30 percent of the gross domestic product
(GDP).
</P>
<P>
The institute said that a sharp rise in foreign debt is likely
to cause price hikes and heavier debt-servicing burden as well as
a serious foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Korea had earlier forecast that the country's
foreign debt in 1997 would reach 140.4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Institute of Finance also warned of a foreign
exchange crisis resulting from a rapid capital outflow.
</P>
<P>
It said that the rising current-account deficit and growing
ratio of short-term debt are likely to increase the possibility of
a temporary but sharp capital outflow designed to sidestep foreign
exchange risk.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Mexico's foreign debt totaled 136.5 billion dollars,
representing 35 percent of the GDP, while its foreign currency
reserves stood at 6.44 billion dollars, leading to a serious
foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Korea Institute of Finance said that with the continuing
devaluation of the Korean won, the high growth rate of local
currency and dwindling foreign exchange reserves, South Korea has
been close to a foreign exchange crisis.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean government is expected to take measures to
avoid a foreign exchange crisis similar to that in Mexico, reports
said.
</P>
<P>
However, experts said that the country's economy could face
difficulties if banking institutions are saddled with huge loans
in the course of the rise and fall of the economic bubble arising
from currency expansion.
</P>
<P>
They suggested that the government take measures to cut back on
import and reduce the current-account deficit so as to revive the
national economy.

<HEADLINE> HK Slow in Transfer to Environment-friendly Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong is trailing Europe in
the introduction of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) as an
alternative fuel for vehicles, Hong Kong Standard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The technology had been used for more than 40 years in Europe,
Ho Kwong-wai, assistant director of Electrical and Mechanical
Services, said.
</P>
<P>
Ho is a member of an Environmental Protection Department-led
task force which studies the use of LPG to reduce air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The task force is considering a plan to phase out Hong Kong's
18,000 diesel taxis and replace them with more expensive LPG-run
vehicles, he said.
</P>
<P>
The particles emitted from vehicles would be reduced by 30
percent and engine noise level also lowered if the plan succeeded.
</P>
<P>
But the plan may be strongly opposed by taxi operators and
drivers because of the capital cost.
</P>
<P>
The government will conduct a pilot scheme using 20 brand-new
LPG-run taxis early next year, and the task force will look into
the reaction of drivers and passengers, and the incentives that
can be introduced during the one-year trial.

<P>
JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto is
expected to realize the establishment of a NAM (Non-Aligned
Movement) center for south-south technical cooperation soon in
Jakarta, capital of Indonesia, a senior official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Nana Sutresna, presidential aide for Non-Aligned Movement (NAM)
affairs, said the establishment of NAM's center for south-south
cooperation was a joint project of Indonesia and Brunei
Darussalam.
</P>
<P>
"If south countries succeed in development, their economies
will invariably grow more rapidly so that they will also be able
to develop themselves and no longer need aid from western donor
countries or the World Bank," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said President Soeharto wished to create a new face of NAM
member countries which have been concentrating on economic
development to realize the Bandung principles to live in peaceful
co-existence.
</P>
<P>
The presence of the center, he added, was expected to help
south countries which are still in need of technical and financial
assistance in carrying out development.
</P>
<P>
President Soeharto proposed to form the center in 1995 at the
ministerial conference of the NAM Coordinating Bureau in Bandung,
West Java.

-- Closing its national congress in Strasbourg on Monday, the

presenting its program for the 1998 legislative elections to
seduce the ordinary people, the middle-class, the small
businessmen and Catholic fundamentalists.
</P>

forward the hypothesis of a conspiracy against his client.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Impose Measures to Control Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Tough measures to control
water usage, which tighten up on the consumption of households
and local authorities, are set to become law within months, local
daily "The Star" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the National Water Supply Regulations proposed by the
Water Affairs Department, people are banned to water gardens,
sports fields or lawns between October and March.
</P>
<P>
There will be a nationwide and total ban on hosing down
pavements or any other hardened area, which, the report said,
would put the businesses that use high-powered hoses to clean
fouled pavements daily in a very difficult position.
</P>
<P>
In addition, local authorities will also have to comply with
the regulations, and will no longer be allowed to water public
gardens and lawns during the hot part of the day in summer.
</P>
<P>
Other regulations include a ban on installing a shower head
with a maximum flow rate of more than 10 liters a minute, and car
washes will have to ensure that 70 percent of water is recycled.
</P>
<P>
Neil Macleod, chairman of the National Water Regulations
Drafting Committee, said many South African people are used to
using water as if this were a water-rich country.
</P>
<P>
"We urgently need to change people's behavior from a
free-and-easy approach of using as much water as they like",
Macleod said, stressing that "we are an arid country, comparable
with Israel, and these regulations are the first step in a
national process to conserve water".
</P>
<P>
"In about five years we will have to introduce stringent
regulations, such as tariff hikes and compelling people to fit
water-saving devices," Macleod said.
</P>
<P>
He said the old Water Act of 1956 will be replaced by two new
acts, the Water Services Act and the Water Resources Act, which
are due to go before parliament this month.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Slightly Higher On Japanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
slightly firmer as buying by Japanese names strengthened the
currency while Commonwealth bond prices fell because of fears of
higher US interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The local unit closed at 78.77 US cents from 78.63 at
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
The increase last week in US interest rates has narrowed the
difference between US official rate, now 5.5 percent, and the
official Australian rate of 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
This has led to speculation that Australian securities will be
less attractive, lessening demand for the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
But traders said, there had been demand for the currency by
Japanese names today, the first day of the new financial year in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Against Japanese yen, the local unit ended at 97.37 from 97.16
and against Deutsche mark it was at 1.3150 from 1.3202.

<HEADLINE> Adoption of Amendment Bill Momentous Occasion: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan said here today the adoption of the 13th amendment bill
by both houses of the parliament in one day is a momentous
occasion.
</P>
<P>
Giving his reaction in the parliament house, he said it was
significant that both the National Assembly and the Senate passed
the bill unanimously.
</P>
<P>
The new bill would help strengthen democratic institutions and
put democracy on a proper path, he said.
</P>
<P>
It would also lend continuity to institutions which would
result in proper development planning, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Foreign Minister said that over the past ten years, four
assemblies were dissolved which created uncertainty in political
institutions and disrupted planning programs.
</P>
<P>
The bill, he said, would put an end to uncertainty and also
slam the door on those who try to get into power through backdoor
or intrigue.
</P>
<P>
On the foreign secretary level talks with India, Ayub Khan said
these were a beginning.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to talk, we talk from a position of strength
because of the massive mandate given to the government by the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question, he said he would be visiting the United
States in May.
</P>
<P>
Answering another question, he said Pakistan would soon post a
new ambassador in Russia and later he would visit Moscow.
</P>
<P>
He said the Prime Minister's visit might take place afterwards.
</P>
<P>
"We want to have good dialogue with Russia as it has a great
trade potential," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, April 1 (Xinhua) -- About seven billion U.S. dollars
worth of agricultural produce is destroyed in Africa every year
by genus striga, a parasitic weed which damages food crops,
according to a research report.
</P>
<P>
The report of the Nigeria-based International Institute for
Tropical Agriculture (IITA), which is made known today, said that
as many as 30 to 35 known species of the striga are present in
west and central Africa.
</P>
<P>
To effectively control the weeds, inexpensive remedial
measures, tailored to the needs of African cropping system, must
be developed, it suggests.
</P>
<P>
According to IITA, traditional African cropping systems, which
include prolonged fallow, rotations and inter-cropping, encourage
the breeding of the weeds.

<HEADLINE> Major Remains Ready for TV Debate With Blair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major
said on Tuesday he was still willing to go for a TV election
debate with Labor Party leader Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
"We the Conservative Party have accepted the terms of the
broadcasters' proposals as they stand even though they are not
perfect from our point of view," Major said in a campaign news
conference.
</P>
<P>
Major accepted an election debate with Blair on March 16 after
the latter requested repeatedly for such an American-style
televised campaign. But the debate seems running to a dead end
after the two parties were at loggerheads over formation of the
debate.
</P>
<P>
"Turkeys may not vote for Christmas, but chickens apparently
run away from broadcasters," Major said.
</P>
<P>
Labor Party enjoys at least a 20-point lead in the opinion
polls and seems set to topple the Conservative Party which has
ruled Britain over the past 18 years in the May election.
</P>
<P>
But political analysts believe Blair has little to win from the
televised debate, which would be the first in British electoral
history, while Major has nothing to lose.

KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Juma Oris, Ugandan rebel leader
of the West Nile Bank Front (WNBF), has fled to Sudanese capital
of Khartoum, "The New Vision" reported here today.
</P>
<P>
He was wounded on March 12 in an ambush launched by Sudan
People's Liberation Army (SPLA). But he survived the ambush and
managed to reach southern Sudanese city of Juba.
</P>
<P>
Security officers here failed to identify the reason why
Sudanese sent the rebel leader to their capital.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports from southern Sudan said the fighting between
the SPLA and the government troops of Sudan is carried out some
55 kilometers south-west of Juba, south Sudan, and the SPLA is
systematically closing to the city from all directions.
</P>
<P>
Sam Caku, another WHBF leader, who is deputy political
commissar, arrived Khartoum earlier.
</P>
<P>
But Abdallatif Tia, still another WNBF rebel leader, is held
by the SPLA with his 518 subordinates.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA were to hand over the captured rebels to the Ugandan
authorities through the International Committee of Red Cross, but
Uganda asked the SPLA to hand over them directly.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the Ugandan army killed 13, captured
eight rebels of the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) in western
Kasese district last Sunday.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Patriot's 100-Year-Old Wish Finally Comes True (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- When Lin Zexu, a patriotic lord of
the Qing Dynasty (1368-1644), resisted British attempts to force
opium on the Chinese. His official career ended in disgrace, but
now his wish of over a century ago will come true this July.
</P>
<P>
In 1839, when Britain forced China to become hooked on opium,
Lin, who was an imperial commissioner, led the move to ban opium
in the south China city of Guangzhou, and destroyed some 20,000
cases of opium seized from the British. In retaliation, the
British colonialists, reacting to the ban on the opium trade,
invaded China with their naval vessels and armed forces, starting
the Opium War.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the court of the Qing Dynasty was defeated and was
forced to cede Hong Kong to the British.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zexu, who was regarded as far-sighted and patriotic by some
Western critics, was exiled to northwestern China's Xinjiang by
the ineffectual Qing government.
</P>
<P>
A century later, Lin Zexu's great great-grandson, Ling Qing,
who served as Chinese ambassador to the United Nations in the
1980s, acting with his British counterpart, submitted the
Sino-British Joint Declaration, stating that China would resume
the exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, to
the UN deputy secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
"This is a historical coincidence," Ling Qing noted, explaining
that "China can take back Hong Kong and fulfil my ancestor's
wish at the same time, mainly because our country is becoming
prosperous and stronger."
</P>
<P>
On a hillside in Fuzhou, the capital of east China's Fujian
Province, one can find Lin's tomb. His great-great-grandson said
poignantly, "The Lin family members have always come to worship
our ancestors every Pure and Bright Festival. The return of Hong
Kong to the embrace of the motherland on July 1 of this year will
finally accomplish the wish of our ancestor."

<P>
Ling Qing is a descendant of Lin Gongshu, Lin Zexu's third
son. His father, Lin Busui, served as an official of the court of
late Qing Dynasty and in the goverment of the Northern
Warlords. Ling took part in the War of Resistance against Japanese
Aggression, and was involved in political activities and foreign
affairs. At that time he changed his name from Lin Moqing.
</P>
<P>
After the founding of the People's Republic of China, Ling
became one of the first generation of new Chinese diplomats and
was a witness to the tremendous changes that took place in Chinese
society, economy, and foreign affairs. And he became Chinese
ambassador to the UN in 1980.
</P>
<P>
Ling said that new China has gained extensive recognition and
respect from the world community, and is playing a more important
role in international affairs, especially since the reform and
opening-up.
</P>
<P>
It is because of this that Hong Kong can be returned smoothly
to the motherland, he noted.
</P>
<P>
As a veteran diplomat, Ling believes that a major factor for
the smooth resolution is the "one country, two systems" concept,
and says that Hong Kong's smooth transition will certainly succeed
and that Hong Kong will become more prosperous and stable after
the return.
</P>
<P>
The 74-year-old Ling is now vice-chairman of the Subcommittee
of Foreign Affairs of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference National Committee. Whenever he returns to his hometown
of Fuzhou, he goes to Lin Zexu's birth place, the old family

forward the staunch spirit of the older generation to resist
foreign agression, Ling says.

<TEXT>

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, April 1 (Xinhua) -- German President Roman
Herzog arrived here today for a five-day state visit to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The German leader is being accompanied by a 100-member
delegation including former soccer maestro Franz Beckenbauer for
his first official visit here.
</P>
<P>
He was accorded a red-carpet welcome upon his arrival at the
Kuala Lumpur International Airport and was then whisked away to
Parliament Square here for the official welcoming ceremony where
he was received by Malaysian King Tuanku Ja'afar and Prime

who is now Bayern Munich FC president.
</P>
<P>
Herzog wraps up his state visit with a trip to Sarawak, East
Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
Germany is Malaysia's leading European trade partner after
Britain. Malaysia, in turn, is Germany's third largest trade
partner in Southeast Asia after Singapore and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Trade between the two countries increased from 3.33 billion
ringgit (about 1.332 billion US dollars) in 1987 to 12.728 billion
ringgit (about 5.0912 billion US dollars) in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia is also an increasingly popular destination for
German tourists whose arrivals have more than doubled from 28,000
in 1987 to over 80,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Investment by German companies in Malaysia is expected to
surge to 6 billion ringgit (about 2.4 billion US dollars) in the
next two years against about 1.617 billion ringgit (about 646.8
million US dollars) from Germany already invested in Malaysia for
the period 1980 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The German president will proceed to Japan after his five-day
visit to Malaysia.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Communications, which
was founded in 1908 and re-established in 1987, has had some
remarkable achievements in commercializing its operations by
focusing on management, quality, and risk-control.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the bank's assets stood at 397.88 billion
yuan, with its deposits totaling 251.96 billion yuan, and loans,
179.16 billion yuan, bank sources say.
</P>

The bank has generated a total of 40 billion yuan in pre-tax
profits and paid 12.8 billion yuan in interest to stock-holders
over the past decade.
</P>
<P>
Since its rebirth, the bank has worked hard at becoming a

first in the country to be owned by central and local governments
as well as by a number of state-owned institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Macao Lifts Ban on Import of Migrant Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Macao Government has lifted a
19-month ban on the import of migrant labor for the textile and
garment-making industry.
</P>
<P>
A government gazette published on Monday says that all those
textile and garment-making factories intending to hire migrant
workers from outside Macao can apply between April 15 and April
30.
</P>
<P>
Textile and garment-making accounts for more than 70 percent of
 the exports of Macao.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was greeted with mixed reaction as factory
owners and trade unions still disagree on the import of migrant
labor.
</P>
<P>
Many factory owners applauded the resumption of import of
migrant labor, saying that they have suffered losses due to severe
shortage of workers.
</P>
<P>
They also urged the government to lift ban on migrant workers
which are needed by some other economic sectors such as hotels and
restaurants so as to push local economy out of the doldrums.
</P>
<P>
But local trade unions complained that the coming of migrant
labor will aggravate the jobless rate, saying the government has
not done enough in the training of local labor and that more than
7,000 people are still out of job.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that the jobless rate dropped to 3.4
percent during the period between December 1996 and February
1997. It hit the highest of 4.6 percent last year.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Wipe Out Leprosy by 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Leprosy is to be eradicated in
Vietnam by the turn of the century, official reports said here
today.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports of the Institute of Dermatology,
Vietnam is one of the 80 countries in the world with a high
proportion of lepers.
</P>
<P>
Since late 1995, patients detected in the country have been
given proper treatment with the majority cured completely.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 63 lepers per 100,000 persons at the
national level and 17 of the 61 provinces still have 121 to 383
leprosy patients per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam has a population of more than 70 million.
</P>
<P>
The number of lepers detected in a single year declined to
4,743 in 1996 from 36,616 in 1983.
</P>
<P>
To eradicate the disease by the year 2000, leprosy awareness
are to be disseminated throughout the country to encourage people
to voluntarily have check-ups and treatment with the governmental
public health sector acting as the driving force.

<HEADLINE> Inflation in March Estimated at 4.4 Percent in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The inflation rate for March in the
Philippines will settle at 4.4 percent, the same level of last
month, Economic Development Secretary Cielito Habito said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Habito attributed the expected low-level inflation to stability
of food prices and lower prices of petroleum products in the
month.
</P>
<P>
"There was nothing extraordinary that would deviate the
inflation significantly both on month-on-month and year-on-year,"
Habito said.
</P>
<P>
Inflation rate in February hit an all-time low for 10 years at
4.4 percent, the second time since last September, despite the
recent wage adjustment and the full deregulation of the oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
Habito traced the lower-than-expected inflation to the
government's efficiency in ensuring price increase commensurate to
the actual cost increases.
</P>
<P>
He said economic planners, however, expect the inflation rate
to go up slightly during the second half of the year, as a result
of higher inflation during the same period of 1996.

<HEADLINE> 5 Percent Consumption Tax Becomes Effective in Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Prices for almost all goods and
services sold in Japan went up as the consumption tax rose for the
first time to five percent today.
</P>
<P>
The tax had been three percent since its introduction in April
1989. Half of the two percentage point increase is to be levied as
a local consumption tax.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with the termination of two trillion Japanese yen worth
of special reductions in income and residential taxes, taxpayers
are expected to end up in paying seven trillion yen in additional
taxes in fiscal 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to Finance Ministry calculations, the increased
consumption tax burden on a family of four with a yearly income of
seven million yen (56,900 U.S. dollars) will come to roughly
67,000 yen (544 U.S. dollars) annually.
</P>
<P>
But some private think tanks have put the figure higher, and
concerns remain that the increased tax burden could dampen
consumers' spending during the first half of fiscal 1997 and lower
economic growth figures for the fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The government's economic forecast, released in December, took
into account the probability of a slowdown in growth due to the
tax changes and put real growth for fiscal 1997 at 1.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, consumers' rush to buy goods ahead of the tax hike was
generally less than anticipated, and officials at the Finance
Ministry and the Economic Planning Agency (EPA) predicted that
spending during the April-June months will not slacken as much as
initially feared.
</P>
<P>
One EPA official said that while there were signs of
last-minute purchases of relatively expensive items, such as homes
and automobiles, in the months preceding the tax hike, it was not
as marked as the shopping spree seen on the eve of the
introduction of the consumption tax eight years ago.

<HEADLINE> Official: Impact of Pollution by Gulf War Needs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The long-term effect on human
health by air pollution caused by oil-well flames during the 1991
Gulf War needs to be monitored, a senior official of a Kuwaiti
environment body said.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Al-Muzaini, director of the Environmental Sciences
Department at the Kuwait Institute for Scientific Research
(KISR), made the remarks in his exclusive interview with the
local daily Arab Times, which was published today.
</P>
<P>
He said the studies by the environmental department showed "a
diminishing of the atmospheric pollution has been observed after
the oil fires were extinguished, but the effects of exposure on
human health needs to be monitored carefully through properly
designed epidemiological studies."
</P>
<P>
He said his department had so far completed about 24 critical
research projects while detailed studies on 19 other projects
were underway.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the oil-soaked soil remediation, he said
biotechnological studies had been conducted for detoxification
and effective utilization of nearly 20 million tonnes of
oil-impregnated sand.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, "Bioremediation efforts for the clean-up of the
oil contaminated desert soil in Kuwait are promising in our
laboratory tests," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the environment official said an analysis of the dust
samples at present in comparison with post-war ones "might show
contamination with hazardous chemicals," but no prediction could
be made about its toxicity as their effects could be observed
only after a long period.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf War resulted in one of the worst environmental
catastrophes in the history of the mankind. About 6 to 8 million
barrels of crude oil were released into the sea as well as the
desert areas in Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Around 800 oil wells in Kuwait remained burning for several
months emitting huge quantities of pollutants to the atmosphere,
and 60 million barrels of crude oil gushed from the burning
wells, thus creating oil pools over a vast area of the desert
land.
</P>
<P>
The KISR organized an international conference last November
to study and exchange information about the long-term effects of
the Gulf War on the environment in the Gulf region and other
parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
Presentations made at the conference showed that progress in
the understanding of many aspects of the impact of the Gulf War
on the environment has been made.
</P>
<P>
But the fact that conclusive statements regarding long-term
effects are still premature was shared by participants of the
conference.

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia expressed
support for resolutions adopted at Arab League ministerial
conference that called on the Arab states to freeze relations with
the Jewish state to press it scrap its settlement policy.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi cabinet in a meeting Monday night condemned the
Israeli practices and asserted that settlement policy constituted
violations of the Middle East peace process launched in Madrid in
1991, Saudi Press Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet especially denounced Israel's construction of a
new Jewish settlement in East Jerusalem and warned that such
"policies would result in dangerous effects on the peace
process."
</P>
<P>
Arab foreign ministers held a two-day meeting in Cairo and
adopted a resolution at the end of the meeting Monday night to
reactivate the economic boycott of Israel, stop normalization
steps, close Israeli offices and missions and pull out of
multilateral talks on aspects of Mideast peace.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to press
ahead with the construction of the settlement defying the
world-wide criticism of the move.
</P>
<P>
Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz has condemned the Israeli plans,
saying that the Israeli policy on Jerusalem is "tantamount to
abrogation of international conventions and Security Council
resolutions."
</P>
<P>
King Fahd also urged the international community to coerce
Israel into stopping the construction of settlements in the
occupied Arab territories.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia does not maintain any official relations with
Israel.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Manufacturer Delivers 500th Boeing 737 Part </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A leading Chinese aircraft
manufacturer completed its 500th vertical stabilizer for the
Boeing 737-300 recently.
</P>
<P>
This means that the cooperation between the Xi'an Aircraft
Industrial (Group) Co. Ltd. (XAIC) and the American company has
entered a new period, according to officials of the two companies
who attended a delivery ceremony in Xi'an, capital of northwest
China's Shaanxi province.
</P>
<P>
The Xi'an company is a development and production base of
medium-size and large aircraft and has cooperated extensively with
foreign businesses since China adopted its reform and opening-up
policy in late 1978.
</P>
<P>
In April 1984, XAIC agreed to produce Boeing 737-300 vertical
stabilizers. The 7.3-m by 3.3-m part weighs 370 kg and consists of
more than 1,200 smaller parts. It is the biggest part on Boeing's
commercial planes that is produced outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
To guarantee quality, XAIC spent 300 million yuan on a
large-scale overhaul of its production facilities and to improve
its quality control system. It completed its first stabilizer in
March 1988.
</P>
<P>
The parts have all met Boeing's quality standards, said an XAIC
official, and the localization rate of the parts is 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
In commenting on the quality of XAIC's products, Boeing said
that it will further expand cooperation with the Chinese partner,
including establishing joint ventures.

<HEADLINE> Controversial Portions of Eighth Amendment Scrapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Senate today
unanimously adopted the Constitution's 13th Amendment Act 1997
scrapping controversial portions of the Eighth Amendment of the
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
The bill passed by 79 votes in favor while none against
encompasses the annulment of Article 58-2 (b) divesting the
president of his powers to dissolve the National Assembly and
dismiss the government.
</P>
<P>
The portions of the Amendment which had taken days to be
adopted was scrapped in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
The clause had empowered the president to dissolve the assembly
when "a situation has arisen in which the government of the
federation cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions
of the Constitution and an appeal to the electorate is necessary."
</P>
<P>
The bill also amends Article 101 of the Constitution regarding
the appointment of provincial governors. The governors would now
be appointed on the advice of the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The bill also amended Article 112 of the Constitution taking
away powers of the governor to dissolve the provincial assembly in
circumstances where a provincial government could not be carried
on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution and an
appeal to the electorate was necessary.
</P>
<P>
Through an amendment to the Article 243 of the Constitution,
the new bill withdraws the powers of the president to appoint "in
his discretion" the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
Committee and Service Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
The Eighth Amendment to the Constitution was made in 1985
during the regime of late President Zia-ul Haq and it has been
used four times ever since.
</P>
<P>
General Zia-ul Haq dissolved the National Assembly on 29th of
May in 1988. President Ghulam Ishaq Khan dismissed Benazir
Bhutto's Government on August 6, 1990 and Nawaz Sharif's
Government on April 18, 1993. Benazir Bhutto's Government again
fell victim to this amendment on November 5, 1996 and the action
of the President was upheld by the Supreme Court on Jan. 29, 1997.

HAIKOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A new industrial base in the
suburbs of Haikou, the capital of China's island province of
Hainan, has become a multi-purpose economic development area for
the provincial export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Five years of infrastructure construction at a cost of 600
million yuan has given some help to the investment environment in

The zone generated nearly 1.9 billion yuan in output value and
400 million yuan in pre-tax profits in 1996. It now has 192
projects, 103 of which are under construction, and 47 that have
gone into operation in the fields of machine-building, building
materials, biology, textiles, electronics, and pharmaceuticals.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Official Decries Effects of SAPs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A trade union official has urged
the Kenyan government to fight against commercialization and
consumerism being promoted by Western countries, according to a
Kenya Times report today.
</P>
<P>
The daily newspaper quoted Boniface Munyao, deputy
secretary-general of the Central Organization of Trade Unions
(COTU), as saying on Monday that the economic ideologies of
Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) are totally foreign to the
African continent.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the effects of the SAPs and other economic
adjustments imposed by Western countries are already felt by
Kenyans.
</P>
<P>
"Already we see the commercialization and consumerism of
everything in the country," said the trade union official, adding
that these two things are terrible to the African communal life.
</P>
<P>
He argued that this is not the right time for restructuring
jobs and employment since the economy has not yet taken off well.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "some of the ideologies brought to us in
essence are meant to stifle us in order not to match them."
</P>
<P>
Munyao pointed out that some leaders in the country only saw
good in the SAPs and not the effects on the ordinary workers and
common people.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the future of the country's economy is bleak if
the economic ideologies imposed by Western countries are fully
followed.

<HEADLINE> College Girl Receives Big Insurance Indemnity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A Shanghai college student,
suffering from severe aplastic anaemia, has received 220,000 yuan
in compensation, from the local branch of the PICC Life.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Life is one of the three subsidiaries of the People's
Insurance Company of China, the country's biggest insurer.
</P>
<P>
This is one of the largest indemnities paid by Chinese
insurance companies over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old student, named Wan Lili, was admitted into the
Shanghai College of Chemical Engineering for professional training
in September, 1995. She was diagnosed with the disease half a year
later.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, Wan paid 36 yuan to buy a medicare insurance
policy on a two-year-term from the PICC Life Shanghai branch on
the day she entered the college.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, her old father would have spent all his savings to
pay his daughter's medical costs.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Life Shanghai branch has paid 222,000 yuan to the girl
from last February to now.
</P>
<P>
The insurance company will have to pay about 100,000 yuan more
to the girl before this September for hospital expenses.

<HEADLINE> Thai PM on Relations with China (Part 1) (by Yu Zuncheng, Xiong Ping) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh said that "Thai-Chinese relations are now moving in
an even smoother and steadier direction."
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Bangkok-based Chinese correspondents
before his official visit to China from April 2 to 5, Chavalit
said, "ties between the two countries are not ordinary ones.
Thailand and China have special relational and brotherly
feelings."
</P>
<P>
This is where Thai-Chinese relations differ from any other
country-to-country relations, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on China's reform and opening up, he said, "Like the
Chinese people, the Thai people are also very happy to see China's
growth and development trend in recent years."
</P>
<P>
Recalling the development of bilateral relations during the
past two decades since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in 1975, the Thai prime minister said that during the
first decade the two counties built mutual understanding and
confidence and they jointly played an active role in maintaining
peace in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said the second decade was one for bilateral cooperation in
economic and social development. The two-way trade increased with
each passing year and China had become a most preferred country
for Thai investors.
</P>
<P>
He said the first ten years in the next century "should be an
important period for furthering their bilateral ties." The two
countries need to work out programs for cooperation in line with
each country's national economic and social development programs.
</P>
<P>
He added that the two countries can also enhance cooperation on
the international arena in the fields of political, economic and
social affairs.
</P>
<P>
Congratulating on China's great achievements in its
modernization efforts and economic reform, Chavalit said that
during the past two decades the living standard of the majority of
the Chinese people had improved and are still improving.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit believed that each country has the right to choose its
own way of carrying out realistic reforms in accordance with the
country's social reality. He also expressed his belief that the
Chinese leadership does not want instability to occur and that
among China's priorities are tapping its economic potentials and
improving the quality of life of the people in hinterland, in
particular the western provinces.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today hailed
the signing of a memorandum of understanding on a submarine
optical cable project between the US's AT&AMP;T and China.

telecommunications and other fields, Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
Allen, who came for the signing ceremony at the invitation of
the Chinese Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications, briefed
Jiang on AT&AMP;T's business developments in China. He noted that
China's rapid economic growth, especially in telecommunications,
has gotten investment from many foreign companies.
</P>
<P>
Allen told Jiang that his current visit has been "very
successful" and that AT&AMP;T is ready to expand mutually beneficial
cooperation with China.

<P>
China's cooperation and close relationship with ASEAN will not
only be beneficial to both sides, but also contribute to the
stability of the Asia-Pacific region, he said.
</P>
<P>
China became a dialogue partner to ASEAN in July 1996 and it is
also a participant in the ASEAN regional forum, Chavalit said,
adding that Thailand is pleased with these because the links will
serve as bridges between China and ASEAN members.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said that geopolitically speaking, China, now a close
neighbor of ASEAN, will be adjacent to the grouping when Myanmar,
Laos and Cambodia join ASEAN in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and ASEAN will be even closer, when
land and waterway transport networks are linked within the
framework of the quadrangle growth area. The networks are expected
to play an important role in strengthening the economic links
between China and ASEAN, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On Thailand's trade links with Hong Kong after July 1, 1997,
Chavalit said, the handover ceremony at midnight of June 30 will
be an important event in China's history.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the handover will help build confidence of the
international community in Hong Kong's future.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Thai government is confident in Hong Kong's
future, believing that the Chinese government will be able to
maintain Hong Kong's stability and prosperity, as well as its
status as an international trade and financial center.
</P>
<P>
After Hong Kong's return to China, Chavalit said, trade between
Thailand and Hong Kong will not be adversely affected, but will
instead grow.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Privatization Victims Obtain Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Victims of Turkey's privatization
drive received a total compensation of 4.12 million U.S. dollars
over the past years, local newspaper Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Out of 4,692 employees, 4,360 applied for compensation after
losing their jobs due to the privatization program and received
the money.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 291.7 million dollars obtained from the
privatization of the state-owned industries is reserved to
increase employment, investment and to pay the debts of the
state-run economic enterprises, the paper quoted financial
sources here as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the "Working Power Adaptation Project", which is
being carried out by the Treasury and aimed at creating new jobs
for the unemployed, is reportedly proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The project, with the support of the World Bank, is of great
significance because it will not only solve the thorny problem
of unemployment in the country but also increase regional
economic development, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The same sources pointed out that the process privatization
should be coordinated with relevant employment measures so as to
decrease the negative effects to the society, because the process
itself is likely to increase unemployment.
</P>
<P>
The privatization process started in 1984 in Turkey but it
slowed down following the death of former president Turgut Ozal
in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Turkey made great strides early this year by selling the
shares of the three banks of Etibank, Anadolubank and Denizbank,
with a total value of 342.5 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The drive, however, has drawn sharp criticism from trade
unions which described the government as ignoring the interests
of civil servants and workers and trying to plunder the state
assets.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China has started pilot
operation of a new insurance service for civil engineering
projects in the Changning District of Shanghai, China's largest
city.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai is also one of the two pilot cities in China to open to
overseas insurance companies.
</P>
<P>
The new insurance service covers all risks that might happen
during construction of the projects. The total cost of the policy
will not exceed 0.25 percent of the overall investment of each
project.
</P>
<P>
China has never before had insurance coverage that includes
accidental life insurance, third party liability insurance and
property insurance within a single policy.
</P>
<P>
Changning District now has about 500 construction sites, and
the new insurance service has been applauded by builders of the
projects.

<P>
The local government of Changning has also adopted a rule that
all project builders must buy an insurance policy for their
projects before construction begins.
</P>
<P>
Insurance specialists say the service has a bright future,
since China has massive construction work in urban areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Some 2,000 Ugandan refugees in
southern Sudan are in critical condition due to the fighting
between the government troops of Sudan and Sudan People's
Liberation Army (SPLA), local press "The New Vision" reported
today.
</P>
<P>
"We have reports that women and children are starving in the
bushes as they are looking for any available means to return to
Uganda. Many others feared dead," an United Nations official
asked to be not named told the newspaper Sunday in Arua,
north-western Uganda.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Local Government Ministry said their
colleagues and UN High Commissioner for Refugees officials
visited southern Sudan and western Zaire last week confirmed the
report and urged Ugandan refugees scattered in these areas to
return to their home.
</P>
<P>
There are some 8,000 Ugandan refugees in camps in southern
Sudan and the West Nile Bank Front Rebels tried to stop the
refugees to return, a security official in West Nile Region,
north-western Uganda said. The WNBF uses the camps as the recruit
bases, he added.
</P>
<P>
But still, call for return received a warm reaction among
refugees. Some 250 Ugandan refugees returned to north-western
Uganda on Sunday after a 18-year of exile in Zaire and Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The fighting between the Sudanese army and the SPLA is now
carried out 55 kilometers from Juba, southern Sudan.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
overdrawn its account at the Bank of Zambia by 51.236 billion
Kwacha (about 39 million U.S. Dollars), representing heavy
borrowing from the banking system.
</P>
<P>
According to Bank of Zambia Monetary Survey/Statistics,
Zambia's domestic debt has been increasing, reflecting heavy
dependence on domestic money by the government to meet its
short-term expenditure requirements.
</P>
<P>
The increase in domestic debt has always brought negative
effects on the overall economy and with the high interest rates,
most government revenue has been going to service interest on
domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
Last year the government spent 122 billion Kwacha (about 94
million Dollars) on interest payments on the domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
As a result, most capital projects did not take off last year
due to the increasing domestic debt.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts predicted that the government will be forced
to increase the allocation to domestic debt service this year.

<P>
The manager of the marketing department of the company, Xu
Ming, said that although the renovation project cost every
household 1,000 yuan (about 120 US dollars), they can enjoy the
drinking water at the price of 0.3 yuan per kg, only about 40
percent of that of barreled pure water available in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai residents are more concerned with the quality of
drinking water, with almost ten percent of residents drinking
barreled pure water.
</P>
<P>
The Shanghai Tube Pure Water Company Ltd, established last
September, is constructing seven pure water piping projects, with
nearly 20 more such projects under negotiations. Most are part of
the construction plans of new residential buildings.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Considering Visit to Washington: Radio </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu is considering making a visit to the United States soon
to seek ways of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian crisis, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu is expected to decide today whether he would make
such a visit, which seems to be important to break the current
impasse in the peace process and the rising tension.
</P>
<P>
The radio reported that Netanyahu would probably visit
Washington between Sunday and Tuesday before traveling to
the Netherlands for an official visit.
</P>
<P>
Top on Netanyahu's agenda in Washington will be the
arrangement of a summit with Palestinian National Authority (PNA)
President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
As the leading mediator in the peace process, the U.S. is
currently launching a new round of diplomatic activities to bridge
the Israeli-Palestinian gap. U.S. President Bill Clinton sent his
Middle East peace envoy Dennis Ross to the Mideast last week on a
mediation tour.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman, the ceremonial head
of state, is also making efforts to try to ease the current
tension. Arye Shumer, Director-General of the President's Office,
met Monday with PNA Culture and Information Minister Yasser Abed
Rabbo in a Jerusalem hotel to discuss the possibility of holding
a meeting between Arafat and Weizman or Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was the leading force in arranging the first
Netanyahu-Arafat meeting early last September, and he himself met
last October with Arafat following the late September bloodshed
which killed 75 people.
</P>
<P>
Following the resolution approved Monday in Cairo by the Arab
Foreign Ministers meeting to freeze ties with Israel, Weizman
called for resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks which have
been stalled since Israel decided to build the Abu Ghneim (Har
Homa) settlement in East Jerusalem last month.
</P>
<P>
This morning, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai
traveled to Washington on an official visit at the invitation
of his U.S. counterpart William Cohen to discuss bilateral
military cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The trip, scheduled a week ago, was delayed due to the current
tension. Mordechai will also meet with U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright to review regional strategic situation and the
Israeli-Palestinian tension.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Warns Infiltrating Zairean Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has warned
that Zairean government soldiers who wandered into Zambia should
surrender themselves to local authorities or return to their
country, otherwise, Zambia would be compelled to deal with them.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government is keenly monitoring events in Luapula
Province where a number of heavily armed Zairean soldiers have
been spotted at a fishing camp near Mwense, said Defense Minister
Ben Mwila to local press on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to deal with these soldiers but I cannot say
what action we are going to take for security reasons. I want to
assure the people that the government is definitely going to do
something," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwila is expected to go to Mansa, capital of Luapula Province,
this week to obtain first hand information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government faced a similar situation in
Mpulungu Port by Lake Tangakyika recently and it took measures to
compel the Zairean soldiers to hand themselves over to
immigration officers.
</P>
<P>
Luapula Province Permanent Secretary Maybin Mubanga said that
the Zairean soldiers have been camped at a primary school and the
authorities there are cautious to approach them.

<HEADLINE> University Students Should Be Self-Reliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has urged that
Chinese university students should rely on their own strength
instead of constantly seeking financial help from other people.
</P>
<P>
Gao Hong, deputy secretary-general of the All-China Students
Federation, said that the federation will continue to aid those
students experiencing financial difficulties, but "we should first
encourage them to face hardships boldly and independently,"
according to a "China Youth Daily" report.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the paper, Gao said that self-reliance is
the basic requirement for a student who wants to contribute to the
country in the next century -- when the social and international
competition will be strong.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that university students take part in part-time
study/part-time work programs, clean up dormitories and restrooms
by themselves, and do more social work, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Gao said that the campaign to aid poor students would go
through three stages: the first is to accumulate social funding to
help them complete study; the second is to encourage them to be
self-reliant; the third is to ask them to connect their personal
goals with the country's needs.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, China abolished the old system under which the
state covered all tuition fees for university students; all
students now must pay the fees themselves.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The non-governmental

Last year the Hebei Provincial Chamber of International Trade
signed cooperation agreements with its 16 counterparts in other

advertising business, and issued ads for 13 enterprises, getting
feedback from the United States, East Asia and Europe.

<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Non-agricultural industries have
seen substantial development in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region
of northwest China,
</P>
<P>
Now grain processing, retail sales, transportation, commerce
and catering industries contribute 45 percent to Ningxia's annual
rural output value, up 14 percent from 1990.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, the autonomous region has restructured the
rural economy by focusing on non-farm industries, providing more
employment opportunities for surplus rural laborers.
</P>
<P>
Various commodity production bases for grain, potatoes,
oil-bearing crops, and medicinal herbs have been set up in recent
years, generating an output value of 4.9 billion yuan (590.4
million US dollars) in 1996, four times the 1990 figure.
</P>
<P>
At present, the number of rural marketplaces is 300, with a
turnover climbing 33 percent annually. The fast growth has pushed
development of the farming sector in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Ningxia's grain output was 2.58 million tons and
farmers' annual per-capita income reached 1,416 yuan, 19.7 percent
more than the previous year.

<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- In Fuzhou, capital of south
China's Fujian Province, a new administrative method to evaluate
foreign-funded ventures is as simple as the ABC's.
</P>
<P>
As part of the local government's effort to guide the inflow of
overseas investment, and to support development of pillar
industries, foreign-funded ventures will be divided into three
basic categories.
</P>
<P>
Fuzhou has seen a substantial increase in foreign investment in
recent years, reaching 10.5 billion US dollars in contractual
value by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
The combined output value of the 2,249 joint ventures in
operation has reached about 63 percent of city's total last year,
with their exports accounting for 85.4 percent of the city's
total.
</P>
<P>
Official sources say that Fuzhou has listed 146 foreign-funded
enterprises, each with an annual production value of more than 100
million yuan, and an annual export volume of more than 10 million
dollars, in Category A.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, overseas investment has gone beyond 30 million
dollars in each of the 146 ventures in categorized in A, which
will be on the desks of the heads of the local government, to
supervise their operation.
</P>
<P>
Category B includes 151 joint ventures, each with an annual
output value of more than 30 million yuan, or a yearly export
volume of over five million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Foreign-funded ventures in B also include those involving in
more than 10 million dollars in overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that directors of departments of the Fuzhou City
government or the heads of suburban countries and district will
take charge of the operation of the joint ventures in the B
category.
</P>
<P>
About 166 joint ventures in Category A and B have been
put into operation, accounting for seven percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
However, the export volume of these A, B ventures reached 92
percent of the city's total.
</P>
<P>
The sources say that there are 23 projects in Category A and B
in construction now, which will increase the city's annual
industrial production value by 10 million yuan, when completed.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Two suicide bombing explosions
occurred in two different places in the Gaza Strip early
this morning, according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian
press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
During the double attacks, no Israeli casualties were reported,
but some Palestinians sustained light and moderate injuries.
</P>
<P>
It was presumed that the attacks near two Jewish
settlements at Cfar Daroum and Netzarim were targeted against
the settlers. But the bombs went off prematurely.
</P>
<P>
The duel incidents followed the suicide bombing in Tel Aviv
on March 21. Three Israeli women were killed and dozens of
Israelis wounded during the explosion.
</P>
<P>
Today's attacks, although no Israelis victimized, will
intensify the distrust further between the Israelis and the
Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> China Improves Civil Aviation Laws </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Aviation Administration
of China (CAAC) is focusing on improving the legal system in 1997,
with regulations and law enforcement playing an important role.
</P>
<P>
CAAC wants to develop 400 regulations and rules to complement
the Civil Aviation Law by the year 2000. The main task for 1997 is
the formulation of regulations on aviation safety and the aviation
market. It will pay greater attention to implementing the law and
regulations on aviation safety, market supervision, and to dealing
with passenger complaints.
</P>
<P>
CAAC will provide training programs for leading officials and
other cadres, and legal consultation for some regional
administrations and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Other measures include formulating regulations on the
responsibilities of regional administrations, requiring legal
personnel to be present at the signing of civil aviation
contracts, establishing a training and certification system for
legal consultants, and a legal counsellor system in the country's
three main airline groups.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, CAAC drafted or amended close to 40 administrative
rules and regulations on aviation safety, flight standards, air
traffic control, transport, airport management, finance,
scientific research, and education.
</P>
<P>
Legal departments were established in 37 out of 82 regional
administrations, airlines, airports and provincial administrations
by the end of last year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Makes Achievements in Resuming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Cai Guozhong)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Uganda has in recent years made
great achievements in resuming vanilla production.
</P>
<P>
Reliable statistics from a department concerned in the country
indicate that Uganda's production of vanilla dried beans had
increased from two tons in 1991 to 12 tons in 1996, representing
a five fold increase in six years and creating a new record in
the country's history.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla is a creeper-crop usually grown under coffee or banana
plantation. It is used in manufacturing spices for
food-processing and cosmetic.
</P>
<P>
Vanilla originally grows in tropical forests in eastern Mexico
and now its major producer is Madagascar which produces 70
percent of the total output of vanilla in the world.
</P>
<P>
It was in the 1940's when Asians in Uganda began to develop
vanilla plantation in the country.
</P>
<P>
Much progress was made in 1960's after Uganda's independence
in 1962. The country at that time had a record high productin of
10 tons of dried vanilla beans per year. However the production
had gone down almost to zero in the 1970's and 1980's due to the
political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1980's when peace and stability started to
prevail across the country, a Ugandan called Sekarara trusted and
encouraged by foreign vanilla-purchasers with fund, reconstructed
a vanilla-processing factory. Furthermore, he got all kinds of
support including technical services from Uganda's central
government, because to resume vanilla production is part of
Uganda's export diversification program which is aimed at
reducing the country's dependence on coffee export for foreign
exchange earning. Coffee is still the country's number one
foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
Since then he has encouraged and organised farmers to plant
vanilla and some small-scale vanilla plantations have appeared in
the districts of Mukono, Mbale, Masaka, Mpigi and Budibugyo.
</P>
<P>
What's more, the agricultural ministry, district agricultural
offices and women organisations at various levels have been
trying to provide the farmers with technical training, fertilizer
and pesticides and marketing services. Meanwhile a vanilla
farmers' association was formed to promote vanilla production,
processing and marketing.
</P>
<P>
The cooperation between Uganda and foreign countries and
international organisations also contributed to the rapid
resumption of vanilla production. A vanilla extension project was
launched in August 1992 and funded by the United States' Agency
for International Development (USAID) and the Norweigian fund for
women. The United Nations Development Programme has since the end
of the 1980's invited vanilla experts from Britain and China and
other countries to work among Uganda's vanilla growers. These
growers have much improved their skill under the experts'
guidance, thus getting bumper harvests for years.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Uganda vanilla growers held a seminar which worked
out measures to further develop vanilla production in the country
and announced a target production for the next century, that is
50 tons per year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here believe that the target can be realised and Uganda
will become a new vanilla producing base in the world in the next
century, provided peace and stability are continuously to prevail
across the country.

<HEADLINE> China Increasing Airline Industry Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Since 1993, the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC) no longer approves the
establishment of new air transport companies and has pushed for
mergers of small carriers with bigger ones to create large
companies and enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Major corporate mergers include Nanjing Airlines with China
Northwest Airlines, which helped it expand in east China; Chengdu
Aircraft Maintenance Engineering Co. with China Southwest
Airlines, which improved maintenance capability; and Swan Airlines
with the Heilongjiang branch of China Northern Airlines.
</P>
<P>
China Northwest, China Southwest and China Northern are three
of the six major carriers in the country. China Southwest,
Guizhou Airlines, and Huaxia Securities Co. are working together
on Guizhou's issuing of shares.
</P>
<P>
To find funds, CAAC has helped China Eastern Airlines and China
Southern Airlines issue shares. On February 4 and 5, China Eastern
was listed on the New York and Hong Kong stock exchanges, raising
a total of 228 million US dollars, and making it the first airline
company to issue stock abroad.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen Gaoqi International Airport Development Co. Ltd.
became the first to get a public listing on the domestic market,
with A shares being traded in Shanghai in April of 1996. That
stock issue has so far raised 2.6 billion yuan for the airline
industry.
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of inefficient management in airlines and
airports, CAAC has launched a drive to restructure businesses and
improve management and marketing methods. Some progress has been
made in this, says one official.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Amateur Actors In Chinese Films Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The performances of some foreign
amateur actors in Chinese films and TV dramas have been criticized
by "China Culture News."
</P>
<P>
The paper, run by the Ministry of Culture, said that, as the
cultural sector opens wider to the outside world, a greater number
of foreign actors and actresses have been hired for Chinese films
and TV programs.
</P>
<P>
Many of them have even played famous historical figures in
films with an international theme, the paper added.
</P>
<P>
However, because most were not professional artists, their
performances were second- or third-rate, and did not meet with the
Chinese audience's expectations, the paper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It suggested that film and TV departments improve contacts with
foreign film and TV institutes, and try to attract better
stars. But there is a problem with a shortage of funds, and the
enormous amounts famous foreign actors get for starring roles.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Parliament Session Concludes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The winter session of Nepal's
parliament concluded here Monday night amid an uproar as
opposition lawmakers protested against the government's failure to
present any bills during the session.
</P>
<P>
The nearly one-month session witnessed the fall of the former
coalition government under Sher Bahadur Deuba of the Nepali
Congress (NC) party, but could not pass any important bills except
a fringe one on joint housing ownership, which was presented in
the last session.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lokendra Bahadur Chand, whose three-party
government took power three weeks ago after the Deuba government
lost a confidence vote in the lower house, told MPs that the
government has not adequate time to bring the bills to parliament.
</P>
<P>
The winter session, traditionally a bill session, was
originally expected to discuss and approve several important bills
including those on decentralization, women's property rights and
MPs' defection.
</P>
<P>
MPs of the main opposition NC party surrounded the speaker of
the lower house twice during Monday's nearly 10-hour-long meeting,
urging Prime Minister Chand to clarify his government's position
on the up-coming local elections.
</P>
<P>
Chand later told the house that the government would work
towards empowering local authorities and hold the local elections
on the schedule set by the former NC-led government.
</P>
<P>
The former government announced last month that it would
postpone the local elections, which will elect chief officers for
local administration bodies throughout the country, till mid-June
to wait for the parliamentary approval of the decentralization
bill.
</P>
<P>
Opposition MPs and local administration officers, most of them
also from the NC party, had been urging the government to hold the
elections after the passage of the bill, which is expected to give
more autonomous rights to the local bodies.
</P>
<P>
Chand, a senior leader of the National Democratic Party (RPP),
the third largest party in parliament, formed his ruling coalition
with the largest Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist
Leninist, CPN-UML) and another small party when the NC-led
government resigned following its failure to get majority support
in parliament earlier last month.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Crack Down on IPR Violations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Commerce Ministry of Thailand
will seek approval from Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh to
set up a special task force to revitalize suppression of
intellectual property right (IPR) violations, it is learned today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is concerned that weak enforcement of the law on
IPR protection over the past two years could increase the risk of
Thailand facing trade retaliation from the United States and other
major trading partners.
</P>
<P>
Somporn Asavahame, deputy commerce minister, said the US Trade
Representative appeared to be unhappy with the IPR situation in
Thailand and that this may lead to a decision to retain Thailand
on the regular watchlist, or even put it on the priority
watchlist, subject to more serious retaliation.
</P>
<P>
Sean Murphy, director of the Asia Pacific Office of the US
Trade Representative (USTR), visited Thailand earlier this month
to monitor the latest developments in the country's IPR
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The US official implied that the Thai government has yet to
follow up on its commitment to pass the patent act and step up
enforcement of copyright violations.
</P>
<P>
The USTR reviews annually the status of trading patterns in
April and announces its decision in October.
</P>
<P>
The US government moved Thailand from its serious watchlist to
regular watchlist in November 1994 and restored generalized system
of preferences (GSP) benefits on 15 Thai export items in July 1995
after the Thai government promised to reduce the number of
violations.
</P>
<P>
Some Thai officials fear that the overwhelming volume of
copyright violations in Bangkok might prompt the USTR to leave
Thailand on its watchlist during the upcoming revision.

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi PM Offers Open Discussion With Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Monday offered dialogue with opposition leader Khaleda Zia
to settle the most important or contentious national issues in a
bid to defuse political tension.
</P>
<P>
Hasina said she is ready for talks with the leader of the
opposition or sit for a live debate or discussion on TV for
thrashing out the issues, including the confrontational situation
between the government and the opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We have several times invited the opposition leader to sit for
open debate to explain to the people what we are doing and what
they," she told a group of editors Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist
Party Chairperson Khaleda Zia gave a seven-day ultimatum to the
government to arrest the killers of two of her party workers in
Feni city, 136 kilometers southeast of capital Dhaka.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise we will announce tough agitation programs separately
for the Chittagong division," she told a large public meeting in
Feni town, adding that Sheikh Hasina, after coming to power, has
unleashed a reign of terror on the opposition party workers.
</P>
<P>
Hasina, who defeated former prime minister Khaleda Zia in
election last June, told the editors that her government
repeatedly invited the opposition to cooperate with the government
in development activities to ensure rapid and smooth development
of the country.
</P>
<P>
However, at a time when the government is continuing its
all-out efforts to improve the situation of the country to rebuild
the national image, the opposition party is calling for strike,
and acts of sabotage are going on to disturb the calm in the
country, she alleged.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Military Chief Optimistic About Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Defense Secretary Renato
de Villa has expressed satisfaction over the forming of a joint
committee to oversee a local ceasefire in Buldon, the southern
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
He was quoted by today's local press as saying that the
creation of the committee was a "very significant" and
"encouraging" development in the peace negotiations between the
government and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a
12,000-member rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
De Villa said he was pleased that the MILF accepted the
military's suggestion that four non-government organizations be
tapped to become members of the joint monitoring committee.
</P>
<P>
The MILF and the government peace panel had held two
preliminary talks with the two sides agreeing to form the said
joint committee to ensure the implementation of the local
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
However, the talks are sometimes stalled due to sporadic
fighting between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the MILF and the military exchanged accusations on
who was responsible for the death of 10 students and a teacher in
an exchange of mortar fire in Buldon.
</P>
<P>
A few days later, another clash occurred, wounding at least
three soldiers in the same area.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a splinter group of the Moro National Liberation
Front which ended its armed struggle against the government last
year, is expected to hold the third round of talks with the
government this month to set a timetable for their future formal
peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Eighth Amendment to Be Revised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Pakistan Muslim League
(PML-N) led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has decided to do away
with some portions of the most controversial and much abused
Eighth Amendment in order to restore supremacy of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The decision was announced by Nawaz Sharif in his televised
address to the nation last night.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that President Farooq Leghari had
happily agreed to the PML(N)'s historic decision during his
meeting with him Monday.
</P>
<P>
Sharif was thankful to Leghari for giving his consent and said
a complex constitutional issue has been solved amicably and
through mutual understanding.
</P>
<P>
With the annulment of some of its portions, the prime minister
said, the Eighth Amendment will go away with all its bitter parts
and memories.
</P>
<P>
The infamous amendment was inserted in the constitution in 1985
by the party-less parliament when the late General Zia ul-Haq was
the chief martial law administrator and president of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Its most notorious provision, 58(2)(B), has since been used for
four times to dismiss elected governments and has been a source of
constant political instability.
</P>
<P>
Under the amendment, the president has discretionary powers to
dismiss the government and the national assembly, appoint services
chiefs and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff committee and
chief election commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Nawaz Sharif said the decision to scrap some portions of the
amendment was taken to revive the democratic concept as envisaged
by the founder of the nation, greater leader Quaid-e-Azam.
</P>
<P>
The decision to dispense with these portions followed lengthy
and serious discussions among the PML parliamentary and its allied
parties, he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Increases International Police Presence in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
today authorized a major strengthening of the U.N. International
Police Task Force (IPTF) in Bosnia's disputed northern town of
Brcko.
</P>
<P>
A total of 186 police and 11 civilian personnel will join the
30 international police already stationed in Serb-held Brcko,
which is claimed by both Bosnian Serbs and the Bosnian-Croat
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Brcko has been placed under international supervision pending a
final solution on the town's status in March next year.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council unanimously passed the resolution to send
the forces and stressed the importance of ensuring that the IPTF
is able to carry out the tasks outlined in the Dayton Peace
Agreement which ended the near four-year war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The IPTF is to monitor, observe and inspect policing activities
and facilities, advise and train police personnel and forces, help
law enforcement activities and and assess threats to public order.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council's decision comes following U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan's request on March 18 for an
extra 306 international police in Bosnia, including the 186
for Brcko.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council urged member states to provide qualified
police monitors and other forms of assistance to support the
IPTF.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon all parties in the Dayton Peace Agreement,
signed in December 1995, to implement all aspects of the agreement
to cooperate with IPTF in the conduct of its activities.

<HEADLINE> Civilians Cooperate With Sri Lankan Forces Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan government troops on
Sunday recovered a large haul of bombs and grenades during a
search operation in Jaffna peninsula following information
provided by Tamil civilians, according to military sources here
today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Tamil civilians who have moved into army-
occupied territory in northern Sri Lanka are cooperating with the
armed forces against the rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
Eelam (LTTE).
</P>
<P>
The civilians have informed the forces as to where large stocks
of rebel arms and ammunition were hidden and the forces were able
to unearth them in the past several months, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
More civilians who were living in the LTTE-controlled areas
have of late moved into the security forces-controlled areas in
Northern province and were supplying information to the forces
about Tiger hideouts.
</P>
<P>
Consequently the forces have been able to flush out rebels and
arrest them at various places in the north, particularly in Jaffna
peninsula, they added.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been waging a 14-year war against the Sri Lankan
government for a separate state in the north and east of the
country. During this period over 55,000 persons are reported to
have been killed.
</P>
<P>
Efforts by the present government for a dialogue to end the war
was reneged by the rebels. And consequently the government has
launched major offensives against the rebels and dislodged them
from their heartland, Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Now the LTTE rebels have taken refuge in nearby jungles while
government forces have controlled Jaffna peninsula and its
surroundings since last May.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Bad-loan Crisis Hits East Asia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- There are two sides to everything,
and Asia's economic miracle is no exception. If the steady and
high growth could be described as the bright side of the miracle,
then, the bad-loan crisis is its dark side.
</P>
<P>
Five years ago, when Japan started experiencing the bad-loan
crisis, no one expected that years later, the crisis would spread
to other parts of Asia, the region with fastest economic growth in
the world for the last decade.
</P>
<P>
Now, from Tokyo to Seoul, from Bangkok to Jakarta, lenders have
run up about 660 billion U.S. dollars in non-performing loans to
over-extended real estate developers, money-losing state
enterprises, and politically connected corporate deadbeats.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, Ssangyong group, the country's sixth biggest
conglomerate, is reportedly looking for foreign buyers for half
its carmaking unit, Ssangyong Motor, which has more than 3 billion
dollars in debt.
</P>
<P>
But Ssangyong's case is not an isolated one in South Korea.
Many companies there are suffering from the same disease -- high
debt-to-equity ratios caused by borrowing too much, too quickly to
finance growth. Most companies' debt is nearly three times their
equity, and for some outfits it is more than 10 times.
</P>
<P>
Within three months, two major conglomerates have collapsed in
the country: the Hanbo group in January and the Sammi group in
March. The Hanbo group, South Korea's 14th-biggest conglomerate
and its number two steel maker, had 5.8 billion dollars in debt,
while the Sammi group, the nation's 26th biggest conglomerate,
cracked under debts of 2.2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, years of go-go development left lenders with
non-performing credits that represent roughly 10 percent, or 15.5
billion dollars, of their loan portfolios. The debt has amounted
to nearly 9 percent of Thailand's gross domestic product (GDP) and
is expected to expand in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In Indonesia, a World Bank study says, nearly 17 percent of
state-owned banks' loans are non-performing, or shaky.
</P>
<P>
However, by comparison, things in Japan are still the worst.
Japanese banks are in the fifth year of a battle with a stagnant
economy. Collapsing equity and property prices have left them with
at least 350 billion dollars in bad loans.
</P>
<P>
Economists blamed mis-management for the spreading of the
bad-loan crisis in the region. From Japan to Thailand, they said,
many banks lack credit and cost controls and as a result, banks
have lent too much money to property developers, money-losing
enterprises and politically connected companies.
</P>
<P>
With a wary eye on bad-debt problems in its neighboring
countries, Malaysia's central bank has moved to curb lending to
property and stock purchasers. Starting today, Malaysian banks can
lend only up to 20 percent of total loans for property projects
"deemed less productive." Commercial banks and finance companies
will not be able to lend out more than 15 percent of total loans
for customers to invest in stocks and mutual funds.
</P>
<P>
As the crisis is so serious, fixing this mess would take years
and cost hundreds of billions of dollars, if not more, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
They said that if the current problems are allowed to fester,
Asian banks could be trapped with bad loans weakening their
capital bases. That would severely crimp their ability to make new
loans.
</P>
<P>
The bad-loan crisis has a grave impact on the economic growth
in the region. As a response to the crisis, banks in some
countries have tightened credit and slowed growth in government
spending. These moves would push some of the world's most dynamic
countries into the sort of economic slump.
</P>
<P>
In South Korea, the troubles have sent many experts scurrying
to readjust their forecast for the nation's economy. Compared to
the government's initial GDP growth projection of 6 percent for
this year, the Samsung Economic Research Institute now predicts an
increase of just 5 percent. At such a rate, the nation's
unemployment is bound to increase from the present 2.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
As a solution to the crisis, experts suggested that Asian banks
change their corporate culture and put risk control and
profitability ahead of rank expansionism.

ROME, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi
said today Italy will do everying in its power to find out exactly
how a boat packed with Albanian refugees sank last Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
And he called for Italy and Albania to join forces in the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
"The Italian government wants to shed light on every aspect (of
this tragedy) because there should be nothing left in the shadows,

<P>
"I am in favor of a bilateral Italian-Albanian effort to

Some 83 Albanians are believed to have died when an Albanian
harbor patrol vessel crowded with refugees sank in the Otranto
Channel between Italy and Albania after colliding with an Italian
naval ship trying to turn it back.
</P>
<P>
Asked about whether the Italian naval patrols would continue,
Prodi said:"There was an agreement on it. We must now reflect on
the ways and on the aspects. The investigation into the incident
will be useful in clarifying how to carry out the patrols."

<HEADLINE> Georgian President Urges Support for Extended Abkhazia Mission </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Georgian President Edward
Shevardnadze Monday called for support for a decision by the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) on extending the mission
of its peace-keeping force in the break-away Abkhazia Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Interfax agency quoted Shevardnadze as saying in a routine
weekend radio speech that the implementation of the CIS resolution
involved the comprehensive settlement of the Abkhazian conflict.
The conflict began in August 1992, after the republic declared
independence from Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The CIS member states agreed at a summit meeting Friday to
extend the mandate of the CIS peace-keeping force in Abkhazia to
July 31, as requested by Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the 2,500-member CIS peace-keeping force,
deployed in June 1994 to help monitor a ceasefire that ended the
war, had already been extended once to April 1996 at a CIS summit
in January last year.
</P>
<P>
The CIS decision met opposition from Abkhazian Parliament
Speaker Sokrat Djindjoliya, who said the resolution did not take
into account the opinions of Abkhazia, and was a unilateral action.
</P>
<P>
The speaker vowed that Abkhazia would not allow the CIS
peace-keeping force to expand its security zone in Abkhazia, as
proposed by Shevardnadze.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, the United Nations Security Council also
decided to extend the U.N. observers' mission in Georgia to July
31 this year.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people were killed in the Georgian-Abkhazian
conflict. It was prompted by the Georgian government's dispatch of
troops to the seceding region located on the Black Sea, in
northwestern Georgia,
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Georgian government and the Abkhazian
authorities have stalled and resumed from time to time as the two
sides disagree over key issues including the status of Abkhazia
and the repatriation of tens of thousands of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Government Increases Disaster Relief to Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China's central government has
given Xinjiang more than 76 million yuan this year to help the
disaster-affected areas rehabilitate their homeland, and ensure
normal life and production. More money is expected to follow.
</P>
<P>
Northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region was plagued
by frequent disasters in the past two years. Snowstorms hit Altay
and Ili prefectures in northern Xinjiang, while quakes shook
Jiashi County in the south this January, leaving dozens of
casualties and causing heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
Jiashi County had not recovered from a strong quake that
occurred in March of 1996. And last year's unprecedented flood
disasters destroyed more than crops on 730,000 ha and 250,000
rooms, and affected four million people.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that direct economic losses amounted
to more than six billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Relief funds came immediately from the central government and
rose from 20 million yuan in 1995 to 96 million yuan last year,
financing the reconstruction of more than 130 flood-destroyed
water conservancy facilities and over 50,000 new rooms.

<HEADLINE> Soft Interior Decoration Becoming Popular in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- More and more urban dwellers in
China are turning to textiles to soften the look of their home, as
Chinese taste in interior design shifts from the practical to the
aesthetic.
</P>
<P>
Well-off urban residents in the past decorated their homes with
wood, ceramic tiles or mosaics, but many now prefer exquisite
curtains and unique tapestries, especially newly-married couples
and newly-moved-in families.
</P>
<P>
Flourishing firms which specialize in selling curtains and
textiles strongly support the change. Softer decor is finding more
favor in the eyes of consumers, as it costs less and can be easily
created to satisfy individual taste, experts say.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 firms in Changchun, the capital of northeast
China's Jilin Province, are all making considerable profits by
selling colorful curtains and textiles for interior decoration.
</P>
<P>
The new look was initiated in south China and has gradually
spread to the north and west, one firm manager says, and is now
accepted by most urban citizens.
</P>
<P>
Rapid development of high-grade hotels and the service
industry as well as improved office environments, will further
promote the softer styles, the manager predicts.

GUANGZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- While the investment craze in
real estate in south China's Guangdong Province has cooled, sales

</P>
<P>
The southern province, an economic powerhouse in China, poured
58 billion yuan into development of real estate projects last

The total area of the land covered by the projects underway was

</P>
<P>
However, the sales of buildings increased by 13 percent from
1995, and purchase prices rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 32 billion yuan-worth of buildings sold were
apartments for ordinary urban dwellers.
</P>
<P>
As a result of China's stable economic growth and Hong Kong's
midnight handover on June 30, the prices of buildings for sale has
increased by five to 15 percent.

Beijing-Shanghai, and Beijing-Harbin - will have a maximum speed
of 140 kilometers per hour, while trains on other railway lines
will have a speed of 120 km per hour, the Ministry of Railways
says.
</P>
<P>
This will increase the average speed of the country's trains
from the current 48.1 to 54.9 km ph, and the maximum speed of
long-distance passenger trains, 97.6 km per hour.
</P>
<P>
In order to win back travelers, many of whom in recent years
have changed to buses and airlines for speed and comfort, the
Ministry of Railways will start 78 "arrive-in-a-night" trains from
large and medium-sized cities, including Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Zhengzhou, for destinations within a
1,500-km range.
</P>
<P>
Highway and civil aviation industries have been developing
rapidly in China, while rail transport has seen a steady decrease
in the past few years. Statistics show trains carried only 942
million passengers last year, a 12.3 percent drop from the
previous year.

<HEADLINE> Leading Chinese Ham Producer Aims High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, April 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chundu Conglomerate of
Luoyang City, in central China's Henan Province, is hoping to
build itself into an important food company on the world market by
using overseas funds and importing the world's most advanced
technology.
</P>
<P>
Gao Fenglai, the company's general manager, says that it is
paying close attention to market changes and now dominates China's
ham market. The central Chinese province now has 17 factories
capable of producing 300,000 tons of ham annually, accounting for
90 percent of the country's total ham output.
</P>
<P>
Gao's conglomerate contributes 200,000 tons to the province's
total, and has 2.4 billion yuan in sales each year and 150 million
yuan in net profits.
</P>
<P>
This contrasts sharply with ten years ago, when the company was
a state-owned meat processing factory on the verge of being shut
down because of fierce competition.
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the factory spent a million yuan on a ham-production
machine at an international food machinery fair in Zhengzhou,
Henan's capital, marking the start of a new business.
</P>
<P>
After an extensive study of the domestic market and China's
consumer conditions, the factory began producing "Chundu" brand
hams, which have a shelf life of three months. "Chundu" is now a
household word in China, as product quality was improved and
diversified in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Chundu set up the joint-stock Sino-foreign Chundu
Group Company with 300 million yuan raised from overseas
investment organizations, with Chundu Conglomerate holding the
majority. It is now planning to establish a financial company for
borrowing and lending, to help it expand.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will hold a model contest
this month that reflects the country's enthusiasm for fashion,
"China Women's News" reports.
</P>
<P>
Some 300 girls will take part in the high profile
competition. The organizers, who are from China's fashion
industry, say that they are younger and more intelligent than in
the past.
</P>
<P>
A panel of experts and designers from the US, France, and Italy
will judge the contest, and winners will be given an opportunity
to attend international modelling contests elsewhere, the paper
revealed.
</P>
<P>
China's first official modelling contest was held five years
ago as a part of the country's first international clothing
fair. The paper says that an estimated 100 million Chinese girls
from the ages of 15 to 20 dream of becoming models.
</P>
<P>
The evolution of taste is one of the most important changes in
the refrom and openinging up process in China. Before the reforms
were introduced in the late 1970s, most Chinese wore the same
blue-color Mao jackets.

<HEADLINE> Displaced Miners in Shanxi Province Find New Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 130,000 laid-off miners
are doing just as well in non-mining industries in China's major
coal producer, Shanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The newly-launched non-mining industries are capable of
producing more than three billion yuan-worth of annual output
value, and are expected to match the mining industry by the end of
the century.
</P>
<P>
Coal mining is the province's pillar industry, but poor
performance and over-staffing have hindered its development. One
third of the coal industry's output value was eaten up by wages
and salaries.
</P>
<P>
The nationwide restructuring of state-owned enterprises and the
introduction of a modern enterprise system have promoted
mechanization and upgrading of Shanxi's coal mines, which left
some 130,000 of the province's total 400,000 coal miners jobless.
</P>
<P>
Since 1993, the province's key coal mines have raised 268.76
million yuan to create new job opportunities for the surplus labor
force. To date, 64 projects centering on the service sector have
been completed, supported by low-interest government loans
totaling 416.9 million yuan and overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
The non-mining industry has risen at an average rate of 30
percent in terms of annual output value over the past two years.

<HEADLINE> Laid-off Worker Says Finding A Job Not So Difficult in Shenyang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Most workers who lost their jobs
at ailing state-owned enterprises in Shenyang, capital of
northeast China's Liaoning Province, have gone to the city's
booming commercial and service industries to look for jobs.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say that most of the city's 300,000 laid-off
workers have found places in the commercial and service sector,
either by opening a small business of their own, or by working for
privately-owned companies.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Chen, one of the city's large number of jobless, became a
taxi driver after he was given a long holiday by his company two
years ago. But, he said, "My misfortune has turned out to be a
blessing now, and I earn much more than what I used to in the
state-owned enterprise."
</P>
<P>
"It's not too difficult for us to find jobs again," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The city's largest labor market, a part-time job service center
in the Heping District, has become a place frequently visited by
local laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Sources say that local laid-off workers have taken up about a
third of the jobs available in a market that was previously
dominated by farmers flooding the city looking for work.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off workers are better educated than farmers and more
competitive at finding work, the sources say, and some workers
have become bosses of their own businesses.
</P>
<P>
The city has some 300,000 people involved in privately-run
businesses, and the figure is growing at an annual rate of more
than 20 percent.

<HEADLINE> China to Develop More New Drugs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- China will subsidize research on
new drugs effective on brain vascular illnesses, tumors and
virulent diseases in the next three years, reported today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
At least ten such new drugs will be developed in China by 2000,
with one or two marketed in developed countries, said Wang
Mingxue, an official with the State Pharmaceutical Administration
(SPA).
</P>
<P>
By achieving these goals, Wang said, the country will gradually
divert the pharmaceutical industry from drug imitation to
innovation, setting up a practicable drug research and development
system.
</P>
<P>
The SPA encourages scientists to research on potential Chinese
patent drugs to compete with foreign products, he said.
</P>
<P>
The SPA and the State Science and Technology Commission are
building up five new medicine safety evaluation centers and five
new clinical research centers in line with international
standards, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country is capable of producing 1,350
varieties of bulk pharmaceuticals, more than 3,500 kinds of
pharmaceutical preparations and 4,000 varieties of traditional
Chinese medicines.
</P>
<P>
About half of the medicines produced in China have been raised
to the level of developed countries.
</P>
<P>
More than ten percent of prescribed medicines have been
prepared in line with international requirements for Good
Manufacture Practice.
</P>
<P>
To expedite research and development of new drugs, a National
Co-ordination Committee of New Drug Research was set up in 1993
composed of officials from 11 commissions, ministries and
administrations including the State Science and Technology
Commission, SPA and the Ministry of Public Health.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's King Hussein is
hopeful that there is a basis for moving forward the Middle East
peace process, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"He felt we could get over this bump and move the process
forward," Annan said after discussions with King Hussein, who
spent several hours with Annan at his residence today.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian talks have been disrupted since Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu broke ground for new Jewish
settlements in Arab East Jerusalem two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
After seeing King Hussein, Annan met with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright. Albright said that the peace process was
in a difficult phase. She appealed to all sides to avoid any
initiatives that would jeopardize the process further.
</P>
<P>
At a dinner honoring King Hussein today, Albright called on
Arabs and Israelis to give up "old thinking and old habits" in
order to forge a Middle East peace.
</P>
<P>
"The process of creating confidence, forging agreements and
meeting commitments can be painstaking and painful," she said. "It
requires a steadfast adherence to principle and steadfast
opposition to terror."
</P>
<P>
She praised King Hussein's move of making peace with Israel in
1994, which had taught others that reconciliation among peoples
begins at the individual level.

JAKARTA, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's inflation rate in
fiscal year 1996/97 (from April 1 to March 31) reached 5.17
percent, lower than the 8.86 percent for fiscal 1995/96, a senior
official said.
</P>

The inflation rate for fiscal 1996/97 was a record low since
fiscal 1985/86, Antara news agency reported today quoting Finance
Minister Mar'ie Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
While in the last two months the food sector was the biggest
contributor to inflation in the country, in March this sector
along with the sector of multifarious goods and services curbed
the inflation rate, turning it into a deflation of 0.12 percent,
the minister told local press on Monday.
</P>

With the 0.12 percent deflation, this year's inflation till
March reached 1.96 percent, lower than in the same period of last

<HEADLINE> WB Approves 400-Million-Dollar Reorganization Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank board approved
today a reorganization plan of 400 million U.S. dollars designed
to make the bank more effective in fighting poverty around the
world.
</P>
<P>
The main objective of the plan is to enable the bank to act
more rapidly and improve its results because private capital flows
to developing countries have dwarfed official aid from the bank
and other institutions.
</P>
<P>
World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn said that the bank had
to put greater emphasis on helping poor countries build up their
institutions and infrastructure so they would become more
attractive to private capital.
</P>
<P>
On the reorganization plan itself, he said the bank would
finance the plan so none of its 180 members "would have to
write checks" to pay for the plan.
</P>
<P>
He also told the board's 24 governors there will be no
golden-parachute payoffs for employees near retirement who are
losing the jobs as part of the reorganization.
</P>
<P>
The plan calls for an additional 150 million dollars to be
spent on termination payments.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said the board approved an initial 60 million
dollars for dismissal indemnities and wants to closely monitor how
Wolfensohn and his managers go about the terminations, put at up
to 700 people in the initial plan.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said he and his managers were ready to be dismissed
if the board at its twice yearly review of the reorganization
decided he was not getting the job done.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Peacekeepers' Stay in Angola Extended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations
Security Council decided unanimously today to extend the stay of
the 6,240-member U.N. peacekeeping force in war-torn Angola until
April 16, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Council also decided to consider applying sanction measures
against a party that tried to delay the establishment of a new
coalition government in Angola.
</P>
<P>
The Council took the move at the suggestion of U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan who said in his latest report that
over the past six weeks little progress had been made towards the
establishment of a Government of Unity and National Reconciliation
in Angola.
</P>
<P>
Annan attributed the failure to Angola's major anti-government
force, Uniao Nacional para a Independencia Total de Angola
(UNITA), which did not send to Luanda its officials who had been
designated to join the Angola National Assembly and the new
government.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the Security Council intended to
pressure UNITA to join the Angola new government, so that the
remaining part of the Lusaka Protocol could be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
Angola has suffered civil war between the ruling People's
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (PMLA) and the opposition
UNITA since 1976 when Portuguese colonial rule ended.
</P>
<P>
Under the mediation of the U.N., the United States, Russia and
Portugal, the Angola government and UNITA signed a peace protocol
in the Zambian capital of Lusaka in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The protocol called for a ceasefire, deployment of
U.N. peacekeeping troops to monitor the ceasefire, dismissal of
UNITA forces, UNITA officials to join the central and the local
governments, and the holding of a new presidential election at a
time acceptable to both sides.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Acrobatic Master to Drive across Yellow River Waterfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Renowned Taiwan acrobatic master Ke
Shouliang, who successfully drove a car down the Great Wall in
1992, plans to drive a car across the Hukou Waterfall on China's
Yellow River on June 1.
</P>
<P>
The more than 60-meter-wide waterfall lies on the border
between north China's Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces, with water
falling 30-plus meters to the ground.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, the 44-year-old Taiwan master, known as "the first
skyman of Asia," plans to begin driving on the Shanxi side, go
airborne over the water, and land on the Shaanxi side.
</P>
<P>
"I hope my driving adventure on the Yellow River will serve to
inspire Chinese nationals the world over to care more about and
try their best for their motherland's progress," Ke said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Ke's driving stunt, the event -- part of the
"Visit China '97" campaign -- will feature other acts of daring
involving cars and helicopters, as well as musical numbers and
choirs. The two-hour display will be attended by actors and
actresses from Hong Kong, Taiwan and the inland, as well as an
audience of some 50,000.
</P>
<P>
Crossing the river will be very difficult, as the distance
between the starting point and the water's edge is only 200
meters, said Zhang Xiaoke, deputy director of the Shaanxi
Provincial Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
But he claimed that Ke's daring stunt will add extra "colorful
flavor" to the day.
</P>
<P>
Before his June 1 driving adventure, Ke will donate money to
set up two "Hope" primary schools on both sides of the Hukou
Waterfall, one in Jixian County of Shanxi and one in Yichuan
County of Shaanxi.

<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Foreign capital directly invested
in Venezuela in 1996 increased by 27 percent over the previous
year, the Superintendency of Foreign Investments (SIEX) said today.
</P>
<P>
The total amount of foreign investments in 1996 was about 7.5
billion U.S. dollars, the SIEX said today.
</P>
<P>
The petroleum sector received the biggest volume of capital,
followed by such sectors as commerce, agriculture and livestock
breeding, construction, transportation and electrical and water
services.
</P>
<P>
The United States was usually the principal source of foreign
investment but last year it was outranked by Holland.
</P>
<P>
Regional capital accounted for 11 percent of all foreign
investments in Venezuela. Inflows of Latin American capital have
increased since 1991 following the economic opening up of the
countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
The SIEX attributed the increase of foreign investments to
regional integration, privatization and favorable legislation.

</P>
<P>

already served notice that they will quit their Cabinet posts by
the middle of the year to enable them to concentrate on their
election campaign.

elections.

<P>
Cabinet members intending to run for the presidency are Vice
President Joseph Estrada, Defense Secretary Renato de Villa,
Finance Secretary Roberto de Ocampo and Presidential Adviser on

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Argentine Defense Minister
Jorge Dominguez today held talks on bilateral relations with a
Chinese military delegation headed by Zhang Wannian, vice chairman
of the Central Military Commission of China.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, both sides emphasized the importance of
pursuing a foreign policy of independence, self-determination and
non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries. They
also expressed satisfaction over the cooperative and friendly
relations between the two countries and armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Dominguez said that his government has attached great
importance to the development of the friendly relations with China
and will continue to make its efforts to promote bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
He added that both Argentina and China have participated in
U.N. peacekeeping operations and can exchange experience in this
regard.

<P>
Dominguez expressed his condolences over the death of Chinese
leader Deng Xiaoping, saying Deng was a world leader.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Zhang said that China's defense policy is of a
defensive nature. China's armed forces do not seek to interfere in
other countries' internal affairs, to form military alliance with
other countries, to send troops to other countries and to
establish military bases abroad.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that China's foreign policy is oriented to peace
and development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang also met with Argentine President Carlos Menem this

<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, April 1 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand boasts the fifth
highest number of Internet-linked computers, known as hosts, per
head of population among the world countries.
</P>
<P>
The local magazine NZ Infotech Weekly today quoted a global
survey conducted by the California-based consultancy Network
Wizards in January that New Zealand's placing is below Finland,
Norway, the United States and Australia, but ahead of Britain,
France and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The survey found that hosts in New Zealand totaled over 84,000
in January, up 58 percent from the numbers a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
But many hosts are used by more than one person, so the actual
number of New Zealanders using the Internet is likely to be very
much greater than the figure suggests, according to the survey.

BUENOS AIRES, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Diego Maradona said on

and he was desperately trying to give it up.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC, Non-Communist Parties Help Poor Farmers in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, April 1 (Xinhua) -- More than one million farmers in
southwest China's Guizhou Province have shaken off poverty thanks
to an anti-poverty technical program.
</P>
<P>
The program is initiated by local committees of the Chinese
people's political consultative conference (CPPCC), non-Communist
parties, and the federations of industry and commerce.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Jiaoyao village of Leishan County were the first to
benefit from the program. In the early 1980s, they lived in
thatched sheds, fed on relief grains provided by the state, and
had no more than 28 yuan of annual income per capita. But now
every family has a new house with running water, and their per
capita annual income is 2,053 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts and technicians from the committee of CPPCC of the Miao
and Dong Nationalities Autonomous Prefecture came to the village
in 1980 with new rice strains and new farming techniques.
</P>
<P>
As a result, rice output rose to 6,000 kilograms from 2,200
kilograms per hectare as a result, according to Wang Siming,
vice-chairman of the CPPCC Provincial Committee.
</P>
<P>
Farmers came to know the good of science, as their farm work
relies heavily on it. They even built a new school after raising
30,000 yuan, hoping that their children will become better
educated.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the
Chinese Kuomintang invited Zhang Wenbing, a fruit tree expert, to
help cultivate high-yield fruit trees in Nayong County, and Zhang
has been in the county four times for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
More than 36,000 personnel are involved in the technical
poverty alleviation campaign, covering 200-plus townships and
villages. And 8,560 projects have been completed with 1.5 million
farmers trained and 40 vocational-technical schools set up,
Wang said. enditem

<P>
PARIS, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia beat Malta 2-0 to draw
level on points with Yugoslavia in World Cup qualifying group six
in Valletta, Malta on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Tibor Jancula put the Slovaks ahead in the 39th minute and
Dusan Tittel added the second two minutes into injury time.
</P>
<P>
The Maltese, weakened by the absence of four key players
through injury and suspension, were always on the defensive but
their reserve goalkeeper Mario Muscat was outstanding.
</P>
<P>
Jancula broke the deadlock late in the first half when he broke
almost from the halfway line and placed the ball beyond the reach
of the advancing Muscat.
</P>
<P>
Maltese defender Lawrence Attard was unlucky not to head home
from a corner a few minutes after the interval and Slovak keeper
Alexander Vancel saved a powerful shot from outside the box by
Joseph Brincat.
</P>
<P>
Ten minutes later Brincat beat Vancel only to see his goal
ruled offside.
</P>
<P>
Tittel scored Slovakia's second goal in injury time with a
header.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia lie joint second in the group, four points behind
leaders Spain. Malta have lost all six of their matches,
conceding 27 goals without scoring any.

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Card Telephones Becoming Popular in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, April 1 (Xinhua) -- Nanjing, the capital of east
China's Jiangsu Province, has installed more than 500 magnetic
card telephone booths along the 44 streets in the city proper.
</P>
<P>
Some 1.5 million magnetic cards have been sold in the city,
with 50 million yuan (5.1 million U.S. dollars) of sales
value. The sales volume of the magnetic cards in Nanjing is more
than the combined total of Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Nanjing began to provide the magnetic card telephone service in
1993 and the business has maintained a steady growth. In 1993, the
number of magnetic card telephones only accounted for 1.5 percent
of the total public phones. Now they account for 17 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
The city now has 2,100 magnetic card telephone sets.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the "card collection fever" has also given
rise to the widespread interest in the magnetic cards.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a magnetic card with a picture of a pig, one of the 12
animals in the Chinese zodiac, had a face value of 50 yuan (5.1
dollars), and was sold for 45 yuan. There were not many buyers.
</P>
<P>
Now, however, the card is sold for as high as 1,500 (187
dollars) on the free market. The price of an "ox" card also went
up from 50 yuan to 350 yuan (43 dollars) only a month after its
issue at the beginning of this year.

<HEADLINE> National Forest Park Built in Revolutionary Mecca </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, April 1 (Xinhua) -- A national forest park is taking
shape in Yan'an, a revolutionary base of the Communist Party of
China in northwest China in the 1930s and 1940s.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are already 3,600 ha of forests in and around
the city in Shaanxi Province, bringing its afforestation rate up
to 66.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The afforestation fever in the city dates back to 1956, when
the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China held
a conference in the city calling for the youth in northwest
regions to add green areas to their homes.
</P>
<P>
Now, a forest belt 12 km long and ten km wide has taken shape
around the city.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the Ministry of Forestry approved for Yan'an the
establishment of a national forest park, consisting of 1,332 ha of
trees specially for tourism and 60 ha of forests for economic
purposes.
</P>
<P>
So far, 26.7 ha of trees have been planted annually in the
park. The afforestation rate in the park is expected to rise to
80.29 percent when the park is completed.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Arson Kills Three Turks in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 31 (Xinhua) -- A Turkish woman and two of her
children were killed with two others serious injured in a fire
broke out today in their apartment building in the western German
town of Krefeld, arson being suspected, said reports reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
Local police investigating the case said lighter fluid had been
poured and ignited in the third-floor hallway outside the Turkish
family's flat in the 13-storey apartment building.
</P>
<P>
Fellow occupants and police who happened to be in the area when
the fire broke out tried to convince the Turkish family to stay
calm and wait for help.
</P>
<P>
But with fire blocking all the escape routes, the
panic-stricken 41-year-old Turkish woman threw a mattress onto the
ground some 12 meters below and jumped out of the window, followed
by her three daughters -- a 19-year-old and her 15-year-old twin
sisters.
</P>
<P>
The 41-year-old died instantly from the jump while her
19-year-old daughter died later in hospital. The twins were
critically injured. The woman's 17-year-old son remained in the
flat and died of smoke inhalation, police said.
</P>
<P>
Although police suspected arson, officials said there were no
immediate evidents pointing to a xenophobic attack.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish community in Germany called for a swift
clarification of the incident while Turkish ambassador in Bonn
Volkan Vural said in an interview with a local television after
the incident that xenophobia and racist attacks are "reality in
Germany."
</P>
<P>
About 500 Krefeld residents gathered before the apartment
building this evening in protest against the attack while another
group of people demonstrated on the streets, chanting, "Turkey,
Turkey," the reports said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 31 (Xinhua) -- Stocks tumbled again on Wall
Street today, giving the Dow Jones industrial average a two-day
loss of nearly 300 points, as interest rate worries continued to
eat away at the robust gains of the past half year.
</P>
<P>
The Dow lost 157.11 points, its sixth worst point-drop in
history, closing at 6,583.48, plunging below 6,600 for the first
time since early January and trimming the year's gain to only
slightly more than 2 percent. Just three weeks ago, when it set an
all-time high at 7,085.16 on March 11, the Dow was up nearly 10
percent on the year.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by nearly a 4-to-1
margin on the New York Stock Exchange, with NYSE volume jumping to
555.73 million shares from 475.93 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
Other key stock measures also extended Thursday's selloff,
which was spurred by growing fears the Federal Reserve will keep
raising interest rates to fight against inflation. The stock
market was closed on Good Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 list, a popular model for many mutual
funds, and the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index both fell
more than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The S&AMP;P 500 fell 16.76 to 757.12, and the NYSE composite index
fell 8.88 to 398.55.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Mulls Over Mideast Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton today
discussed the tense situation in the Middle East with his peace
broker Dennis Ross on the eve of a visit by King Hussein of
Jordan.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry, in a briefing to reporters
about the meeting, said the United States continued to encourage
the Israelis and Palestinians to "recognize the utility of
dialogue."
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government, defying world criticism, had pushed
forward with its plan to construct a Jewish neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Ross was dispatched by Clinton to the Middle East
for talks with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in an attempt to stop the peace
process from derailing.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said Ross returned to Washington late Friday "not empty
handed," but he admitted, "There's a lot of hard work to do."
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters that
Ross, whose mission to the Middle East was to assess the situation
and find what would be the best way to move forward the peace
process, had spoken "extensively" with Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
But Dinger declined to make any comment on Ross's trip, which
was seen by analysts here as a failure to reverse the tense
situation.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday night, Arab foreign ministers agreed at a Cairo
meeting to recommend that their countries suspend normal relations
with Israel, restore an economic boycott, close down Israeli
diplomatic missions and withdraw from multilateral peace talks
until Israel shows greater flexibility.
</P>
<P>
Dinger indicated that Albright might travel to the Middle East
"when it is helpful and useful."
</P>
<P>
Both McCurry and Dinger announced the arrival of King Hussein
of Jordan and a meeting with Clinton Tuesday, which was postponed
from March 18 after a deranged Jordanian soldier killed seven
Israeli schoolgirls near the Jordan-Israel border.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein is the fourth of a series of Middle East leaders
coming to Washington for talks with Clinton after a deal on Hebron
was signed between the Israelis and Palestinians in January.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu was the first who had talks with Clinton, which were
followed by Arafat and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.

<HEADLINE> US Army Gen. Clark Nominated as Top NATO Commander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
has picked Army General Wesley Clark to become the next top
commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the
White House announced today.
</P>
<P>
Clark, 52, who is expected to succeed General George Joulwan,
will also be head of the U.S. forces in Europe, White House
spokesman Michael McCurry told a news briefing.
</P>
<P>
Joulwan is expected to retire this summer.
</P>
<P>
"This nomination is subject to the approval of the North
Atlantic Council," he said. "We are actively consulting now, of
course, with our North Atlantic Treaty allies."
</P>
<P>
The nomination of Clark as commander-in-chief of the U.S.
European Command will need the approval of the U.S. Congress, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
Clark brings to the job both a knowledge of Russia and
extensive experience with the Bosnia problem. He was the senior
military member in the team brokering the 1995 Dayton peace
accords that ended the war in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
A West Point graduate, Clark is now head of the U.S. Southern
Command, overseeing U.S. military operations in Central and South
America.

<HEADLINE> US Personal Incomes Up by 0.9 Percent in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 31 (Xinhua) -- The personal incomes in the
U.S. surged by 0.9 percent in February, the largest gain in eight
months, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the personal incomes were earned at a
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.71 trillion dollars in the
month. It was the largest advance in incomes since June 1996 and
more than doubled January's revised 0.4 percent gain.
</P>
<P>
Private wages and salaries, the most closely watched component
of income, surged by 1.5 percent in February after declining 0.2
percent in the month before.
</P>
<P>
It also said that the personal spending in February was at an
annual rate of 5.33 trillion dollars, up by 0.3 percent, the
smallest since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
But the increase followed a revised 1 percent gain in January,
the best in 11 months. The previous estimate increase of spending
in January was 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The report showed consumers in the first two months of the year
spent at about the same robust rate as in the final three months of
last year, when consumers helped boost economic growth to a strong
3.8 percent annual rate.
</P>
<P>
Spending on durable goods rose by 0.1 percent. It gained by 0.3
percent on nondurable goods and by 0.4 percent on services.
</P>
<P>
Disposable personal income, income after taxes, grew by 0.8
percent in February after a 0.7 percent gain in the month before.
</P>
<P>
The combination of strong income growth and a modest spending
increase boosted Americans' savings rate -- savings as a
percentage of disposable income -- to 5.5 percent in February, the
best in five months.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. analysts said that spending and income growth in
February may lead the U.S. Federal Reserve to further raise the
interest rate to wring inflationary pressures from the economy.
