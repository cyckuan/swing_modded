<HEADLINE> Chinese President Meets Law Meeting Participants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua)-- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
said today that administering a country by law is not only a sign
of civilization and progress for a society, but also a powerful
guarantee of long-term stability.
</P>
<P>
He made this remark when he met with participants who attended
a conference on law today, which was sponsored by the China Law
Society.
</P>
<P>
He said that this is a basic policy of China, as Deng Xiaoping
advocated the development of socialist democracy and the
strengthening of the socialist legal system, beginning with the
3rd Plenary Session of the 11th Congress of the CPC Central
Committee in 1978.
</P>
<P>
He noted that without socialist democracy and a legal system
there would be no modernization drive in China. Therefore, he
noted, the Party, leading officials in particular, should make an
effort to promote socialist democracy and the legal system and
improve their style of leadership and management level.
</P>
<P>
Legal workers are an important force in promoting China's
democracy and its legal system, he said, adding that he hopes they
continue to work to resolve major issues under the guidance of
Deng's theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics,
and better serve the country's reform drive.

<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it is
worried and shocked by the escalating violences in Algeria, which
killed at least 150 people since the beginning of the Muslim
festival of Ramadan on January 10.
</P>
<P>
"In these tragic and revolting circumstances, we naturally have
to express our sadness and sympathy (with the Algerian people),"
said French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt.
</P>
<P>
A car bomb attack killed at least 21 people on a street in the
Algerian capital Algiers Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic extremists of the Armed Islamic Group have vowed to
escalate the war and denied neutrality of civilians.
</P>
<P>
"We are worried and shocked by the wave of violences which hit
blindly and savagely the Algerian people, especially those of the
capital (Algiers), whose population has been toughly tested," said
the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said that France, the former colonial power of Algeria and the
biggest economic and financial partner of the country, condemns the
violence, "no matter where it comes from, what it is, and what its
motives are."

<HEADLINE> EU to Send Mission to Belarus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The European Union(EU) is to
send a fact-finding mission to Belarus on January 26 to study the
legality of last November's constitutional referendum and the
circumstances under which it took place, the Dutch presidency
announced today.
</P>
<P>
The mission, led by former Dutch Justice Minister Aad Kosto,
will also examine the role of the opposition and the independent
media in the Belarussian political process.
</P>
<P>
Western countries believe the referendum greatly expanded
the powers of Belarussian President Alexander Lukashenko, who
favours a renewed economic union with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has strongly opposed NATO's planned expansion eastward
and has said it may have to respond by creating its own new bloc.
</P>
<P>
The decision to send a fact-finding mission to Belarus was
taken by EU foreign ministers during their meeting here on
Monday. The team will report to the next foreign ministers'
council meeting on February 24.

<HEADLINE> Nazarbayev Calls for Fundamental Reform of CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev has called for fundamental reform of the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), saying that without change, it will
become irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kazakhstan Pravda, Nazarbayev said that
since it was set up at the end of 1991, the CIS had failed to
unite the republics of the former Soviet Union. Instead these
countries had gradually become alienated from each other
politically, economically and socially, Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the life of the CIS could be divided into two
stages: the first from 1991-1992, and the second from 1993 onwards.
</P>
<P>
In the first stage, the economic system still in place after
the collapse of the Soviet Union still functioned. But in the
second stage, economic growth in all CIS member states dropped
significantly, damaging the economic ties linking the countries.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said 1997 would be crucial to CIS's future. Member
states must establish relations of mutual respect, clear up their
mistrust of each other, and promote economic integration.
</P>
<P>
But the president was upbeat on some aspects of the CIS and
said the organization had made some achievements.
</P>
<P>
"At least, we have successfully avoided such bloody clashes as
those that happened in the former Yugoslavia," he said.

BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's first international
electronic commerce center opened in Beijing today, according to
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Wu Yi, who made
the announcement at a national conference on foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Wu said the establishment of China International Electronic
Commerce Center and China Trade Network marks a new step toward
more intensive use of information for foreign trade and economic
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The center and the network will also provide an effective
channel for the world to get to know China, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
To enhance the role of information is an important task in
promoting the development of China's foreign trade, Wu explained,
noting that enterprises and foreign trade administrators should
increase the pace of entering the network, and to gradually link
up with banks, customs offices, tax offices, departments in charge
of foreign exchange and insurance, and commercial organizations in
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
She also encouraged the connection of the new center with the
UN trade information network and other international trade
networks.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reiterates Readiness to Resume Talks With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Israel reiterated today its
readiness to resume peace talks with Syria, which have been
stalled for months.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during a tour to the police headquarters today,
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that Israel was
interested in restarting the peace negotiations with Damascus.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said there were indications that the United States
would make new efforts to start the Israeli-Syrian talks
since the Monday inauguration of President Bill Clinton for a
second term.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai also stressed
that Israel was ready to restart negotiations with Syria at
any time in any place.
</P>
<P>
The minister was making the comments during a meeting with
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk and other diplomats, who
said the recent Hebron agreement had created favorable atmosphere
for pushing forward the whole Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Israel's call for renewing peace talks came after it completed
the long-delayed Hebron redeployment last Friday, a move regarded
as a major step to ease regional tension and push forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Egypt are moving quickly to make new efforts
to help resume the Israeli-Syrian talks that have been
suspended since early last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel is demanding renewing talks without any prior
conditions, while at the same time vows never to relinquish its
self-claimed sovereignty over the Golan Heights, which it seized
from Syria in the 1967 War.
</P>
<P>
For its part, Syria has declared that the only way to resume
peace talks was Israel's total withdrawal from the Golan
Heights. It urged Israel to restart the talks from where they were
left off last year.
</P>
<P>
Israel's previous Labor government reportedly had committed
itself to withdrawal from the Golan Heights in order to seal a
peace pact with Damascus, but the current Likud government has
refused to recognize this as the basis for renewing
talks.

<HEADLINE> Tensions Ease After Hebron Redeployment: Army </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A top Israeli army
officer said today that tensions have eased in the West Bank
since the Israeli army concluded its troops' redeployment in
Hebron, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Appearing in the Foreign Affair and Defense Committee of
the Knesset (Israel's parliament), Amnon Lipkin-Shahak, chief of
staff of the Israeli army, said that "most people are much
relaxed now."
</P>
<P>
Before the Hebron pullback, there had been reports from
diplomatic and security establishments of tensions in the West
Bank, particularly in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahak warned that there is still a small number
of people who could cause trouble, adding that both the Israelis
and Palestinians must act against them.
</P>
<P>
The chief of staff also expressed his hope that the
Palestinian police and the Palestinian National Authority "will
implement their responsibility," while on the other hand, the
Israeli side will try its best.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, the Israeli army completed its long-awaited
redeployment in the West Bank town of Hebron, less than
eight hours after the Knesset approved the Hebron agreement.
</P>
<P>
Jibril Rajoub, head of the Palestinian Preventive Security
forces in the West Bank and a Hebron native, said that the
Palestinians would try to fulfill their commitments in
the Hebron accord, and he hoped that the Israelis would do
the same.
</P>
<P>
As Palestinian policemen now taking over observation positions
close to the Jewish neighborhood, the residents in Hebron,
Jews and Palestinians, are entering a new era, in which they
will live side-by-side, hopefully in a peaceful way.

<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scholars studying
overseas wanting to find out about an investment policy for a
domestic high-tech development zone can now get the information
directly through the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The network includes information about overseas scholars and
their work, policies about returning home and working for the
country, lists of major colleges and universities, scientific
research institutes, and enterprises, and information about key
subjects and labs in China.
</P>
<P>
Official from the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange
(CSCSE), which is in charge of the network, say they will make it
a professional information resource center for overseas scholars
and a "technology information board".
</P>
<P>
Sites will also be set up in Chinese embassies and consulates,
CSCSE branches, and groups of overseas scholars in foreign
countries to speed information access.
</P>
<P>
Founded in early 1994 by CSCSE, the information network has
provided information about overseas scholars and domestic
companies.

<HEADLINE> Misguidance in Vain  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's state news agency,
Xinhua, released an article, entitled "Misguidance In Vain",
written by Wen Ming, today.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that recently some US news media have
published commentaries and reports that are obviously against the
wishes of the people of both China and the United States, and in a
sharp contrast to the two countries' improved relations.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that there are a number of columnists and
scholars in the US who have a deeply-rooted prejudice and
hostility toward China, which perseveres in the road of socialism,
and are extremely reluctant to resign themselves to the fact that
the "overall containment" policy used against China has ended in
failure.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, they have tried every means to undermine China's
image worldwide by misleading the general public in the US,
exerting influence on decision-makers, and throwing up barriers to
Sino-US relations by means of the news media," it said.
</P>
<P>
While continuing with different versions of the "China Threat",
these people rack their brains to come up with new Anti-China
theories. "Sometimes they spread pessimism and skepticism about
the return and future of Hong Kong, urging the US government to
step forward to interfere in an attempt to protect the 'freedom'
of Hong Kong. At other times they framed up lies about Tibet,
claiming that the people of the ethnic Tibetan group are still
being 'persecuted'," it noted.
</P>
<P>
These people deliberately turn a blind eye to China's political
stability and booming economy, and view the country with sarcasm
and in a distorted way.
</P>
<P>
They also wilfully accuse the Chinese government of "playing
the nationalism card", and openly call for Americans to boycott
Chinese goods.
</P>
<P>
"It's easy to change rivers and mountains but hard to change a
person's nature," as a Chinese proverb goes. Since they think they
are the chosen people and have the right to tell anybody what to
do, the article said, it's not easy to expect them to abandon
their hostility to China. It is necessary, however, to refute
these fallacies to allow for a correct view of the facts.

<HEADLINE> Africa Backs Cape Town's Olympic Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme Council of
Sport in Africa (SCSA) has endorsed South Africa's bid to host
the 2004 Olympic Games in Cape Town as "an African bid", the
South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Cape Town, Chief Executive
Officer of the Cape Town Olympic bid committee, Chris Ball, said
the SCSA had requested the continent's ministers of youth and
sport to actively support South Africa's bidding efforts.
</P>
<P>
Ball said SCSA's support was of special significance because
President Nelson Mandela and all levels of the South African
government had already stated that Cape Town's bid was as much
Africa's as it is South Africa's.
</P>
<P>
"The SCSA's pledge of support strongly reinforces our efforts
to bring the Olympic games to Africa for the first time," said
Ball.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town is the only African city among the 11 cities of the
world bidding for the right to host the 2004 Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The International Olympic Committee is expected to announce a
shortlist of the four or five finalist bidding cities on March 7,
and the 2004 host city will be named on September 5.
</P>
<P>
The other bidding cities are Athens, Buenos Aires, Istanbul,
Lille, Rio de Janeiro, Rome, San Juan, Seville, Stockholm and St.
Petersburg.

<P>
Some US newspapers, the article noted, have tried to deprive
China of its right to self-defense and explanation, and have
hurled unfounded charges against China and interfered with its
internal affairs themselves.
</P>
<P>
They have imposed recrimination upon China when it tries to
speak for itself, and gone so far to curse the Chinese government
as peddling "nationalism and exclusivism" as Hitler and his like
did, and they even voiced their resentment to the indignation of
the Chinese people about Japanese rightists' attempts to revive
militarism.
</P>
<P>
"What these people have is nothing but a psychology typical of
hegemonists," the article notes.
</P>
<P>
As is known to all, it goes on to say, China is striving to
promote among its people a kind of patriotism with reasoning. "The
Chinese do not go in for expansionism, nor will they tolerate
being suppressed or humiliated by anyone."
</P>
<P>
It points out that China's stability and development are an
indispensable, important factor to world peace, stability, and
development, and that China is seeking prosperity so as to make
more contributions to world peace.
</P>
<P>
"Some American politicians and members of the news media
deliberately confuse the lofty patriotic ideals of the Chinese
people with the narrow concept of nationalism and use this to
confuse the general public and place yet another obstacle in the
way of improved Sino-US relations," it said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that stable relations between China and the US comply
with the trend in the world development, and are in the interests
of both countries. With increased exchanges between the two
countries, more Americans have become aware that many reports in
the US media are simply not true, and say that they do not want
to be misguided any more.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of fooling the people will be the loss of their faith
and trust, and anyone trapped in Cold War thinking who refuses to
face reality will be surely abandoned by the people - this is a
historical law," it concludes.

<P>
The commentator's article cited a recent article from
"U.S.A. Today" that described China as a future "superpower" that
the US must take precautions against.
</P>
<P>
After China has taken back Hong Kong, Macao, and eventually
Taiwan, the American article claimed, the country will become
powerful enough to trigger a new round of Cold War and arms race.
</P>
<P>
"Anyone with an understanding of China can clearly see that
these words are just sheer nonsense," the article went on to say,
adding that the Chinese government has always followed an
independent foreign policy of peace, and is in firm opposition to
any form of hegemonism and power politics.
</P>
<P>
It said that 22 years ago, Senior Leader Deng Xiaoping had
already made the solemn declaration at the Six Special Meeting of
the United Nations General Assembly that China would never be a
superpower. "China is no threat to other countries now, and it
will not pose any threat to other nations even when it is even
more developed and its comprehensive national strength is
strengthened," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Some people in the West hold a very strange logic. Based on the
history of the US, Britain and other Western nations growing in
strength, from weak to strong, and finally launching aggression
against other countries, they alleged that China, too, will take
the similar road. The basic reason for some Americans feeling
nervous about China's growth is the fact that China's development
has added strength to the force of peace in the world, which
certainly is definitely no good news for the hegemonists.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that, while some Americans claim to be greatly
concerned about security in the Pacific region, they never utter a
word against Japan, which is rapidly becoming a military power
with a defense budget of over 50 billion US dollars a year, the
world's second largest. It goes on to note, "Quite to the
contrary, the US has even strengthened its security pact with
Japan, and extended its scope of defense to cover the whole
Asia-Pacific region that includes China."
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's military budget is less than one tenth that
of the US, which has become a major source of global disturbance
with a continuous display of military might.
</P>
<P>
"These facts can only lead us to conclude that the
so-called 'China Threat' is merely a pretext resorted to limit
China's development, one that has been refuted not only by Third
World countries, but also by a lot of sensible and far-sighted
people inside the US," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted former President George Bush as saying that he
never regarded China as a threat, and that China should deserve
due respect as a proud country.

HARARE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A three-day agricultural
workshop organized by the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) and the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation
(FAO) opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 participants from 11 of the 12 SADC countries will

impact of the trade agreements on food security and the
implications for agricultural exports.
</P>
<P>
FAO's eastern and southern Africa regional representative,
Victoria Sekitoleko, told the meeting that SADC countries should
change their agricultural policies to take into account economic
reforms currently underway.
</P>
<P>
She pointed out that the way agriculture is undertaken will
change radically in the future, hence the need for new policies.
</P>
<P>
"First and foremost, this concerns the list of policies that
are discouraged and those that are acceptable. Overall trade
regimes in future should be much more transparent and, as a
result, the quality of price signals faced by producers and
consumers should improve," said Sekitoleko.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Symposium On Deng Xiaoping's Theories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on Deng Xiaoping's
theories opened in Beijing today to mark the fifth anniversary of
his famous south China tour, one that added great impetus to the
country's reform and opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was hosted by the Party School of the Communist
Party of China's Central Committee, with 60 prominent academics
and journalists present.
</P>
<P>
Participants said they agreed that the keynote speech Deng made
during his southern visit, along with the 14th CPC national
congress in late 1992, indicated that China's reforms, opening up,
and modernization drive had entered a new phase.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Deng pointed out that a socialist country can
also have a market economy, one that is not identical to
capitalism, providing a theoretical basis for "building a
socialist market economic system".
</P>
<P>
The participants said Deng's speech integrated Marxism-Leninism
and Mao Zedong thought with the reality of China's reform and
development, and demonstrated the veteran leader's enormous
political and theoretical courage.
</P>
<P>
They said they attribute China's rapid growth over recent years
to the powerful guidance of Deng's theories, as well as the
correct and firm leadership of the Party Central Committee with
Jiang Zemin at its core, and that a careful re-examination of
Deng's 1992 speech in current circunstances can further promote
research on and publicity about Deng's theories of building
socialism with Chinese characteristics, and greatly benefit the
country's economic development.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Inflation Falls to 39 Percent in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Annual inflation slowed
significantly in Ukraine last year, rising 39 percent compared
with more than 1,000 percent in 1993, a senior official said today.
</P>
<P>
Valery Litvitsky, chief economic advisor to Ukrainian President
Leonid Kuchma, said the fall in production had also slowed down,
from 15 percent in 1995 to 5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
"It's a sign of the beginning of stability," he said.
</P>
<P>
But Litvitsky warned that the potential for inflation still
exists in the government's immense debts to workers in the form of
some 1 billion hryvnas (530 million U.S. dollars) in unpaid wages.
</P>
<P>
Disgruntled mine workers protested outside government
headquarters last week to demand up to 12 months of back pay.
</P>
<P>
Litvitsky said the country needed to keep a tight rein on
inflation to secure more financial assistance from international
lenders. The nation has absorbed only 1 billion dollars of foreign
investment since independence in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Economic reform in Ukraine has been slower than in many other
former Soviet republics. The underground economy remains huge and
analysts believe up to 45 percent of Ukrainians live below the
poverty line.

Corporation and the city of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
The first-phase of the project includes construction of a
offshore platform, drilling of 13 oil and gas wells, the laying of
365-km of natural gas pipeline, the construction of a natural gas
treatment plant in Nanhui, the laying of 305-km of crude oil
pipeline, and the building of a crude oil transmission station in
Daishan, in Zhejiang Province. Total cost is estimated at five
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Natural Gas Treatment Plant of Shanghai will cover an area
of 130,000 square meters and will mainly be used to process
natural gas from the pipeline to supply the Pudong New Area of
Shanghai. The plant has a daily handling capacity of 1.6 million
cu.m. of natural gas and is expected to be operational at the end
of 1998.

<HEADLINE> Russian Top Diplomat to Meet NATO Chief Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov and NATO Secretary-General Javier Solana, who met in
Moscow on Monday, will hold another round of talks next month, a
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman said today.
</P>
<P>
Gennady Tarasov, director of the ministry's press and
information department, did not specify the date or venue of the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the first round of talks between the two men
was "useful," although "the sides differ in their approaches to a
number of issues."
</P>
<P>
Solana arrived in Moscow on Sunday evening and held his first
round of talks with Primakov on Monday over NATO's eastward
expansion plans, which Russia strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
The two sides failed to reach agreement on the issue but, said
Tarasov, no one should have expected any sensational breakthrough
from the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov told Solana negotiations on Russian relations
with NATO and the relationship itself could not be viewed as
"compensation" for Russian agreement on NATO's plans to admit
former Warsaw Pact countries. He said Moscow would remain negative
about NATO expansion.
</P>
<P>
Tarasov said that this stance is dictated by a whole range of
political, military-strategic and moral-psychological reasons.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of any statements and intentions, any unbiased
observer can clearly see that expansion of the alliance creates
the threat of new division lines in Europe, which could lead to
consequences all of us tried to get rid of with the end of the
Cold war," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Because of this, he said, ways needed to be found to avoid any
eastward spread of NATO military infrastructure and the 1991
Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty signed before the fall of the
Soviet Union needed to be changed to take account of the new
geopolitical realities in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The talks would also try to work out a formula for Moscow-NATO
relations, which would meet Russia's security requirements and the
tasks of building a new Europe in the 21st century, Tarasov said.

<HEADLINE> Germany To Improve Business Ties With Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Southern Africa
Initiative of German Business (SAFRI) today announced its plan to
improve its business relations with the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Johannesburg, SAFRI said it is aimed
at stablising the 12-member Southern African Development
Community (SADC) by pouring massive overseas investment into the
region.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the plan will help dispel international
pessimism and help usher SADC countries into the global market,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, SAFRI said it will also initially concentrate on
business-related projects such as training, organizing investment
schemes and working with small and medium-sized businesses in the
SADC region.
</P>
<P>
The plan, a brainchild of German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and
Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel, was supported by various German
enterprises, including the German Chamber of Commerce and
Industry.

<HEADLINE> China To Combat Air Pollution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- At the 10th session of China's
State Council's 3rd Environmental Protection Commission today,
State Councillor Song Jian called on the country to take steps to
prevent air pollution from going from bad to worse.
</P>
<P>
"The quality of the air has a close tie with people's health,"
Song, who is director of the environmental commission of the State
Council, noted.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the conference say that sulfur dioxide has been a
major factor in the deteriorating environment, causing air
pollution and acid rain in west and south China.
</P>
<P>
China plans to study air pollution in 47 major cities,
including Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Shenyang, Guangzhou and
Xi'an, with the first ten expected to hand in weekly reports on
local air pollution this June.
</P>
<P>
"Its aim is to reflect the current environmental situation in
large and medium-sized cities, and solicit comments from the
public," Song said.
</P>
<P>
The deteriorating environment and rapid population growth are
becoming serious threats to resources and environment, and to
China's sustained economic development. China has to take steps to
fight environmental pollution, such as closing small enterprises
which seriously pollute the environment.

<HEADLINE> China Praise Rule of Returned Scholars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 21 (Xinhua) -- China's 18-year's of sending
scholars abroad for further study has trained a large group of
professionals and enlarged China's cooperation with other
countries in science and technology, education, culture, economy
and trade, according to Wei Yu, vice-minister of the State
Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Wei was speaking today at a national conference on overseas
scholars held by the SEC and the Ministry of Personnel, the first
of its kind ever held in China since the late 1970s when the
country started its reform and opening up drive.
</P>
<P>
Wei, got a doctorate in electronics from Aachen Industrial
University in Germany, in 1981, and was the first women from new
China to get a doctorate from that university.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, 157 academics of the Chinese Academy
of Engineering (CAE) were scholars who returned to China over the
past decade or so. Returned scholars also account for over half of
those doing key scientific research projects or who are listed as
top professionals given priority in research fund.
</P>
<P>
To help overseas scholars work for the country, various
organizations were formed, including the Chinese Service Center
for Scholarly Exchange. Education sections were also set up in
Chinese embassies or consulates in foreign countries where most
overseas scholars stay and study.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange has 23
branches in China and service centers in Berlin, San Francisco,
and New York so that it can provide direct services overseas.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, approximately 270,000 Chinese went
abroad for advanced training over the past 18 years. Over 120,000
of them were sponsored by the State or their work units, with the
remainder self-supporting.
</P>
<P>
Some 90,000 of these people have completed their overseas study
and returned.
</P>
<P>
However, Wei added, most of these scholars chose to work in
educational or scientific research institutes based in Beijing or
other big or medium-sized coastal cities, which are more developed
than other parts of the country, and not enough returning scholars
want to work in central or western areas.
</P>
<P>
Wei expressed the hope that departments and officials would
work harder to provide still better working and living conditions
for returning scholars.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Leaves for Prague to Sign Czech-German Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 21 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
leaves for Prague today to sign a highly controversial
Czech-German reconciliation accord.
</P>
<P>
The accord, to be signed by Kohl and Czech Prime Minister
Vaclav Klaus at 4:15 p.m.(1515 GMT), is the result of more than
two years of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The deal is aimed at helping heal the wounds of World War Two
and its aftermath. It also includes German support for Czech
membership of the European Union and North Atlantic Treaty
Organization.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Bonn expresses sorrow for the 1938-45 Nazi
occupation of Czech land. Prague also states its regret for Czech
brutality in the post-war expulsion of Sudeten Germans.
</P>
<P>
Czech President Vaclav Havel said that the declaration between
the two nations is a "great step forward" and will undoubtedly
help people reconsider the past, though it cannot thoroughly
change the biased attitudes the two countries have held
towards each other.
</P>
<P>
Havel's comments were echoed in the positive response from
different political parties in Germany. The Chairman of the Free
Democratic Party Wolfgang Gerhardt hailed the accord as "one
shaping a common future for wronged Germans and Czechs".
</P>
<P>
Ex-Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher said it opens a road
leading to the future of Europe for both countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Sudeten Germans held a protest rally against the
declaration, saying it has not solved any controversial problems
left behind by history, but merely creates more.

<HEADLINE> Global Musical Sales to Rise 7 Percent Each Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The world's musical sales are
expected to increase 7 percent each year between 1997 and 2002
with retail sales hitting 62.12 billion U.S. dollars in 2002,
according to a new study.
</P>
<P>
The study, to be published later this week by Market Tracking
International (MTI), suggested that the global musical market
should regain momentum in the coming years following a slowdown in
sales last year.
</P>
<P>
The global music market grew by 66 percent from 1990 to 38.8
billion dollars in 1995, but MTI estimates it increased just 5
percent last year to 40.86 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the estimated sales will increase 7 percent this year
to amount to 43.87 billion dollars with Asia's sales trebling to
8.82 billion dollars by 2002, the fastest growing rate.
</P>
<P>
Musical sales are also expected to treble to 1.83 billion
dollars in eastern Europe during the period, and Latin America
market will rise 139 percent in the same period to 4.46 billion
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Conference on European Arms Treaty Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The conference to revise the
Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe opens here today in
a bid to decide future ceiling numbers on troops, tanks, fighters
and artillery in European countries.
</P>
<P>
The conference, attended by 30 member states of NATO and the
former Warsaw Pact, will focus on amendments to the treaty signed
by NATO and Warsaw Pact member countries in 1990 before the fall
of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
Amendments to the treaty are being demanded by Russia to take
account of the significant changes which have taken place in the
continent's political landscape since 1990.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, negotiated under the auspices of the Organization
of Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), was signed by the
member states of NATO and of the now defunct Warsaw Pact to cap
the levels of weapons and troops around Europe. It took effect on
November 17 1995.
</P>
<P>
But just before that date, Russia announced that its could not
meet its treaty obligations because it feared that reduced
military might on its frontiers would ruin its defense
capabilities. It was particularly concerned about its southern
flank near the troubled Caucasus, where Russia troops once fought
Chechen rebels.
</P>
<P>
By missing the deadline Russia was in technical violation of
the pact, but it argued that the treaty limits on military
equipment allowed on a state's borders had to be altered, because
Russia's frontiers were not the same as the Soviet Union's.
</P>
<P>
The United States accepted Moscow's argument and put pressure
on its NATO allies to agree to adapt the pact, despite concern
from Norway and Turkey over any increase in Russian military
equipment near their border.
</P>
<P>
The conference, decided by the OSCE summit last December, is
expected to last one and half years.

<HEADLINE> UK Needs Radical Policy Initiatives: Business Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Britain's business needs a
number of radical policy initiatives by the next government if the
UK is to climb the prosperity league table, senior business
leaders argue.
</P>
<P>
A report, entitled, Promoting Prosperity: A Business Agenda for
Britain, launched here today analyses why the UK is not performing
better, sets out what principles should guide future business
policy and establishes an agenda for action for the next
government.
</P>
<P>
The report was unanimously adopted by the Commission on Public
Policy and British Business (CPPBB) which includes senior business
leaders in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Promoting Prosperity identifies four linked problems: too many
unsuccessful companies, too many underachieving people, too little
investment, and too frequent shifts in government policy.
</P>
<P>
These problems would be remedied if the government were to:
promote competition and cooperation, foster far-sighted companies,
mobilize people's potential, and maintain greater consistency in
its policies, the report adds.
</P>
<P>
Among a large range of recommendations, Promoting Prosperity
calls for: -- Stiffer competition policy,
</P>
<P>
-- A new Council of Institutional Investors to target
underperforming companies,
</P>
<P>
-- Increased funding for nursery and primary education,
</P>
<P>
-- A Level reform to reduce the damaging effects of early
specialization by children.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the above measures, it also calls for: Independence
for the Bank of England to help steady the roller-coaster
macro-economy.
</P>
<P>
In addition the Commission accepts the need for a national
minimum wage to control welfare costs and favors opting-in to the
Social Chapter.
</P>
<P>
But it is relatively cautious on EMU entry which it views as
politically desirable to retain influence in the Single Market but
whose economic advantages are less clear.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Promoting Prosperity, Opposition Leader Tony
Blair said: "This report sets the business policy agenda for the
next decade."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the conclusion of the report that UK's economy is
in the position of "relative decline", Michael Heseltine, Deputy
Prime Minister, said: "Britain's relative decline has been
reversed for the first time since the Second World War."
</P>
<P>
He also quoted the latest OECD Economic Outlook as saying
"Britain's prospects for achieving sustained output growth and low
inflation are the best in 30 years."
</P>
<P>
"The Commission can't bring itself to get the story right,"
said, the Deputy Prime Minister. "The relative decline", they
concluded "may be bottoming out", he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rejects US Proposal on Banning Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government told
the United States and the European Union today that it would not
bow to a U.S.-backed proposal on banning overflights of Greek and
Turkish military aircraft in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Alecos Michaelides said that such a move
would be tantamount to conceding the right to control its air
space to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
He announced the Cypriot position during his meetings with the
U.S. ambassador here and the ambassadors of EU members.
</P>
<P>
"A halt of overflights would mean that we recognize the right
to Turkey to share with us ownership of our air space. This
cannot be accepted," Michaelides told reporters after the
meetings.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the Cypriot government has given assurances to ban
overflights when the peace talks start, the minister said the
government will refrain from any move that would create
tension.
</P>
<P>
"We may take certain steps unilaterally to facilitate the
climate of the dialogue without asking anything in return from
the other side," he added.
</P>
<P>
U.S. ambassador to Cyprus Kenneth Brill expressed
disappointment today with the Cypriot government's decision,
backed by Athens, not to accept the U.S. proposal for a
moratorium on overflights of Greek and Turkish military aircraft
in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
"We are disappointed that this opportunity to move forward
was not taken," Brill said after his meeting with Michaelides.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the U.S. position, Michaelides said "the
U.S. may be disappointed because they wished to see each step
adopted as proposed. We have heard this but we have also
explained that any moves taken must not have a poltical cost."
</P>
<P>
Asked if the U.S. disappointment may have negative
repercussions on the U.S. initiative on Cyprus, which is
expected to be launched in April, the minister said "I do not
think so because the U.S. recognizes that Turkey poses the main
problem, there are far more flights by Turkish aircraft than
Greek planes."
</P>
<P>
He said he explained to the ambassadors that "Cyprus wishes
to see intensive effort to prepare the ground before direct
negotiations begin."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. proposal for a ban on military flights over the
island was first put forward last summer by Madeleine Albright,
former U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations and
now new U.S. secretary of state.
</P>
<P>
U.S. special envoy Carey Cavanaugh reiterated the proposal
during his recent three-nation tour which took him to Cyprus,
Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Cyprus' President Glafcos Clerides announced after his
talks with Greek leaders during his recent visit to Greece that
the moratorium banning Greek and Turkish military aircraft
flights over the island "is dead."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has accused Greece of rejecting the U.S. proposal,
saying that the Greek government was reluctant to ease tensions
on the eastern Mediterranean island.
</P>
<P>
The relation between Greece and Turkey has always been tense
for the Aegean and Cyprus issues, and has become even worse as a
result of the Cypriot government's decision to buy Russian-made
S-300 missiles with a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> UK Bank Governor Repeats Call for Interest Rate Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The governor of the Bank of
England Eddie George Monday night delivered an unequivocal warning
that interest rates would have to rise if inflation was to be kept
in check.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to bankers in Edinburgh, Scotland, the governor
renewed his call for "a modest pre-emptive tightening of monetary
policy" to prevent a resurgence in inflation.
</P>
<P>
His call came less than a week after his monthly monetary
meeting with the Chancellor of the Exchequer Kenneth Clarke at
which Clarke decided to leave interest rates unchanged from the
current six percent.
</P>
<P>
Clarke had cited the strength of sterling as the key reason he
did not raise rates, saying that "the big thing at the moment is
that the pound is very strong and that is very anti-inflationary".
</P>
<P>
However, the governor indicated that the pound should not be
used as an excuse to delay raising rates, as the stronger exchange
rate had no direct effect on the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
"There could be real dangers in allowing justified concern
about the exchange rate to deflect us too long from moving
gradually to moderate the (economic) upswing," George added.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor reiterated the Bank of England's
belief that the earlier rates were increased, the less they would
ultimately have to rise.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that rapid falls in unemployment and the
recovery in the housing market indicated demand might be
strengthening and said that was why he believed that the choice of
a rise of interest rates was not whether or not, it is sooner or
later, less or more.

<HEADLINE> No Threats to S. Africa Over Arms Sales, Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 21 (Xinhua) --The United States
Ambassador to South Africa James Joseph said on Tuesday his
country was not threatening Pretoria over a possible 638 million
U.S. Dollar arms deal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
" No one in the U.S. administration is threatening South
Africa," Joseph told reporters in Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
Referring to remarks by a U.S. State Department Spokesman one
week ago that the U.S. might to suspend aid to South Africa if
the latter sells advanced arms to Syria, Joseph said what the
U.S.government spokesman said meant that Washington is required
to implement state laws. Such acknowlegement should not be
considered a threat, he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. counter-terrorism act requires the American
government to act against countries which provide lethal military
equipemnt to "state sponsors of terrorism".
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Dismisses Turkish Threats </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today turned down the
Turkish threats that it will set up air and naval bases in
northern part of the island and dismissed them as "not serious."
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a joint declaration issued Monday in Ankara
after a meeting between Turkish President Suleyman Demirel and
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash, Cypriot Foreign Minister
Alecos Michaelides said the occupied part of the island is in
itself a Turkish military base and therefore the Cypriot
government does not consider Ankara's threats as serious.
</P>
<P>
In the joint statement, Turkey has threatened to set up air
and naval bases in the Turkish-occupied areas of the island if
the Cypriot government deploys Russian-made anti-aircraft
missiles on the island and goes ahead with establishing an
air and naval base.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that any aggression directed against
Turkey or the Turkish Cypriot regime in northern Cyprus "will be
jointly confronted and the military planning and co-ordination
necessary for this will be done."
</P>
<P>
Michaelides said that for the past 22 years Turkey has been
occupying 37 per cent of the island's territory, adding that
Turkey keeps 35,000 troops on the island and uses the airport at
Lefkoniko for military purposes and Kyrenia as a naval base.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The tension has escalated on the island following the Cypriot
government's recent decision to buy Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles with a range of 150 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> UN Conference on Disarmament Begins Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Disarmament (CD) began its 1997 session with no agreed agenda here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The CD is supposed to adopt the agenda and its work program at
the beginning of the session. But unfortunately I have to inform
you that the consultation is still under way," South Korean
Ambassador Joun Yung Sun told reporters at the end of today's
session.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "I hope, in the very near future, we'll be able to
get together and discuss the possibility of the adoption of the
agenda." Items in his draft agenda include nuclear disarmament,
cut-off treaty, negative security assurances, transparency in
armaments, prevention of an arms race in outer space and
anti-personnel land-mines, and regional disarmament.
</P>
<P>
During the current session from January 21 to March 27,
delegates from 61 CD members will discuss proposed issues and then
adopt an agenda if consensus could be reached after consultations.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half years of negotiations culminating in the
drafting of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treat approved by
the UN General Assembly last September, the CD is now ready to
focus increased attention on other issues on the international
disarmament agenda.
</P>
<P>
The question of nuclear disarmament is at the heart of the
concerns of many delegations, with 21 non-aligned nations calling
for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear
disarmament as a matter of priority on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, like Italy and the United States, insist
that a ban of the production of weapons-grade fissile material and
a solution of the problem of anti-personnel land-mines should be
considered in the CD session. "These are the two main subjects we
have identified," said Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs at a
separate press conference.
</P>
<P>
The CD presidency rotates among all of its members for a four
working-week period in accordance with the listing of the
membership in English alphabetical order. The representatives of
the following member states will serve as conference presidents
during the 1997 session: South Korea, Romania, Russia, Senegal,
Slovakia, and South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Airbus to Go Ahead with "Super Airliner" Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Airbus Industry, the European
aircraft manufacturer, announced today that it would press ahead
with its plans to build a "super airliner", according to a BBC
television report.
</P>
<P>
The four-nation European consortium reaffirmed its
determination to stick to its super jet project following the
decision by its main U.S. rival Boeing to drop its plans for its
990-seater airliner.
</P>
<P>
Boeing was reported as saying that it was too risky to spend 5
billion pounds (about 8 billion U.S. dollars) on large aircraft
when there were few orders for them.
</P>
<P>
However, Airbus Industry, in which British Aerospace has a 20
percent stake, insisted that there was a demand for a "superliner"
in the world aviation market.
</P>
<P>
Boeing and Airbus are the two largest players in the global
aircraft manufacturing field and Airbus is now under great
pressure to promote its competition capabilities following
Boeing's successful merging of MacDonald, another major U.S.
aircraft manufacturer.

<HEADLINE> Stiffer Competition Policy Central to Strengthen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The Commission on Public Policy
and British Business's (CPPBB) report launched here today, argues
that the current government has failed British business by
dragging its feet on promised reforms of UK competition policy.
</P>
<P>
The report entitled Promoting Prosperity describes current
policy as "feeble" since although anti-competitive practices may
be banned, there is little other penalty on offending companies.
</P>
<P>
It recommends that the next government take specific steps to
stiffen competition policy and that it should also investigate
other ways of raising the quality of domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The report calls for the overall design of competition policy
to be shifted more towards the prohibition approach with legal
penalties and fines for specified anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the report argues that the institutions of
competition policy require an overhaul to make policy more
effective and less prone to political interference.
</P>
<P>
Promoting Prosperity details following policy changes to
promote competitive product markets:
</P>
<P>
-- The government should adopt a prohibition approach to
restrictive agreements and abuse of market power with stiffer
penalties for anti-competitive behavior,
</P>
<P>
-- There should be a substantial increase in the powers of the
Director General of Fair Trading to investigate suspected
anti-competitive behavior,
</P>
<P>
-- The Secretary of State's role in competition policy should
be made transparent through the obligatory publication of a report
with reasons for his or her decisions,
</P>
<P>
-- The responsibilities of the Office of Fair Trading and the
Commission of Monopoly and Mergence should be realigned to make
the OFT the principal agent of investigation and prosecution with
the MMC concentrating on adjudication,
</P>
<P>
-- The government should be predisposed to public disclosure of
the information it has about companies where that would enable
consumers to make more informed choices.

CAIRO, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The following are business
briefs from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu is about
to invite some of the world's top businessmen, led by
U.S. software giant Bill Gates, to visit Israel in a bid to
attract more foreign investment, Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The list of guests also includes other big names such as Wall
Street financier George Soros, Japan's Itocho Corp. President
Minoru Murofushi, Wolkswagen Chief Executive (CEO) Ferdinand
Piech, Siemens' CEO Heinrich von Pierer, Sara lee Corp. Chairman
John Bryan, General Motors Corp. President John Smith and General
Electric Co. Chairman John Welch.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Dead Sea Works and the Bromine Company, both
subsidiaries of Israel Chemicals, intend to acquire 80 percent
of a Czech firm engaged in pharmaceutical chemicals.
</P>
<P>
The acquisition price is estimated at 20 million U.S. dollars
and the factory will be built close to Prague, capital of the
Czech Republic, according to President of Dead Sea Works Ben Soon
quoted by local press today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to invest in an overseas company is due to the
government's decision to reduce benefits in the framework of the
Ministry of Industry and Trade's investment incentive program.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- A total of 55 foreign institutions and funds have up
to now invested in Jordan's stock market, Jordan Times today
quoted an official from the Amman Financial Market (AFM) as saying
here.
</P>
<P>
Most of these institutions and funds which have recently
entered Jordan are from European countries and the United States,
said AFM Director General Wahib Shair.
</P>
<P>
He said that 19 non-Jordanian institutions invested at the AFM
last year compared with only nine in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shair estimated that the total volume of non-Jordanian trading
at the AFM to be around 44 million Jordanian dinars (about 62
million U.S. dollars), of which about 26.5 million dinars (about
37.3 million dollars) was for purchasing transactions and less
than 18 million dinars (about 25 million dollars) for selling
deals.
</P>
<P>
AFM has been one of the most developed and fast growing stock
markets in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Hold Free Trade Talks with EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January (Xinhua) -- South Africa's development
needs as well as those of its neighbors will have to be
recognized in any trade agreement with the European Union (EU),
the South African trade negotiation team members said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director-General of the Foreign Affairs Ministry Abdul
Minty told reporters in Pretoria that South Africa is a young
democracy and its own development cannot take place in isolation
from the rest of the region.
</P>
<P>
This will be the central message to the European Commission
when trade talks for a free trade agreement between South Africa
and the EU resume in Pretoria on January 24, said Minty.
</P>
<P>
According to a document on South Africa's stance of the talks,
scheduled to be formally presented to EU negotiators, the EU has
so far failed to recognize the integrated nature of the South
African economy with that of Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa called for a trade and development
agreement instead of a free trade agreement with the EU.
</P>
<P>
In terms of a EU mandate set out in March last year, 40
percent of South Africa's agricultural products are excluded from
the proposed agreement.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, Chief Director of Foreign Trade Relations of
the Department of Trade and Industry, Faizel Ismail, said the
EU's mandate will bring into question the acceptability of such a
deal to the World Trade Organization, which requires at least 90
percent of all trade be included in such an agreement for
ratification.
</P>
<P>
Listing South Africa's other broad concerns, Ismail said the
EU has to take into account that the European economy is large
and competitive, therefore, adjustment costs in the South African
economy brought about by any free trade deal will have to be
addressed by mechanisms put into place by the EU.
</P>
<P>
South Africa's Ambassador to the EU, Elias Links, who will
head his country's delegation, said the upcoming talks will set
the stage for intensive detailed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"What must be understood is that there is underlying
seriousness on both sides to present an ultimate position to the
benefit of both sides, and in our case also to the region," said
Links.

<HEADLINE> - Sudanese Vice-President Ends Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Vice-President
Al-Zubeir Mohammed Salih left here today after a two-day
discussion on the current military situation in eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Damascus Airport by Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Syrian sources disclosed that during a meeting on
Monday, the Sudanese vice-president briefed Khaddam on what he
called external military intervention in Sudan aimed at
overthrowing the Sudanese government and undermining its unity
and the Arab nature of the country.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Syrian vice-president reiterated that his
country supports the territorial integrity of Sudan and unity of
its people, and opposes any foreign interference in Sudan's
internal affairs, on the grounds that Sudan's security is part and
parcel of the Arab security.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Sudanese vice-president to Syria came within
the framework of several tours undertaken by Sudanese emissaries
dispatched by President Oman Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir to a number
of Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the tours is to brief the Arab leaders and
governments on the latest developments of the military situation
in Sudan, and seek Arab assistance in repelling what the
emissaries have described as Eritrean-Ethiopian aggression against
Sudan's territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government army has recently repelled an attack
in eastern Sudan. The offensive reportedly launched from Ethiopia
and Eritrea was under the command of southern Sudanese rebel
leader John Garang.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused Eritrea and Ethiopia of supporting and
fighting along with the Sudanese opposition, a charge rejected by
both countries. However the Sudanese opposition has denied any
external interference in the military maneuver.

<P>
OTTAWA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Canada's newest bank - the
branchless Citizens Bank of Canada - has opened its telephone
lines for business, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The bank, granted the federal charter Monday, enables clients
to do their banking by telephone, personal computer and automatic
teller machine 24 hours a day seven days a week.
</P>
<P>
Services will also be offered through the Internet once the
bank can solve some security concern, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
As a wholly owned subsidiary of Vancouver City Savings Credit
Union, Citizens Bank will start by focusing on the Toronto,
Calgary and Vancouver markets, providing clients with loans,
deposit accounts and mortgages.
</P>
<P>
In Canada, a number of banks have already launched their own
electronic banking versions, it is reported.
</P>
<P>
"We're not opening up an electronic banking arm for a big bank.
We're something completely different," Linda Crompton, president
of the Vancouver-based electronic bank was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
As the name Citizens Bank suggests, it is a bank of the people,
"branchless, but not faceless," she said, adding that the bank
will offer financial services with a social conscience.
</P>
<P>
Crompton predicted that the new bank hopes to have 30,000 to
40,000 members by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Citizens Bank has assets of exceeding 450 million U.S. dollars.
Its parent company is the largest credit union in Canada with
226,000 members and 3.5 billion dollars in assets.

continues, according to a report by the Equal Opportunities
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The study said that between 1975 and 1995 the average hourly
pay gap closed by 9 percent. If this trend continues, it will be
another 45 years before it disappears.
</P>
<P>
The commission said that pay difference are particularly wide
in managerial posts as female general managers and administrators
earn 42 percent less than their male colleagues and for women bank
and building society managers the gap is 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
"There can be no equality of opportunity without equality in
pay. Throughout their working lives women earn less than men,
whether they are lawyers or sales assistants," said Kamlesh Bahl,
chairwoman of the commission.
</P>
<P>
She added that unless significant changes are made in the way
the pay gap is tackled, women face a future of continuing
inequality.
</P>
<P>
Women working part-time earn 58 percent of the hourly rate of
male full-timers. One in five of the population, most of them
women, now works part-time.
</P>
<P>
The pay gap is widest in the South-East where women earn on
average 22.1 percent less than men compared with the national
average of 20 percent. It is narrowest in Wales at 19 percent.

<HEADLINE> UN Conference on Disarmament Begins Without </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Conference on
Disarmament (CD) began its 1997 session with no agreed agenda here
today.
</P>
<P>
"The CD is supposed to adopt the agenda and its work program at
the beginning of the session. But unfortunately I have to inform
you that the consultation is still under way," South Korean
Ambassador Joun Yung Sun told reporters at the end of today's
session.
</P>
<P>
Sun said, "I hope, in the very near future, we'll be able to
get together and discuss the possibility of the adoption of the
agenda." Items in his draft agenda include nuclear disarmament,
cut-off treaty, negative security assurances, transparency in
armaments, prevention of an arms race in outer space and
anti-personnel land-mines, and regional disarmament.
</P>
<P>
During the current session from January 21 to March 27,
delegates from 61 CD members will discuss proposed issues and then
adopt an agenda if consensus could be reached after consultations.
</P>
<P>
After two-and-a-half years of negotiations culminating in the
drafting of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treat approved by
the UN General Assembly last September, the CD is now ready to
focus increased attention on other issues on the international
disarmament agenda.
</P>
<P>
The question of nuclear disarmament is at the heart of the
concerns of many delegations, with 21 non-aligned nations calling
for the establishment of an ad hoc committee on nuclear
disarmament as a matter of priority on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Western countries, like Italy and the United States, insist
that a ban of the production of weapons-grade fissile material and
a solution of the problem of anti-personnel land-mines should be
considered in the CD session. "These are the two main subjects we
have identified," said Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs
Lamberto Dini at a separate press conference.
</P>
<P>
The CD presidency rotates among all of its members for a four
working-week period in accordance with the listing of the
membership in English alphabetical order. The representatives of
the following member states will serve as conference presidents
during the 1997 session: South Korea, Romania, Russia, Senegal,
Slovakia, and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan will come to Geneva and address
the conference on January 30.

<HEADLINE> Car Bomb Explosion Kills 6 in Central Algiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A car bomb attack by Islamic
extremists killed at least six people and wounded more than 40
this afternoon in the center of the Algerian capital of Algiers,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
This attack brought to 150 the number of victims killed since
the beginning of the Muslim festival of Ramadan this month, in an
unprecedented wave of massacres committed by the militant
movement, the Armed Islamic Group (GIA).
</P>
<P>
Shortly before 16:45 (1545 GMT), a Honda-Civic car packed with
explosives blew up near a passenger bus on the Boulevard des
Martyrs, a major thoroughfare of the city, the Agence France
Presse (AFP) quoted witnesses as saying.
</P>
<P>
AFP said that the boom of the explosion was heard in most parts
of central Algiers, and spread panic in the city, which has been
repeatedly hit by bombing attacks over the past 10 days after the
Ramadan began.
</P>
<P>
Houses lining on the two sides of the street were seriously
damaged and pieces of iron scraps were scattered on the pavement,
while the central Mustapha hospital was filled with the wounded,
including a five-year-old child whose eye was wounded, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Another car bomb explosion killed at least 21 people Sunday
evening in Algiers, according to official figures. Private sources
put the number of victims at 42.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Algerian press published today a communique
issued by the GIA vowing to continue the massacres and saying that
"there was no more neutrality in the war."
</P>
<P>
"The war will continue and intensify during the month of
Ramadan, and we have the means and men to punish those who are not
on our side," said the communique signed by the GIA chief, Antar
Zouabri.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Set to Import Maize to Ensure Food Supply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap
Moi today announced that his government has decided to import
maize to ensure food supply as Kenya was hit by a severe drought
during the past year.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here today, the president noted that
many parts of the country were experiencing drought and hence
food shortage due to the failure of the short and long rains last
year.
</P>
<P>
A food situation report compiled by the Inter-Governmental
Authority on Development said that about 1.5 million people
require relief food in Kenya following poor rains in the
vulnerable areas of eastern and northeastern provinces.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the long rains maize production for 1996
is estimated at two million tons, a 20-percent decline compared
with 1995.
</P>
<P>
The overall cereal production in the country is estimated at
3.8 million tons for the 1996/97 marketing year while the total
consumption stands at 4.5 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In a new year address, Moi declared that the shortage of
staple food is one of the major challenges facing Kenya in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Mike Sackett, the Director of the World Food Program to Kenya,
said recently that "the (food) situation in 1997 is the most
serious since the 1992/93 drought. If the next rains in March and
April fail, we have big problems."
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government formally requested donor assistance
earlier this month following months of increase of food prices
and higher rates of malnutrition and infant mortality in
northeastern Kenya due to drought.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations disaster management team, which is on a
visit to Northeastern Province of Kenya, today learned that over
50 percent of livestock was wiped out by the drought and the
pastoral families run towards urban areas for survival.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Algerian diplomat
Mohamed Sahnoun, who once headed the U.N. operation in Somalia,
will be named a special representative for the Great Lakes region
of Central Africa, U.N. sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun was appointed to head the U.N. Somalia operation in
April 1992 but resigned in the following October after a row with
the then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
He was rebuked by Boutros-Ghali for publicly saying the United
Nations came too late to save many of the millions of Somalis
facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
His diplomatic career has included service as Algeria's
ambassador to the United Nations in 1982-84, and to the United
States (1984-1989). He was deputy secretary-general of the Arab
League in 1973 and from 1964 to 1973 was deputy secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region of Central Africa has been in turmoil
for the past three years following large-scale ethnic violence
between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi.

LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major stock markets
in Europe recovered from their morning losses and ended
positively, boosted by U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan's upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George's call Monday
night for a rate hike to ensure that government inflation targets
are met cast a shadow over morning dealings on the London market.
</P>

But share prices bounced off their lows when the Dow shook off
an early bout of profit-taking to push higher, with the FTSE 100
index closing 1.5 points up at 4,195.5 after a low of 4,167.6.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, profit-taking after recent strong
gains made the DAX-30 index sharply lower at the close, down 53.97
points at 2,976.71, falling through the 3,000 points level.
</P>
<P>
The Paris bourse had also fallen to a session low of 2,384.77
in the morning before taking heart from Greenspan and finishing up
3.78 points at 2,409.88.

<HEADLINE> Wang Junxia Sick, Coach Reveals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's Wang Junxia, world
record holder for the women's 10,000 meters and 5,000m winner at
the Atlanta Olympics, has been plagued by an illness in the past
two months, her coach Mao Dezhen told Xinhua through telephone
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"She was overtired after the Olympics, and the doctor said she
had contracted a nervous disorder, forcing her out of regular
training in the past few months," said Mao, who is now training
his other runners in China's southern city Nanning.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who won the Jesse Owens Award of 1993 due to a series of
brilliant record-beating performances and became the best distance
runner of the world under the coaching of her former trainer Ma
Junren, competed bravely in the 10,000m and 5,000m in Atlanta. The
23-year-old slim girl was the only distance runner, men and female
in the world, to challeng the humid and hot weather of Atlanta in
the above events, winning the silver medal in the 25-lap final and
the gold in the next.
</P>
<P>
It is the only athletics gold medal for China in the Games, and
Wang was hailed as a national heroine after the victory.
</P>
<P>
"She had to get involved in many celebrations and fatigued
social activitities, that costed her a lot of time and energy,"
Mao revealed.
</P>
<P>
It was said that Wang was given about 50,000 U.S. dollars as
prize money from the country and a few Hong Kong businessmen.
</P>
<P>
Wang had to spend some time to get back her bonus - a Mercedes
Benz won at the world championships in Stuttgart in 1993.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that though the car belongs to Wang, yet it is
still seized by Ma Junren. Wang broke away from Ma with a field of
world class female runners in 1994 due to some bitter dispute.
</P>
<P>
"Every time she runs, headaches and leg injury make it
difficult for her to bear up. She needs a good rest. She may drop
out of the National Games this September in Shanghai, but she will
try her best to continue her career," Mao said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Dong, former world 1,500m champion in 1993, has joined
Mao's group after a long lay-off. Liu left Ma as soon as she won
the world title, and failed to make a comeback in the Olympic year.
</P>
<P>
According to Mao, Wang is maintaining a convalescent training
program in Shenyang. "She plans to come to Nanning in the end of
this month. We will have our winter training in this warm city
instead of going to Kunming's plateau camp," the coach said.
</P>
<P>
It is hard to say if Wang takes part in this year's world
championships or not. Wang once expressed that she would like to
study in a university, but most people encourage her to run
ahead.

WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded today
outside a Planned Parenthood clinic in central Washington,
D.C. early this morning less than a kilometer from the White House.
</P>
<P>
There were 10-15 patients and staff inside the abortion clinic
when the bomb went off at 7.45 a.m. EST (1245 GMT), but there were
no reports of damage or injuries.

<P>
Police said the device was left outside the clinic by a man who
fled the scene after the explosion, the latest in a series of
attacks in the past week on abortion clinics in Tulsa, Oklahoma and
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
The explosion happened on the 24th anniversary of a Supreme
Court ruling that legalized abortion nationwide. Anti-abortion
groups have been fighting the 1973 Supreme Court ruling and
demonstrators were gathering in Washington today for the annual march
protesting the 1973 decision.

MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Latvia's Finance Minister
Vassilija Melnik today resigned over conflict-of-interest
allegations that had also prompted Prime Minister Andris Skele to
offer his resignation Monday, Interfax news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Melnik was nominated as finance minister by Skele, but was
attacked by parliament members and President Guntis Ulmanis for
accepting posts on the boards of the Latvian port authority and
several companies.
</P>
<P>
Parliament approved Melnik's appointment anyway last week. But
Skele, originally a businessman with no party affiliation, said he
took the allegations as an insult to his dignity and offered to
resign on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The parliament and President Ulmanis are now negotiating over
who should be nominated as new prime minister. Interfax said that
Skele, appointed prime minister in December 1995, could be asked
to stay on.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
urged Congress on Tuesday to enact campaign-finance reform
legislation to bar foreign donations as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Delay will mean the death of reform one more time," Clinton
said in an address before a meeting of the Democratic National
Committee (DNC).
</P>
<P>
"So I ask members of Congress in both parties to act now while
the public is watching, while the momentum is building," he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the DNC announced that the party would no longer
accept contributions from foreigners or the American subsidiaries
of foreign companies, and put a 100,000 U.S. dollar cap on all
future "soft-money" donations.
</P>
<P>
In his first post-inaugural address to the DNC, Clinton called
on Republicans to join Democrats in refusing so-called
"soft-money" -- unregulated contributions to parties that can
be used for a range of party-building activities.
</P>
<P>
"If you will do it, we will do it," he said. "We have offered
our hand time and again. Why not just say yes?"
</P>
<P>
Clinton expressed his support for a long-stalled
campaign-finance bill sponsored by Arizona Republican Senator John
McCain Wisconsin Democrat Senator Russell Feingold.

CANBERRA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Australian soccer body
defused an embarrasing strike by national team players during the
ongoing Four Nations tournament staged in the country, local media

Newspapers reported that players had threatened to strike for

But the threat was withdrawn after talks between Soccer

"The players are absolutely steadfast," ASPA president Kimon
Taliadoros told Melbourne newspaper, The Age.

Players, who currently only get a match fee and daily
allowance, are reportedly demanding a 75 percent share of prize
money for international matches.
</P>
<P>
A Soccer Australia spokesman only said the two parties now had
an understanding that the Saturday game would be played as usual

<HEADLINE> South African Chief Resigns after Damning Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South African Football
Association executive president Solomon Morewa resigned on
Wednesday after a damning report described him as unfit to run
soccer in the country, according to a report here.
</P>
<P>
Morewa, 54, announced his resignation eight days after the
release of a judical commission into the running of South African
soccer, which recommended he stepped down.
</P>
<P>
Morewa was heavily criticised in the 102-page report by
Justice Benjamin Poickard, who was mandated in May by sports
minister Steve Tshwete to investigate possible corruption in
South African soccer.
</P>
<P>
The investigation found Morewa had received a loan of
500,000 rand ($107,000) from a marketing company granted the
rights to organise international matches for the South African
national team and a Mercedes Benz car from a tournament sponsor.
</P>
<P>
He was also found to have awarded himself a study bursary
from a football association fund specifically designed to
finance players' education and bonus payments following South
Africa's win in last year's African Nations Cup.
</P>
<P>
The commission said: "He has proven himself to be over
concerned with promoting his own interests instead of those of
his association and should resign."
</P>
<P>
Morewa told radio interviewers he had not discussed the
matter with FIFA at its annual award ceremony in Lisbon on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
But a FIFA press release from Zurich said he had a meeting on
the issue with FIFA president Joao Havelange and secretary-general
Sepp Blatter.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Three officials of Nepal's
Home Ministry are facing corruption charges after they permitted a
foreign couple to adopt two orphans, the official news agency RSS

Home Ministry on charges of committing corruption due to their
involvement in the double adoption case, the RSS reported.

<P>
The Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA)
accused the three of allowing a Spanish couple, who had adopted a
boy from an orphanage in the eastern district of Morang two years
ago, to adopt a second child from the same orphanage last year.
</P>
<P>
The CIAA also asked the Home Ministry to take administrative
action against the Chief District Officer of the eastern district

welcomes more Japanese businesspeople to come to invest.
</P>
<P>
"As the nation's capital, Beijing is not allowed to have too
many labor-intensive enterprises, and has to focus on developing
high and new-technology industry," he said, adding that he hopes
to see more Japanese funds here in the future and that the city
wants to strengthen hi-tech cooperation with Japan.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Enterprises Expected To Comply With ISO Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China issued its first ISO
14000 certificates to four companies today, demonstrating that it
has made a great step forward in increasing use of the standards
of the International Standards Organization.
</P>
<P>
The aim of the ISO 14000 is to curb pollution and waste, an
official with the State Bureau of Environmental Protection
explained.
</P>
<P>
China is a developing country with many poorly-equipped
factories, the official noted, and although it closed over 57,000
factories last year because they were causing serious pollution,
those remaining are one of the main sources of pollution and they
waste a lot of energy.
</P>
<P>
The standards will make China's environmental protection work
more scientific and effective, he pointed out, and it is one of
China's important moves in preventing pollution.
</P>
<P>
"China will take action, but carefully, to expand the use of
the ISO 14000 standards with regard to the country's situation,"
said Xie Zhenhua, director of the bureau, and called on
enterprises to abide by environmental protection laws and
regulations and to comply with the government standards.
</P>
<P>
"The first four certified enterprises are all modern," he
commented, and that certification work will be extended to more
factories, including backward ones, and 22 are awaiting
certification now.
</P>
<P>
The companies recognized today were the ABB Xiamen Switchgear
Co. Ltd, the Shanghai Gao Qiao-BASF Dispersion Co. Ltd, the Haier
Group's Haier Refrigerator System, and the Beijing Matsushita
Color CRT Co. Ltd.

<HEADLINE> OAU Mechanism Discusses Situation in Great Lakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The central organ of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) Mechanism for Conflict
Prevention, Management and Resolution held its 28th ordinary
session last Monday to discuss the situation in the Great Lakes
Region.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued today said that the central organ
expressed its deep concern about the continued fighting in
eastern Zaire.
</P>
<P>
The meeting reaffirmed the fundamental principles of the

inherited from colonization, as stated in the charter of the OAU
and the resolution adopted in Cairo of Egypt, in July 1964.
</P>
<P>
It also reaffirmed the principle of absolute respect of rights
to nationality and citizenship of all the peoples established
within internationally recognized borders, in conformity with the
African charter on human and peoples' rights and other relevant
international legal instruments.

<P>
The cenhral organ underscored the urgent need for the OAU to

<P>
Within that context, the meeting stressed its support for the
sanctions adopted by the countries of the region against Burundi

NANJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Vanuatu's Prime Minister

</P>

In the morning, Vohor visited the Nanjing Panda Electronics

<HEADLINE> UK Tories Win Critical Vote in Commons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister John Major's Tory
government narrowly survived a Commons vote over health policy on
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
Both sides reportedly brought MPs in from their sick beds for
the vote at the end of an Opposition debate on the health service.
</P>
<P>
One Conservative MP complained furiously at having to
leave his hospital bed for a l50-mile round trip to
Westminster 24 hours after surgery.
</P>
<P>
But the defeat of a Labor motion attacking the Tories' record
on the National Health Service, by 319 votes to 312, reinforced
the growing view that Prime Minister John Major may be forced to
call an early general election rather than wait until May, the
last possible date for an election.
</P>
<P>
A senior party source said: "It was a very comfortable
majority in line with most of the majorities we have
secured in recent months.
</P>
<P>
"It shows once again that Labor cannot bring all their
people in, as we won the vote without any help from the
opposition parties," the source added.
</P>
<P>
However, while Major has reiterated his determination to hold
out until his favored election date of May l, senior Tories
acknowledge Commons arithmetic is making this more difficult by
the day.

<P>
ALMA ATA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kyrgyzstan's gross domestic
product (GDP) rose 5.6 percent to 22.47 billion som (about 1.32
billion U.S. dollars) in 1996, the first increase in the five
years since independence in late 1991, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Figures from the State Statistics Commission showed industrial
output rose 4.6 percent to 9.93 billion som (about 584 million
dollars) in 1996 over 1995, while agricultural production jumped
13 percent.
</P>
<P>
Grain output soared 45 percent, making 1996 the first year
Kyrgyzstan stopped importing grain.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that 77,000 people were registered as
unemployed in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Radical economic reforms in this former Soviet Republic of 4.6
million people are believed to have caused severe economic and
social problems as the transition to a market economy got underway
in 1992.
</P>
<P>
The economy slid into recession as GDP fell steeply, inflation
rocketed, foreign debt rose and living standards fell sharply.
</P>
<P>
But by 1995, as reforms started to slow down, the country's
economic situation started to improve slowly.

<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of egrets have
returned to Huwei Mountain in the urban area of Xiamen, an island
city and the original home of egrets for many years in east
China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
To the delight of environmental protection experts, they are
the same egrets lost half a month ago from Dayu Island, a nature
reserve in the sea about 1,000 meters away from Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
Catching a sight of thousands of egrets on the mountain, a
local resident reported the news to the city's environment
protection bureau.
</P>
<P>
A group of bird experts and post graduate students from
biological department of Xiamen Uninversity carried out an
investigation in the mountain area.
</P>
<P>
When the team went to the deep forest area, thousands of
grey-white colored, long and sharp mouthed, sea gull like egrets
scattered, singing and dancing.
</P>
<P>
The mountain, covered with silks trees and pines, will be a
nature park according to the city's development plan. And nearby
Yuandang Lake has fish and shrimps which could serve as food for
the egrets.
</P>
<P>
Xiamen was famous for its tens of thousands of egrets living in
the island, and had been called egret island in the past.
</P>
<P>
However, with the economic development of the city, the
ecological environment had deteriorated and many egrets moved to
the Dayu Island. The city established the Dayu Island nature
reserve to protect the egrets there.
</P>
<P>
With the improvement of the environment, bird experts said,
egrets returned to the island to spend their winter. If the birds
feel the environment suitable for them, they will settle on the
mountain.

<HEADLINE> HK Hotel Owners Optimistic About Prospects After Handover </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Hotel owners here are
optimistic about the future of Hong Kong after its handover later
this year, the chairman of the Federation of Hong Kong Hotel
Owners said here today.
</P>
<P>
"With the handover this year and the start of operation of the
New Airport next year, Hong Kong's status as an international
tourist city will for sure be strengthened," Lui Che Woo said at a
press conference before the start of the federation's annual
general meeting here.
</P>
<P>
And more international meetings are expected to be held here
and Hong Kong's hotel industry is to face an even bigger challenge
as more tourists will come, he said.
</P>
<P>
"At the turn of the century, Hong Kong's position will become
even more strategic with Asia's growing importance in the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
"In order to ensure our competitiveness in the world as well as
in the Asian market, we must strike a balance in the local hotel
operation and make sure that we do not price ourselves out of the
market," he warned.
</P>
<P>
More hotels should be built to cater to budget visitors, but an
over supply of new hotel rooms can also be detrimental to the
local hotel industry and the overall economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"A right balance should therefore be achieved," he added.
</P>
<P>
Lui encouraged the government to work together with the
industry to ensure that a positive image and appeal is projected
to tourists worldwide, in particular, after the handover in July.
</P>
<P>
The federation supports the Hong Kong Tourist Association's
initiatives to build theme parks and tourist attractions to
encourage a longer stay of tourists in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The organization hopes that a department or bureau of tourism
will be set up to ensure this second largest foreign exchange
earner is adequately taken care of, he added.
</P>
<P>
More than 16,000 hotel rooms are to be built by the year 2000
and with the current figure of 33,491, they could help ease the
shortage of rooms in the hotel industry, federation officials
said.
</P>
<P>
The federation plans to conduct a study on the development of
Hong Kong's tourism and hotel industries as well as ways to ensure
that room supply keeps up with demand.
</P>
<P>
Federation officials also hoped to meet Tung Chee-hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, before
the handover to brief him on the problems facing the future of the
industry and work out a coherent tourism policy.

<HEADLINE> Walkie-Talkie Becomes Communication Tools for Herdsmen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HUHHOT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Across the vast grasslands of
Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, mobile phones are no longer used
just by public security men.
</P>
<P>
The cellular age has become a communication instrument for
herdsmen to report to local police when their cattle are stolen.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992, a number of towns in the Xilin Gol League and
Ulanqab League collected over one million yuan (120,000
U.S. dollars) to build nearly 100 radio communication stations
covering the vast pastoral areas.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,000 herdsman households have now bought mobile
phones.
</P>
<P>
As the network is connected to the public security departments,
herdsmen can report thefts to the local police, and report their
safe and sound conditions regularly to the town stations by using
their phones.
</P>
<P>
In the past four years Siziwang Banner (Ulan Hua Town)
resolved 136 criminal cases, with 87 offenders arrested and 310
stolen cattle returned, thanks to the communication network by
which the public security departments promptly got details of
offenders appearances and other characteristics.
</P>
<P>
A herdsman lost six horses and asked for help from the township
public security department with his walkie-talkie, and his horses
were quickly found in an area 70 kilometers away.

<HEADLINE> Four More Foreign Banks in China Doing RMB Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Four foreign-funded banks in
Shanghai have been given permission to deal in yuan after they
move to the Pudong New Development Area, the People's Bank of
China Shanghai branch announced today.
</P>
<P>
The four are the Shanghai branch of Japan's Daiichi Kangyo Bank
and Sanwa Bank Ltd., Britain's Standard Chartered, and the
Shanghai-Paris International Bank, the first joint venture bank in
Shanghai, set up in 1992 by the Industrial and Commercial Bank of
China and France's Banque Nationale de Paris.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Shanghai gave permission to deal in RMB (yuan) to
four foreign banks. The eight are required to relocate in the
Pudong area before they can start dealing in RMB. The business
includes savings, loans, loan guarantees, and investment in state
treasury bonds.
</P>
<P>
They are also allowed to open sub-branches in the Puxi area, or
in downtown Shanghai for foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China Shanghai branch said that it is now
working hard to come up with policies and regulations to guide the
RMB business of foreign banks.

<P>
FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province will
make an effort this year to draw more Taiwanese investors and
increase trade with Taiwan, according to a provincial government
official.

enterprises had been approved, with investment of more than 2.15
billion US dollars, and that about half of the top 100 Taiwanese
enterprises have made inspection tours of Fujian, with 24 having
invested in over 30 projects in the province.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Yemen to Launch Giant Gas project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANAA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister
Mohammed Saeed al-attar has said a giant gas project to be
launched in mid 1997 would greatly boost Yemen's economic
development.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Yemeni newspaper Al-Thawra which was
published today, al-attar, who is also Oil Minister, said the
4.5-billion-dollar project includes extending a 320-kilometer
pipeline from Maareb in the north to Belhaf on the coast of
Arabian Sea; setting up a gas factory at a cost of more than 300
million U.S. dollars and constructing an exportation terminal in
Belhalf.
</P>
<P>
After completion, the project will provide enough energy to
operate two thermal power plants in Maareb and Belhalf with a
power ranging from 180 to 200 megawatts, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not name companies which had signed contracts
to launch the project, neither mentioned sources of the huge
investment. But he said exportation of the gas produced by the
project will start in the year 2001 at a rate of 5 million tons a
year. And Yemen has so far received orders from Turkey, Japan and
Korea to purchase its gas .
</P>
<P>
Yemen has recently signed agreements with British, Indonesian
and U.S. firms for searching and prospecting for oil in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable studies, Yemen's gas reserve ranges
between 13 and 15 trillion cubic feet. Yemen is thinking of
exporting liquefied gas to neighboring countries, such
as Somalia, Sudan and Djibouti after meeting domestic needs.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, Yemen will be able to obtain 500 million
U.S. dollars a year in oil revenues for 25 years.

</P>
<P>
State Minister of Population Haryono Suyono said that to

<HEADLINE> Ramos Approves Full Deregulation of Oil Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
signed here today an executive order approving the full
deregulation of the country's oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The measure, effective from February 8, will relieve the
government of the burden of determining the prices of gasoline and
other petroleum products, which will now be set by oil companies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his regular press conference in the Presidential
Palace, Ramos said the measure is aimed at fostering "a truly
competitive market which can better achieve the social policy
objectives of fair prices and adequate, continuous supply of
environmentally-clean and high quality petroleum products."
</P>
<P>
He cited the stable prices of crude oil and petroleum products
in the world market as well as the stable exchange rate between
peso and U.S. dollar as the reasons for his approval of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
The price of crude oil had been stable at 21-23 U.S. dollars
per barrel since last October while the prices of petroleum
products in the world market had been stable since mid-December
last year.
</P>
<P>
The exchange rate of the peso against U.S. dollar has also been
stable for the past 12 months, averaging around 26.2 pesos to one
U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the deregulation of the oil industry, based on
studies made by the Department of Energy, would keep oil prices in
the country at "very manageable levels" because of the entry of
other players in the downstream industry.
</P>
<P>
Energy Secretary Francisco Viray also shared the same view. He
said that oil prices will be "at a stable level and fuel oil price
change will be minimal."
</P>
<P>
He added that the deregulation does not mean the government
will give up total control of the industry.
</P>
<P>
It still has to intervene in matters affecting fair trade
practices, security of domestic oil supply, public health and
safety and environmental protection, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia and Germany today
agreed to expand bilateral ties by increasing cultural and
educational exchange programs, as well as enhancing trade and
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We must now think of an expanded relationship that is not
confined to trade but also includes education and science and
technology cooperation," Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi told a news conference after talks with visiting German
Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel here.
</P>
<P>
Germany proposed that the two countries sign a cultural
agreement to boost bilateral ties, which Abdullah termed as
"good".
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, who arrived here earlier today for a two-day visit, is
the first German foreign minister to visit Malaysia in 16 years.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Kinkel assured him that Bonn was willing to
participate with Malaysia in programs that would enable it to
transfer its technology.
</P>
<P>
He said they also discussed regional and international issues
such as ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said Kinkel responded positively to a proposal that
Malaysia and Germany form a partnership to help in the
reconstruction of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
On Bonn's bid to secure a permanent seat on the U.N. Security
Council, he said Germany was "well qualified" for the job.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said he also informed Kinkel that Malaysia was not
ready to discuss the reform of the U.N. on a "piecemeal basis but
in a package formula" which covers all issues and areas of the
world body.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also met with Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad
and Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters after his meeting with Anwar, Kinkel said
his meetings with the Malaysian leaders were "satisfactory."
</P>
<P>
Describing Malaysia as a "booming tiger", Kinkel praised
Malaysia's economic achievements and offered German assistance in
high-tech fields.
</P>
<P>
Germany is the fifth largest trading partner of Malaysia.
According to official statistics, two-way trade in the first six
months of 1996 amounted to 7.05 billion ringgit (about 2.82
billion U.S. dollars) against 6.77 billion ringgit (about 2.71
billion U.S. dollars) in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Germany registered a surplus of 1.15 billion ringgit (about 460
million U.S. dollars) in the first half of last year compared with
1.23 billion ringgit (about 490 million U.S. dollars) in the
previous corresponding period.
</P>
<P>
Since 1980, German companies have invested about 1.6 billion
ringgit (about 640 million U.S. dollars) in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
There are currently more than 200 German companies in Malaysia
and about 90 percent of them have production facilities in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Hopeful of Ceasefire Between Government, Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Despite sporadic clashes between
the Philippine government troops and the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF), Philippine President Ramos is still optimistic about
a ceasefire prior to the holding of formal peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said at his weekly news conference this afternoon that
the government peace negotiators will follow the general peace
process formula similar to the one adopted by the government when
it concluded a successful peace talks with the Moro National
Liberation Front (MNLF).
</P>
<P>
"We are at the stage vis-a-vis the MILF right now the same as
where we were in October 1992 and we are not yet really into
formal talks but the work is being done at the committee level,
below the level of the negotiators so that they can provide the
proper environment for a final agreement," the president said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that when the peace process between the government
and the MNLF started in 1992, the first step was to achieve a
local ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"We did that during the MNLF process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said that by local ceasefire, in the case of the MILF, it
refers to such areas as Malmar, Cabulnan and perhaps Basilan. A
general ceasefire must be reached first, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Most of the MILF forces are operating in Central Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
"I hope it will be done through the efforts of our panel and
the MILF panel with the support of a lot of people, including our
peace constituency in Mindanao which has already expanded," the
president said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano
Prodi is to visit the Middle East at the invitation of Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat who is currently visiting Italy, a government
statement said today.
</P>
<P>
No dates were given for the trip.
</P>
<P>
This was Arafat's first meeting with a European leader since
the Palestinians signed an accord with Israel on January 17 on the
redeployment of Israeli troops in the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
During a half-hour meeting at the prime minister's office, the
two leaders discussed the ongoing Middle East peace process. Prodi
asked about the next step in the process now the Hebron agreement
has been signed.
</P>
<P>
The Hebron accord was signed after months of negotiation. Under
the deal, 80 percent of the town will revert to Palestinian
control, ending 30 years of Israeli rule.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed the importance of a rapid and punctual
implementation of the Hebron agreement and expressed his
appreciation for the role Italy and the European Union played in
helping reach an accord.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said that the two leaders agreed that the
peace process should be accompanied by economic development
initiatives.
</P>
<P>
This is Arafat's second meeting with Prodi in two months. The
Palestinian leader came to Rome for a meeting of the Socialist
International Council in December 1996 and visited political
leaders.

<HEADLINE> Ramos Urges Quick Passage of Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
today called on the bicameral Congress to pass the 1997 budget
soon in order not to jeopardize major infrastructure projects,
particularly those with foreign assistance.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting of the Legislative-Executive Development
Advisory Council, Ramos urged the House of Representatives and the
Senate to continue their dialogue on the budget.
</P>
<P>
He said the 30 billion pesos (1.2 billion US dollars) proposed
infrastructure projects for 1997, including the vital Ninoy Aquino
Highway, will be adversely affected by the delay in the passage of
the new budget.
</P>
<P>
The House of Representatives and the Senate have been
deadlocked over the passage of the budget for nearly three months
because of wide differences on the cuts in the Countrywide
Development Funds.
</P>
<P>
The house has refused to accept any cuts in the Countrywide
Development Funds, or the so-called "pork barrels", as proposed by
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The development funds are vital for the representatives since
their popularity usually depends on budget allocations for
infrastructure funds for their districts.
</P>
<P>
But the senators rely more on campaign donations than the pork
barrels to ensure their re-election in the 1998 general elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Omron Corporation, a Japanese
manufacturer of factory automation systems and control, opened a
regional head office in Hong Kong on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The head office is responsible for the corporation's business
in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The office, also named Omron (China) Group Co., Ltd., will
provide overall managerial support to 12 Omron group companies
now operating in the region, including nine in the Chinese
mainland, two in Hong Kong and one in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
According to Hideo Akaike, director of the Strategy Planning
Department of the corporation, up to now Omron has pursued its
overall management in the Chinese mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan
from Japan.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, Omron decided to establish this office after
reflecting on the mounting necessity to establish a management
center in the region due to the increasing growth and development
of complementary links of business and trade between the Chinese
mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He said that Omron also aims to strengthen and expand its
business in the region by making more efficient the management
function of Omron (China) Co. Ltd., the Beijing-based Chinese
central office, Omron Electronics Asia LTD. in Hong Kong, as well
as Omron Taiwan Electronic Inc. in Taibei.
</P>
<P>
Omron expects total sales in the region in the fiscal year 1996
 to be around 27 billion Japanese yen (228.81 million
U.S. dollars), rising to 40 billion yen (338.98 million dollars)
in fiscal year 1997 and growing to 50 billion yen (423.73 million
dollars) by the year 2001.

<HEADLINE> Six HK Stocks Predicted to Be Top Performers in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Six Hong Kong-based companies
are picked up as the top global stocks for 1997, according to a
report released today by Salomon Brothers, one of the leading U.S.
investment banks.
</P>
<P>
In the 305-page report, titled "The Best the World Has to
Offer: Our Top Global Stock Picks for 1997," analysts of Salomon
Brothers selected 119 stocks worldwide which they believe will
perform well in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The six listings in Hong Kong are Guangnan Holdings Ltd., Dah
Sing Financial Holdings, Sing Tao Holdings, Hysan Development,
COSCO Pacific and Swire Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Both Guangnan and COSCO are Chinese-funded companies registered
and listed in Hong Kong. Guangnan, an authorized agent to import
live and fresh foodstuffs from the mainland into Hong Kong, is
predicted to experience steady growth in 1997 as high consumer
spending drives food stocks, says the report.
</P>
<P>
COSCO Pacific, primarily a container leasing and terminal
operator, is believed to take advantage of the wide use of
containers in cargo transport in China.
</P>
<P>
Dah Sing Financial Holdings is a strong recommendation among
Hong Kong banks that the report predicts a promising outlook for
1997.
</P>
<P>
Sing Tao Holdings, the publisher of a Chinese daily and an
English-language paper, is likely to benefit from fast-growing
property advertisements.
</P>
<P>
Hysan Development is a property investment company which is
expected to reap opportunities in the recovering office building
market.
</P>
<P>
Swire Pacific fits broadly into six operating divisions --
property, aviation, industry, trading, shipping and insurance.
</P>
<P>
Stephen L. Weiss, Salomon Brothers' global and U.S. equity
research product manager, expected the report to provide an
overall strategy for global institutional investors.

<HEADLINE> Seoul to Press Japan to Set Up Body on "Comfort Women" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korean legislators and
civic leaders will go to Japan next week to press the Japanese
parliament to set up an investigative committee on "comfort women"
who were forced to serve at the Japanese army brothels during
World War II.
</P>
<P>
Chongdaehyop, a council for the comfort women, and other social
organizations will visit Japan between February 3 and 7 along with
lawmakers for a series of meetings with their Japanese
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Delegation members said here today that they will press
Japanese lawmakers to form an investigative panel within their
parliament to find out the facts behind the operation involving
such women and to press Tokyo to officially apologize and
compensate the victims.
</P>
<P>
They will also lodge a protest against Japan's Asian Peace Fund
of Women, which has secretly delivered monetary compensation to
South Korean victims in defiance of Seoul's opposition.
</P>
<P>
Historians say that as many as 200,000 women, mostly Koreans,
were recruited as "comfort women" -- a euphemism for sex slaves --
for the Japanese imperial army at it invaded East and Southeast
Asia in the 1930s and the 1940s.
</P>
<P>
Japan ruled the Korean Peninsula as a colony from 1910 until
its World War II defeat in 1945.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese private organization, Asian Peace Fund for Women,
recently relayed 2 million Japanese yen (about 15,009
U.S. dollars) to each of five former South Korean "comfort women"
with a letter of apology from Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Railways Responsible for Train-Van Collision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The train-van collision which
happened Tuesday near Gujar Khan, Rawalpindi, was due to gross
neglect and mismanagement by the railway authorities, a religious
party charged today.
</P>
<P>
In a press release, Hafiz Muhammad Idrees, Punjab chief of the
Jammat-e-Islami said the railway authorities should be responsible
for Tuesday's tragedy.
</P>
<P>
A passenger train rammed into a school van at a railroad
crossing near Gujar Khan Tuesday morning, killing nine people
including six children and injuring seven others as it tore the
van apart.
</P>
<P>
Idrees said it was amazing that the railway authorities had
never thought of installing gates on unmanned crossings and
posting guards there.
</P>
<P>
Idrees quoted newspaper reports as saying there are around
3,700 unmanned crossings on different rail tracks all over the
country, causing huge life losses, but the railway authorities
paid no heed to this.
</P>
<P>
Idrees called upon the authorities concerned to take
appropriate steps to check the recurrence of such bloody incidents
in the future on a priority basis.

<P>
PARIS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- At the Zairean town of Tingui-Tingui, 150 kilometers east of
Kisangani, about 100,000 Rwandan refugees have finally emerged
from the jungle after months of wandering. The refugees,
originally from the Mugunga refugee camp in eastern Zaire, have
trekked 700 kilometers and survived by eating plants during the
past two months.
</P>
<P>
-- The Algerian capital Algiers was hit by two car bomb attacks
on Tuesday, in which at least 17 people were killed and 50
wounded. The attacks took place after 42 people were killed and 35
wounded in an explosion at the populous neighborhood of Belcourt
in Algiers Sunday evening. The militant group, Armed Islamic
Group, has threatened to "continue and intensify" the massacre of
civilians.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- By signing on Tuesday the German-Czech reconciliation
declaration, Helmut Kohl and Vaclav Klaus have settled the last
problem between Germany and Eastern European countries. But the
text also indirectly ratified the expulsion of more than 3 million
ethnic German minority population -- one third of the population
of Czechoslovakia in 1945 -- by Prague 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
-- Among the 10,000 youths who win doctoral degrees each year
in France, 2,000 of them have to stay on in the laboratories of
their colleges for one or two years as post-doctoral fellows,
because of lack of job opportunities outside. More and more of
them are going abroad to seek jobs.

<HEADLINE> One in 10 Chinese Urban Families Have Personal Computer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese families have placed
personal computers on their list of household essentials.
</P>
<P>
Computers come after color TVs, refrigerators and washing
machines as a necessary appliance for urban homes.
</P>
<P>
Yang Tianxing, director at the Computer Department of the
Ministry of the Electronic Industry, said that one-in-ten of the
country's urban Chinese families now have personal computers.
</P>
<P>
Last year up to 40 percent of the computers sold on the Chinese
market were bought by Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
Yang said that the development of computers and wide use of
multimedia technologies have quickened the pace of making
computers popular among ordinary Chinese families.
</P>
<P>
Most individual PC owners in China are intellectuals and
computer technicians because computers are a hi-tech product, Yang
noted.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China's potential PC market capacity is as
huge as the annual market for color TV sets, currently 20 million
units year.
</P>
<P>
Ministry's statistics show that the country's PC sales hit 1.8
million units last year, up 56 percent over the previous
year. Total computer sales reached 80 billion yuan in 1996, a
30 percent increase over 1995.
</P>
<P>
The country's PC sales are expected to hit between 2.4 and 2.7
million units in 1997, with the total sales value topping 40
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that Chinese-made personal computers are cheaper
and more convenient in post-sale services than the imported
models, while their functions and quality are the same.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Chinese products have claimed an increasing large
market share. In 1995, Chinese-made PCs gained a market share of
15 percent, while in 1996, PCs with such famed brands as Legend,
Great Wall, Tongchuang and Langchao had 40 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that Pentium-based computers will occupy a
market share of 80 percent in 1997 with the rest by 486 types. In
the meantime, 386-computers will be squeezed out of the market
completely.

<HEADLINE> Adoption of Unitary Rating on Firms Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Chinese bankers have suggested
the government create a unified rating system for domestic
enterprises, to give banks a common standard by which to evaluate
firms which apply for loans.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion was repeatedly raised by participants in last
week's national financial conference and at separate annual
meetings of local branch heads held by the country's major
state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
To date, there has been no such a national criterion for
assessing the reputation of enterprises in China, owing to the
long-established planned economy and differing ideology. This has
resulted in bad credit in many cases and numerous bad loans,
according to the bankers.
</P>
<P>
Some Chinese bankers have to set their own standards for
classifying firms, which is in the long-term interests of both
enterprises and banks, and also the state, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the bankers, the credit-rating for Chinese
enterprises, also including banks, currently depends on some
international organizations which evaluate Chinese firms by mainly
judging their relationship with the government.
</P>
<P>
The ratings for state-owned commercial banks have declined
since 1994, when China started to separate policy-oriented loans
from commercial loans by setting up three policy banks. Meanwhile,
the policy banks such as the Import and Export Bank of China
continue to be rated as AA-, which is equal to the government's
rating.
</P>
<P>
"These ratings cannot reflect the real situation in China's
banking industry, the country's ongoing banking reform and its
efforts to commercialize and internationalize the state-owned
commercial banks," the bankers said.

<P>
MOGADISHU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Acute diarrhoea and cholera
have emerged in Somali capital Mogadishu, leaving more than 10
died in the past two weeks and hundreds ill, said the local
health authorities.
</P>
<P>
Sample tests from a number of cases revealed the presence of
cholera epidemic here, said the authorities.
</P>
<P>
One of the dead was a well known Somali journalist called
Mohamed Ahmed Takow.
</P>
<P>
The SOS hospital, the major child and maternity hospital in
the city, registered nearly 300 cases of acute diarrhoea since
the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Jumale Abdi, a pediatrician at Al-Arafat Medical
Center, said his hospital had admitted 26 patients, mainly women
and children and 15 of them suffered from cholera.
</P>
<P>
Abdi said the number of cases is increasing day after day and
called on the humanitarian agencies to distribute chlorine to
shallow wells owners in the capital.

<HEADLINE> Major Chinese Banks Take to Computerization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Pen-pushing is coming to an end
in major Chinese state-owned commercial banks as the march toward
computers, software and other hi-tech equipment races forward in
an age of electronic gadgets.
</P>
<P>
Four billion yuan was invested in the country's financial
sectors, including the banks, during the Eighth Five-Year Plan
period (1991-1995), according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
Some experts estimated that such investments in the Ninth
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000) could be much higher.
</P>
<P>
China has four large state-owned commercial banks: the
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), the China Construction Bank (CCB) and the
Bank of China (BOC).
</P>
<P>
At a recent national financial conference, and the respective
annual meetings of the banks, electronic automation was placed top
of the agenda and listed as one of the major tasks for future
development.
</P>
<P>
Among the four, ABC and CCB have opened their
electronic clearing systems, while the operation in over 80
percent of ICBC's offices having introduced electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
BOC, the leading international banking player in China, has
been comparatively slow in switching to the electronic age,
according to BOC's president Wang Xuebing.
</P>
<P>
He urged relevant departments to make greater efforts to turn
out more applicable software for the bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ICBC, the largest bank in the country, also plans to
concentrate on developing more applicable software. A software
development center was recently set up at the headquarters of the
bank in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Local experts said that the great efforts made by the banks on
electronics reflects the increasing sense of commerce and
competition among Chinese commercial banks, which will improve their
performance and risk-prevention abilities and increase their
service.
</P>
<P>
This may further speed up structural reforms to meet the needs
of the market economy and strengthen their viability on the
international and domestic markets, they said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the current electronic efforts of the banks
have created a huge market for high-technology products for the
banking industry.
</P>
<P>
A large number of Chinese and foreign research institutions and
manufacturers have been working to enter the market by
participating in various exhibitions and product presentations.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Opposition CUF Recognizes Amour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Mainland Chapter of
the opposition Civic United Front (CUF) has recognized the
victory of Isles President Salmin Amour in the 1995 multi-party
elections -- a dramatic departure from its position on Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here on Tuesday by Pawa Mussa and Michael
Nyaruba, who are the CUF Acting Vice-Chairman and Acting Deputy
Secretary General (Mainland) respectively, said this was one of
the resolutions of the disputed general council meeting held in
Dar es Salaam on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We also declare that the Zanzibar Revolutionary Government led by
Dr. Salmin Amour is legally constituted and we urge CUF members to
stop the politically-motivated malicious confrontation with the
government," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Mainland CUF members called for an end to the boycott of
House of Representatives sessions maintained by the Zanzibar
Members of the party, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"It is absurd that we should give the ruling Revolutionary Party
(CCM) representatives a free hand to pass laws to control the
opposition without the opposition taking part in the process," said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
CUF once claimed that Amour, who won the elections by a slim
margin, rigged the poll results, and has persistently refused to
recognize him and his government.
</P>
<P>
The statement urged Amour to release CUF members arrested by
his government for alleged subversion.
</P>
<P>
"Let us bury the hatchet and open a new chapter of
reconciliation," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Trade Union Strikes Resume in South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Trade union strikes demanding the
nullification of the new labor law resumed at 20 manufacturing
workplaces in South Korea today, but the fervor of the walkouts
was not as high as expected.
</P>
<P>
The day marked the first occasion of the "Wednesday Strikes" as
announced by the Korea Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) last
week.
</P>
<P>
Some 34,000 union members went on strike at 20 manufacturing
sites throughout the country today, including Hyundai Motor
Company's Ulsan plant, the Labor Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
However, the KCTU claimed that about 180,000 workers from 170
trade unions went on strike.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the KCTU asked its members to stop strikes on
January 20 and said that it will stage a general strike every
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The strikes began on December 26 last year when the ruling New
Korea Party railroaded the new labor law through the National
Assembly in the absence of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
Unionists charge that the new labor law is biased in favor of
management, making it easier for employers to make workers
redundant, extend work hours and recruit replacements for striking
workers.
</P>
<P>
Industrial production losses in South Korea since the start of
the labor strikes have been estimated at 3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
President Kim Young-sam met with opposition party leaders Kim
Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil Tuesday and told them that he will
rewrite the controversial labor law and order law enforcement
authorities to suspend executing arrest warrants issued against
trade union leaders who orchestrated the nationwide wildcat
strikes.
</P>
<P>
However, President Kim rejected the opposition leaders' call
for nullifying the new labor law, saying he cannot do something
"unconstitutional."

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Returns to Kremlin Amid Lawmakers' Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
returned to the Kremlin this morning amid lawmakers' doubts about
his health.
</P>
<P>
He was earlier expected to stay closeted in his out-of-town
residence for convalescence after double pneumonia for at least
another week.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin's arrival for a regular meeting in the Kremlin with
Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin came as a surprise to many
people, despite his press secretary's repeated statements that the
president had not cancelled any of his international meetings
scheduled for the end of January and early February.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin underwent a heart bypass surgery on November 5 and was
taken into Moscow's Central Clinical Hospital for double pneumonia
on January 8.
</P>
<P>
After moving from the hospital to a country residence near
Moscow, he had been reportedly working on documents and avoided
meetings with his top officials.
</P>
<P>
Doubts about his ability to regain enough strength to return to
the Kremlin soon were so strong that different sources started to
talk about the "the vacuum of power" in the country.
</P>
<P>
The State Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, even
decided to debate Yeltsin's impeachment on grounds of his ill
health at a meeting today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources close to the parliament, an item of early
termination of President Yeltsin's powers for health reasons was
put on the agenda of the State Duma plenary meeting this morning.
</P>
<P>
Only 160 legislators opposed the item while 206 voted for it
and two abstained.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban militia
hit back today at its rivals on the front north of the capital of
Kabul, a report reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The fighting erupted outside Charikar, capital of Parwan
Province which lies about 64 kilometers north of Kabul, after jets
belonging to the anti-Taliban alliance bombed the Kabul Airport
late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report gave no details about the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic militia have achieved a sudden upsurge in fighting
over the past few days when they launched a lightning attack
against the opposition alliance on the front north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
The front-line, which a few weeks ago was close to Kabul, has
now been pushed back 100 kilometers into the territory under the
control of the alliance led by Ahmad Masood, commander of the
ousted government forces.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Puts Conditions on Aid to DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 22 (Xinhua) -- South Korea has made its economic
assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
conditional upon more exchanges between the two parts of Korea.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Yoo Chong-ha said today Seoul will consider
economic aid if Pyongyang agrees on material and human exchanges
to help build confidence and ease tension on the Korea Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
Seoul "cannot accept Pyongyang's demand for food assistance or
economic aid in exchange only for the North (DPRK) taking part in
the proposed four-party talks," Yoo told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Attending the talks involving South Korea, the DPRK, China and
the United States "will not be a sufficient condition for us" to
provide food or any other economic assistance, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, South Korea provided 150,000 tons of
rice and 3 million U.S. dollars in food aid to help ease the
DPRK's severe food shortage caused by devastating floods.
</P>
<P>
Yoo said Seoul will link any further assistance with the DPRK's
efforts to promote confidence-building and ease the tensions.
</P>
<P>
Seoul, he added, will make its position clear at the joint
briefing on the proposed four-party talks to be attended by South
Korea, the DPRK and the United States in New York on January 29.
</P>
<P>
However, Yoo did not rule out the possibility of the South
Korean National Red Cross providing small-scale humanitarian aid
worth several million dollars to the DPRK through international
relief organizations.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority(PNA) President Yasser Arafat today consulted the Arab
League(AL) on the Palestinian position on the peace process and a
vision for the future after the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who arrived here this morning, briefed AL Secretary

Cairo-based League General Secretariat, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the PNA chief extended his thanks to Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak for his support to the Palestinian stand
and their rights, in their first meeting since the PA took control
of most of the West Bank city of Hebron in a landmark deal with
Israel.

between the PNA and Israel, pushed by tortuous mediations involving
the United states,the European Union, Egypt and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will resume talks on a
number of other issues immediately after the redeployment and
start the final status talks within two months.

<HEADLINE> RUF Rebels Trading Along S. Leone-Liberia Border </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Rebels belonging to the
Revolutionary United Front (RUF) are "still engaged" in cross
border trade in farm produce and diamonds along the Sierra
Leone-Liberia border, government guards said today.
</P>
<P>
One of the guards at the boundary, Sulaiman Sesay reached by
phone said, ''they (rebels) are swapping cacao, coffee and gems
with ULIMO-K fighters (one of the factions in Liberia led by
Alhaji Kroma) for arms.''
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for ULIMO-K in Freetown immediately dismissed the
charge as "silly" but residents in the south and eastern border
towns near Liberia have repeatedly complained to government
"about military movements in the area."
</P>
<P>
Last week, a delegation of farmers and sub chiefs sent an
urgent appeal to Sierra Leone's President Tejan Kabbah that a
military outpost should be established in the border if peace is
to be sustained.
</P>
<P>
Travelers have also reported "intensified movements" in the
area and have called for "strong surveillance."
</P>
<P>
Suspicion of strange dealings along the border for sometime round
but these are not viewed as "a threat to the peace process,"
they say.

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a senior
official of the Communist Party of China (CPC), today called for
more cooperation between the CPC and the ruling Colombian Liberal
Party (CLP).
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with the CLP leaders, including Senate President
Luis Fernando Londono Capurro and House of Representatives
President Glovanny Lamboglia Mazzili, Hu said the two parties'
mutual need for peace and development lay a solid foundation for
bilateral cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The two parties should expand the sphere of communication and
cooperation in more flexible and various ways, said Hu, a member
of the Standing Committee of the CPC Political Bureau and the CPC
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Londono agreed with Hu's remarks, saying that it is more and
more important for Colombia to promote friendship with China,
which is developing at an astonishingly fast pace.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hu's visit to Colombia and the visit by Colombian
President Ernesto Samper to China last year surely would
strengthen the ties between the two parties, two peoples and two
nations.

<HEADLINE> Liberian Faction Pledges Disarmament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Liberia's Lofa Defense Force
(LDF) has announced plans to disarm all its fighters in the
southwest Saturday amid stepped-up efforts to disarm some 60,000
Liberian factional fighters before the January 31 deadline.
</P>
<P>
LDF Chairman Francois Massaquoi said Monday the LDF is ready
to do whatever is necessary to turn in to the West African
peacekeeping force, known as ECOMOG, all weapons in its
possession before the deadline for voluntary disarmament.
</P>
<P>
"We are anxious to disarm," he said when meeting with ECOMOG
Commander Major-General Victor Malu and his deputy
Brigadier-General Joe Kwateng at the ECOMOG headquarters in
Liberia's capital Monrovia, a report reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
Only more than 7,000 fighters have put down their weapons
since the ongoing disarmament operation started on November 22 in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Massaquio said the delay in disarming LDF fighters was due to
some communication difficulties.
</P>
<P>
He said the LDF disarmament in the southwestern Ahmadu town
would be carried out orderly, pledging any LDF fighters who
failed to disarm in accordance with the relevant orders "would
have themselves to blame and should be treated as criminals."
</P>
<P>
In response, Malu said ECOMOG will provide vehicles to
transport LDF fighters to the nearby disarmament sites.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that ECOMOG would not compromise on disarmament
and would be prepared for very efficient military operations
against the fighters who failed to surrender weapons.
</P>
<P>
Malu urged all faction leaders to encourage their fighters to
disarm before the expiration of the January 31 deadline.

<HEADLINE> Pearl River Delta Short of Laborers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Pearl River Delta in
south China, once a favored site for inland laborers, is suffering
from a severe shortage of workers, forcing local firms to cut
production.
</P>
<P>
"For a company, labor is as important as capital, but now it is
difficult to employ skilled workers here," said a Hong Kong
businessman who owns a toy factory in the city of Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
In the early 90's, the area suffered from an influx of farmers
from across the country, who were attracted by the delta's
plentiful job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two years, many of these farmer-turned-workers,
including some with experience and skill, have returned to their
hometowns.
</P>
<P>
Due to the lack of laborers, many local enterprises have moved
to other parts of the country, said an official with the Foreign
Trade Bureau of Dongguan.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, in addition to the nearly 3.3
million migrants who have been working in local firms, there are
still about three million transient rural laborers in this
area. But the number keeps on shrinking.
</P>
<P>
The number of the non-native laborers in Zhongshan has lowered
from 390,000 to 320,000 over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
A local economist attributes the reduced labor force to the
low-level salaries and the poor welfare conditions for the
employees.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the favorable policies offered by inland
provinces which encourage their natives to invest in their home
places have also contributed measurably to the phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Along with the development of China's reform and opening drive,
rural people are able to find job opportunities in many other
parts of the country, according to the economist.

<HEADLINE> Aftershocks Happen in Xinjiang Quake-Hit Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Two aftershocks measuring 4.5
and 4.1 on the Richter scale have jolted Jiashi and Artux areas in
northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, which were hit
by two earthquakes measuring 6.3 and 6.4 on Richter scale at 9:47
and 9:48 Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
China's State Seismological Bureau cited reports from Xinjiang
Seismological Bureau as saying that the aftershocks happened
between Tuesday morning and 8:00 this morning.
</P>
<P>
However, quake experts believe that though a stronger
earthquake is less likely to hit the areas within a short period,
an aftershock measuring over 5 on the Richter scale may still
possibly happen.
</P>
<P>
By 20:50 Tuesday, the two strong quakes had claimed 12 lives,
wounded 40 people, eight of them seriously.
</P>
<P>
The shocks also killed 1,969 cattle, and destroyed 7,300 homes
and eight mosques.
</P>
<P>
Residents in the quake-hit areas currently have trouble in
finding accommodation. Transport and telecommunications are
basically operating normally.
</P>
<P>
Soldiers and armed police have been sent to the quake-hit areas
to help in disaster relief work.
</P>
<P>
The regional government has established a disaster-relief
office to arrange the overall rescue work, and the State
Seismological Bureau and Xinjiang Seismological Bureau have

<HEADLINE> Macao Issues New Stamps of Lunar Year of Ox </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A total of 1.50 million pieces of the stamp, which depicts the
head of a huge buffalo with the face value of 5.5 Patacas (about 0.70
US dollars), will be issued. That will be three times the number of
the Year of Rat stamps issued in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the number is to meet the surging demand from
both Macao and neighboring regions over the past six months.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, officials with the Macao Posts and
Telecommunications Department said that all the 1.5 million pieces
have all been booked even before the stamps go to the stalls.
</P>
<P>
The department said that it will increase the amount of stamps
to be issued this year by 20 percent from last year.
</P>
<P>
A total of 13 sets of stamps will be issued in Macao in 1997.
They include "lucky numbers", "Boat People", "Drunken Dragon
Festival", "Legends and Myths IV-Gods of Protection", "Balconies of
Macao", "Chinese Traditional Fans" and "Fong Soi", among others.

<HEADLINE> Most Conventions Applicable to Macao to Pass Through: Chinese Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A senior Chinese official said
here today that most current world conventions applicable to Macao
will pass through 1999.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xi'an, counselor of the Chinese side on the
Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group (JLG), told reporters after
meeting with his Portuguese counterpart that any current world
conventions and bodies that are conducive to Macao's economic
growth and social stability and suit the status of Macao will enjoy
 the support of the Chinese side in their renewal after 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese side is currently studying the list provided by
the Portuguese side last December on the world bodies or
conventions applicable to Macao," he said. "Most of them will get
renewal after 1999 so long as they will help Macao's economic
development, social stability and suit the status of Macao itself."
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the two sides reached consensus on Macao's
renewal into the International Organization of Consumers' Unions
after 1999 in today's meeting, adding that both sides are
satisfied with the working process in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Jorge Mendes, representative of the Portuguese side, said that
the two sides have exchanged views on the list of 200 world bodies
and conventions applicable to Macao, and both agree to do the best
to quicken the working procedure.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Israel Expects Regional Thaw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Encouraged by the positive
reactions from the Arab world and international community to the
recent Hebron troops pullback, Israel is expecting a regional thaw
in Israeli-Arab ties.
</P>
<P>
Following the Hebron redeployment last week, Israel has been
praised for taking a major step toward pushing forward the peace
process by world leaders and notably the moderate Arab gulf and
north African states.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States is making new efforts to build
on the new momentum of the peace process created by the Hebron
deal. It is calling on Arab countries to be more forthcoming
with Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu, a frequent
target of Arab criticism until recently.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. officials said the Hebron could lead to a regional
thaw that might include a revitalization of the long dormant
multilateral peace talks.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Foreign Press Association Tuesday,
U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk made clear that the Arab
states should realize the importance of the Hebron agreement. He
said Arabs should credit Netanyahu for his courage in clinching
and implementing the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
He added that the U.S. had received signals from Egypt,
Jordan, Morocco and Oman of a willingness to move closer to
Israel.
</P>
<P>
To seize the momentum of Hebron deal, Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy today is expected to brief foreign envoys to
Israel on the Hebron agreement and its smooth implementation.
</P>
<P>
There is speculation here that Netanyahu's foreign policy
adviser Dore Gold will visit a number of Arab countries very
shortly to promote a regional thaw. Top on the agenda will be the
arrangement for Netanyahu's visits to capitals of several major
Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa told Israel Radio last
week that Cairo would welcome Netanyahu for a visit after the
Hebron redeployment.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian Ambassador Omar Rifai said Tuesday night that
Jordan was now open to a visit by Netanyahu, which could take
place following the end of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the
Islamic lunar month, on February 9.
</P>
<P>
Oman Foreign Minister Yusef Ben-Alawi said Tuesday his
country, which has halted normalization with Israel following
Netanyahu's rise to power, was willing to renew its dialogue
with Israel following the Hebron deal.
</P>
<P>
Despite of the positive signs created by the Hebron pullback,
a long way still lies ahead for reaching a just, comprehensive
and lasting Israeli-Arab peace.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Palestinian peace track, the immediate
challenges after Hebron deal will be the more complicated and
sensitive final-status talks, which will tackle the fate of
Palestinian territories, Jerusalem and Palestinian refugees.
</P>
<P>
The central disputes are Israel's opposition to the creation
of an independent Palestinian state with eastern Jerusalem as
capital, which is the long-cherished lofty goal for the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The difficulty of Hebron negotiation bode ill for future
talks which are expected to be marked with more deadlocks and
confrontations. And the renewed deadlocks in future talks could
offset any positive effect of the Hebron deal and push the
region back into tension and confrontation.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli-Syrian track, there is still no sign
indicating that the Hebron deal could help ease the military
tension and restart the long-stalled peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Syria is insisting on Israel's return of whole Golan Heights,
a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Mideast
War. But the request was flatly rejected by Israel. Without a
solution to the Israeli-Syrian dispute, it will be impossible to
realize a genuine regional thaw.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Syrian FMs Exchange Peace Messages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy has exchanged messages with his Syrian counterpart
Farouq Shara on renewing the stalled peace talks, a local
newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
Levy and Shara have exchanged views recently through an
European Union minister who acted as a go-between, Hebrew daily
Haaretz reported.
</P>
<P>
The report did not disclose further details about the content
of the messages, which are believed to focus on finding ways to
break the ice in the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Until now, there is still no sign of a the quick resumption of
the peace talks between Israel and Syria that have been suspended
since early last year. Because of Israel's objection to returning
the whole Golan Heights, Syria has rejected repeated calls for
resuming the talks.
</P>
<P>
The United States is apparently making new efforts to press
for resuming Israeli-Syrian peace track following the recent
Hebron redeployment which has eased tension considerably in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Egypt is also keen to play a role in restarting the
Israeli-Syrian peace talks. Shara paid a visit to Cairo recently
in the wake of Israeli pullback in Hebron in an apparent bid to
explore ways of resuming the peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, an military intelligence report revealed today that
Israel is now viewing Syria as the No. 1 threat to its national
security.
</P>
<P>
An assessment report compiled by Mossad, Israel's secret
military intelligence service, said because the Israeli-Syrian
peace talks are deadlocked, Syria, armed with non-conventional
weapons, is posing a more serious threat than international
terrorism and the dangers of Islamic countries Iran and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The report, published in the front page of the largest Hebrew
daily Yediot Ahronot today, said that the stalemate in the peace
talks would very likely lead to confrontation between Israel and
Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria is demanding Israel's return of the whole Golan
Heights as a prior condition for resuming the peace talks,
which was turned down by Israeli hardline Likud government.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Named as Best Bond Issuer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Europe-based international
finance publication Euromoney has named the Philippines as Asia's
best sovereign bond issuer for its 690-million-U.S.-dollar Brady
bond exchange offer in 1996, the Philippine News Agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the Philippines has recently retired 1.9
billion dollars of its Brady bond, floated during the tenure of
former President Corazon Aquino to generate support for the
country's sagging economy, by exchanging them with new
non-collateralized 20-year bonds.
</P>
<P>
The exchange allowed the Philippines to slash off 84 million
dollars from its 35-billion-dollar foreign debt, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Euromoney also named five Philippine corporate bond issuers as
among the "best or most professional issuers" in Asia.
</P>
<P>
The international publication named Ayala Corporation as the
best issuer in the Philippines; Filinvest, Inc. as the overall
best convertible; PCIBank as the best bank issuer; Philippine Long
Distance Telephone Co. as the best telecommunications firm issuer;
and SM Prime Holdings as the overall best new issuer.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Mubarak Meet in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
held talks with Palestinian National Authority(PNA) leader Yasser
Arafat today in their first meeting since PNA took control of most
of the West Bank city of Hebron in a landmark deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are expected to discuss the latest development
of the Mideast peace process and the implementation of the Hebron
deal.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will acquaint Mubarak of the details of the
just-concluded Hebron agreement and raise other issues in the
transitional phase and about the final status in the upcoming
negotiations with Israel, Palestinian Ambassador to Egypt Zuhdi
al-Qodra told the Egyptian MENA news agency Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat will extend his thanks to Mubarak and the Egyptian
people for their perennial and continuous support and advocacy for
the Palestinian's right, said the ambassador.
</P>
<P>
Arafat arrived here this morning from Rome, where he addressed
a conference of the Socialist International and later had talks
with Prime Minister Romano Prodi and President Oscar Liugi
Scalfaro.
</P>
<P>
In Rome, calling for sustained international support for the
Mideast peace process, Arafat said peace is the strategic option
of the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Egypt has said an independent
Palestinian state should be set up to allow the Palestinians to
practice their legitimate right of self-determination.
</P>
<P>
Israeli partial troop withdrawal from the West Bank city of
Hebron was an important step but the Palestinian state should
eventually be declared, said Foreign Minister Amr Moussa Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt will continue its support to the Palestinians till they
establish their own state," he said in a press statement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a strong advocate of the Palestinian cause and the
first Arab country to make peace with Israel, has played a pivotal
role in the Palestinian-Israel negotiations.
</P>
<P>
It is behind the proposal which ended last-minute differences
between the Palestinians and Israelis after their months of bitter
wrangling over implementing the Israeli troop redeployment from
Hebron, the last of eight West Bank towns to be handed over to the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the two sides will resume talks on a
number of other issues immediately after the redeployment and
start talks on a final peace agreement within two months.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader's visit to Egypt comes within the
framework of the frequent coordination between the two leaders. He
is expected to report to the Cairo-based Arab League on the Hebron
agreement and visit other Arab states after the Cairo stop.

TEHRAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to pay 4 billion
U.S. dollars of foreign debts that get mature in 1997, local press
reported today, citing banking authorities.
</P>
<P>
The foreign debt payment will constitute 24.89 percent of
the total foreign exchange expenditure, which was approved by
Iran's Parliament Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Parliament voted to approve the ceiling of 16.07
billion dollars for foreign exchange expenditure of the Central
Bank of Iran.
</P>
<P>
Mohsen Nourbakhsh, Governor of the Central Bank of Iran,
was quoted by Persian daily Salam as saying that Iran's external
debts total 20 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran is expected to earn a total of 19 billion
dollars of hard currency in 1997, of which 16 billion dollars
will come from oil and gas export, 2.5 to 3 billion dollars from
the exports of non-oil goods.
</P>
<P>
He declared that the foreign exchanged rate would be fixed at
3,000 Iranian rials for one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Since the rescheduling agreements were reached with major
creditors in 1994-95, the repayment of debt has been a top
government priority.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses 360m Dollars to Foreign Shippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria loses 28.8 billion Naira
(about 360 million U.S. Dollars) a year as indigenous carriers
are not involved in the lifting of crude oil, the country's
number one export item, outside its shores.
</P>
<P>
It will also lose about 216 billion Naira (about 2.7 billion
Dollars) in the next 10 years if indigenous shippers are not
participating in lifting liquefied natural gas.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by Alhaji Baba Galadima, director-general
of the National Maritime Authority (NMA), at a meeting with chief
executives of oil companies and related marine service on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the government has incurred such huge losses
because indigenous shippers have been kept outside "the lucrative
business" and that all the money due for payment to the NMA
coffers by foreign shippers who lift oil in and out of the
country has not been remitted.
</P>
<P>
"On the average, about a million barrels of crude oil go out
of Nigerian shores per vessel, with each of these being above
500,000 dollars," he said, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
"No fewer than 60 vessels pass the Nigerian waters monthly.
This is about 360 million Dollars annually. And this is Nigeria's
hard-earned foreign currency. It is not a small amount of money."
</P>
<P>
Nigeria, the biggest oil producers in west Africa and a member
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, is the only
member of the organization that does not involve indigenous
shippers in the lifting of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
NMA was established after a 1987 decree on national shipping
policy. It has the right to allocate cargoes coming in and going
out of Nigerian waters.
</P>
<P>
Indigenous carriers should be given priority in this respect,
the NMA boss said, but lamenting that some oil companies and
other companies rendering support services to the oil companies
have refused to patronize the indigenous carriers in the
freighting of their cargoes to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Some of the major oil companies, mainly Western companies
operating in Nigeria, have been confirmed to object to
patronizing indigenous shipping companies and this attitude is at
variance of the stipulation of the national shipping policy, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the lifting of crude oil and other petroleum
products by indigenous carriers, NMA has begun discussion with
relevant authorities with a view to "involving our national
carriers in this lucrative business," he added.
</P>
<P>
He stated emphatically that NMA has concluded all arrangement
to wage war against the foreign carriers to ensure that
indigenous carriers are involved in the lifting of crude as well
as ensuring that the hard earned foreign currencies do not elude
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Draft Law on Setting up Islamic Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is drafting
legislation for establishing Islamic banks aimed at encouraging
people to deposit their money in compliance with the Islamic
sharia law.
</P>
<P>
Salem Abdelaziz Al-Sabah, governor of the Central Bank of
Kuwa, said Tuesday that the Kuwaiti market needs these kinds of
banks which applies the Islamic sharia in money dealing, adding
that a certain class of investors might move their funds abroad
if such banks do not exist.
</P>
<P>
He said serious steps are already underway to prepare a bill
on establishing Islamic banks.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks operate according to rules laid down in Islamic
sharia law that prohibit the payment of interest and investments
in outlawed activities such as brewing or gambling.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has only one Islamic bank, the Kuwait Finance House, where
Muslims can make deposits against seven conventional banks,
although there are several finance institutes that operate
investment funds according to the Islamic code.
</P>
<P>
Islamic banks have become popular among the world's one
billion Muslims, especially in Arab states including the Gulf and
Asian states such as Malaysia and Indonesia, with more than 185
financial institutions. The Islamic financial institutions'
assets had jumped 21 times in 10 years to around 166 billion
U.S. dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Kuwaiti previous parliament had nearly passed a bill on
regulating Islamic bank operations, but the Central Bank called
for drafting an integrated law that takes into account the views
of experts.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sabah said "a team of technical and legal cadres was
formed at the Central Bank to outline an integrated plan to
prepare the said bill and put it into effect."
</P>
<P>
Adnan Al-Bahar, board Chairman of the International Investor
Company which is run according to the Islamic system, said in an
earlier statement that 1997 would be the year for establishing
Islamic banks.
</P>
<P>
Other Islamic banking institutions operating on the Kuwaiti
market include the International Group, Investment Dar (house)
and International for Murabaha (an Islamic law on resale with
specification of gain). But the Kuwait Finance House remained in
control of the market in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Enterprises in East China Seeking Expansion in New Homes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Enterprises in Suzhou, a booming
scenic industrial city in east China's Jiangsu Province,
are seeking expansion in new homes.
</P>
<P>
Seven major industrial enterprises have already moved to the
city's industrial park, where they will spend 230 million yuan on
the renovation of facilities.
</P>
<P>
The enterprises have switched to the industrial park mainly
because of the high-level investment environment and managerial
expertise there, according to officials of the park's managerial
committee.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the enterprises in the park are
foreign-funded. By the end of 1996 the park had brought in 2.5
billion US dollars in foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
The seven enterprises, involved in synthetic crystals,
pesticides, printing, plastics, petrochemicals and automobile
repair, are the first group of domestic enterprises in the
park. They will focus on a number of hi-tech products with
government support.

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Henan Province, famous for
its fable of the "foolish old man who removed the mountains,"
built a record 2,200 kilometers of highway last year.
</P>
<P>
The roads enabled all of the 2,400 townships in the province to
be linked.
</P>
<P>
The total length of highway opened to traffic in the province
now stretches over 50,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The newly operational highways include 94 kilometers of express
way, 350 kilometers of second-grade highways, and 1,800 kilometers
of county and township roads.
</P>
<P>
Apart from utilizing state funds for major highway projects,
Henan, a center for China's highway network, collected 2.2 billion
yuan (275 million U.S. dollars) from society for local highway
construction in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The collected tolls will be used to pay back investors and
loans, with the rest of the money used for further road building.
</P>
<P>
Counties in northwest and southwest mountain areas made the
most hard efforts in building highways and bridges.

<HEADLINE> Infrastructure Tops Philippines' Industry Sectors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' infrastructure
sector emerged as the most favored investment area in the country
last year with a project cost of 10.2 billion U.S. dollars, the
Board of Investments (BOI) reported today.
</P>
<P>
Documents from the BOI, the government's investment-licensing
agency, showed that infrastructure accounted for 70.31 percent of
the total approved project cost registered last year.
</P>
<P>
It said that nine big tickets for infrastructure projects
pushed the sector to the number one position, dislodging the
manufacturing sector from the top niche in terms of magnitude of
investments.
</P>
<P>
Next to infrastructure, manufacturing was a distant second
accounting for 9.46 percent of the total project cost.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector garnered 211 projects amounting to
1.38 billion dollars intended in construction, electrical and
electronic products, plastic products, and processed food.
</P>
<P>
In the third place was the public utilities sector with 24
projects valued at 1.37 billion dollars, or almost 9.46 percent of
the total.
</P>
<P>
Energy-related projects came next, accounting for 3.62 percent
or 526.6 million dollars of the pledged investment total.
</P>
<P>
Other sectors that attracted investments were tourism-oriented
service, mining, and agriculture, the BOI said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The State Cultural Relics
Bureau urged today that all officials and workers engaged in
relics protection nationwide should carry out their duties
honestly.
</P>
<P>
A new regulation drafted by the bureau states that relics
workers should not take advantage of their position by stealing
and smuggling relics.
</P>
<P>
China issued a regulation in 1981 to monitor relics workers'
morality, but it is outdated and has not always been faithfully
observed.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the bureau said that the adoption of the new
rule will prevent valuable relics from being smuggled, a rampant
occurrence in a country with a 5,000-year-old civilization and
countless unearthed treasures.
</P>
<P>
The regulation stipulates that workers must have a devotion for
relics, and should not pilfer items discovered at excavation sites
and during field investigations.
</P>
<P>
They should keep national secrets, and report relics thievery
in a timely way, according to the new regulation.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The first exclusively
foreign-funded lubricating oil and grease blending plant has gone
into operation in Tianjin, the largest port city in north China.
</P>
<P>
The plant, covering 50,000 sq. m. at the Nanjiang Development
Zone near Tianjin Harbor, was built by the Mobil Petroleum
Co. Ltd. of the United States at a cost of 45 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It will annually produce 45,000 tons of lubricating oil in 23
varieties, and 5,000 tons of lubricating grease in three
varieties. Its products will be sold in north and northeast China.
</P>
<P>
This coastal city has become the fountainhead of many
prestigious transnational petrochemical companies in recent
years. In 1994, Esso, the largest oil company in the United
States, invested 30 million US dollars to build a lubricating oil
blending plant.
</P>
<P>
The Shell 0il Company followed suit, building four
petrochemical works in the southern part of Tianjin.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin will become a rising petrochemical center when all
these foreign-funded projects start operation, said an official of
the Tianjin Harbor Administration.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Medicare Proposal Well Received </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today put forth a Medicare budget plan which immediately won
praise from congressional Republicans.
</P>
<P>
The plan would cut the spending of the Medicare, a health
insurance program for the low-income elderly, by 100 billion
U.S. dollars over five years to help balance the budget by 2002.
</P>
<P>
The savings would transfer into 138 billion dollars over six
years, substantially more than the 124 billion dollars Clinton
proposed during budget talks with Congress, which collapsed last
January.
</P>
<P>
Most of the savings would be achieved by reducing payments to
doctors and hospitals. But a portion of it -- 10 billion dollars
over five years -- would come from recipients, by increasing the
premium they would pay for coverage beginning in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Medicare is expected to run out funds by 2001. Clinton has
promised a plan to keep the program solvent for 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who was sworn in for his second-term presidency
Monday, met his economic advisers at the White House Tuesday to
discuss a new budget plan.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans, who proposed a cut of 168 billion dollars on
Medicare more than one year ago, spoke warmly about Clinton's new
proposal.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that he has unilaterally moved halfway in our
direction is something that is very, very positive for us," said
Bill Archer, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee of House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
He called it a "tremendous move" but said the Republicans would
have to study the details.
</P>
<P>
House Budget Committee chairman John Kasich said it "brightens
the prospects to get a budget agreement."

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urges Businessmen to Reduce Maize Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government has
urged millers and traders to reduce their prices and described
the recent price hikes of maize, Zambians' staple food, as
''unjustified''.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture, Food and Fisheries Minister Edith Nawakwi said
here on Tuesday that the government may release its maize
reserves on the market if maize traders refuse to reduce the
prices of the staple food immediately, according to Zambia's
Daily Mail.
</P>
<P>
She was quoted as saying the increased prices are not
justified and warning that the government will release its maize
stocks, if necessary, to offset the recent hikes, which she said
have been created by a cartel of millers and traders who are
hoarding the commodity in anticipation of a maize shortage this
year.
</P>
<P>
She said her ministry has enough maize stocks to dampen
traders and millers' unjustified prices.
</P>
<P>
In some retail shops in Lusaka, an average of 2,000 Kwacha
(1.5 U.S. Dollars) have been increased on various quantities of
maize with a 25-kilo bag of breakfast meal going at 9,000 to
12,000 Kwacha.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
profitable companies in economically-developed east China have
shown big interest in China's most-populous Sichuan Province, in
line with the central government's new blueprint for economic
development in central and western China.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, located in the southwest, has set up firms with the
help of companies in Guangdong, Jiangsu, Fujian, Zhejiang and
Shandong provinces in the form of joint ventures, cooperatives,
mergers, leasing, contracts and share-holding.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, China's largest industrial center, and Sichuan are
jointly building an industrial park at the projected dam area of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the projects being built in Sichuan are large
and use advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
The Changzhou Diesel Engine Group of Jiangsu Province and its
partner in Sichuan raised 21 million yuan to build a diesel engine
plant with an annual production capacity of 100,000 sets. Its
output will be tripled in three years.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is rich in energy and cheap labor resources, and
remains under-developed economically, while coastal areas in east
China have adequate operating funds, educated personnel and
up-to-date technology but lack raw materials. Inter-regional
cooperation will help the two sides compensate for each other's
deficiencies.
</P>
<P>
The White Cat Group, a noted detergent manufacturer in
Shanghai, purchased a cosmetics plant in Sichuan. The move not
only saved the unprofitable plant but also helped the White Cat
Group to expand its production.

<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The export of machinery and
electronic products in the Chinese capital city of Beijing
maintained a strong growing momentum last year.
</P>
<P>
Despite Beijing's slump in exports as a whole, the export
volume of machinery and electronic products reached 740 million US
dollars, an increase of 18 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The city has been carrying out a supportive policy in these
trades to nurture a large number of competent and competitive
factories and foreign trade companies.

<HEADLINE> Pressure Expected on Syria after Hebron, Lebanon PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik
Hariri has expected that pressure on Syria and Lebanon to yield
to Israeli conditions will increase following the recent
Israeli-Palestinian agreement on Hebron, Beirut's An-Nahar daily
reported today.
</P>
<P>
But the prime minister stressed that he did not anticipate
a Middle East war, because the military option had been tried
by Israel and proved too costly.
</P>
<P>
"Military pressure on Lebanon has proved to be futile,"
Hariri said. "It may kill people, destroy facilities and
terrorize the nation, but in the final result, Lebanon won't
change its political stance."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister made the remarks during an Iftar, a
breakfast in the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, which he hosted
Tuesday night for some 1,000 college and university students at
his residence in West Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Hariri said that Israel was the main beneficiary of "the
no peace, no war status quo" in the region, which, he
noted, is slowing down his government's drive to restore
Lebanon to its pre-civil war glory as the economic center in
the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He underlined that Lebanon does not wish to interfere with
the internal affairs of the Palestinians, but said that the
Hebron agreement was being used by Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu as a propaganda stunt.
</P>
<P>
"Israel is trying to polish its image abroad, and the
Western media are trying to market Netanyahu's government as a
peace-loving body as if Netanyahu has taken an important step
toward peace when in fact what is happening is contrary to
that," Hariri said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that what Netanyahu signed was "an agreement
which had been concluded by the previous Labor government
which he tried to circumvent for six months to delay a
redeployment form Hebron."
</P>
<P>
"This only proves the lack of seriousness on the Israeli
side to achieve peace," the Lebanese prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the Israeli forces last week handed 80
percent of Hebron to the Palestinian Authority led by Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
As to the impact of the agreement on Lebanon, Hariri said
Israel and its Western allies were likely to exert more pressure
on Syria and Lebanon until "one day we'll give in and say 'fine,
let's finish with it and sign a deal irrespective of the
conditions."
</P>
<P>
He vowed that his government will never bow to this pressure
"because such a deal would spark divisions in the country."
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, resisting pressure is necessary so that
the peace will be achieved only after the Lebanese conditions
are met.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon demands a full implementation of U.N. Security
Council Resolution 425, which calls for an unconditional Israeli
withdrawal from south Lebanon.

COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan Foreign Minister
Lakshman Kadirgamar today denied that the navy shot at an Indian
trawler and killed a fisherman on Tuesday night, according to a
news release from the ministry.
</P>
<P>
The denial was in response to a complaint from the Indian High
Commissioner here that an Indian trawler was shot in the
Kachchativu area in northern Sri Lanka and one of the four Indian
fishermen aboard was killed, the release said.
</P>
<P>
On inquiries by the Foreign Ministry, the Sri Lanka navy
categorically denied any shooting in this area in the past two
days.
</P>
<P>
The release said that the incident was a deliberate act by the
Tamil rebels aiming to disrupt Indo-Sri Lankan relations,
especially as Indian Foreign Minister I.K. Gujral is now in
Colombo co-chairing a meeting of the Indo-Sri Lanka Joint
Commission.

SHIJIAZHUANG, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A new tourism law went
into effect in Hebei province, north China, today which will
regulate the development and protection of tourism resources and
management, and spell out the rights and duties of tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Hebei regulation on tourism, adopted by the 22nd session of
the Standing Committee of the Eighth Provincial People Congress,
is China's fourth local law of the kind.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation welcomes overseas companies, organizations
or individuals to join in the development of Hebei's tourism
resources and the building of tourism facilities.
</P>
<P>
Wang Xinyong, Deputy Director of the Hebei Tourism Bureau, said
that compared with other big tourism sites in China, his province
has lagged behind, adding that Hebei's development of tourism
resources and management level could not meet the needs of the
nationwide expansion of the sector.
</P>
<P>
He said that the poor management of some scenic spots has
damaged Hebei's image and has adversely affected provincial
tourism.
</P>
<P>
Hebei, which surrounds China's capital city of Beijing, and the
big industrial city of Tianjin, faces the Bohai Sea and has rich
tourism resources.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hebei received 260,000 overseas tourists and 28

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Under Appreciation Pressures (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese currency is under
pressure to appreciate further this year, but the country's
central bank will not let it rise all the way, according to
officials and experts.
</P>
<P>
"This year the yuan will remain strong against the US dollar as
the supply of foreign exchange will continue to exceed demand," a
senior official of the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE) told Xinhua News Agency recently.
</P>
<P>
The supply of hard currencies has outgrown demand since China
overhauled its foreign exchange system in January 1994 by
devaluing the yuan from 5.7 against the greenback to 8.7, thereby
unifying the currency's dual exchange rates.
</P>
<P>
The yuan has since strengthened to around 8.3 against the US
dollar. It gained nearly 0.3 percent over the greenback in 1996,
following a rise of 1.5 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively, in
1995 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
"All the measurable factors foretell the further expansion of
our reserves and an oversupply of foreign exchange, leaving the
yuan under pressure to gain more ground," the SAFE official said.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign exchange reserves have grown significantly in
recent years, to 105 billion US dollars at the end of last year
from merely 21.3 billion US dollars at the year-end of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The official explained that this year China is again expected
to post a trade surplus, which stood at 12.2 billion US dollars
last year.
</P>
<P>
The rising momentum of foreign direct investment in China,
which reached more than 41 billion US dollars in 1996, will remain
strong thanks to an improving investment environment and good
economic prospects.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the People's Bank of China (PBC) will
not let the yuan go up all the way and also dismissed the
possibility that the central bank will bow to pressures from
exporters to artificially depress the local currency.
</P>
<P>
"If the central bank can buy foreign exchange at a cheaper
price, why should it pay a higher price?" the official
asked. "Exporters should improve their competitiveness through
their own efforts."

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Zambia earned 1.7 billion
Kwacha (1.3 million U.S. Dollars) from non-traditional exports to
Nordic countries in 1996, Commerce, Trade and Industry Deputy
Minister Ackim Nkole said.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's non-traditional exporting items include live fish,
game trophies, handcrafts, coffee and particle boards, Nkole said
at a one-day exporters seminar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In view of the continuous decline and the ever fluctuating
prices for metal products on the world market, non-traditional
exports are the only alternative to economic recovery in the
copper-rich country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Zambia's non-traditional exports, particularly agriculture and
forestry products, are renewable and competitive on world markets
for years as long as better methods of production are applied, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The government and the Export Board of Zambia are currently
mobilizing technical and financial assistance from donor agencies
to support exporters who facing problems on sourcing cheaper
pre-shipment and finance, Nkole added.

<HEADLINE> China's Yuan Under Appreciation Pressures (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tao Liming, deputy director of the International Finance
Research Institute under the Bank of China, said that the local
currency will continue to be in short supply as China is keeping a
moderately tight monetary policy this year.
</P>
<P>
"The yuan will remain solid unless basic construction overheats
and imports run out of control," he said, noting that the two will
not happen this year as the central government has vowed
repeatedly to pursue stable economic growth and cut inflation
further to embrace the resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong
and the convocation of the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China.
</P>
<P>
"Overall, the forces pushing up the value of the local currency
still exist this year and I don't see any signs for it to
depreciate in a foreseeable time frame," Tao said, adding that he
expects China's foreign exchange reserves to grow by around 20
billion US dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Tao said that the firmness of the yuan indicates a sound macro
economy but adversely affects some micro economic aspects, such as
dampening exports.
</P>
<P>
"And I have to say the double-edged exchange rate is inevitable
in a market economy, and the reality is that we are developing a
market economy," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the central bank will continue to purchase
hard currencies, though a rapidly-expanding foreign exchange
reserve, which increases money supply, has been partly blamed for
inflationary pressures in past years.
</P>
<P>
"There is no way for the central bank to avoid the bad effects
of a consolidating exchange rate and an enormous foreign exchange
reserve at the same time," Tao pointed out.
</P>

"From a realistic point of view, the PBC will opt for a
relatively stable exchange rate of the yuan and let the currency
reserves grow," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, a second SAFE official told Xinhua that it could be
harmful if China too heavily emphasizes the stability of the
yuan's exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
"The market will decide the value of the yuan," he said. "Why
should we let overseas speculators take advantage of our promise
to keep it stable?"
</P>
<P>
Tang Jiying, vice president of the Shanghai-based China Foreign
Exchange Trade System, said that the yuan's current exchange rate
basically reflects its value.
</P>
<P>
The yuan was quoted today at 8.2955 against the US currency, up
from 8.3174 in early 1996.

<HEADLINE> Social Changes Give Rise to Higher Divorce Rate in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's rising divorce rate is
the result of overwhelming social changes brought on by the
country's reform and opening up, a recent survey by the
Procurators Daily shows.
</P>
<P>
According to the survey of 100 divorce cases handled by a local
court since 1992, 18 percent of those who initiated divorce
proceedings are newly-promoted officials from the government and
state-owned enterprises. Seven percent of them are women.
</P>
<P>
The increase is three times higher than that before 1992, it
says.
</P>
<P>
China's divorce rate has climbed from 5.9 per thousand in 1990
to 7.1 per thousand in 1995. And the rate is expected to be much
higher in 1996, an official with the Civil Affairs Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The opportunity to change jobs, which was difficult under the
former planned economic structure, has prompted more divorces in
recent years, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
It explains that many who left government institutions and
state-owned enterprises for more profitable private or foreign
funded businesses have decided they and their spouses are no
longer compatible.
</P>
<P>
Also increasing are divorces that allow either spouse to evade
debts or for women to have more children, thereby bypassing the
state family planning policy.
</P>
<P>
Second divorces, which have only become frequent in recent
years, have also increased.

MEXICO CITY, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Maria Diaz, a 28-year-old

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China's market potential for
electronic products is expected to top one trillion yuan in the
year 2000, and six trillion yuan just ten years later.
</P>
<P>
According to a national meeting on the electronics industry,
which opened in Beijing today, China has a huge market for
electronic products, with an annual growth rate as high as 30
percent expected.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that with the quickening of the
information-oriented process and the improvement of living
standards, people are posing greater demands on electronic
products.
</P>

The Chinese government has already designated electronics as a
pillar industry of the national economy, and designated electronic
and information products as new sectors for development, which
will push ahead the national economy at a fast pace.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of the Electronics Industry, China
will boost the development of promising products such as
large-scale integrated circuits, computers, software, computer
networks, mobile telecommunications, digital program-controlled
switchboards and large-screen color televisions.
</P>

<P>
HARARE, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Chancellor of the National
University of Rwanda (UNR) Deo Kambanda has encouraged more
south-to-south cooperation among African countries rather than
perpetual dependence on western countries.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda, who is on a two-day visit to Zimbabwean universities
before proceeding to other southern African universities to
discuss cooperation pacts, said Africa had enough professional
manpower to develop the continent.
</P>
<P>
''We have brilliant brains here. Why can't we use them,'' he
asked after a tour of the National University of Science and

</P>
<P>
During his visit, Kambanda would discuss exchange programs for
Rwandan and southern African university students and lecturers.
</P>
<P>
He said currently his university has about 4,000 students and
the intake would be increased to 6,000 next year.
</P>
<P>
Kambanda described the situation in Rwanda as ''99 percent
normal''. ''There is no more conflict between tribes. The main
problem at the moment is re-integrating returning refugees,'' he
noted.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Malaysia Thinks Big for Future (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Many Malaysians appear
modest in their vision of a modernized country compared with their
prime minister who has vowed to catapult the nation to "the full
promise of the Information Age" by 2020.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has successfully transformed its agriculture-based
economy to an industrial one which grew at a rapid rate of eight
percent annually for the past nine years.
</P>
<P>
However, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, aiming much higher,
said that the progress of the nation would be stalled unless it
joins the emerging new industries of the Information Age in a
world which is leaving the Industrial Age behind.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir returned here today after a 10-day working visit to
the United States and Japan, where he expounded emphatically and
eloquently his country's drive to modify its strategy to move
towards the Information Age.
</P>
<P>
Although Malaysia's economic prospects are bright with a high
growth rate of 8-8.3 percent in reach this year, challenges remain
to overcome lower competitiveness and structural weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
The country's competitiveness is affected by wage increases
that outpace productivity growth, a low level of research and
development activities, and little innovative capability.
</P>
<P>
To improve its competitiveness, Malaysia is shifting to
capital- intensive and high-tech-intensive investments for the
future sustainable economy, in which services will be the biggest
sector, ahead of manufacturing.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir's trip to the U.S. and Japan was specially intended
for promoting Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC), a
multi-billion-dollar high-tech project, and for seeking help from
world-renowned hardware and software companies to develop the
country's multimedia industries.
</P>
<P>
"We can't ignore developments in the field of Information
Technology (IT)," Mahathir said,
</P>
<P>
He noted that unless Malaysians actively take part in the
Information Age activities, they would lag behind in their way of
life and even their intellectual growth.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said that the country's future will see the creation
of an environment where the IT industry will form the backbone of
a new way of life, while for Malaysians, exciting times are ahead
as they learn to adapt.

<TEXT>
<P>
The MSC, covering a zone of 15 kilometers by 50 kilometers
south of Kuala Lumpur, is designed to offer a prefect environment
for companies wanting to develop and distribute multimedia
products and services.
</P>
<P>
During the trip to the U.S. and Japan, Mahathir drummed up
support for the development of the MSC, a brainchild of his own,
which he said would serve as a launching pad for the IT
transformation of an entire nation and a gateway to a dynamic and
prosperous future.
</P>
<P>
The response he received for the upcoming MSC development has
been most positive, especially as support is coming from the
world's leading high-technology companies in multimedia and
knowledge-based industries.
</P>
<P>
More than 30 American companies, including Microsoft
Corporation, have shown interest in investing in the MSC and a
number of Japanese companies, including Japanese giant Nippon
Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (NTT), also indicated their
keenness to invest in the MSC.
</P>
<P>
In addition to political stability and economical
competitiveness, Malaysia has promised attractive incentives to
potential investors, such as no taxes, no investment allowance tax
for the first decade of operating and no duties on multimedia
equipment.
</P>
<P>
The country is also drawing up a set of cyberlaws including
those on computer crime, intellectual property rights and digital
signature to protect investors in the MSC.
</P>
<P>
Chief executives of the companies who showed very strong
support for the project "find that the conditions, the laws, the
policies as well as the practices in the MSC are conducive to
their participation," said Mahathir, who had meetings with them.
</P>
<P>
To kick-start the MSC, Malaysia identified seven specific
flagship applications for development in the first phase, which
are electronic government, smart schools, telemedicine, research
and development clusters, the national multipurpose card,
worldwide manufacturing webs and borderless market centers.
</P>
<P>
As envisaged by Mahathir, the second phase will involve linking
the MSC with other islands of excellence of the country and phase
three will see the whole of Malaysia leapfrogging into the
Information Age with the entire country "living and working in
these new ways."
</P>
<P>
"I fully expect that this 'web' will extend beyond Malaysia's
borders and out across Malaysia's multicultural links to our
neighbors," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that the MSC would eventually become a
global bridge when its web is linked to those of other regions in
the world.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the MSC, a network of world-class and
local companies will hopefully be enlisted to help Malaysia
achieve the goals of its Vision 2020, which is to attain the
status of a developed country.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Supporters Just Fantastic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Soccer has brought a legendary
fame to the northern seaport city of Dalian, Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The most prosperous city in Liaoning Province enjoys a
reputation as a "green city" as well as a "soccer capital."
</P>
<P>
Dalianers still talk about the stunning performance by their
favorite (Dalian) Wanda team in 1996, a season when the side did
not lose a single game, netting their second Chinese professional
league title.
</P>
<P>
Every Dalian family has at least one soccer fan. But the fans
among nearly two million urban residents used to revel in untamed
enthusiasm in their soccer stadium, regardless of whether their
team won or hit a losing streak.
</P>
<P>
Then people came to realize that the sports stadium was an
instant showroom of their city, especially in a place where the
residents took pride in their sporting traditions.
</P>
<P>
Soccer fans in Dalian set up an association to produce its own
pennant, badge and mascot.
</P>
<P>
"Spirited enthusiasm should not be outlawed on the soccer
field," Zhang Jiashu, the secretary general of the association,
said, "however, being energetic but not rude is a golden rule for
our fans."
</P>
<P>
Fans rallied in the downtown sports stadium to celebrate and
rally every week in the last 11-week season. Confetti, trumpets
and military bands showed their enthusiasm in a colorful way,
replacing the old style of throwing soda bottles and hurtling foul
words.
</P>
<P>
Warm support to the fans added fuel to the team's performance
and instilled a sense of pride among the city's soccer
professionals.
</P>
<P>
"We really show our gratitude to such warm and polite fans,"
said Wang Jianlin, chairman of the Wanda Group, a
major sponsor of Dalian's soccer team, citing that his team's
record of never losing a home game in three years has been a
victory for all fans.
</P>
<P>
A package tour by 300 fans to Beijing for an away-game last
year gave the Dalian supporters a chance to show Beijingers their
good manners and expertise in watching soccer games.
</P>
<P>
Team manager Chi Shangbin even bowed in thanks that night
to the stand holding Dalian fans. He wanted to thank them
personally - in full view of the country's capital - for their
politeness and support.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 22 (Xinhua) -- About 22,000 Burundi
refugees have fled their country for neighboring Tanzania and the
pace of their exodus is picking up, the U.N. refugee agency said.

<P>
Pamela O'Toole, spokesman of the U.N. High Commission for

fleeing the fighting in southwestern Burundi to join 134,,000
displaced Burundians who escaped to Tanzania in November and
December.

Some 60,000 Burundi Hutus have been forced out of eastern
Zarie by an ethnic Tutsi rebellion.
</P>
<P>
UNHCR Commissioner Sadako Ogata will visit Burundi, Zaire,
Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda from February 6 to 15.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR charged that hundreds of returnees have been killed
by Burundi's Tutsis-dominated army since the minority Tutsis
seized power in a military coup on July 25 last year.
</P>
<P>
In the latest reported massacre earlier this month, Burundi
troops killed 126 Hutu returnees expelled from Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
A total of some 150,000 people have been killed in the tiny
central African country during a three-year war between the army
and Hutu rebels.

FUZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
dealt with 65 cases of illegal land use over the past two years as
part of a province-wide land protection campaign.
</P>
<P>
More than 21 unauthorized structures built on cultivated land
have been pulled down, and 47 hectares of land reclaimed.
</P>
<P>
Fujian is one of the Chinese provinces that suffer from an
acute shortage of cultivated land, with only 0.038 hectares per
person.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure adequate grain supplies, the province has
adopted a series of financial and legal regulations and invested
20 million yuan (about 2.4 million US dollars) to place 82 percent
of the farmland under top protection.
</P>
<P>
Developers who want to use land are required to obtain a permit
and pay high compensation costs. And officials' performance is
linked with their efforts to curb the shrinking land space.
</P>
<P>
As a result, more than one million hectares of basic farmland
have been effectively saved.
</P>
<P>
To meet the demand for land development, the province has set
aside 3,300 ha of idle land for construction of towns and
villages, foreign-backed projects, and industrial zones.

<TEXT>
<P>
WEIHAI (Shandong), January 22 (Xinhua) -- China set a record in
its import and export of chemical products in 1996, with the
annual value topping 30 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The export increased by a big margin, hitting 12 billion U.S.
dollars last year, said Gu Xiulian, Chinese minister of the
chemical industry, at a national conference held recently in
Weihai, a port city in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
An outstanding characteristic in chemical development last year
was the big rise in the long and medium-term investment from
abroad, Gu said.
</P>
<P>
Many large foreign corporations have been involved in the
development of some key chemical works by setting up holding
companies in China.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chinese chemical giants have extended their market
absorption, selling complete sets of equipment and exporting
laborers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China held an international chemical exhibition
which attracted 1,800 domestic and foreign chemical works and
snatched a transaction value of 12 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Outlining tasks for this year, Gu said chemical industry should
raise efficiency and improve product quality, explore more new
markets, develop technology-intensive and value-added products and
enhance cooperation with other countries.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, China is to export 20 billion U.S.
dollars-worth of chemicals and absorb 12 billion US dollars of
foreign investment a year.

<P>
BELGRADE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The three parties of Bosnia
have failed to reach agreement on the issues of setting up an
integrated central bank and using the same currency in the
country, said a senior bank official in Sarajevo on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
K. Omicevic, president of the National Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina, said that during the negotiations among the
representatives from the three parties, the Serbs insisted on
establishing their own central bank and currency, which was turned
down by representatives from the Muslem-Croat Federation.
</P>
<P>
According to the Bosnian constitution and the Dayton peace
agreements, which were signed in December 1995 ending the
three-and-half year Bosnian War, there should be one central bank
and one single currency in the country.
</P>
<P>
The international community has also required Bosnia to set up
an integrated central bank before it provides financial aid to the
Balkan country.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Bosnian Serbs, Muslems and Croats have their own
respective central banks and currencies, and they are negotiating
on the issues.

barriers to the privatization drive and put effective bankruptcy
mechanisms into operation.

JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia will soon have its
first commodity futures market managed by the private sector,

<P>
Like the stock market, the futures trading will be entrusted to
private business, while the government will merely act as
supervisor, Industry and Trade Minister Tungky Ariwibowo told a

on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"The plan will be immediately set in motion after its bill has
been enacted by the House of Representatives," said Tungky.
</P>
<P>
Commodity futures trading has been in operation in Indonesia,
but only as an extension of overseas markets such as the Tokyo
Commodity Futures and the Malaysia Commodity Stock Exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Tungky said that the Indonesian government has drawn up
guidelines for the implementation of the bill and provided
intensive training for department personnel and bourse
participants.
</P>
<P>
Basically, the exchange was designed to achieve social welfare,
ensure efficient and effective trade, and keep out speculators.

company monopolizing the production and exportation of several
nonmetallic minerals including iodine, has prescribed that it will
export 140 million dollars worth of iodine this year, double the
number of the previous year.
</P>

in 1996 compared with 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Costa Rica exported 105

of 600 million U.S. dollars against 1995's 620.77 million dollars.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Troops Continue to Shell Muslim Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Philippine government troops
continued to shell the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) rebels
in southern Philippines, sending hundreds of residents to flee,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Al-Haj Murad, MILF vice chairman for military affairs, said the
military was still conducting ground-to-ground and aerial
bombardment in Buldon, the main camp of the rebel group in
Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
About 300 families have already fled the area and a "massive
evacuation" is going on, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the military said that the evacuation was "very
minimal" and the residents began to return to their homes as the
situation has been put under control.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant Noel Detoyato, spokesman of the Army's Sixth
Infantry Division surrounding the MILF stronghold, admitted that
there was shelling, but described it as "necessary" to protect the
residents from lawless elements.
</P>
<P>
The MILF warned that there was "a very high probability" that
it would back out of the peace talks with the government if the
military presence and armed conflicts continue in the area.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a breakaway group of the Moro National Liberation
Front that signed a peace agreement with the government last
September, is growing into the biggest rebel group in the country.
</P>
<P>
The joint technical committee of the government and the MILF
discussed the guidelines and framework for their future formal
peace talks at their first meeting on January 7-8. They are
scheduled to meet again on February 25-26.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine to Make Efforts to Develop Ties With Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukraine would make great efforts
to develop the relations with Russia and no one could hamper the
process, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Gennady Udovenko said today.
</P>
<P>
At a news briefing, Udovenko said Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov's
remarks on Sevastopol should not negatively affect the existing
ties and their development prospects between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Last Friday, during his visit to Sevastopol in Crimean
peninsula which is the home port of the Black Sea Fleet, Luzhkov
declared that Sevastopol was and is a city of Russia. On Sunday
Ukraine lodged a protest, warning that the mayor's statements
could affect Ukrainian-Russian relations and bring about their
deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Russians account for about 70 percent of the population of
Sevastopol, and are in the majority across Crimea which was
Russian territory until 1954 when the then Soviet leader Nikita
Khrushchev gave it to Ukriane in a symbolic gesture of friendship.
</P>
<P>
Russia and Ukraine have been fighting over the city since the
Soviet collapse in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko told reporters today that he had written to Luzhkov
not to go to Sevastopol, but he still went there and Ukraine took
a "tolerant attitude" to the issue. He said Luzhkov's remarks were
"very rude" and "unacceptable" to his country.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine condemned Luzhkov's remarks, but it would never take
his remarks as the basis of establishing the ties with Russia,
Udovenko stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said Ukraine expected Russian President Boris Yeltsin to
recover from his illness as early as possible and resume
activities.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Continues Search for Missing Plane </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's air force with
assistance from the navy continued its search for the third day
for the missing Y-12 aircraft with a crew of four off the northern
coast, military sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The aircraft, which took off at the Palaly base on a
reconnaissance mission Monday, might have been gunned down by
Tamil rebels, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The loss of the Y-12 aircraft came six days after the
disappearance of an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) of the Sri
Lankan Air Force over Pooneryn in the north of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-built UAV, acquired last year, vanished during a
surveillance mission. Attempts to locate it have so far failed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the air force lost another aircraft last evening
when a multi-role Israeli-built Kfir fighter on a bombing mission
crashed into the Nogombo lagoon, over 30 kilometers north of
Colombo, shortly after take-off. The pilot ejected and landed
safely a few kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Since the resumption of fighting between the Tamil rebels and
government forces in April 1995, the air force has lost 11
aircraft including helicopters.
</P>
<P>
At least 300 persons were killed in these incidents, according
to local press reports.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, Malaysia to Hold Talks on Dispute Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia and Malaysia are
preparing to hold another round of talks to settle their dispute
over the Ligitan and Sipadan islands after completing the first
round early this month, a Foreign Ministry official said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Izhar Ibrahim, director general for political affairs of the
ministry said last night the preparations were being made although
it was still not certain when the second round of talks would take
place.
</P>
<P>
The two countries at a meeting between President Soeharto and
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed in Kuala Lumpur last October
agreed to submit their dispute to the International Court of
Justice (ICJ) in the Hague and their subsequent talks concerned
the processes and procedures they would follow in seeking the
arbitration, Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
In their talks held early this month, the two sides agreed to
meet again in Jakarta but "so far there is no certainty yet as to
when the second round of talks will be held because consultations
on it are still going on at departmental level," he said
</P>
<P>
Sipadan and Ligitan are small islands located in the Makassar
strait on the sea border between the Indonesian province of East
Kalimantan and the eastern Malaysian state of Sabah.
</P>
<P>
The dispute surfaced in 1969 when the two sides were engaged in
efforts to delineate their continental shelves. Since then the two
sides twice attempted to settle their overlapping claims to the
islands in bilateral talks.

BELGRADE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Military experts from the
United States began to train the first group of officers of
Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Federation Army today at a military base
close to the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
This is part of the U.S. program to train and equip the
federation army, which will cost 400 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the end of last year, the first consignment of ammunition
provided by the United States was shipped to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Under the program of the U.S. experts, the weaponry of the
federation army would be double that of the Serb forces, namely
273 tanks, 227 armored vehicles, 41 fighters, 14 helicopters and
1,000 artillery units.
</P>
<P>
The start of the training program also means the official
establishment of the federation army, which should contain 30,000
to 35,000 troops.

<HEADLINE> Ukraine's Nonaligned Status Unchanged, FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Ukrainian foreign minister Gennady
Udovenko said today that the nonaligned status is a strategic
policy adopted by Ukraine, and any change of the position was
"unsuitable" at the present time.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a news briefing following a claim, once
again, by the Mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, that the port city of
Sevastopol was in the past, and would be in the future, Russia's.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko stressed that the nonaligned position was Ukraine's
"most correct choice", which "completely conforms to the present
reality".
</P>
<P>
Mayor Luzhkov made his remarks last Friday when attending a
handing over ceremony of houses financed by Russia for sailors of
Russia's Black Sea Fleet.
</P>
<P>
His remarks caused strong repercussions and the Ukrainian
foreign ministry delivered a protest note to the Russian
government.
</P>
<P>
Udovenko said that though some Russian politicians recently
took part in unfriendly activities against Ukraine, and made
speeches damaging Ukraine's territorial integrity, Ukraine would
steadfastly carry the strategic policy of being nonaligned.

<HEADLINE> Thai Cabinet Puts New Airport Project on Hold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 22 (Xinhua) -- The cabinet of Thailand has put
the second Bangkok international airport project, also known as
the Nong Ngu Hao airport, on indefinite hold.
</P>
<P>
At the cabinet meeting on Tuesday, most cabinet ministers
supported Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh's proposal to
shelve the project, conceived 37 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Delays to design work on the new airport terminal and the
relocation of local people had already left the first phase three
years behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
Chavalit said the first phase of the new airport could not be
completed by the year 2000 as scheduled and continuation would run
against the austerity policy of the government.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is facing a current account deficit and the government
has adopted a policy to cut spending on huge projects which do not
have top priority.
</P>
<P>
The state has already spent 6 billion baht (240 million US
dollars) on the project, which is just outside southeast Bangkok
in Samut Prakan province.
</P>
<P>
The project site is low-lying and flood-prone, needing refill
with sand, subsequently raising the cost.
</P>
<P>
To cope with increased passenger volume over the next 10 years,
Chavalit suggested that the air force base adjacent to the
existing Bangkok Don Muang International Airport, be given over to
civil use and the air base be relocated.
</P>
<P>
The expansion of Don Muang airport would cost 10 billion baht
(about 400 million dollars), while implementation of the first
phase of Nong Ngu Hao alone would require 97 billion baht (3.88
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the high-speed train between Bangkok and the eastern
province of Rayong is likely to be derailed by the scrapping of
Nong Ngu Hao airport.
</P>
<P>
Without a connection to the airport, the 190-km rail link would
not be viable, a transport and communications official said.

<HEADLINE> Roads, Bridges Increase in Myanmar in Past 9 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A large number of new roads and
bridges have been built in Myanmar since 1988 as part of the
government's efforts to improve transportation in the country,
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Second Secretary of the State Law and Order
Restoration Council Tin Oo, roads in Myanmar increased from 23,316
kilometers in 1988 to 27,680 kilometers in 1996, while bridges
from 4,932 to 5,078.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inauguration of the Natchaung bridge in Bogale
township in Ayeyawaddy division on Tuesday, Tin Oo said the
government is committed to improving transportation and promoting
contacts and economic progress among national races.
</P>
<P>
Tin Oo, also chairman of the Central Committee for Ensuring
Smooth and Secure Transportation, said that there are now over
2,080 kilometers of roads in Ayeyawaddy division, which previously
depended on waterways for transportation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the construction of roads has brought about
significant development in the division.
</P>
<P>
The bailey-type Natchaung bridge, linking Bogale to Pyapon and
measuring 91.44 meters long and about 3.6 meters wide, was built
at a cost of 16.8 million kyats (112,000 U.S. dollars), the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Czech Republic, Germany Declare Post-War Reconciliation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Czech Prime Minister Vaclav
Klaus and German Chancellor Helmut Kohl signed here today a joint
declaration of reconciliation between the Czech Republic and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
In the declaration, Germany confessed its historical
responsibility for the Second World War, expressed its sorrow for
the 1938-45 Nazi occupation of the Czech lands and asked the Czech
people for "forgiveness".
</P>
<P>
Prague expressed its regret for its expulsion of 2.5 million
Sudeten Germans and the confiscation of their property after the
war.
</P>
<P>
The accord also included Germany's support for the Czech
Republic's efforts to obtain membership of the European Union and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
</P>
<P>
"The declaration which we have just signed is a big step
forward for both of our nations," Kohl said after the signing of
the declaration at Prague's Liechtenstein Palace.
</P>
<P>
The accord will mean better neighborly relations and peaceful
co-existence in Europe, he added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also agreed to set up a 160 million mark
(98.6 million U.S. dollars) "Future Fund".
</P>
<P>
Most of the money will come from Germany and is primarily
intended to benefit victims of the Nazi aggression.
</P>
<P>
The accord, drawn up after two years of delicate talks, is
opposed by the Czech Republic's Republicans, who won 18 of the 200
seats in parliamentary elections last June, and the Communists,
who won 22.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans staged a demonstration today and referred the
accord to the 1938 Munich Agreement which ceded the Sudetenland,
then part of Czechoslovakia, to Germany and the communists say the
declaration is a threat to Czech sovereignty.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide Anti-Fraud Crackdown Generates Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- China will continue the cleanup
and standardization of consumer good market this year by
tightening inspection of quality of products in large and
medium-sized department stores.
</P>
<P>
The medium-sized shops, with an annual sales volume of more
than 50 million (six million US dollars), is part of the country's
anti-fraud drive this year, a report in "China Daily" quoted an
official in charge of quality control as saying.
</P>
<P>
The State Bureau of Technical Supervision (SBTS) and the
Ministry of Internal Trade early last year launched a nationwide
crackdown to clean up the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
Large state-owned department stores and more than 400 shopping
centers, each of which boasts an annual sales volume of 100
million yuan (12 million US dollars), were the first to be
examined, said Ye Bolin with the SBTS.
</P>
<P>
The inspections, first conducted by the shops themselves and
then by local authorities in charge of technical supervision and
commercial administration, focused on packaged food, clothes,
leather goods, chemical products for daily use, cosmetics, gold
and jade ornaments and electric house appliances.
</P>
<P>
"Regional results indicate large state-owned department stores
are trustworthy regarding the quality of goods and services," Ye
said.
</P>
<P>
"Though complete information about the results of this cleanup
crackdown is still not available, the move has helped strengthen
management of markets, improve the quality commodities and of the
people who work in the sector and protect the legal rights of
consumers," said Wang Qing, an official with the Ministry of
Internal Trade.
</P>
<P>
The state-owned department stores have served for decades as
the main channel of commodity distribution in China.

<HEADLINE> Carter Praises Mercosur, Criticizes Helms-Burton Act </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. President
James Carter today described the South American Common Market
(Mercosur) as "a marvelous development" for the region.
</P>
<P>
Carter, who arrived in Buenos Aires Sunday on a Latin American
tour, also criticized the Helms-Burton Act as a "serious error or
disaster".
</P>
<P>
Carter said at a news briefing that Mercosur not only helped to
lower trade barriers and increase trade but served as a way to
achieve harmony and cooperation between its member states.
</P>
<P>
It also helped to boost citizen exchanges and prevent political
tensions, he said.
</P>
<P>
Carter criticized the United States' position on Cuba. He said
the Helms-Burton Act was "a trade embargo that severely punishes
the people of Cuba and hinders a peaceful resolution to the
differences between the United States and Cuba."
</P>
<P>
The former U.S. president also mentioned the Malvina (Falkland)
Islands issue and said the United States might agree to mediate
between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
The Malvina Islands (also called Falkland Islands), located to
the east of Argentina in the Atlantic, is a former colony of
Britain. Both countries have claimed sovereignty over the islands
with no agreement reached so far. In 1982, Britain fought a war
with Argentina over the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Carter said that the U.S. government would keep neutral and it
wished for a resolution to the issue satisfactory to both sides.
</P>
<P>
Carter made his Latin American tour to advance political
consultations in order to organize the theme of the Latin American
Conference to be held in the U.S. in April.
</P>
<P>
Carter's next stops will be Brazil and Jamaica. He has been to
Chile.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Fights Firecrackers, Smoking in Public Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- With China's traditional Spring
Festival just around the corner, Beijing has stepped up its fight
against the selling and dealing of firecrackers, which have been
banned in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
And checks against violations of the smoking ban in public
places have also been carried out in the capital city, the Beijing
Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The ban on fireworks was enacted on December 1, 1993, and one
on smoking in public places went into effect on May 15, 1996. Both
are designed to reduce the number of fires, injuries and health
hazards, and "cultivate a civilized way of life."
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the local police have successfully
investigated eight violations of the fireworks ban since the
beginning of 1997, charging 11 offenders and confiscating 600,000
firecrackers.
</P>
<P>
Over 800,000 primary and middle school students were recently
mobilized by the municipal fireworks-ban office and youth league
to form a "Beijing Young Fire Brigade," which is expected to help
oversee the fireworks ban and fire control measures in the city,
the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The municipal hygiene campaign committee recently organized
law-enforcement personnel to review the smoking ban's
effectiveness in public places such as libraries, railway
stations, university classrooms and hospitals.
</P>
<P>
It was found that the smoking ban has helped to greatly curb
smoking in those places, as only a small number of offenders were
caught and fined, the newspaper said.

JAKARTA, January 22 (Xinhua) -- A high alert was in force
around Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano on Tuesday, four days
after it erupted spewing deadly heat clouds and forcing the
evacuation of 15,000 people, a volcano observation station
official said.
</P>
<P>
Some 2,126 people living within the danger zone were still
staying in the barracks that had been set up to accommodate them,
Antara news agency today quoted Soeramto, an officer at the
Volcano Observation Station as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the peak of the mountain was covered in clouds so that
the mountain's activities could not be observed visually.
</P>
<P>
The sound of avalanches of magmatic lava was still heard, he
said, adding that he could not determine their direction and
distance because of the clouds.
</P>
<P>
Soeramto said no heat clouds were produced in the last two days
while the tremors so far were caused by lava avalanches.
</P>
<P>
Although no other kinds of tremor happened, people had been
asked to stay alert because the intensity or timing of the
mountain's activities were hard to predict, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 2,968-meter-high Merapi, one of the world's most active
volcanoes erupted in 1994, claiming 69 lives and leaving 5,000
homeless.

<P>
-- China's state news agency, Xinhua, released an article,
entitled "Misguidance In Vain", written by Wen Ming, today.
</P>
<P>
The article noted that recently some US news media have
published commentaries and reports that are obviously against the
wishes of the people of both China and the United States, and in a
sharp contrast to the two countries' improved relations.
</P>
<P>
It went on to say that there are a number of columnists and
scholars in the US who have a deeply-rooted prejudice and
hostility toward China, which perseveres in the road of socialism,
and are extremely reluctant to resign themselves to the fact that
the "overall containment" policy against China has ended in
failure.
</P>
<P>
-- China sent scholars abroad for further study in the past 18
years and this has helped train a large group of professionals and
increased China's cooperation with other countries in science and
technology, education, culture, economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
A national conference on returned scholars opened here
yesterday said that approximately 270,000 Chinese went abroad for
advanced training over the past 18 years. Over 120,000 of them
were sponsored by the government or their work units, with the
remainder self-supporting. Some 90,000 of these people have
completed their overseas study and returned.

cooperation with the world market as the new century approaches.
The state-owned corporation is to expand its international
business and hopes to become one of the world's top companies by
the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
It would emphasize satellite technology and related products,
commercial launching services, and civilian mechanical and
electronic products geared toward the international market.

those contradictory to the Basic Law for Hong Kong will be
abolished, said Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang yesterday

GUANGZHOU, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of farmers in south
China have better lives thanks to a program that started a decade
ago to develop the countryside by means of advanced technology.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, 4.9 billion yuan has been put into the
"Spark Program" in China's Guangdong Province, and had resulted in
29 billion yuan of added value.
</P>
<P>
Under the program 1,728 projects have been launched in the
province, 167 of which produced an annual output value of over ten
million yuan each, 29 major industries have taken shape, and more
than 400,000 farmers have received technical training.
</P>
<P>
A number of hi-tech development areas have been established in
the province, and the province has also set up the first national
Spark Program service center.
</P>
<P>
The development of township enterprises is one of the program's
targets. The province is now the country's largest poultry
production base, producing 800 million chickens, ducks, and geese
annually.

<HEADLINE> Name of Poets, Historian Misused </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Poet Chen Mingyuan and the
Publishing House of China Federation of Literary and Art Circles
were said to have infringed upon the the name rights of the famous
Chinese poet and historian Guo Moruo, the China Daily reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The case involves a book, "New Tide," published by the
publishing house in 1992 and with Chen Mingyuan and Guo Moruo
listed as co-authors.
</P>
<P>
In the book, Guo's 108 sonnets were rewritten into modern poems
by Chen.
</P>
<P>
Guo Moruo, a famous poet, historian and former head of the
Chinese academy of Sciences, was said to have not given permission
for Chen Mingyuan to publish books using his name, Guo's daughter
Guo Pingping said.
</P>
<P>
Guo died in 1978.
</P>
<P>
Chen Mingyuan could not offer evidence that he had Guo's
permission to use his name. He admitted he used Guo's name without
permission from his heir, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, Chen argued in court that he worked with Guo for many
years on the book, which should be a joint effort of both of them.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Haidian People's Court ruled Chen had infringed
upon Guo's name rights by having his name printed as one of the
two authors of the book without permission of Guo's heir.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Chen could not give any evidence justifying the
use of Guo's name. The verdict also ruled that Chen used Guo's
poems without the permission of Guo's heir, and thus infringed on
her right to use Guo's works and to be paid for this.
</P>
<P>
The judgment rule that Chen and the publishing house should
apologize in national newspapers to Guo's daughter, compensate her
for her economic loss and cover all the lawsuit fees, the Daily
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, January 22 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin, a leading industrial
city in north China has succeeded in eradicating poverty four
years ahead of the national target set by the central government.
</P>
<P>
The per capita net income of farmers in 175 poor villages in
rural Tianjin soared to 1,550 yuan by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
This was the result of an anti-poverty program launched in
1993, under which the municipal government provided these areas
with financial aid, technical guidance and materials to help them
develop local economy.
</P>
<P>
The combined grain output of the villages increased by 1.35
times in the past three years. The outputs of vegetables, fruit,
poultry, eggs and meat also grew by a wide margin.
</P>
<P>
In the course of industrial restructuring, the ratio of
industry and service trade has increased, and the overall capacity
of agriculture has been strengthened, said a local official.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Suggests 6-Month Renew of Force in Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan recommended today that the U.N. Interim Force in
Lebanon (UNIFIL) be extended for another period of six months,
until 31 July 1997.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Security Council, the secretary-general
noted that while the level of hostilities was somewhat lower than
that in the past, the situation in southern Lebanon continued to
be tense and volatile.
</P>
<P>
Israel maintained its occupation of parts of the area, while
Lebanese groups continued their attacks against the occupying
forces, the report said.
</P>
<P>
But it stressed that although the UNIFIL continued to be
prevented from implementing its mandate, which is to monitor the
withdrawal of Israeli troops, its contribution to stability and
the protection it was able to afford the population of the area
remained important.
</P>
<P>
In suggesting that the mandate renew for the 4,505-member force
established in 1978, the secretary-general also called upon member
states to pay their contributions.
</P>
<P>
"I must again draw attention to the serious shortfall in the
funding of the force," said the U.N. chief. "At present, unpaid
assessments amount to some 177 million U.S. dollars."
</P>
<P>
He said this money represented money owed to the member states
contributing the troops that make up the force.

NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Blue-chip shares on Wall
Street led stocks to more new highs today.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 40.03 points to
6,883.90, its fourth straight record finish and 10th in 12
sessions.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a narrow margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume jumping to 571.26
million shares from 444.39 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list rose 6.05 to 782.75; the
NYSE's composite index rose 2.26 to 411.57; the Nasdaq composite
index rose 11.32 to 1,375.60; and the Russell 2000 list of smaller
companies rose 0.98 to 370.33. All four measures set new highs.
</P>
<P>
The American Stock Exchange composite index rose 1.00 to
589.94.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the Dow's gain came from Boeing, which soared
on late Monday's news the company is halting plans to develop
larger 747 jets because there isn't enough demand to risk spending
up to 7 billion U.S. dollars on the project.
</P>
<P>
Technology shares also moved higher after a stream of
impressive profit reports and in advance of IBM's results.
</P>
<P>
Stocks started the day lower after interest rates rose in the
bond market amid worries about Federal Reserve chairman Allen
Greenspan's morning report to the Senate Budget Committee on the
state of the economy.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices fell before Greenspan's speech, the yield on the
30-year Treasury bond jumped to nearly 6.89 percent from late
Friday's 6.83 percent. But as bonds recovered, the yield fell to
6.78 percent, boosting stocks.

LONDON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Most of the major stock markets

Greenspan's upbeat assessment of the U.S. economy.

Governor of the Bank of England Eddie George's call Monday
night for a rate hike to ensure that government inflation targets

an early bout of profit-taking to push higher, with the FTSE 100
index closing 1.5 points up at 4,195.5 after a low of 4,167.6.
</P>
<P>
On the Frankfurt market, profit-taking after recent strong
gains made the DAX-30 index sharply lower at the close, down 53.97
points at 2,976.71, falling through the 3,000 points level.

UNITED NATIONS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Algerian diplomat
Mohamed Sahnoun, who once headed the U.N. operation in Somalia,
will be named a special representative for the Great Lakes region
of Central Africa, U.N. sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Sahnoun was appointed to head the U.N. Somalia operation in
April 1992 but resigned in the following October after a row with
the then Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
He was rebuked by Boutros-Ghali for publicly saying the United
Nations came too late to save many of the millions of Somalis
facing starvation.
</P>
<P>
His diplomatic career has included service as Algeria's
ambassador to the United Nations in 1982-84, and to the United
States (1984-1989). He was deputy secretary-general of the Arab
League in 1973 and from 1964 to 1973 was deputy secretary-general
of the Organization of African Unity.
</P>
<P>
The Great Lakes region of Central Africa has been in turmoil
for the past three years following large-scale ethnic violence
between Hutus and Tutsis in Rwanda and Burundi.

<HEADLINE> - Sudanese Vice-President Ends Visit to Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese Vice-President
Al-Zubeir Mohammed Salih left here today after a two-day
discussion on the current military situation in eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
He was seen off at the Damascus Airport by Syrian
Vice-President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed Syrian sources disclosed that during a meeting on
Monday, the Sudanese vice-president briefed Khaddam on what he
called external military intervention in Sudan aimed at
overthrowing the Sudanese government and undermining its unity
and the Arab nature of the country.
</P>
<P>
In response, the Syrian vice-president reiterated that his
country supports the territorial integrity of Sudan and unity of
its people, and opposes any foreign interference in Sudan's
internal affairs, on the grounds that Sudan's security is part and
parcel of the Arab security.
</P>
<P>
The visit by the Sudanese vice-president to Syria came within
the framework of several tours undertaken by Sudanese emissaries
dispatched by President Oman Hassan Ahmed al-Bashir to a number
of Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The objective of the tours is to brief the Arab leaders and
governments on the latest developments of the military situation
in Sudan, and seek Arab assistance in repelling what the
emissaries have described as Eritrean-Ethiopian aggression against
Sudan's territory and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government army has recently repelled an attack
in eastern Sudan. The offensive reportedly launched from Ethiopia
and Eritrea was under the command of southern Sudanese rebel
leader John Garang.
</P>
<P>
Sudan has accused Eritrea and Ethiopia of supporting and
fighting along with the Sudanese opposition, a charge rejected by
both countries. However the Sudanese opposition has denied any
external interference in the military maneuver.

<HEADLINE> Parties of Cypriot Communities Call for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- A Greek Cypriot party and a
Turkish Cypriot party today called for measures to defuse tension
in the divided Cyprus and a solution to the protracted Cyprus
problem through dialog.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of the Greek Cypriot United Democrats Party, a
small party which has seats in the Cypriot parliament, and Turkish
Cypriot leftist Republican Turkish Party from northern Cyprus had
a meeting here today to discuss the Cyprus problem and its recent
developments.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
abortive coup seeking union with Greece. The Turkish Cypriots in
the north then declared an independent "Turkish Republic of
Northern Cyprus", which is only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The tension has escalated recently on the island since the
Greek Cypriot government decided to buy Russian-made S-300
surface-to-air missiles with a range of 150 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued after the meeting said the two parties
voiced concern over the increase of tension on the island and an
"increase in chauvinistic tendencies."
</P>
<P>
It said "a solution to the Cyprus problem should be based on
political procedures and not military confrontation," and noted
that if the present situation continues there will be serious
consequences for both communities.
</P>
<P>
The two parties believe a dialog should begin soon, under the
auspices of the United Nations in order to reach a bicommunal,
bizonal solution to the Cyprus problem, as outlined in
U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
They also supported meetings between Greek Cypriot and Turkish
Cypriot political parties, noting these will help restore
confidence between the two communities.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Warships to Visit Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Turkish navy ships will call
on ports of northern Cyprus Friday to show Turkey's unity with
Turkish Cypriots in confronting alleged military threats from
the Cypriot government.
</P>
<P>
Islamist Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan made the announcement
here today after he got the information from Chief of General
Staff of the Turkish Armed Forces Ismail Hakki Karadayi.
</P>
<P>
However, it is unknown how many and what kind of Turkish
warships will visit the ports of northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi paid a two-day visit to northern Cyprus from January
13 to 14 to show Turkey's determination to block the deployment
of Russian-made S-300 missiles.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan said that Turkey and northern Cyprus were tied to each
other in every way and the Turkish government would never
tolerate any threat to the security and rights of Turkish
Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Welfare Party parliamentary group today, Erbakan
said that Turkey would abandon its long-standing passive stance
on the Cyprus issue and do what it can to assist northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
As for the Cypriot government's decision to purchase
anti-aircraft missiles, Erbakan reiterated that the Turkish
government would never allow the 150-kilometer-range missiles to
be deployed on the island of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said Turkey did not care about how long the deployment
of the missiles would be delayed, adding it would make no
difference if the Cyprus government refused to give up the
arms program.
</P>
<P>
"If it is not declared within a certain time that the
missiles will not be coming, we will definitely not hesitate
to take the necessary steps," Erbakan warned.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Cyprus has remained tense since the Cypriot
government contracted to buy S-300 missiles worth of 400
millions from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller
has warned that Turkey would not hesitate to hit these offensive
weapons if the Cypriot government goes ahead with the missile deal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus remains divided since 1974 when Turkey occupied the
northern third of the strategic Mediterranean island in the wake
of an abortive coup by supporters of union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
At present, some 35,000 Turkish troops are stationed on the
island to protect the Turkish Cypriots.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corporation, the
third largest auto maker of the U.S., today announced that both
its 1996 pretax earnings and vehicles sales hit their highest
points ever.
</P>
<P>
The company reported its pretax earnings reached 6.092 billion
U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase of 2.643 billion U.S. dollars represented 77
percent more than the 1995 pretax earnings of 3.449 billion U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Net earnings as a percent of total revenues increased to 5.7
percent in 1996, compared to 3.8 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler's worldwide factory vehicle shipments in 1996 were
2,958,800 compared with 2,673,539 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The company attributed the marked improvement to its strong
product line which turned out a wider range of models to the
market needs.
</P>
<P>
A company spokesman said that 1996 was the strongest year in
U.S. retail sales in the company's history. Chrysler finished
1996 with U.S. retail vehicle sales of 2,450,826, breaking the
1988 calendar-year record of 2,208,057. Its combined U.S. and
Canadian retail market share increased by 1.4 percentage points to
16.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Its combined U.S. and Canadian retail (including fleet) vehicle
sales in 1996 were 919,414 cars and 1,770,926 trucks and minivans,
compared with 883,769 cars and 1,505,696 trucks and minivans in
1995.
</P>
<P>

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United States House of
Representatives today voted to give Speaker Newt Gingrich formal
reprimand and a penalty of 300,000 U.S. dollars for admitted
ethics violations.
</P>
<P>
The House voted 395-28 to punish Gingrich, the first House
speaker formally punished by vote of his colleagues for misconduct
in office in the country.
</P>
<P>
"No one is above the rules," Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn.,
chairwoman of the ethics committee, said as the debate unfolded.
"Representative Gingrich failed to exercise the discipline and
caution of his office and so is subject to penalty today."
</P>
<P>
Gingrich was not present in the House chamber when his case was
brought before his peers.
</P>
<P>
The punishment permits Gingrich to hold his powerful post. The
House re-elected him its speaker two weeks ago despite of the
ethics case. But Gingrich apologized for his misconduct.
</P>
<P>
"To the degree I was too brash, too self-confident or too
pushy, I apologize," Gingrich said.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich agreed in advance to the punishment and the ethics
committee rubber-stamped it late Friday. On December 21, he said
he failed to seek proper legal advice on using tax-exempt projects
to meet political goals. He acknowledged that "in my name and over
my signature" inaccurate statements had been submitted to the
ethics committee.

ABU DHABI, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates
(UAE) President Zayed Bin Sultan al Nahyan said today that the
fighting in Sudan was an internal affair and his country prepared
to help the Sudanese people to reach a settlement.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks during his meeting with Sudan's
visiting Minister of Cabinet Presidency Amid Al Rakni Bahri who
conveyed him a letter from Sudanese President Omar Hassan Ahmed
al-Bashir.
</P>
<P>
"What is happening in Sudan is an internal affair and if our
Sudanese brothers ask for our help, we will prepare to do it," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Fightings between Sudanese government army and opposition
troops have continued for days in eastern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
The president also said that any foreign effort to divide Sudan
is "unacceptable" and if the Sudanese people can not resolve their
dispute by themselves, "they should ask for help from their Arab
brothers."
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese government has accused Ethiopia and Eritrea for
aiding the opposition forces, a charge both countries have
denied. But the rebel side has ruled out a foreign intervention.
</P>
<P>
The president also called for an Arab reconciliation and said
the Arab world should not "keep silent" if anything happens in an
Arab state.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Premier Promises Cooperation with UN Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Premier Gojko
Klickovic said today that his government was ready to cooperate
with the U.N. war crimes tribunal, but he stressed that the Serbs
must be treated equally with the other parties in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks in the Serb capital of Pale after meeting
with the prosecutor of the Hague-based War Crimes Tribunal for
Former Yugoslavia, Louise Arbour, who was paying a visit to Pale
at the invitation of the Serb government because the Serb
authorities believed that unfair treatment was accorded to the
Serb side in the investigation of the crimes.
</P>
<P>
Klickovic said that in the cases involving the Serbs, decisions
were made quickly, whereas in the case of the other parties
involved in war crimes, the establishment of facts was proceeding
slowly and with difficulty.
</P>
<P>
The international war crimes tribunal has listed 75 war
criminals in the former Yugoslavia, of whom more than 50 are
Serbs, including former Serb President Radovan Karadzic and Serb
Army Commander Ratko Mladic. So far only one Croat soldier serving
in the Bosnian Serb army has been sentenced to 10-year
imprisonment and seven suspects are under custody in the Hague.
</P>
<P>
According to ther Tanjug news agency, the Serb premier said the
Serb government had worked out its own position as regards the
court's indictments of Karadzic and Mladic. Eleven documents had
been drawn up to show that most allegations presented by the court
were unfounded, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far the Serb authorities have refused to hand out Karadzic
and Mladic, the most wanted men by the war crimes tribunal despite
strong pressure from the court and the West.
</P>
<P>
Arbour told reporters in Pale that the court would not be able
to deal with all crimes committed in these lands in the course of
the war and that some people would be answerable only to their
conscience and to God for what they had done during the
43-month-long civil war.
</P>
<P>
All that was expected of the court and all that it could do was
to investigate certain crimes, establish the facts of the case and
prosecute individuals responsible for those crimes, Arbour said.
</P>
<P>
Allegations had to be proven publicly, beyond any doubt, in a
fair trial, she added.

BELGRADE, January 21 (Xinhua) -- The training of a first group
of officers of the future Muslim-Croat Federation army has started
in Hadzici near Sarajevo under the supervision of U.S. military
experts.
</P>
<P>
The training is the first step in the complicated process of
creating a joint Muslim-Croat army which should comprise 30,000 to
35,000 professional soldiers in line with the orders of the
federation's political leadership, according to a Tanjug news
agency report from Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
The federal army is expected to have a joint artillery
division, a helicopter force, anti-aircraft defense and rapid
intervention force.
</P>
<P>
The army will comprise three Muslim and one Croat corps with 14
brigades -- 10 Muslim and four Croat.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. training plans, the federation army armaments
should be twice as large as those of the army of the other entity
in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Warns of Renewed Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 21 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that the good news on inflation
may be ending as low unemployment leads to rising wage demands in
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
In his testimony to the Senate Budget Committee of the U.S.
Congress, Greenspan said that "the overall performance of the U.S.
economy has continued to surpass most forecasters' expectations."
</P>
<P>
But he said that the U.S. Fed is on heightened alert that at
some point that the low unemployment rate will spawn inflationary
pressures.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan emphasized that inflationary pressures in the U.S.
have not yet become evident even though the current recovery is
now the third longest in history and has driven unemployment down
to 5.3 percent, near a seven-year low.
</P>
<P>
"The question is, of course, where do we go from here?" he
said. "Can we continue to achieve significant gains in real
activity while avoiding inflationary excesses?"
</P>
<P>
He said that widespread job insecurities have kept wage
pressures constrained even though labor markets are tight, but
"the trade-off of subdued wage growth for job security has to come
to an end" at some point in the future.
</P>
<P>
He said that there has been a recent pickup in some measures of
wages that "suggests that the transition may already be running
its course."
</P>
<P>
Economists viewed Greenspan's comments today as a clear signal
that the U.S. Fed's next move will be to tighten monetary policy.
Some economists have begun to believe that the U.S. Fed will soon
start raising interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Analysts predicted that the U.S. economic growth, as measured
by the gross domestic product, was expanding at an annual rate of
3.5 percent to 4 percent in the final three months of last year,
up from a 2.1 percent rate in the third quarter.
