Japan's ruling party wants to quadruple bank bailout funds
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's governing party wants to quadruple funds
set aside to fix its ailing banking industry to 67 trillion yen
(dlrs 580 billion), newspapers said Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's Liberal Democrats will ask
Parliament to earmark an additional 50 trillion yen (dlrs 430
billion) by the end of next week for cleaning up bad loans
burdening the nation's banks, the reports said.
	   Parliament has already approved 17 trillion yen (dlrs 147
billion) to protect depositors that could be used for the clean up.
	   LDP lawmakers said earlier they were seeking an additional 10
trillion yen (dlrs 87 billion).
	   But the reports said the party accepted an opposition proposal
Friday night to sharply increase the sum in order to resolve the
bad loan problem once and for all.
	   Japanese banks are saddled with as much as dlrs 1 trillion in
defaulted or risky loans that soured when the real estate market
collapsed in the early 1990s.
	   Japan is under growing international pressure to put its own
financial house in order and aid the rest of Asia, which is
enmeshed in an economic crisis of its own.
	   ``Taking into account the world's serious financial situation,
it's necessary to send a substantial message,'' Chief Cabinet
Secretary Hiromu Nonaka was quoted as saying by the Tokyo Shimbun
newspaper.
	   Of the new funding, about 30 trillion yen (dlrs 259 billion),
would be made available to help healthier banks write off bad
loans.
	   The proposals calls for using another 20 trillion yen (dlrs 172
billion) to nationalize struggling banks and clean up their balance
sheets in preparation for a rescue merger with a stronger lender.

Malaysia irritated with neighbors' support for dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is getting increasingly
irritated with other Asian countries for sympathizing with jailed
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``We should not interfere in the internal political affairs of
other countries, especially the friendly nations,'' tourism
minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Saturday in the latest such
outburst.
	   It came a day after Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi blasted
nations like Indonesia and the Philippines for showing solidarity
for the ousted deputy prime minister, who was arrested as he
mounted a political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's
17-year-rule.
	   ``We cannot accept any interference,'' Abdullah told reporters
Friday.
	   World leaders expressed shock and concern after Anwar appeared
in court last month with bruises on his body and a black eye,
alleging he was hit repeatedly on the first night of captivity on
Sept. 20.
	   He was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after being dubbed too
immoral to rule. Anwar faces trial beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has denied all the
charges, saying they were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he
posed to Mahathir.
	   On Friday, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said she had received a
``letter of inspiration'' from former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, whose own husband was murdered 15 years ago for opposing
then Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   ``I can very well understand your present difficulties and I
want you to know that I truly admire you for your courage and
strength,'' Aquino said in the letter.
	   She said she had faith in ``people power,'' the popular support
that helped overthrow Marcos three years later.
	   Not only have the interviews given by Azizah since Anwar's
arrest helped kindle sympathy overseas, but many of Anwar's
supporters have also traveled to neighboring countries to criticize
Mahathir.
	   On Saturday, Sabbaruddin, the tourism minister, condemned one
such reported meeting between an Anwar supporter and Philippine
President Joseph Estrada in Manila.
	   ``They (foreign leaders) should have been more sensitive
especially if they are aware that this person is out to discredit
Malaysia,'' said Sabbaruddin.
	   A leading Malaysian daily said such remarks from Asian countries
were straining Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which has
traditionally promoted a policy of refraining from commenting on
other's internal affairs.
	   ``In international relations, ASEAN's strength has mainly been
its unity in fending off external aggression and in speaking up for
_ not against _ one another in public,'' the New Straits Times
editorial said.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Apart from Estrada, who canceled a scheduled visit to Kuala
Lumpur, President B.J. Habibe of Indonesia has voiced concern over
Anwar's injuries and detention. Thailand's powerful finance
minister also joined a chorus of condemnation by many world finance
officials.

Counselor of rape victims in Indonesia is killed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A human rights activist who was
counseling some of the many women who were raped during Indonesia's
riots in May was found stabbed to death in her home.
	   At least 168 women, mostly ethnic Chinese, were raped during the
unrest, which killed 1,200 people and led to the resignation of
longstanding President Suharto.
	   Several activists helping the victims or investigating the cases
have complained about receiving death threats. But 18-year-old
Martadinata Haryono, whose body was found Friday night by her
father with multiple stab wounds and a slashed neck, was the first
such volunteer to be killed, police said.
	   No one witnessed the slaying in her second-floor bedroom, but
Lt. Col. Iman Harjatna, a policeman who toured the site, told The
Jakarta Post that the killer didn't steal anything from the home.
	   ``We'll investigate it thoroughly,'' he said, refusing to
speculate whether Miss Haryono might have been killed because of
what she had learned about several of the rape cases.
	   In a telephone interview Saturday, Jakarta police spokesman
Edward Aritonang confirmed the killing, which resulted in
front-page newspaper stories in the capital, but he also refused to
discuss what may have motivated it.
	   After the attack, other members of Miss Haryono's Volunteers for
Humanity visited her home to offer condolences to her parents.
	   Miss Haryono, a student at Paskalis Catholic high school, had
counseled at least four rape victims, the Post reported.
	   Many of the women who were raped during the riots are members of
the nation's ethnic Chinese minority, which was targeted by mobs
who resent its comparative wealth and success in business,
especially during the country's crippling economic crisis.
	   Reports of the rapes galvanized outrage among Chinese
communities around the world and resulted in calls for tough action
by the governments of China and Taiwan.

Analysts: Stock markets could falter with recovering U.S. dollar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; BC-Asia-Markets
 &UR; By JASMINA KUZMANOVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Asian stock markets enjoyed a brief respite
from tumbling share prices last week when regional currencies
rallied against the greenback, but analysts warned of renewed
losses this week.
	   The rising yen boosted other Asian currencies, encouraging
domestic demand and sending positive signals to most Asian markets.
	   But analysts cautioned that the strengthening of regional
bourses is not supported by a real economic turnaround. The bourses
are expected to give up much of their gains, particularly if the
U.S. dollar recovers as many expect it will.
	   ``There are hardly any fundamental justifications for the stock
markets to go up,'' said Jacqueline Ong, senior regional economist
at Independent Economic Analysis (IDEA) in Singapore.
	   ``The markets went a little bit overboard'' on the yen rise, Ong
said, adding that ``some of this has to correct.''
	   While most Asian bourses will slide, Ong predicted a rise in
Bangkok's market, which may improve on news that the Japanese
government could buy up to 95 percent of Thailand's sovereign debt.
	   The sharp drop of the U.S. dollar began Wednesday amid reports
Japan might soon adopt new spending measures to boost its sagging
economy. Late last week the dollar dove briefly to a 16-month low
of 111.73 yen from more than 135 yen earlier in the week.
	   Most Asian markets responded positively to the rising Japanese
yen last week.
	   On Friday, Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index jumped 7.1 percent to
8,506.79. In Singapore, the benchmark Straits Times Index rose 2.7
percent to 976.65. South Korean shares also soared, with the main
index up 7.5 percent on bullish sentiment over the yen's surge
against the dollar.
	   But the stronger yen hurt share prices in Tokyo. The Nikkei
Stock Average on Friday tumbled 1.12 percent to 12,879.97 _ its
lowest finish in 13 years.
	   ``It didn't take people long to realize that the currency's
strength might hurt Japanese exporters,'' Ong said.
	   A slide by regional bourses will likely come if the U.S. dollar
rebounds from last week's losses, as analysts predict it will. A
stronger greenback makes it difficult for Asian countries to cut
interest rates without scaring away investment money, hurting the
chances of a regional recovery.
	   ``The weakness that we see in the dollar is unsupported by the
fundamental picture,'' said Jonathan Hazell, strategist at the
Singapore office of Barclays Capital Asia.
	   ``Though there is still a short term chance that dollar can
experience further risk against yen, I expect to see dollar on the
appreciating trend against yen as soon as next week,'' Hazell said.

Sharks, Flames Tie 3-3 in season opener
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Mike Ricci slammed in a goal from the left circle
with 2:18 left in regulation Saturday, giving the San Jose Sharks a
3-3 tie with the Calgary Flames in their season opener.
	   Neither team could score in the five-minute sudden death
overtime. Calgary had the best shots with Theoren Fleury's long
blast into the body of San Jose goalie Mike Vernon in the opening
seconds and a closer chance with 30 seconds left, also saved.
	   San Jose opened the scoring 16 minutes into the game when
veteran Joe Murphy, who had hit the post with a long shot on an
earlier power play, put in a rebound off a shot by Marco Sturm.
This time, the Sharks had enjoyed a man advantage for more than 3
minutes, thanks to penalties on Fleury for high-sticking and Todd
Simpson for roughing.
	   But the lead lasted only 26 seconds as Calgary charged down the
ice and Jason Wiemer deflected in a sharp pass from Dave Roche.
	   The Flames went ahead 2-1 seven minutes into the second period
when Valeri Bure flipped the puck past Vernon from a goalmouth
scramble. The San Jose defense first had trouble finding the puck,
and then couldn't clear it, and Bure gleefully seized the chance.
	   Murphy had a chance to tie the score on a power play 2 1/2
minutes later, but his blast from the circle hit the post again.
Calgary goalie Ken Wregget also had stopped him on an unguarded
shot from close range earlier in the period.
	   San Jose scored the equalizer at 6:14 of the third. With a pack
of Sharks pressing in on Wregget, Mike Rathje put the puck in.
	   But Calgary came right back again. One second after the end of a
penalty to San Jose's Bill Houlder for slashing, Andrew Cassels
curled around from behind the net to make it 3-2 at 9:44.
	   And again San Jose equalized. with Ricci assisted by Stephane
Matteau and Scott Hannan.

Argentina: uproar over deaths of figures linked to scandals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos planned &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Marcelo Cattaneo, a prominent
businessman, had been missing five days when a fisherman seeking
shelter from a thunderstorm found him.
	   Peering up from an abandoned building beside the muddy Plata
River, the fisherman saw Cattaneo's lifeless body, clad in a blue
jogging suit, hanging from an antenna tower.
	   Police said Cattaneo _facing a likely court appearance in a
bribery investigation involving computer giant IBM and Argentina's
Banco Nacion _ had apparently killed himself.
	   But opposition politicians and a skeptical press haven't been so
easily persuaded. For them, it's another eerie twist to the
scandals that have plagued President Carlos Menem's nine-year
administration.
	   ``In Argentina, we have a habit of returning to these kind of
events,'' Graciela Fernandez Meijide, a top opposition party
leader, said this week.
	   Cattaneo's death is the third this year of a figure linked to a
scandal investigation. The death dominated news coverage this week,
and like the others, revealed a public weary of scandal and prone
to believe government abuses of power are rampant.
	   ``Each time more suspicion'' proclaimed a headline in the daily,
Diario Popular. ``With the seal of the Mafia'' added Pagina 12. La
Nacion spoke of ``strange deaths involving key witnesses in various
scandals.''
	   Reclusive businessman Alfredo Yabran was found dead May 20 of a
gunshot wound at his country estate. He was wanted for questioning
in the slaying of a journalist, a case that had gripped the country
for more than a year.
	   Horacio Estrada, a former navy captain, was expected to be a key
witness in a suspicious arms sale. He died Aug. 25.
	   ``These kinds of scandals keep coming up. No one is ever charged
with anything. If they are, they usually go free,'' said Julio
Jorge, a 42-year-old medical inspector. ``I'm getting tired of
it.''
	   More and more, official accounts of these cases are being
second-guessed and speculation of foul play is growing.
	   ``In the late 80's the perception of strange suicides and odd
kidnappings was assumed to be leftover from the military's rule,''
said political analyst Felipe Noguera. ``Now, the perception is
it's related to organized crime with possible links to the
government.''
	   Menem has discouraged a rush to judgment.
	   ``We have to trust the justice system. We can't jump to
conclusions,'' he told the newspaper Clarin. As for suggestions of
foul play, he added: ``Those that believe that it was murder, think
like the Mafia.''
	   For years, investigators have been probing accusations that IBM
distributed millions of dollars in bribes to government and bank
officials to win a dlrs 249 million contract with Banco Nacion, the
former state-owned bank. IBM denies any wrongdoing.
	   Cattaneo was cleared of any involvement in that case two years
ago. But he had been expected to return to court for questioning on
fresh accusations by two former bank officers he implicated.
	   The public uproar surrounding his death echoed that of Yabran.
	   At the time of his death, Yabran was the subject of a police
hunt in connection with the 1997 slaying of photojournalist Jose
Luis Cabezas, who had taken some of the few photographs of the
highly private Yabran.
	   Polls after Yabran's death showed few people believed government
and police assertions that the businessman had killed himself.
	   As in Yabran's death, Cattaneo's was the talk of the country,
and many suspected foul play.
	   ``I didn't believe the Yabran explanation and I have my doubts
about Cattaneo,'' said shopkeeper Judy Garcia. ``People have no
confidence in what the government says. It all involves so many
questionable people.''
	   Add to that the death of Estrada, who was under orders to appear
before a judge probing suspect weapons sales to Ecuador and
Croatia, in apparent violation of international embargoes. He was
found dead in his apartment, with a gunshot to the head.
	   Taken together, the deaths have left the Argentine public
brooding.
	   ``Who knows if we'll ever know the truth of any of this,'' said
Marcelo Gomez, a clerk at a coin-operated laundry.

Megawati wraps up opposition congress, promises Suharto probe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ Nominated by adoring supporters to be
their presidential candidate, Megawati Sukarnoputri promised
Saturday that if chosen leader of Indonesia she would fully
investigate corruption allegations against former President
Suharto.
	   Megawati made the pledge while wrapping up a three-day congress
of her faction of the minority opposition Indonesian Democratic
Party, which drew tens of thousands of supporters.
	   Much of the island has been bedecked with red party flags and
banners. Convoys of motorcycles and trucks have driven noisily
though the streets almost continuously for days in support of her.
But police have reported no trouble.
	   The size and enthusiasm of the numbers surrounding her has made
it clear that the daughter of Indonesia's founding President
Sukarno will be a major player in elections to be held next year.
	   During the past three days, Megawati has promised to clean up
endemic corruption and to ease the plight of millions of poor hit
hard by food shortages, soaring prices and unemployment from the
worst economic crisis since her father was ousted more than three
decades ago.
	   Subagyo Anom, a close Megawati aide, said congress delegates had
called on her to stand for the presidency against incumbent B.J.
Habibie. ``It's a historic decision,'' he said.
	   The delegates also were expected to reelect her unanimously as
party chief later Saturday, he said.
	   Suharto replaced Megawati's fiercely nationalistic father in
1966 after the military crushed what it said was a bloody communist
coup at a time of political and economic upheaval.
	   Megawati hopes to take the presidency back as the world's fourth
most populous nation tries to prevent a new round of turmoil.
Suharto ruled with an iron fist for 32 years before being forced to
quit in May after riots and protests left about 1,200 people dead.
	   Opponents claim he wrongly used his power to enrich himself, his
family and his cronies. Suharto has denied any wrongdoing and has
scoffed at claims that he has stashed away billions of dollars in
foreign banks.
	   Habibie, a close friend and one-time strong ally of Suharto, has
ordered an investigation into Suharto's wealth. But critics say the
government has neither the will nor the expertise to conduct the
probe properly.
	   Habibie, who is facing growing protests against his government,
has also promised to institute democratic reforms and to hold free
parliamentary elections next year.
	   After that, a special assembly of legislators and government
appointees will select a new president before the end of 1999.
	   ``If Megawati becomes the next president ... she has promised to
destroy corruption, collusion and nepotism. This will include
investigating Suharto,'' Subagyo said.
	   Megawati was chief of the Indonesian Democratic Party until
1996, when party rivals, supported by Suharto, deposed her after
she criticized him and called for democratic reform.
	   Dozens of her supporters were later killed in clashes with
police and troops.
	   Since then she has maintained that she is still the legal leader
of the opposition party, even though the government refuses to
recognize her as such.
	   Habibie maintains the party is legally controlled by Megawati's
rivals. She has challenged this in court.

Russian doctors to get online instruction by U.S. heart surgeon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian doctors will take classes via the Internet
from renowned U.S. heart surgeon Michael DeBakey, who consulted on
Boris Yeltsin's quintuple bypass surgery, a news report said
Saturday.
	   DeBakey's lectures, to begin Oct. 19, are designed for doctors
in rural communities in Kansas, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
The courses will be broadcast on the Internet and participating
doctors will be able to ask him questions.
	   DeBakey, 90, a professor and researcher at Baylor University in
Houston, was the first surgeon to implant a partial artificial
heart in a patient nearly 40 years ago.
	   DeBakey consulted with Yeltsin's doctors before and after his
1996 bypass surgery.

Police deployed to stop anti-Mahathir rally in downtown Kuala
</HEADLINE>
Lumpur
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Police patrolled parts of downtown
Kuala Lumpur to keep pro-democracy protesters from gathering
Saturday as weekend shoppers were warned to keep away from the
area.
	   The protest planned on two of the busiest streets in Kuala
Lumpur for Saturday, however, did not start. Shops remained open
and the sidewalks bustled with people.
	   Five police trucks were parked nearby and dozens of police
officers in uniform and many more in plainclothes milled about in
the crowds, waiting to strike at the first indication of a
gathering.
	   On Friday, police warned people to stay away from gatherings
that authorities have banned. Kuala Lumpur and many other Malaysian
towns have been rocked by street protests and loud rallies
demanding the resignation of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   The rallies were triggered by the firing and subsequent arrest
of Anwar Ibrahim, who was once Mahathir's anointed successor and is
now his fiercest critic.
	   Although support for the opposition has swelled in recent weeks,
particularly among the country's majority Muslim population, public
protests have ebbed since Anwar appeared in court on Sept. 29 to
face 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   On Friday night, a opposition-sponsored rally in the southern
town of Semerah drew just more than one thousand people, who
dispersed peacefully when police arrived to break up the gathering.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of three main opposition parties and private groups, had expected a
turnout of 15,000 people.
	   Police have warned that no pro-Anwar protests would be allowed
and that authorities will not tolerate any show of solidarity for
the ousted deputy prime minister.
	   On Friday, police detained five people in the northern city of
Ipoh for selling books and tapes containing Anwar's speeches, The
Sun newspaper reported.
	   Kuala Lumpur police chief Kamarudin Ali warned Friday that
police would ``come down hard.''
	   Rallies were planned in Kuala Lumpur and the northern town of
Penang, but there was no indication that protests had started in
either place.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, says Anwar was morally
unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy, and Anwar
has said Mahathir feared he posed a leadership threat.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired on Sept. 2 and arrested Sept. 20 under the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
trial. His arrest came after two weeks of rallies where he called
for government reform, an end to corruption and the resignation of
Mahathir.

Karpov agrees to compete in Las Vegas championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World chess champion Anatoly Karpov has agreed to
compete in the world championship later this year, backing down
from his efforts to block the tournament, officials said Saturday.
	   Karpov won the world title in January and was to serve as
champion for two years. But the Switzerland-based World Chess
Federation, or FIDE, has since decided the championship should take
place annually and scheduled the next tournament for Nov. 29-Dec.
27 in Las Vegas.
	   Karpov had said he would file lawsuits in Switzerland and the
United States to stop the championship.
	   Friday night, however, he signed an agreement in the Russian
republic of Kalmykia with FIDE president Kirsan Ilyumzhinov saying
he would compete, said Ilyumzhinov spokesman Buyancha Galzanov.
	   A statement from Ilyumzhinov's office said he was ``able to find
compromises for securing stability and peace in the chess world.''
It was unclear what prompted Karpov to change his mind.
	   About dlrs 3 million in prize money will be on the line, and 100
of the top chess players in the world are scheduled to compete.

Conservative Thai party expels members who joined government
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thailand's most outspoken conservative
politician engineered the expulsion on Saturday of 12 members of
his party who disobeyed his orders and joined the coalition
government of Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
	   As police kept rival groups of protesters apart outside the
headquarters of the Prachakorn Thai (Thai Citizens) Party, its
leader, Samak Sundaravej, made good on his 11-month-old threat to
expel the renegades, whom he had dubbed ``the Cobras.''
	   The defection of the 12 enabled Chuan to forge a coalition with
a majority in parliament and become prime minister in November
1997. He succeeded Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, who was driven from the
top post after street protests erupted over his mishandling of
Thailand's crumbling economy.
	   Samak, who once threatened to have Thailand's crime bosses deal
with auditors from Moody's Investor Service, an international
ratings agency that downgraded the country's debt rating, has been
a bitter foe of Chuan for more than 20 years.
	   By expelling the 12 ``Cobras'' he hoped to rob them of their
status as members of parliament, causing Chuan to lose his majority
and force his resignation.
	   But Chuan beat Samak to the punch last week by bringing in
another party to his coalition, boosting its majority and making
the fate of the 12 irrelevant.
	   It's also not assured that the renegades will lose their
lawmaker status. Some lawyers have said that under Thailand's new
constitution they have the right to join another party and keep
their parliamentary seats.
	   Thailand's Constitutional Court ruled it was legal for Samak to
expand the size of his party's executive board. After a series of
appeals by the Cobras failed, he did, packing it with supporters
who voted on Saturday to expel the 12 by a vote 54-12.
	   Some of the renegades have said they will appeal their
expulsions to the Constitutional Court.
	   Samak said on Saturday, however, that he won't show up for any
hearing on the matter.
	   ``I am not going to testify. We are done with them,'' he said.

Mixed race neighborhood destroyed by apartheid will be rebuilt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY108-109 &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ More than 20 years after he
watched apartheid's bulldozers demolish his house, Noor Ebrahim
believes he is going home again.
	   Ebrahim, 54, was forced out when the vibrant, racially mixed
Cape Town neighborhood of District Six was declared a ``whites
only'' area _ a practice that ousted millions of people from their
homes as the British colonial administration and then the apartheid
government took the best land for whites.
	   Now the government hopes rebuilding District Six and bringing
back its former residents will kick-start efforts to reverse the
state's policy of forced removals.
	   When white rule ended after all-race elections in 1994, the
government drafted laws to give the land back. More than 26,000
claims involving individuals and communities representing hundreds
of thousands of people have applied to get their land back.
	   But progress has been painfully slow because of legal
complexities and lost or destroyed records.
	   Only 19 claims _ covering 37,800 acres (15,300 hectares) of land
and 27,738 people _ have been approved. Land Affairs Minister Derek
Hanekom has ordered an inquiry to look at ways of speeding things
up.
	   Government officials believe the District Six project may
provide the boost that land reform needs, while also healing the
wound left by one of the most notorious of forced removals.
	   ``If District Six gets off the ground it will be a huge boost
for the reconciliation process in the whole country,'' said Terence
Fife, land affairs director for the Western Cape province.
	   With a national election looming next year, a high-profile
effort to rebuild District Six may also deflect criticism by rival
parties that the African National Congress has not done enough to
restore land to its former owners.
	   Rebuilding District Six finally got the green light after a deal
was signed in September among former residents, the Cape Town City
Council and the Department of Land Affairs.
	   District Six's fame lay in the fact that many whites, blacks and
Indians lived there, even though it was predominantly a ``colored''
neighborhood, meaning people of mixed race lived there.
	   ``Color didn't mean anything in District Six,'' Ebrahim,
education officer at the District Six museum, said proudly.
	   ``We were poor, but when we had no food each one of us would go
to any house _ Jew, African or white _ and people would give us
something to eat. We just grew up like that.''
	   This tolerant atmosphere made it a target for planners
advocating a system of racial segregation. The first removals
started in 1966 and were completed 15 years later.
	   Now gray-haired, Ebrahim he was a young father of two in 1974
when he was told to leave the neighborhood his family had lived in
for generations. Like other people of mixed race, Ebrahim was
forced to move into a specially built township far from the center
of town.
	   Just before his home was pulled down, he ran into the building
and grabbed the number plate. The rusty plaque from long-gone
Caledon Street, bearing the numerals ``247,'' is all that remains
of his house.
	   Despite occupying a prime city center site, much of District Six
is still wasteland. Its razing caused such an outcry that private
developers were never found.
	   Today most of the area is grassy and desolate, dotted by
churches and mosques that were the only buildings left untouched by
the bulldozers. Piles of rubble poke out of the weeds.
	   More than 6,000 families _ some 30,000 people _ say they owned
or rented houses in District Six and want to be resettled in the
new project, expected to cost dlrs 84 million in a mix of state
funds and cash from private developers.
	   Construction will start once all parties decide what type of
housing should be built and who qualifies for resettlement. Ebrahim
believes he may be able to move back late next year.
	   Given the pressure on space, all parties agree that apartment
buildings three or four stories high will have to be built instead
of the old-style, two-story houses.
	   ``It will not be possible to recreate the atmosphere of District
Six in the 1950s,'' said Terence Fredericks, vice-chairman of the
District Six Beneficiary Trust.
	   ``That will have to be in peoples' memories and their souls.''

Iranian appeals courts upholds death sentence for jailed German

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a
death sentence for a German businessman convicted of having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, a decision that could
worsen relations between Iran and Germany.
	   Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate
relations'' with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, said the decision.
Qassemi was sentenced to 100 lashes.
	   The decision can be appealed to the country's supreme court, but
the verdict still came as a shock to German diplomats and Hofer's
lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   ``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear
Hofer of all charges. But the case will go to the supreme court,''
said Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with Qassemi, a medical student.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, German-Iranian relations
would deteriorate.
	   While there is no evidence that the government had influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, political considerations are generally
taken into account by Iranian courts.

Thai army says it will crack down on soldiers running rackets
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Several soldiers have been arrested
after army officials found them extorting money from owners of
Bangkok discotheques and nightclubs, the Bangkok Post reported on
Saturday.
	   In what has seemingly become an annual announcement, the Thai
army said it will crack down on soldiers running protection rackets
or who are engaged in other criminal activity.
	   The arrests occurred on Friday evening as an 11th Army colonel
led an inspection tour of the night spots after receiving reports
about soldiers running the protection racket.
	   Thai military personnel have been suspected of smuggling heroin
and arms, taking part in an illegal logging scandal, serving as
enforcers for loan sharks and other organized crime operations and
moonlighting as bouncers at nightclubs.
	   Recently appointed Thai Army Commander in Chief Gen. Suraydh
Julanont has said he will make the army more professional.

Gay film festival in Bangkok proceeds after police visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Thai police descended on a gay film
festival in Bangkok but allowed the screenings to proceed after
finding nothing illegal, police said on Saturday.
	   ``I did not see anything improper and the audiences looked
sophisticated enough to me. As long as it is not pornography, they
have rights to enjoy the films,'' said Police Gen. Surakrit
Chanjuanmath, who led the Friday evening raid.
	   The Nation newspaper reported that police told the audience they
did their duty following a complaint.
	   The film department at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University
alerted police to the festival. The department's chairman said she
was compelled to do so because a professor who organized it was
using the university's name without its consent to advertise the
screenings.
	   The chairman said she wanted police to know the university had
nothing to do with the festival.
	   The Alternative Love Film Festival is screening movies with
homosexual themes from Thailand and several foreign countries.
	   Police said the festival does not fall under censorship laws
because the screenings were to a small, select audience.
	   Despite being one of the most open societies in the region in
terms of freedom of expression, the Censorship Board, which is part
of the police department, occasionally bars the showing of foreign
films and edits out sexually explicit scenes or foul language.
	   Police recently barred the showing of three movies at Bangkok's
first international film festival, alleging they were either
indecent or insulted all religions.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The chairman of the Committee on
Justice and Human Rights in Thailand's House of Representatives has
resigned after being accused of striking a woman in the mouth with
his mobile phone, Thai papers reported Saturday.
	   Police Col. Vijit Suvit, a member of the Democrat Party, gave up
his chairmanship but not his seat in parliament, according to the
Bangkok Post newspaper.
	   Vijit has been accused of striking a female parliamentary aide
in the mouth with his mobile during an argument while they were
traveling together in a car.
	   The paper also reported that another Democrat may resign from
parliament because he is being investigated for using his political
post to raise money for promoting Thai kick-boxing matches in
Australia.

Energy can play key role in overcoming economic crisis: APEC
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GINOWAN, Japan (AP) _ Ministers from Asian and Pacific Rim
nations said Saturday that improving efficiency in the energy
sector can help the region overcome its economic crisis.
	   Japan's trade minister Kaoru Yosano, who chaired the two-day
meeting that gathered energy ministers of the Asia Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum, told reporters that the ministers agreed on the
importance of the energy sector.
	   The ministers at the forum, ending Saturday, also reiterated a
need for a more predictable, transparent framework to promote
private investment in energy development.
	   ``This is not a time to turn away from the movement to more open
and transparent markets,'' said Bill Richardson, the U.S. Secretary
of Energy.
	   In their declaration, the ministers endorsed recommendations
contained in the Natural Gas Initiative, originally presented by
the United States and cosponsored by Japan to accelerate investment
in the regional natural gas sector and trading networks.
	   Ministers agreed to submit the Natural Gas Initiative at the
November APEC economic leaders' forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   ``Natural gas is a clean and flexible fuel that is underused in
much of the world,'' Richardson said. ``The initiative will help
develop the new market for this cleaner and affordable fuel.''
	   Also Saturday, Yosano said Japan is considering giving loans to
Malaysia for energy conservation and other environmental projects,
Kyodo News reported.
	   The move follows Malaysia's request for a dlrs 1.8 billion loan
in July. Japan will send a delegation to Malaysia for feasibility
studies as early as next week, Kyodo said.
	   According to the updated long-term energy outlook presented by
the Asia-Pacific Energy Research Center Friday, natural gas demand
in the APEC region is expected to grow 63 percent over the
1995-2010 period.
	   The Asian Development Bank estimates that as much as dlrs 70
billion in investment will be required for natural gas
infrastructure in Asia over the next 15 years.
	   ``Hundreds of billions of dollars of investment _ mainly private
_ will be needed over the next 15 years to meet projected energy
demand growth in the region,'' Richardson added.

Russian prime minister asks EU for food and medicine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGELA CHARLTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia has asked for food and medicine from the
European Union to make it through the winter, an official said
Saturday, while the country faces plunging imports, a sinking
currency and its worst harvest in decades.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov told European Union President
Jacques Santer in Moscow on Friday that such aid ``would be
welcome,'' said Bertrand Soret, chief EU spokesman in Russia.
	   Reports of a U.S. food aid package to Russia propelled a brief
surge in grain markets earlier this week. While talks between the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and Russian officials were said to
be informal, some say Russia is looking to import as much as 3
million metric tons (3.3 million short tons) of donated grains.
	   Many store shelves have been empty for days at a time since
Russia's long-standing economic problems developed into a
full-fledged crisis in mid-August, though the country hasn't
experienced any serious shortages. The government is planning to
drop or lower import duties on basic foods such as meat, butter and
grain in a bid to restock them.
	   Details on what food and medicine Russia needs and what the EU
could offer will be worked out in committees, Soret said. The EU
insists that the distribution of any such aid be carefully
controlled.
	   Other Russian officials, meanwhile, were seeking to play down
the shortages.
	   Deputy Agriculture Minister Vyacheslav Chervoivanov said Russia
would not import any grain this year, despite a paltry harvest of
50 million tons (55 million short tons), Russian news agencies
reported. That's down from 88.5 million tons last year, and the
lowest in more than 40 years largely because of prolonged droughts.
	   Imports _ which Russia used to depend on for nearly half its
consumer goods _ plunged 45 percent in September because most
people can no longer afford them, the government announced Friday.
When the ruble was devalued Aug. 17, it sent prices soaring.
	   In some categories the decline was even more dramatic.
Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and sugar
imports both fell more than 80 percent.
	   Many are concerned that the government has not yet come up with
a comprehensive plan to deal with the economic crisis after nearly
two months. While Primakov has been in office since Sept. 11, his
Cabinet is still formulating an economic rescue plan. The
government has said it will be announced before Oct. 20.
	   Primakov reiterated Friday that the government's plan hinges on
whether the International Monetary Fund releases the next
installment on a dlrs 22.6 billion loan negotiated before the
crisis.
	   Without that boost, Russia is widely expected to start printing
more money, which will stoke inflation.
	   Russia badly needs foreign aid to pay off a mountain of debts,
but international lenders have not been willing to provide money
until they know the contents of Russia's economic program.

U.S. envoy heads for Pristina and talks with Albanians

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke headed
Saturday to Kosovo's provincial capital to meet ethnic Albanian
leaders as part of a renewed effort toward a diplomatic solution
without NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic. Returning to his hotel well past
midnight, Holbrooke had announced he would go to Pristina later in
the day for talks with the main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim
Rugova.
	   Holbrooke left Belgrade shortly after 0930 CET (7:30 GMT) in the
company of British Ambassador to Belgrade, Brian Donnelly, the
first time the U.S. envoy was known to have included another
Western top diplomat in his negotiating effort.
	   As he left his Belgrade hotel, Holbrooke told reporters: ``The
British Ambassador is coming this morning with us to Pristina for
talks, representing his own government and, by extension, the whole
Contact Group.
	   ``As you know, Foreign Minister Robin Cook was the chairman of
the last meeting (of the six-nation Contact Group). We decided that
in this capacity it would be useful for him (Donnelly) to come down
to show a united U.S.-EU (European Uhion) front.''
	   Asked about progress in the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke
said, ``We never answer that question and, speaking frankly, we
don't know.
	   ``We are in a very grim situation, and everybody knows how
serious it is. We are not anywhere near a point where everyone can
be satisfied on either side,'' he added.
	   Asked if there was any change in the position of the
international community, Holbrooke reiterated that what is demanded
is ``full compliance with the U.N. resolution, major steps forward
on the political front and an end to the terrible events that have
done such damage to Kosovo over the last few months.''
	   After his talks in Pristina, Holbroke was to return to Belgrade
for more talks with Milosevic.
	   In the earlier late night meeting with reporters, Holbrooke
refused to say what he planned to discuss with Rugova. But resuming
talks between the ethnic Albanians and the Milosevic-led government
on the future of Kosovo is one of the key international demands.
	   The ethnic Albanians refused to meet government officials until
the seven-month crackdown in the province was ended.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the Contact Group. He said that movement toward authorizing the use
of force by NATO continues ``in a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
casualties.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified. Foley said Friday that there had been no new reports of
fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``While there has been no shooting in the past 24 hours, neither
has there been any measurable change in the Serbian deployment of
army troops in the field,'' he said. ``A large police presence also
remains on major roads and highways.
	   Citing the Kosovo crisis and NATO threats of intervention, the
Serbian government Friday put into effect a harsh decree tightening
state control over companies and independent media.

Company official commits suicide amid defense scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A company president has committed suicide after
being questioned by investigators about his role in a scandal
centered around overpayment for military equipment.
	   Yutaka Kominato, 64, who has been missing since Wednesday, was
found hanging from a tree in the woods in Yugawara, just west of
Tokyo, early Friday, police said Saturday. Police would not say
whether he had left a suicide note.
	   Kominato was managing director of Tokyo Communication Equipment
Co. in 1994 when his company's alleged overcharging for defense
equipment surfaced, Kyodo News service reported.
	   He was questioned by the Tokyo District Prosecutors Office
several days before he went missing, Kyodo said.
	   In 1996, Kominato became president of Toyokomu Shoji, a Toyo
subsidiary.
	   Two Defense Agency officials and 13 officials at NEC Corp. and
two affiliates _ Toyo Communication and Nico Electronics Co. _ have
been arrested in the scandal.
	   The Defense Agency officials are suspected of arranging the
inflated billing in exchange for jobs for retiring agency
officials.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke headed to
Kosovo's provincial capital Saturday to meet ethnic Albanian
leaders in a renewed effort to reach a peace agreement without NATO
airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic. Returning to his hotel well past
midnight, Holbrooke announced he would go to Pristina for talks
with the main ethnic Albanian leader, Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Holbrooke left Belgrade shortly after 9:30 a.m. (0730 GMT) in
the company of the British Ambassador to Belgrade, Brian Donnelly.
It was the first time the U.S. envoy was known to have included
another Western top diplomat in his negotiating effort.
	   As he left his Belgrade hotel, Holbrooke told reporters: ``The
British Ambassador is coming this morning with us to Pristina for
talks, representing his own government and, by extension, the whole
Contact Group.''
	   Asked about progress in the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke
said, ``We never answer that question and, speaking frankly, we
don't know. We are in a very grim situation, and everybody knows
how serious it is. We are not anywhere near a point where everyone
can be satisfied on either side.''
	   Asked if there was any change in the position of the
international community, Holbrooke reiterated that what is demanded
is ``full compliance with the U.N. resolution, major steps forward
on the political front and an end to the terrible events that have
done such damage to Kosovo over the last few months.''
	   After his talks in Pristina, Holbroke was to return to Belgrade
for more talks with Milosevic.
	   Earlier, Holbrooke refused to say what he planned to discuss
with Rugova. But resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and
the Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the
key international demands.
	   The ethnic Albanians refused to meet government officials until
the seven-month crackdown in the province was ended.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday. They said Serbian police and ethnic Albanians
loyal to the Serbian government were attacked, but there were no
casualties.
	   The KLA said it was government troops who were on the offensive.
In a statement read on state television in neighboring Albania, the
rebels claimed villages were being attacked west of Pristina, but
added that their troops continued to respect the unilateral
cease-fire.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified.

Report: Drug-related crimes up in Moscow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Violent drug-related crimes in Moscow have
increased 40 percent since last year, law enforcement officials
said Saturday.
	   More than 6,000 people have been convicted of drug-related
crimes in Moscow this year, making up 13 percent of the capital's
total crime rate, the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted the officials as
saying. That's up from 11 percent last year and 5 percent in 1995.
	   The report did not give a breakdown of the number of violent
drug-related crimes, but said they were up 40 percent.
	   Nationwide, drug-related crimes nearly doubled last year to
185,000, though many are unreported, officials have said.
	   More than 2 million Russians use drugs regularly, according to
official estimates. The government has said that income from the
illegal drug trade in Russia exceeds dlrs 1.5 billion.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A police helicopter crashed into woodland in
central England early Saturday, killing one policeman and injuring
another and the aircraft's civilian pilot.
	   Northamptonshire police said it was not immediately clear what
caused the helicopter to come down shortly after midnight near its
base at Husband's Bosworth, 100 miles (160 kms) north of London.
	   Northamptonshire Chief Constable Chris Fox called the accident
``an appalling tragedy which has saddened professional
colleagues.'' The helicopter service, set up four years ago, ''has
had an excellent operational and safety record and assisted in the
arrests of hundreds of criminals and helped hundreds of victims,''
Fox said.
	   The two injured men were taken to hospital in Leicester.Their
injuries are not considered life-threatening.

Counselor of ethnic Chinese rape victims killed in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A young ethnic Chinese activist who
was counseling women from her minority who had been raped during
Indonesia's riots in May has been found stabbed to death in her
home.
	   Human rights groups say that at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the unrest in Indonesia, which killed
1,200 people and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   Several activists helping the victims or investigating the cases
have complained about receiving death threats.
	   But 18-year-old Martadinata Haryono, whose body was found Friday
night by her father with stab wounds and a slashed neck, was the
first volunteer to be killed, police said.
	   Miss Haryono and her mother, Wiwin, both worked for Volunteers
for Humanity, one of several volunteer groups recently established
to counsel ethnic Chinese victims of the unrest.
	   Kompas, Indonesia's largest newspaper, reported Saturday that
Martadinata and Wiwin were both planning to help rape victims tell
foreign human rights groups exactly what had happened to them.
	   ``This was so unfair. We just hope she wasn't killed because she
and her mother were helping rape victims,'' said Ester Indahyani
Jusuf Lubis, leader of Serambi Nusa Bangsa, a group formed in June
to fight racial discrimination in Indonesia.
	   ``People will now be afraid to tell anyone what happened during
the riots. This is terrorizing for Indonesia's ethnic Chinese,''
she said in a telephone interview.
	   No one witnessed the slaying in Miss Haryono's second-floor
bedroom, but Lt. Col. Iman Harjatna, a policeman who toured the
site, told The Jakarta Post that the killer didn't steal anything
from the home. ``We'll investigate it thoroughly,'' he said.
	   Harjatna refused to speculate whether Miss Haryono had been
killed because of what she had learned about the rape cases.
	   Miss Haryono, a student at Paskalis Catholic high school, had
counseled at least four rape victims, the Post reported.
	   Jakarta police spokesman Edward Aritonang confirmed the killing
but refused to discuss what may have motivated it.
	   Police refused comment on rumors that Miss Haryono also had been
raped and sodomized and told reporters to await an autopsy.
	   During the rioting in May, many businesses and homes of the
nation's ethnic Chinese minority were targeted by mobs who resent
its comparative wealth and success, especially now that Indonesia
is suffering through its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   Reports of the mass rapes outraged Chinese communities around
the world and resulted in calls for tough action by the governments
of China and Taiwan.
	   Indonesia's government set up an independent inquiry into the
reported sexual assaults. It confirmed that rapes had taken place
during the riots, but it has yet to determine how many.
	   The military and police have repeatedly said they have no hard
evidence that sexual assault was widespread.

U.N. barges deliver food to hungry Sudanese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Barges began this week to deliver food to
more than 100,000 Sudanese along the Sobat River, the U.N. World
Food Program said Saturday.
	   The delivery of 1,244 tons of food is the first by barges this
year to Upper Nile Province, the agency said in a statement issued
in Nairobi.
	   Three barges, which began a month-long journey on Oct. 1, will
bring food to 40 locations along the Sobat, WFP said. So far, the
convoy has delivered more than 300 tons of food to five locations,
enough to feed 22,000 people.
	   People living along the Sobat receive food aid by barge only
between May and November when river levels are high enough to allow
river traffic.
	   The Sobat joins the White Nile in the Ethiopian highlands.
	   Food stocks in Upper Nile Province are now at their lowest
because people are between planting and harvest seasons, the WFP
statement said.
	   WFP last delivered food by barge to the area a year ago.

Sharks, Flames Tie 3-3 in season opener
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ If Joe Murphy's aim had been a few inches
different, San Jose might have had a victory to show for its
11-hour trans-Pacific trip for the season opener against the
Calgary Flames.
	   Murphy did score once but hit the post twice. Teammate Mike
Ricci came up with the wrist shot from the circle with 2:18 left in
regulation that saved a tie for the Sharks Saturday.
	   More than 8,000 Japanese spectators, many in NHL jerseys,
cheered every goal, every near miss and every pratfall by team
mascots. They also shouted in anticipation when rival players
squared off to fight.
	   So much for worries that the courteous, conservative Japanese
would find NHL violence a bit shocking.
	   ``Look at the sumo wrestlers. They are pretty physical,'' said
Murphy, a veteran acquired from St. Louis in March. ``I'm glad the
Japanese brought us over.''
	   The Sharks were missing contract holdouts Jeff Friesen and Owen
Nolan.
	   ``Obviously if they were here we'd be a better team,'' said
Ricci. ``Today we worked very hard and tomorrow will be even
better.''
	   Two late San Jose goals also were disallowed because the goal
net had been knocked off its moorings. Coach Darryl Sutter said he
would like a videotape look at the second call.
	   ``The ice was not quite up to our standards. It had an impact on
the game,'' Sutter said.
	   Outside temperatures were in the 70s.
	   But his brother, Brian, the Flames coach, disagreed.
	   ``The ice was a lot better than we expected. That can't be a
determining factor,'' he said.
	   After two fairly even periods, the Flames outshot the Sharks
13-9 in the third period and 4-1 in the scoreless sudden death
overtime.
	   ``We got better as we got to play more,'' Brian Sutter said.
``We have a very young team. I was pleased with the game.''
	   The Sharks and Flames meet again Sunday in the Tokyo swimming
stadium built for the 1964 Olympics, which serves as an ice rink in
winter.
	   Seeking to expand its appeal overseas, the NHL first brought
season-opening games to Tokyo last year, when two games between the
Anaheim Mighty Ducks and the Vancouver Canucks brought out capacity
crowds to the 10,000-seat stadium.
	   This time, with Japan in recession and not as many well-known
players in the lineups, Saturday's crowd was down to 8,400, but
there was no lack of enthusiasm.
	   Murphy scored the opening goal on a power play 16 minutes into
the game, putting in a rebound off a shot by Marco Sturm. At that
point, the Sharks had enjoyed a man advantage for more than 3
minutes, thanks to penalties on Theoren Fleury for high-sticking
and Todd Simpson for roughing.
	   But the lead lasted only 26 seconds as Calgary charged down the
ice and Jason Wiemer deflected in a sharp pass from Dave Roche.
	   The Flames went ahead 2-1 seven minutes into the second period
when Valeri Bure flipped the puck past Mike Vernon from a goalmouth
scramble.
	   San Jose scored the equalizer at 6:14 of the third. With a pack
of Sharks pressing in on Wregget, Mike Rathje put the puck in.
	   But Calgary came right back again. One second after the end of a
penalty to San Jose's Bill Houlder for slashing, Andrew Cassels
curled around from behind the net to make it 3-2 at 9:44.
	   After Ricci's tying goal, neither side could score in the
five-minute sudden death overtime. Calgary had the best shots with
Fleury's long blast into the body of Vernon in the opening seconds
and a closer chance with 30 seconds left, also saved.

U.S. envoy heads for Pristina and talks with Albanians

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke headed
Saturday to Kosovo's provincial capital to meet ethnic Albanian
leaders as part of a renewed effort toward a diplomatic solution
without NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic.
	   He left Belgrade shortly after 0930 CET (7:30 GMT) Saturday in
the company of British Ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donnelly,
the first time the U.S. envoy was known to have included another
Western top diplomat in his negotiating effort.
	   Upon arrival in Pristina, Holbrooke went straight into the U.S.
center, where he was awaited by three Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani , Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri. He made no comment.
	   But Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said, Holbrooke and his aides
were conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable,'' adding ``this is an intense time.''
	   Reeker did not disclose other details, but while Holbrooke is
talking to Milosevic, Chris Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia,
and Jim O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state,
apparently are working on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   After finishing talks with the three ethnic Albanian
negotiators, Holbrooke was scheduled to have another meeting with
Ibrahim Rugova, the chief Albanian leader in Kosovo.
	   As he left his Belgrade hotel Saturday morning, Holbrooke told
reporters: ``The British Ambassador is coming this morning with us
to Pristina for talks, representing his own government and, by
extension, the whole Contact Group.
	   ``As you know, Foreign Minister Robin Cook was the chairman of
the last meeting (of the six-nation Contact Group). We decided that
in this capacity it would be useful for him (Donnelly) to come down
to show a united U.S.-EU (European Uhion) front.''
	   Asked about progress in the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke
said, ``We never answer that question and, speaking frankly, we
don't know.
	   ``We are in a very grim situation, and everybody knows how
serious it is. We are not anywhere near a point where everyone can
be satisfied on either side,'' he added.
	   Asked if there was any change in the position of the
international community, Holbrooke reiterated that what is demanded
is ``full compliance with the U.N. resolution, major steps forward
on the political front and an end to the terrible events that have
done such damage to Kosovo over the last few months.''
	   After his talks in Pristina, Holbroke was to return to Belgrade
for more talks with Milosevic.
	   In a late night meeting with reporters after his talks with
Milosevic, Holbrooke refused to say what he planned to discuss with
Rugova. But resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   The ethnic Albanians refused to meet government officials until
the seven-month crackdown in the province was ended.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   Holbrooke arrived from London, where he met with officials of
the Contact Group. He said that movement toward authorizing the use
of force by NATO continues ``in a sustained and intense manner.''
	   ``The situation remains just as serious at it has been before,''
he said shortly before the start of his fourth meeting with
Milosevic in five days.
	   The international demands Holbrooke was presenting to Milosevic
included an immediate end to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces
and heavy armaments to levels before March, before the government
crackdown on Kosovo started.
	   In addition, Holbrooke was expected to press for an
international monitoring force to be allowed to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   But Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday, while the KLA said it was government troops who
were on the offensive. There were no casualties.
	   The claims of renewed skirmishes could not be independently
verified. Foley said Friday that there had been no new reports of
fighting in Kosovo.
	   ``While there has been no shooting in the past 24 hours, neither
has there been any measurable change in the Serbian deployment of
army troops in the field,'' he said. ``A large police presence also
remains on major roads and highways.

Defying police, protesters gather in downtown Kuala Lumpur

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Several thousand demonstrators
protesting the recent arrest of a popular reformer politician
gathered in downtown Kuala Lumpur Saturday despite threats by
police to keep away from the area.
	   People gathered on the sidewalks, shouting ``Reforms, reforms''
and passing drivers blew the horns of their cars in solidarity.
	   Stores and shopping malls remained open and the sidewalks
bustled with weekend shoppers.
	   Activists handed out leaflets, some holding up pictures of Anwar
Ibrahim, who had been deputy prime minister until his pro-reform
policies clashed with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar was fired from his post and later arrested on charges of
treason and sexual misconduct.
	   Five police trucks were parked nearby and dozens of police
officers in uniform and many more in plainclothes milled about in
the crowds, but they did not immediately break up the
demonstration, which started three hours late.
	   On Friday, police warned people to stay away from gatherings
that authorities have banned. Kuala Lumpur and many other Malaysian
towns have been rocked by street protests and loud rallies
demanding Mahathir's resignation.
	   The rallies were set off by the firing and subsequent arrest of
Anwar, who was once Mahathir's anointed successor and is now his
fiercest critic.
	   Although support for the opposition has swelled in recent weeks,
particularly among the country's majority Muslim population, public
protests have ebbed since Anwar appeared in court on Sept. 29 to
face 10 counts of corruption and illegal homosexual acts.
	   On Friday night, an opposition-sponsored rally in the southern
town of Semerah drew just more than a thousand people, who
dispersed peacefully when police arrived to break up the gathering.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of three main opposition parties and private groups, had expected a
turnout of 15,000 people.
	   Police have warned that no pro-Anwar protests will be allowed
and that authorities will not tolerate any show of solidarity for
him.
	   On Friday, police detained five people in the northern city of
Ipoh for selling books and tapes containing Anwar's speeches, The
Sun newspaper reported.
	   Mahathir, who has ruled for 17 years, says Anwar was morally
unfit to lead. The two had differed over economic policy, and Anwar
has said Mahathir feared he posed a leadership threat.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired on Sept. 2 and arrested Sept. 20 under the
Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite detention without
trial. His arrest came after two weeks of rallies where he called
for government reform, an end to corruption and the resignation of
Mahathir.

Bin Laden had hand in bombing in southern India, politician says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Osama bin Laden, the Saudi financier
accused of organizing international terrorism, had a hand in a
bombing in southern India last February that killed 54 people and
wounded 200, a prominant regional leader said Saturday.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, an ally of Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee, said she had credible information that some of the
accused in the bombings in Coimbatore had met bin Laden and had
been trained in Afghanistan for six months before the bombing.
	   A series of 19 explosions rocked Coimbatore, which is 1,500
miles (2,400 kilometers) south of New Delhi. Investigators said the
bombs were part of a conspiracy to assassinate Interior Minister
Lal Krishna Advani, who was due in the city to campaign for his
Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Jayalalitha said police made the discovery while interrogating a
suspect in the bombing. The suspect, Abdul Nazar Madani, was one of
four men charged with planning and executing the bombing.
	   She alleged that Madani had met earlier with bin Laden in the
city of Hyderabad, although there had been no previous indication
bin Laden had ever been in India.
	   ``About 200 men trained in Afghanistan are roaming free in South
India,'' Jayalalitha said.
	   Jayalalitha, a former chief minister of Tamil Nadu state and now
the opposition leader in the state, disclosed the information to
support her demand that her rival be removed as head of government
because of his failure to control law and order.

Hong Kong legislators divided over Britain's approach to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ On the last day of his visit to this former
British colony, Prime Minister Tony Blair faced criticism from some
Hong Kong legislators Saturday over Britain's go-soft approach on
China.
	   The legislators said the good relations Blair had engineered
with China were good for Hong Kong. But the territory's democracy
advocates said a gentler approach on human rights in favor of
profitable commercial ties sends the ``wrong message.''
	   ``The kind of message he delivered is not strong enough,'' said
legislator Yeung Sum of the major opposition Democratic Party.
	   Among the topics discussed during the closed-door meeting
between Blair and the lawmakers were human rights in China and the
pace of democracy in Hong Kong.
	   Independent legislator Margaret Lee said after the briefing that
she had reservations about Blair's subdued approach in raising
sticky issues with Chinese leaders about political dissent and
human rights in favor of wider trade and investment ties with
Beijing.
	   ``If going softly means resorting to euphemism and avoiding
sharp issues then I'm not in favor of it,'' she added.
	   Newspapers were more cautious.
	   The Chinese-language Oriental Daily said cooperation with the
mainland was ``more intelligent'' than the headstrong approach
taken by Hong Kong's last British Gov. Chris Patten.
	   Sino-British relations previous to Hong Kong's handover 15
months ago were marked by pointed exchanges between Patten and
Beijing on a wide range of issues, including wider freedoms and
civil liberties for the people of Hong Kong.
	   In an editorial, The South China Morning Post said, ``It was
almost possible to forget the long years that Beijing and London
spent locked in battles of the handover.''
	   On Friday, Blair told Hong Kong business leaders that relations
with Britain were entering ``a new era'' with strong personal
relations between the leaders of the two countries and growing
commercial ties.
	   ``Britain's influence in Hong Kong has waned, but Blair's
encouraging remarks are still worth listening to,'' said the
Chinese-language Apple Daily on Saturday.
	   Britain and China announced a ``comprehensive partnership'' at
the outset of Blair's five-day visit to the mainland.
	   The visit to China _ the first by a British prime minister in
seven years _ ended much of the suspicion and bitterness over Hong
Kong's transition to Chinese rule.
	   After meeting with the legislators, the prime minister and his
wife visited a 64-year old Buddhist nunnery between the hills of
Kowloon and the sea, known for helping the poor and elderly.

Convicted Saudi thief's hand cut off for stealing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities have cut off by
sword the right hand of a Saudi man for stealing.
	   Nasser al-Mallouhi was convicted several times of stealing and
his hand was amputated Friday, the Arab News reported Saturday.
	   The paper did not give any other details.
	   Saudi Arabia follows Islamic law, which stipulates the cutting
off of a thief's right hand.
	   Amputations are carried out in a public square on the rare
occasions they are implemented. This was only the second time this
year an amputation has been carried out.

	   MIYOSHI, Japan (AP) _ Yasuharu Imano fired a 3-under-par 69
Saturday for a one-stroke lead after three rounds in the 110
million yen (dlrs 894,000) Tokai Classic.
	   Imano, a non-winner in two years as a pro, scored four birdies
against a bogey for an 8-under 208 total at the 7,060-yard

	   American Mark Calcavecchia carded a 67 and shared third place at
210 with Nobuhito Sato and Tsuyoshi Yoneyama. Sato turned in a 70
and Yoneyama a 71.
	   Another stroke back at 211 were Italy's Costantino Rocca, who
shot a 68, and Toshiaki Odate and Kaname Yokoo. Odate carded a 70
and Yokoo a 72.
	   The winner will receive 19.8 million yen (dlrs 161,000).

President calls on reunification on national day

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ President Lee Teng-hui on Saturday
reiterated his call for constructive dialogue with Beijing in
marking the island's National Day, ahead of a crucial meeting
between top Chinese and Taiwanese negotiators.
	   Speaking to about 20,000 people before the Presidential Office,
Lee said, ``Let us push for more exchanges across the Taiwan
Straits ... to help create long-lasting welfare of all Chinese
people.''
	   Lee urged China to `reform its political and social systems and
try to ``cultivate a peaceful and mutually beneficial
relationship'' with Taiwan.
	   ``We hope both sides can begin construction dialogue ... and
take gradual steps to seek reunification in the future,'' he added.
	   Taiwan is the seat of the Nationalists driven from mainland
China by Communist forces in 1949. China still claims Taiwan as a
renegade province with no right to its own foreign relations.
	   Taiwan's top negotiator with China, Koo Chen-fu, will visit the
Chinese mainland on Wednesday to seek a resumption of dialogue that
Beijing broke off in 1995 in anger over a Taiwanese drive for
international recognition.
	   He will meet his counterpart, Wang Daohan, in their first
get-together since the two held a watershed meeting in Singapore
five years ago to begin regular dialogue.
	   To cultivate an atmosphere for the talks, Taiwan canceled a
military exercise scheduled for Monday, which would have been the
largest display of its military might for years.
	   The two rivals have yet to agree on how to resume their
dialogue. China wants to move straight into discussions on
reunification.
	   But Taiwan wants to restart negotiations on practical, less
contentious matters before moving gradually to sensitive political
issues.
	   About 100 foreign dignitaries also attended the National Day
ceremony, officials said.
	   Reflecting Taiwan's diplomatic isolation, among the participants
were only two government leaders _ Burkina Faso President Blaise
Compaore and Grenada Prime Minister Keith Mitchell.
	   The isolation imposed by China has reduced Taiwan's diplomatic
allies to only 27, mostly small countries in Africa and Latin
America.
	   Taiwan celebrated its 87th National Day this year, which marks
the revolution that toppled the Qing dynasty in China.

Polish vote to complete shift from communist-era administration
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANDRZEJ STYLINSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Poland completes its sweeping
administrative reforms Sunday when voters choose new regional and
local bodies that will assume powers held by the central government
during the communist era.
	   At stake are 63,767 seats on provincial, district and various
city and neighborhood councils, which are new levels of government
in a shift from the two-tier system that evolved after decades of
communist rule ended in 1989.
	   ``We are closing the principal stage of building an efficient,
citizen-friendly system,'' Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said in
urging people to take part in the 14 hours of voting that begins at
6 a.m. (0400 GMT). Results were expected to take a week or more to
compile.
	   Government officials predict fewer than 50 percent of the 28.6
million eligible voters will take part in Poland's ninth vote _ in
referendums or elections _ since the end of communist rule.
	   They blame the expected low turnout on unfamiliarity with local
government elections, unease with post-communist reforms that have
brought economic hardships such as high unemployment, and a feeling
that voting will make little difference.
	   Speaking on national television Thursday, Buzek said the new
local government councils would take over some decision-making from
the central government on issues such as education, roads, housing,
water supplies, environment protection and various services.
	   That would free the central government to focus on security for
the country and its citizens, effective economic policies and
guidelines for regional policies, Buzek said.
	   But some parties complain the new local government bodies will
have little power in deciding how to spend money, with most of the
budget allocations designated for specific projects.
	   The new system creates democratic structures at the grassroots
level of government, setting up a Western-style system that will
help Poland's bid to join the European Union early next century.
	   In an irony of post-communist Poland, leftist parties with roots
in the communist era were expected to do well, mostly in a backlash
against the rightist Solidarity-led central government.
	   Broad social and economic reforms launched by Solidarity after
1989 have increased insecurity among average Poles by introducing
unemployment and raising living costs. Under communist rule,
despite the lack of personal freedom, people were guaranteed jobs
and health care, education and other services were paid by the
state.
	   But the hardest-hit areas are those neglected by communist
rulers, who poured money into heavy industry and regions controlled
by the most obedient party bosses while ignoring others.

Arafat urges increased pressure on Israel for Middle East peace

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Palestinian President Yasser Arafat urged
the international community Saturday to step up pressure on Israel
to live up to promises it made under the Oslo peace accords.
	   He also complained that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu failed to make good on many of his promises.
	   Arafat was in Norway, which secretly brokered the breakthrough
Oslo Agreement in 1993, as part of a three-country tour leading up
to a new round of peace talks in Washington D.C. next week. He came
to Norway late Friday after stops in Moscow to meet President Boris
Yeltsin and Helsinki, Finland.
	   The Palestinian leader said the accords were not just a
bilateral agreement. Since the United States, Russia, the European
Union and other countries also signed, they were an international
accord ``so we need international pressure to protect the peace
process,'' he said.
	   Norway also encouraged the effort by awarding the 1994 Nobel
Peace prize to Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin
and Foreign Minister Shimon Peres. Rabin was assassinated by an
opponent of the peace process the next year.
	   The peace process has been stalled since Netanyahu and his
hard-line Likud Party took power from the Labor Party and Peres
after May 1996 elections.
	   In Norway, Arafat met Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik and
Foreign Minister Knut Vollebaek, as well as Terje Roed-Larsen and
his wife Mona Juul. The husband-wife team started the secret Oslo
Channel talks and remain key Middle East peace brokers.

Malaysia, Indonesia leaders missing from East Asia Economic Summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ As central bank governors, finance ministers
and stock exchange chiefs meet for the World Economic Forum's East
Asian summit starting Monday, the two countries in the worst
economic straits _ Indonesia and Malaysia _ will have only meager
representation.
	   Though both countries will send their central bankers to the
seventh annual East Asian Economic Summit, no Cabinet ministers
from Malaysia and Indonesia will attend the three-day gathering.
	   ``I know that they are all under tremendous pressure, given the
situation in these two countries,'' Claude Smadja, the
organization's managing director, said Friday. ``Their
participation and interaction would have been of tremendous value
to these two countries.''
	   Philippines President Joseph Estrada, making his first
international visit as leader of his country, gives the keynote
speech. He will also make a quick side trip to the Indonesian
island of Batam to meet with President B.J. Habibie.
	   The only other head of government attending is Singapore Prime
Minister Goh Chok Tong.
	   The capital and currency controls recently imposed by Malaysia,
as well as the political turmoil the country is going through, will
be a central topic, formally and informally, at the conference,
Smadja said.
	   ``It is too bad that they don't have any of the officials to
present their point of view,'' Smadja said.
	   One of the missing officials is Anwar Ibrahim, former Malaysian
deputy prime minister and finance minister, who had committed in
July to addressing the conference.
	   Anwar was fired and mounted an unprecedented popular challenge
to the 17-year rule of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. Anwar was
arrested Sept. 20 and charged with illegal homosexual acts and
corruption.
	   This year's gathering is also devoid of some top-ranking
European officials.
	   The highest European official on the agenda, Danish Finance
Minister Mogens Lykketoft, canceled just ahead of the meeting.
	   ``I am very disappointed,'' Smadja said.
	   The conference will include economic reports by the East Asian
countries, panel discussions, speeches and networking meals on how
what actions are needed to fix Asia's economic mess.

Opposition alliance claims to capture strategic airport in
</HEADLINE>
Afghanistan &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ The opposition northern alliance has
captured a strategic airport from the hard-line Taliban Islamic
militia after heavy fighting in the northeastern Takhar province,
opposition sources said Saturday.
	   About 200 Taliban fighters were killed or taken prisoners by the
opposition forces after fierce fighting close to the borders of the
central Asian state of Tajikistan, opposition sources told The
Associated Press on condition of anonymity from the northern
Badakshan province.
	   The capture of Khojaghar airport near Taloqan, the capital of
Takhar province is the first major victory for the opposition
forces after suffering a string of defeats by the Taliban in recent
months. The area is 260 kilometers (160 miles) north of the capital
Kabul.
	   The Taliban militia, which controls more than 90 percent of
Afghanistan, including Kabul, have denied the opposition claims of
victory.
	   The Taliban, or the students of Islam, are Sunni Muslims and are
mostly Pakhtoons. The opposition alliance comprise mainly the
religious and ethnic minorities including Shiites, Tajiks, Uzbeks
and Hazaras.
	   The Taliban follows a strict version of Islam that bars women
from work and education, bans arts and music and forces men to wear
beards.

Bombs on military train kill Russian soldier and firefighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Bombs planted on a railroad track tore through a
military train in southern Russia, killing a soldier and a
firefighter, a news report said Saturday.
	   The two explosions occurred Friday while Interior Ministry
troops were traveling across the steppe outside Boikatsk in the
Caucasus Mountains republic of Dagestan, about 1,600 kilometers
(1,000 miles) south of Moscow.
	   The blasts sparked a fire that raged through much of the night,
Interior Ministry official Viktor Medveditskov told the ITAR-Tass
news agency. The motive for the bombings was unclear.
	   Dagestan has been wracked by violence and kidnappings in recent
months as various religious and ethnic groups battle for power. It
has also been hit by spillover violence from breakaway Chechnya, on
its western border.

Father of teacher accused of extorting students threatens suicide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The father of a teacher accused of
taking money from students in exchange for allowing them to skip
assignments said he will commit suicide if his son is guilty, The
Nation newspaper reported on Saturday.
	   The instructor at the Rajabhat Institute, Thailand's main
teachers college, has admitted to accepting money from students to
allow them to skip class work and still get good grades.
	   But he said he used the money to buy instructional materials and
a video cassette player for the classroom.
	   Since the case came to light, other students at the school have
come forward to complain of shady practices by some teachers,
including selling students xeroxed copies of textbooks at prices
higher than the originals.
	   Local papers have reported in the past on cases of wealthier
students simply buying degrees from some local universities.
	   The scandal has underscored questions about Thailand's education
system, which has been criticized for concentrating on rote
learning and not turning out a work force capable of attracting
investment for high technology industries.

Thai opposition files complaint against academics over corruption
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The party of Thailand's former prime
minister has filed a defamation complaint against three academics
and a newspaper over an article that alleged the party is corrupt,
police said on Saturday.
	   The academics, Pasuk Phongphaichitr, Sungsidh Piriyarangsan and
Nuannoi Preerat were interviewed by Prachachart Turakij newspaper
in its Oct. 5-7 editions in which they made references to a survey
by the Counter Corruption Commission, a government agency.
	   They survey found that most Thais believe the 1996-97 coalition
government led by Chavalit Yongchaiyudh and his New Aspiration
Party was the most corrupt in Thailand's history.
	   The complaint, which police said they will investigate, alleges
that the academics and newspaper were ill-intentioned and intended
to mislead the people into believing the NAP is corrupt, said a
police officer who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
	   Results of such police investigations are usually used as
ammunition for a lawsuit.
	   The professors, who teach at the Center for Politics and the
Economy at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, specialize in
studies on corruption and the underground economy.
	   They have come under attack in the past from politicians and
also the police, who tried to intimidate Sungsidh and filed their
own defamation lawsuit against him after he wrote a report saying
officers were taking payoffs from and also running illegal casinos.

Philippine Airlines resumes international flights Sunday
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ President Joseph Estrada said
Saturday the financially troubled Philippine Airlines will resume
its international flights on Sunday by flying him to Singapore
where he will address the World Economic Forum.
	   Debt-laden PAL reopened Wednesday with domestic flights after a
13-day shutdown caused by disagreements with its largest labor
union over a management recovery plan.
	   Speaking over his weekly radio program, Estrada also said Cathay
Pacific and Northwest Airlines were interested in investing in the
national carrier.
	   ``It's either of the two,'' he said.
	   Earlier this week, Peter Foster, a regional manager of Cathay,
said the company would soon decide whether to invest in PAL.
	   Foster said Cathay is ``taking a very close look'' at PAL but
declined to comment what they have found or what stake they are
considering.
	   PAL officials say Singapore Airlines is also interested in a
possible investment.
	   PAL, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1 billion
in debt, was devastated by a pilots' strike in June and by the
region's currency crisis, which reduced passenger numbers and
inflated costs.
	   Estrada brokered an agreement between PAL majority owner and
chairman, Lucio Tan, and its largest union that led to the
reopening of the 57-year-old airline.
	   Under the accord, workers will suspend their collective
bargaining agreement for 10 years in exchange for 20 percent
ownership of the airline.
	   Leftist labor leaders say the agreement violates workers' rights
and called Estrada anti-union.
	   The visit to Singapore would be Estrada's first foreign trip as
president.
	   He will deliver the keynote address to the 7th East Asia
Economic Summit sponsored by the World Economic Forum on Tuesday.
	   Estrada will also hold talks with Singapore Prime Minister Goh
Chok Tong, Singaporean business leaders and members of the Filipino
community.
	   Estrada said he is scheduled to hold a ``getting-to-know-you''
meeting with Indonesian President B. J. Habibie on Tuesday on
Indonesia's Batam Island south of Singapore.
	   Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican said the discussions
between the two leaders may include immigration and refugee
problems near the two countries' common borders, as well as fishing
and rights to other natural resources in the area.

Syria calls Sharon's appointment `bullet of mercy' for talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli
foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle
East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister
on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of
negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
	   Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him
indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees by Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut camps.
	   ``Sharon's appointment as foreign minister is a bullet of mercy
to the (peace) process, which has stopped on all tracks,'' said
Tishrin, which often speaks for the Syrian government.
	   Syrian-Israel peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
	   Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an
informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's
government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed.
	   Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message to all those who are
deluding themselves _ and betting on Israel (to) change its
anti-peace stand _ to give up their illusions,'' the paper said.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke flew to Kosovo
on Saturday to meet with ethnic Albanian leaders as part of a
renewed effort toward a diplomatic solution without NATO
airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic, had little to say about his shuttle
mission. But his latest visit to Pristina signaled a glimmer of
hope in efforts to avoid military intervention, which many have
viewed as likely.
	   The U.S. envoy was accompanied Saturday by Britain's Yugoslav
ambassador, Brian Donnelly, a move Holbrooke said was intended to
show that the European Union was united with Washington in the
latest diplomacy.
	   Asked about progress in the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke said
in Belgrade Saturday morning, ``We never answer that question and,
speaking frankly, we don't know.''
	   ``We are in a very grim situation, and everybody knows how
serious it is. We are not anywhere near a point where everyone can
be satisfied on either side,'' he added.
	   But the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S. officials
were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement, with momentum
toward airstrikes on hold pending the outcome.
	   In another hint of possible progress, American generals in
uniform were seen coming out of Yugoslav army headquarters in
Belgrade with Yugoslav counterparts Saturday morning. It wasn't
clear what the two military sides might be discussing, but they
generally do not communicate frequently.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then headed for a
meeting with political leader Ibrahim Rugova. He planned to return
to Belgrade later for more talks with Milosevic.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said, Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and Jim
O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state, apparently
were working separately on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his
seven-month crackdown on separatist forces in the province has
ended, and the Albanian side would have to acknowledge that it
might settle for less than full independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before March, before the government crackdown on Kosovo
started. In addition, an international monitoring force is proposed
in order to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by the
cease-fire.
	   Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday, while the KLA said it was government troops who
were on the offensive. There were no casualties.
	   While Milosevic issued no new statements after Friday night's
talks, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman reiterated the
government's stance Saturday that intervention is uncalled for.
	   ``We cannot see any serious reason for airstrikes and any legal
basis for it,'' the spokesman, whose name was not available, told
BBC Radio 4's Today program.
	   He also voiced objection to the plan to possibly include a small
NATO troop contingent in a monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the spokesman said. ``We cannot understand
this.''

Woman arrested for heroin trafficking
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A woman was arrested Saturday on
suspicion she collected a package containing nearly half a kilogram
(one pound) of heroin from Thailand for shipment to the United
States.
	   The drugs, hidden in the covers of several photo albums, were
discovered by customs officers running a scanner as the package
arrived from Bangkok last Thursday.
	   Police waited until Saturday morning when Minda Santos came to
the airport's mail center to pick up the package.
	   Ms. Santos initially denied any knowledge of the drugs but later
said it was the third time she had helped ship the drugs from
Thailand to the United States, said Lourdes Mangawang, chief of the
legal division of the airport customs police.
	   The package contained 489.55 grams (1.08 pounds) of heroin with
a street value of dlrs 1,500 per gram (0.035 ounce), Mangawang
said.
	   Narcotics police seized the drugs. Ms. Santos faces
drug-trafficking charges, which carry the death penalty in the
Philippines upon conviction.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian lawyers on Saturday
demanded the repeal of a law that allows indefinite imprisonment
without trial and criticized its use to arrest political dissident,
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Condemning the law as strangling free speech, nearly 2,500
members of the Bar Council unanimously approved resolutions that
demanded the repeal of the Internal Security Act.
	   ``The ISA is an obnoxious piece of legislation undermining
fundamental human rights, basic democratic principles and the rule
of law,'' said one of the resolutions.
	   The law has come under international scrutiny after police used
it last month to arrest former deputy prime minister Anwar, who
became Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's fiercest critic since he
was fired on Sept. 2.
	   The authorities say Anwar had to be detained under the act
because his anti-government rallies were threatening public order.
	   Police detained 17 Anwar associates under the sweeping law,
enacted in 1960 to counter communist insurgents.
	   Council president, Cyrus Das, also demanded that lawyers be
allowed to carry out their duties without harassment by police.
	   Many of Anwar's defense lawyers were outraged when they were
interrogated by police in recent weeks. Police said questioning the
lawyers was necessary to investigate the cases of corruption
against Anwar.
	   Hundreds of people, from mechanics to legislators, have been
jailed over the years under the ISA on charges of threatening
national security. The police can use the loose definition to
justify most preventive detentions.
	   More recently, it has been used against people accused of
spreading racist propaganda on the Internet, forging passports,
cloning mobile phone access codes and breaching copyrights.
	   ``The abolition of the ISA is therefore imperative,'' said the
Bar Council statement.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ After hours of crisis talks with
Yugoslavia's president, U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke flew to Kosovo
Saturday to meet with ethnic Albanian leaders as part of a renewed
effort to reach a peace agreement without NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who talked for more than six hours on Friday with
President Slobodan Milosevic, had little to say about his shuttle
mission. But his latest visit to Pristina signaled a glimmer of
hope in efforts to avoid military intervention, which many have
viewed as likely.
	   The U.S. envoy was accompanied Saturday by Britain's Yugoslav
ambassador, Brian Donnelly, a move Holbrooke said was intended to
show that the European Union was united with Washington.
	   Asked about progress in the talks with Milosevic, Holbrooke said
in Belgrade Saturday morning, ``We never answer that question and,
speaking frankly, we don't know.''
	   ``We are in a very grim situation, and everybody knows how
serious it is. We are not anywhere near a point where everyone can
be satisfied on either side,'' he added.
	   But the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S. officials
were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement.
	   In another hint of possible progress, American generals in
uniform were seen coming out of Yugoslav army headquarters in
Belgrade with Yugoslav counterparts Saturday morning. It wasn't
clear what the two military officers might be discussing, but they
generally do not communicate frequently.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then headed for a
meeting with political leader Ibrahim Rugova. He planned to return
to Belgrade later for more talks with Milosevic.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his
seven-month crackdown on separatist forces in the province has
ended, and the Albanian side would have to acknowledge that it
might settle for less than full independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   After the first round of talks Friday, he called NATO threats of
airstrikes ``belligerent attempts'' to solve the Kosovo problem,
adding that he favors negotiations.
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before March, before the government crackdown on Kosovo
started. In addition, an international monitoring force is proposed
in order to oversee compliance.
	   The KLA announced a unilateral cease-fire throughout Kosovo
starting Friday, a move that will add to the pressure on Milosevic
to reciprocate.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by the
cease-fire.
	   Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday, while the KLA said it was government troops who
were on the offensive. There were no casualties.

Hard-liners reject their candidate's removal from office
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Serb hard-liners
have rejected the removal of their candidate from a seat in their
legislature for threatening retaliation against possible NATO
airstrikes in neighboring Yugoslavia, media here reported Saturday.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, with the
authority to supervise policies in post-war Bosnia, removed earlier
this week Dragan Cavic, vice president of the strongest Bosnian
Serb party, from parliament and banned him from holding any other
government position.
	   Cavic had warned Western powers that any NATO attack against
Yugoslavia would be perceived as an attack against all Serbs,
including those in Bosnia, and promised solidarity with Serbs in
Serbia proper.
	   Cavic also said airstrikes or any NATO military action would
endanger the 1995 peace accord that ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian
war.
	   Such statements were ``incitement to violence and a deliberate
threat to the security of the international community and to the
Dayton peace implementation process,'' Westendorp said, explaining
his decision to remove Cavic.
	   The main board of the Serbian Democratic Party rejected Thursday
Westendorp's decision, claiming it was beyond his mandate. It was
not immediately clear how Westendorp would react to the rejection
of his order.
	   Cavic, a leading member of the SDS, won a seat last month in the
parliament that governs the Bosnian Serb half of the country.
	   In a letter addressed Saturday to the U.S. mediator for the
Balkans, Robert Gelbard, the newly elected president of the Serb
half of the country, Nikola Poplasen, claimed Westendorp's decision
on Cavic's removal was ``unfounded.''
	   ``Cavic has simply repeated a well-known fact, that an eventual
(NATO) bombing of Serbia would be the bombing of a part of the Serb
nation,'' wrote Poplasen, whose Radicals are allied with Cavic's
SDS.

Counselor of ethnic-Chinese rape victims killed in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A young ethnic Chinese activist who
was counseling women raped during Indonesia's riots in May was
found stabbed to death in her home, police said Saturday.
	   Human rights groups say that at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the unrest in Indonesia, which killed
1,200 people and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   Several activists helping the victims or investigating the cases
have complained they have received death threats.
	   But 18-year-old Martadinata Haryono, whose body was found Friday
night by her father with stab wounds and a slashed neck, was the
first volunteer to be killed, police said.
	   Miss Haryono and her mother, Wiwin, both worked for Volunteers
for Humanity, one of several such groups recently established to
counsel ethnic Chinese victims of the unrest.
	   Kompas, Indonesia's largest newspaper, reported Saturday that
Miss Haryono and her mother were planning to help rape victims tell
a foreign human rights group what had happened to them.
	   ``This was so unfair. We just hope she wasn't killed because she
and her mother were helping rape victims,'' said Ester Indahyani
Jusuf Lubis, leader of Serambi Nusa Bangsa, a group formed in June
to fight racial discrimination in Indonesia.
	   ``People will now be afraid to tell anyone what happened during
the riots. This is terrorizing for Indonesia's ethnic Chinese,''
she said in an interview.
	   Police said the assailant did not rob Miss Haryono's home,
located near a military complex in downtown Jakarta, but refused to
speculate what had motivated the killing. They would not say
whether she had been sexually assaulted.
	   Miss Haryono, a student at Paskalis Catholic high school, had
counseled at least four rape victims, the Jakarta Post reported.
	   On Saturday, dozens of people visited her house in a densely
populated neighborhood of modest homes and open sewers, where some
people still make money by raising chickens and pigeons.
	   Miss Haryono's casket sat in one room adorned with flowers,
burning incense, her photograph and a crucifix. Her parents were
consoled by friends in an adjoining room.
	   Indonesians of Chinese descent are widely resented by the
country's Muslim majority for their wealth, their business acumen
and their Buddhist and Christian religions.
	   They are the country's most powerful economic group, controlling
about 70 percent of its private wealth and banking sectors.
	   During the rioting in May, which struck during Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in 30 years, many businesses and homes of the
ethnic Chinese minority were targeted by mobs.
	   Reports that mass rapes had occurred outraged Chinese
communities around the world and resulted in calls for tough action
by the governments of China and Taiwan.
	   Indonesia's government set up an independent inquiry into the
reported sexual assaults. It confirmed that rapes had taken place
during the riots, but it has yet to determine how many.
	   The military and police have repeatedly said they have no hard
evidence that sexual assault was widespread. But that has left them
open to criticism, especially from women's groups.
	   ``Whatever motivated the killing, we see it as a form of terror
against women activists,'' said Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, director
of the Indonesian Women's Association for Justice. ``The armed
forces and police must do more to guarantee our safety.''

<TEXT>
	   SANBU, Japan (AP) _ Aki Takamura fired a 3-under-par 69 Saturday
to share a one-stroke lead with overnight leader Hiromi Takamura
after three rounds in the 80 million yen (dlrs 650,000) Takara
World Invitational.
	   Aki Takamura, the 1996 Japan Women's Open champion, scored four
birdies against a bogey for a 1-under 215 total at the 6,226-yard,
par-72 Caledonian Golf Club course.
	   Hiromi Takamura, winless since her seventh career victory in the
1994 Toyo Suisan Ladies, went around in 71.
	   The two co-leaders are not related.
	   Nayoko Yoshikawa, seeking her first title in three years and
30th overall, shot the day's best round of 65 to share third place
at even-par 216 with Taiwan's Cheng Mei-chi, who turned in a 70.
	   Thirty wins will give Yoshikawa a permanent exempt status on the
Japan LPGA Tour.
	   South Korean Ku Ok-hee shot a 75 and was alone in fifth at 220.
	   Another shot behind at 221 came Michiko Hattori, who is leading
the money list this season, Natsuko Noro and Ko Woo-soon of South
Korea.
	   The four-round event offers a top prize of 14.4 million yen
(dlrs 117,000).

Investigation continues in boat tragedy that killed 20 people
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANYOLES, Spain (AP) _ A report shows that overloading wasn't
enough to cause the sinking of a pleasure boat that killed 20
French retirees in northeastern Spain's Lake Banyoles.
	   The technical evaluation, drawn up by a naval engineer at the
request of local authorities, uncovered that the owner of the boat
had changed the engine before the accident and had also modified
the ventilation ducts ``using very unprofessional methods,'' the
city major Joan Solana said Friday evening in a press conference.
	   The report will be handed to the investigative judge.
	   The changes may have been made to increase the boat's speed and
make it suitable to transport more passengers.
	   Designed for 80 passengers, the electric-powered catamaran was
carrying 141 Thursday when its stern began to sink just after it
was pulling away the port.
	   Two owners of the boat, including the pilot, were released
Friday after giving secret testimony before the judge, who released
them without filing charges. The court said the investigation will
continue next week.
	   Four of the 40 injured in the accident remained in a hospital in
Gerona while the rest of the French tourists were returning
Saturday to France on specially chartered flights. Repatriation of
the corpses was due to begin Sunday.

North Korea faces another meager harvest
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Famine-threatened North Korea's harvest will be
no better this year than last and could be worse, a senior U.N. aid
official said Saturday.
	   North Korea needs a minimum 4.5 million to 5 million tons of
grain to feed its 23 million people, but managed last year to
harvest just 2.8 million tons, Namanga Ngongi, deputy head of the
World Food Program said.
	   Although hard figures are not yet available, the prospects for
this year are that ``the harvest will not be any better,'' Ngongi
told reporters in Beijing after visiting North Korea. ``It may be
worse than last year.''
	   Poor harvests, economic collapse and three years of floods and
drought, have produced chronic food shortages in North Korea and
left it heavily reliant on foreign aid.
	   Fertilizer is lacking, as is fuel to power tractors and farm
machinery, meaning most planting and harvesting must be done by
hand.
	   ``Every year it gets worse,'' Ngongi said.
	   But despite the need for food aid, Ngongi said the government
about a month ago cut the number of counties to which the WFP has
access from 171 to 145, reducing the number of people who can get
aid from 6.7 million to 5.8 million.
	   Most of those receiving WFP aid are children aged between 6
months and 6 years.
	   Ngongi said the government cited security concerns _ notably the
lack of a peace treaty with its rival South Korea _ for its
decision. The government said the ban would be temporary, Ngongi
added.
	   Ngongi, who spent four days inspecting WFP relief efforts in
North Korea, said people generally looked better than during a
visit last year.
	   But he also said he could see that ``a large part of the
population is very weak.''
	   ``Everybody has been consuming at a very low level. So they may
not be severely malnourished, but they are not well nourished at
all,'' he said.
	   U.S. officials who toured some of the hardest-hit regions of
North Korea this summer said 2 million people may have died because
of famine.
	   Ngongi said he saw malnourished children who were said to be 10
or 11 years old, but appeared to be only 4 or 5 years old.
	   About 30 percent of children in one primary school he visited
were not in class. ``A lot of the children were too weak to come to
school,'' he said.
	   But Ngongi said foreign food aid has saved lives. ``A lot of
people are alive today thanks to the international community's
support,'' he said.

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Militants shot dead 17 people in a
remote district in India's northeast Assam state while a
parliamentary committee was touring the area to assess the security
situation, newspapers reported Saturday.
	   The killers were suspected members of the Bodo Liberation Tiger
Force and the National Democratic Front of Bodoland who oppose the
Indian government and also other tribal groups living in Assam, the
Times of India newspaper reported.
	   The Bodos make up nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million
people.
	   The assailants came armed with automatic weapons and attacked
three villages in Darrang district late Friday night killing their
victims in four separate incidents.The area is 1,500 kilometers
(900 miles) east of the Indian capital New Delhi.
	   Two men and a woman were killed early on Saturday, PTI said.
	   It was not clear what was the motive behind the killings. The
victims included members of the majority Hindu community and the
linguistic minority, the Times of India said.
	   Officials in the state capital Gauhati told the visiting
parliamentary team that there has been no let up in violence in the
state. At least 1,000 people have died in inter-tribal conflicts in
the last two years.

Consultant-turned-character in Tintin comics broke stereotypes
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Chang Chong-Jen, who told the author of Tintin
comic books about the realities of a China oppressed by foreign
forces in the 1930s and became one of the characters, has died. He
was 93.
	   The artist-sculptor died of complications from a cold on
Thursday at an artists' retirement home in Nogent-sur-Marne,
outside Paris, said sources close to Chang.
	   In ``The Blue Lotus'' Chang helped Tintin's author Herge, the
pen name of Belgian-born George Remi, to break the stereotypic
style that characterized his earlier work as in ``Tintin in the
Congo,'' and to take a political tack.
	   Chang's death ``turns one of the most moving pages of the life
and work of Herge,'' the Belgian-based Herge Foundation said in a
statement Friday.
	   Born in Shanghai in 1907, Chang wrote and decorated movie sets
before pursuing sculpture in 1931 at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts
in Brussels.
	   He and Herge were introduced by a chaplain for Chinese students,
who urged Herge to be more sensitive about portraying a China
occupied by Japanese and Western powers.
	   ``Chang made me delve into the reality of China,'' said Herge,
who died in 1983.
	   In ``The Blue Lotus,'' published in 1934 and set in Shanghai in
1931, Tintin rescues Chang from the Yangtze River and they become
friends. Chang denounces Western colonizers and encourages the
boycott of Japanese goods, which brought protests from Japanese
diplomats in Brussels.
	   The book, originally published as a children's supplement in a
Belgian newspaper as ``The adventures of Tintin in the Far East,''
includes Chinese characters on street signs and posters.
	   One wall poster calls for a boycott of Japanese goods, while
another, behind an arrogant American who Tintin meets, reads ``Down
with imperialism.'' Chang also appeared in ``Tintin in Tibet.''
	   From 1966-76, Chang returned to his homeland in the midst of the
Cultural Revolution and Herge's comic strips were branded there as
``bourgeois imperialism.''
	   For years Chang was reduced to a street sweeper, though in the
mid-70s he was appointed director of the Fine Arts Academy of
Shanghai.
	   In 1981, Culture Minister Jack Lang invited Chang to return to
France. Chang was later commissioned to sculpt the bust of Francois
Mitterrand after the president's re-election in 1988.
	   Lang, in a statement Friday, remembered Chang as ``one of the
strongest symbols of dignity in the face of tests the great Chinese
people have faced.''
	   More than 154 million copies of Tintin books have been sold
worldwide, translated in 50 languages.

Japanese F-4 fighter crashes into Pacific
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese F-4 jet fighter that went missing in
northern Japan late Friday has crashed into the Pacific Ocean,
defense officials said Saturday.
	   Rescue teams recovered broken pieces of the main wings of the
plane, a Defense Agency spokesman said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity. Rescuers were still searching for the two
pilots, who were aboard.
	   The Air Self-Defense Forces plane disappeared over the Pacific
just off Misawa Air Base, about 560 kilometers (350 miles)
northeast of Tokyo, on its way back from flight training.
	   Earlier Saturday, Misawa Mayor Shigeyoshi Suzuki lodged a
protest to the Defense Agency, questioning the safety of the flight
training, Kyodo News service reported.
	   Suzuki urged the agency to carry out a thorough investigation
and suspend training until the investigation is completed, Kyodo
said.

Indonesia to scrap state deals linked to Suharto family
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's state-owned oil and gas
company announced that it will scrap 159 deals it made with
relatives and cronies of former President Suharto, saying they
amount to corruption, a newspaper reported Saturday.
	   The deals with Pertamina company involved oil exploration, fuel
and crude oil imports, gas purchases, and gasoline chemicals and
catalysts for its refineries, The Jakarta Post said.
	   The company has terminated some deals and is seeking to
renegotiate others to stamp out corruption and nepotism that
tarnished its image for 32 years under Suharto, the report said.
	   The affected parties include PT Permindo Oil Trading, owned by
Bimantara, a business group founded by Suharto's second eldest son,
Bambang Trihatmodjo, and PT Perta Oil Marketing, which has links
with Suharto's youngest son, Hutomo Mandala Putra.
	   By canceling such deals, Pertamina expects to save U.S. dlrs
64.7 million and an additional 313 billion rupiah (dlrs 35 million)
in expenses.
	   ``Pertamina is continuing to investigate other projects and
contracts. So the final figure could be higher,'' the company's
exploration director, Priyambodo Mulyosudirdjo, said Friday.
	   Pertamina moves are the latest in a campaign by President B.J.
Habibie to cut ties with companies owned by relatives of Suharto.
	   Suharto resigned May 21 after widespread rioting, much of it led
by protesters demanding an end to corruption and nepotism.
	   Critics say the family abused its power and amassed a fortune
that some have estimated at dlrs 40 billion through a web of
monopolies, cartels, government concessions and sweetheart deals.

Hard-liners reject their candidate's removal from office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comment from Westendorp's spokesman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Serb hard-liners
have rejected the removal of their candidate from a seat in their
legislature for threatening retaliation against possible NATO
airstrikes in neighboring Yugoslavia, media here reported Saturday.
	   Bosnia's top international official, Carlos Westendorp, with the
authority to supervise policies in post-war Bosnia, removed earlier
this week Dragan Cavic, vice president of the strongest Bosnian
Serb party, from parliament and banned him from holding any other
government position.
	   Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Westendorp, the statement made
by the main board of the hard-line Serbian Democratic Party was
``ludicrous'' and would have no effect.
	   Cavic had warned Western powers that any NATO attack against
Yugoslavia would be perceived as an attack against all Serbs,
including those in Bosnia, and promised solidarity with Serbs in
Serbia proper.
	   Cavic also said airstrikes or any NATO military action would
endanger the 1995 peace accord that ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian
war.
	   Such statements were ``incitement to violence and a deliberate
threat to the security of the international community and to the
Dayton peace implementation process,'' Westendorp said, explaining
his decision to remove Cavic.
	   The Serbian Democratic Party rejected Thursday Westendorp's
decision, claiming it was beyond his mandate.
	   However, Haselock said, ``This decision stands,'' underlining
that Westendorp has a mandate to remove officials who speak and
work against the Dayton peace agreement.
	   ``Mr. Westendorp has used his authority on other occasions,'' he
added.
	   Cavic, a leading member of the SDS, won a seat last month in the
parliament that governs the Bosnian Serb half of the country.
	   In a letter addressed Saturday to the U.S. mediator for the
Balkans, Robert Gelbard, the newly elected president of the Serb
half of the country, Nikola Poplasen, claimed Westendorp's decision
on Cavic's removal was ``unfounded.''
	   ``Cavic has simply repeated a well-known fact, that an eventual
(NATO) bombing of Serbia would be the bombing of a part of the Serb
nation,'' wrote Poplasen, whose Radicals are allied with Cavic's
SDS.

Estrada still undecided on whether to go to Malaysia for APEC
</HEADLINE>
meeting

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Saturday he still has not decided whether he will attend the
meeting of Pacific Rim leaders in Malaysia next month.
	   Last week, Estrada said he was considering skipping the
18-nation Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Kuala Lumpur
because of his concern over the arrest of ousted Malaysian Deputy
Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
	   He later said he would attend the summit and had only made the
earlier remarks out of sympathy toward Anwar, a personal friend.
	   Earlier this week, he said Anwar's human and legal rights should
be respected by Malaysian authorities.
	   During his weekly radio program, Estrada repeated another
statement that he will ``think it over'' on whether to go to
Malaysia or not.
	   ``I did not say that I will go or will not go,'' he said.
``Until now, I am still thinking about it. A president has to think
things over, doesn't he?''
	   Speaking on the same program, Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon
said the APEC was important for the Philippine economy.
	   ``If you do not go to Malaysia, it is not Malaysia that you
snub,'' Siazon said. ``It is APEC that you will snub.''
	   ``The formal decision is, in principle, the government or the
head of state will participate in the APEC summit,'' Siazon said.

Festina to continue cycling team
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sports-Cycling-World Championships

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - The sponsor of the cycling team
Festina said Saturday it would continue to support its team while
taking the lead in initiatives to fight doping in the sport.
	   Gines Gorriz, the Executive Director of the Spanish watch
company Festina, said his company rejected the proposition that
Festina should cut its links with the team in light of the doping
scandal that plagued the Tour de France.
	   ``We want to confirm our commitment to this sport in spite of
the adverse circumstances of recent weeks which has caused a
certain image and moral damage to our company, '' Gorriz said.
``After several years at the top of world cycling, we don't want to
disappoint those who have supported the team and want to see the
racers compete at an international level.''
	   He said he was anxious to see the team return to the Tour de
France in 1999.
	   Before this year's Tour began in Dublin, Ireland, a Festina team
masseur, Willy Voet, was caught near the Belgian border with
performance enhancing drugs in a Festina team car.
	   Subsequently Voet, the team sporting director Bruno Roussel and
team doctor, Eric Ryckaert, were charged with drug offenses.
	   Roussel admitted that the team administered drugs in an
organized effort to improve performance through medical
supervision. The Festina team was kicked off the Tour and
questioned by police.
	   Gorriz said his company was against doping and announced various
measures to demonstrate its commitment.
	   ``We don't believe the solution of the problem will be provided
from long controversies of the past. We are open to united efforts
and dialogue for the future,'' Gorriz said.
	   ``In order to avoid similar incidents Festina will require those
responsible for the cycling team to take an active position in the
fight against the use of substances that can damage the health and
image of the professionals,'' Gorriz said.
	   Festina pledged 4 million French Francs (dlrs 725,000) to create
a fund to combat doping. Gorriz said he was studying various
proposals where the money would go without specifying which
organization or federation would get it.
	   He named a top French doctor, Gerard Dine, to be a scientific
consultant to help establish a series of evaluations to determine
the effects of the use of non-biological substances by riders.
	   Dine said he was working with seven French cycling teams and the
French Cycling Federation to further the medical detection of
banned substances.
	   Gorriz also said Festina will take part in the creation of
association of cycling sponsors. The main objective will be the
coordination of activities to further the development of cycling
and protect the image of the sport, including the establishment of
a professional code of ethics.
	   As to the team itself, Gorriz said it will be changed next year.
A number of this year's team were taken in for questioning by the
French police. Some admitted using banned substances.
	   ``We ask the riders to be honest and they will be forgiven,''
Gorriz said. '' Of course the team will not be the same next year.
It is not clear who will stay and who will not be there will be a
big restructuring,'' Gorriz said.
	   The three Swiss members of the team admitted that they took
drugs and were subsequently suspended and fined by the Swiss
Federation. The UCI reduced the suspensions from eight to seven
months earlier in the week.
	   The disciplines of the five French members and an Australian
were still awaiting action by their respective federations. Some,
like French star Richard Virenque, continue to deny any wrongdoing.

Kenyans mark 20 years of rule under Moi

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Kenyans marked on Saturday 20 years of
rule under President Daniel arap Moi, whose government is burdened
by financial hardship provoked by high-level mismanagement and
political violence.
	   ``We face a great deal of danger if we do not concentrate more
of our energies toward economic and productive activities,'' Moi
said in a speech at Nairobi's Nyayo National Stadium.
	   He pleaded with public employees to be patient, promising to pay
overdue raises when the government, which has a domestic budget
deficit of 152 billion Kenyan shillings (dlrs 2.5 million), has
balanced its budget.
	   In particular, Moi urged 260,000 teachers to end their week-long
strike over the government's failure to pay salary increases
promised before last year's general election.
	   ``I have been a teacher and I empathize with the problems of
teachers, but I cannot negotiate with emptiness,'' Moi said.
	   Thousands of people watched as Moi cut a huge cake blazing with
sparklers to celebrate his 20th year in office. The 74-year-old's
fifth _ and he has said final _ five-year term expires in 2003.
	   Choirs and traditional dancers performed. Air force jets
streaked overhead in formation. Soldiers in red jackets stood at
attention. Banners congratulated Moi on ``20 years of wise
leadership.''
	   But Moi has many critics among Kenya's 29.7 million population.
	   Since Moi took power, opponents have blamed him for
mismanagement of the economy, crumbling infrastructure, decaying
social services and worsening Kenya's reputation for corruption.
	   Per-capita income has fallen from dlrs 700 at independence in
1963 to about dlrs 299 now. Economic growth for the 12 months
ending in June was 1.5 percent compared to 2.3 percent the previous
year.
	   An opposition member of Parliament, James Orengo, is trying to
stage a no-confidence vote against Moi.
	   Taking stock of Moi's tenure, the independent Daily Nation said,
``the scorecard is not as good as could be hoped for.''
	   The respected newspaper complained about political and ethnic
violence that erupted in the early 1990s, then flared again last
year. The renewed mayhem frightened off tourists, cutting deeply
into Kenya's revenue.
	   Finance Minister Simeon Nyachae offered some encouragement,
however.
	   The International Monetary Fund has agreed to open negotiations
with Kenya on restoring loans suspended last year because of
corruption and mismanagement, he told The East African Standard.
	   This year's celebration of Moi Day was calm in contrast to 1997
when police fired live ammunition into the air and unleashed a
cloud of tear gas to break up anti-government demonstrations in
Nairobi.
	   Moi Day was created to celebrate the day Moi assumed the
presidency on the death of Kenya's first president, Jomo Kenyatta,
in 1978.

Megawati wraps up opposition congress, promises Suharto probe
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Megawati unanimously winning a new
term as her faction's leader. Some Indonesians only use one name.
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of
Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, was unanimously elected as
the chairman of her opposition group Saturday, the first step in
her bid for the nation's presidency.
	   A scream of joy went up in the room when the wildly popular
Megawati, the only candidate on the ballot of her faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party, got every single vote in a show of
hands.
	   The 900 delegates from Indonesia's 27 provinces gave her a long
standing ovation, clapped their hands over their heads and sang
their battle cry, ``Mega must win.''
	   ``I voted for Mega. All the delegates voted for Mega, and we
want her to be nominated for the presidency of this country. Mega
belongs to the people,'' said Pati, a delegate from central Java.
	   Megawati was not present during the vote giving her another
five-year term at a plush hotel in Bali, Indonesia's tourist mecca.
	   But she made it clear earlier Saturday that she hopes to defeat
President B.J. Habibie in next year's election.
	   She promised to fully investigate corruption allegations against
former President Suharto, who did everything he could while in
power to thwart her career.
	   ``In terms of popular support, there's not doubt that she has a
good chance to be the next president,'' said Angus McIntyre, a
political analyst from Latrobe University in Melbourne, Australia,
who attended the party congress in Sanur.
	   Throughout the three-day meeting, which ended Saturday, much of
Bali island was bedecked with red party flags and banners. Convoys
of motorcycles and trucks were driving noisily though the streets
almost continuously in support of Megawati.
	   But police reported no trouble.
	   During the conference, Megawati repeatedly promised to clean up
endemic corruption and to ease the plight of millions of poor
Indonesians hit hard by food shortages, soaring prices and
unemployment from the nation's worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   Suharto replaced Megawati's fiercely nationalistic father in
1966, after the military crushed what it said was a bloody
communist coup at a time of political and economic upheaval.
	   Suharto ruled with an iron fist for 32 years before being forced
to quit in May after riots left 1,200 people dead.
	   Opponents, including many of the protesters in the riots, claim
he wrongly used his power to enrich himself, his family and his
cronies. Suharto denies any wrongdoing and scoffs at claims that he
has stashed away billions of dollars in foreign banks.
	   Habibie, a close friend of Suharto, has ordered an investigation
into Suharto's wealth. But critics say the government has neither
the will nor the expertise to conduct a proper investigation.
	   Habibie, who is now facing growing protests against his own
government, has also promised to institute democratic reforms and
to hold free parliamentary elections next year.
	   After that, a special assembly of legislators and government
appointees will select a new president before the end of 1999.
	   Megawati was chief of the entire Indonesian Democratic Party
until 1996, when party rivals, supported by Suharto, deposed her
after she criticized him and called for democratic reforms.
	   Dozens of her supporters were later killed in clashes with
police and troops.
	   Since then she has maintained that she is still the legal leader
of the opposition party, even though the government refuses to
recognize her as such.
	   Habibie maintains the party is legally controlled by Megawati's
rivals. She has challenged this in court.

Another businessman kidnapped in southern Philippines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) _ Another businessman has been
abducted in the latest of a series of kidnappings that have plagued
the southern Philippines in the last month, police said.
	   Hotel owner Arturo Atega was dragged out of his house in
Zamboanga City to a waiting car late Friday by at least eight
gunmen, some of them armed with grenade launchers, as his family
watched helplessly.
	   There was no immediate ransom demand, police said.
	   Since last month, a Taiwanese family, a Filipino trader and two
Hong Kong Chinese have been kidnapped separately in Zamboanga,
about 840 kilometers (525 miles) south of Manila, and nearby
provinces. Also among the abducted are a Malaysian Chinese, an
Italian priest and a Filipino fish-pond owner.
	   The kidnappers, believed to belong to different gangs of former
Muslim secessionist rebels, have demanded ransom totaling about 37
million pesos (about dlrs 805,000).
	   In Manila, the national police have reported that there have
been 73 ransom kidnappings nationwide from January to September,
slightly more than the 69 recorded for the same period last year.
	   Of the total so far this year, 23 were recorded in metropolitan
Manila, including one Chinese-Filipino businessman who was shot to
death in front of his home after his family failed to raise the
ransom money.
	   President Joseph Estrada, who completed his first 100 days in
office on Thursday, has promised to stop major crimes, including
kidnappings, during his first six months in office.

Iranian appeals courts upholds death sentence for jailed German

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a
death sentence for a German businessman convicted of having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, a decision that could
worsen relations between Iran and Germany.
	   Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate
relations'' with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, the court said.
Qassemi was sentenced to 100 lashes.
	   An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected in two
days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn the
verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German diplomats
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   ``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear
Hofer of all charges,'' said Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari.
	   The German Foreign Ministry reacted cautiously. ``We are in the
process of studying the verdict,'' a spokesman said in Bonn.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with Qassemi, a medical student.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied that he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   Analysts believe that Hofer has become embroiled in the power
struggle between hard-liners in the ruling clergy, who control the
judiciary, and moderate President Mohammad Khatami, who was been
trying to improve ties with the West since he took office last
year.
	   Iran has been keen to improve its relations with the European
Union, especially its top Western trade partner, Germany. Bonn had
warned Tehran that if Hofer were executed, relations would sour.
	   Ties between the two had only recently started to recover from
strains caused by a German court's ruling last year implicating
senior Iranian officials in the 1992 assassination of
Iranian-Kurdish dissidents at Berlin's Mykonos restaurant.
	   While there is no evidence that the government had influenced
the decision to retry Hofer, Iranian courts generally take into
account political considerations.
	   Hofer met Qassemi while on a business trip to the northeastern
city of Mashhad last year.
	   Hofer has repeatedly denied a sexual relationship with Qassemi
but has agreed to marry her, his lawyer has said.
	   The relationship was exposed when the woman was stopped at
Tehran's Mehrabad airport last September for a violation of the
strict Islamic dress code for women.
	   When asked what she was doing at the airport, she said she was
waiting for her fiance. When Hofer arrived at the airport to catch
a flight to Germany, he confirmed he knew the woman, but denied
they were engaged to be married.
	   Hofer was arrested when the woman said they had a sexual
relationship. Qassemi was imprisoned for four months before being
released on bail.

Moscow mayor speaks out against NATO airstrikes in Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov voiced his opposition
Saturday to NATO airstrikes against Yugoslavia, saying the country
should be left to sort out the conflict in Kosovo province
internally.
	   ``If there is a need for resolving issues in Yugoslavia,
including with the help of military pressure, the U.N. Security
Council should sanction it,'' the Interfax news agency quoted
Luzhkov as saying.
	   The popular, populist Luzhkov has indicated he plans to run for
Russia's presidency in the next elections in 2000.
	   Russia, a key ally of Yugoslavia, has condemned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, but has staunchly opposed use of force against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Military, pirate-like methods'' will not solve the Kosovo
conflict, Luzhkov said.
	   After hours of crisis talks with Milosevic, U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke flew to Kosovo on Saturday to meet with ethnic Albanian
leaders as part of a renewed effort to reach a peace agreement
without NATO airstrikes.

Composer Anatol Vieru dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Anatol Vieru, one of Romania's
foremost contemporary composers, has died in hospital following
surgery, the Union of Composers and Musicologists announced
Saturday. He was 72.
	   Vieru suffered a heart attack while recovering from ``complex''
surgery, Bucharest's Elias Hospital said in a statement. He died
Thursday.
	   ``He was one of  the greatest Romanian composers after the
second World War,'' said Adrian Iorgulescu, head of the composer's
union.
	   Vieru wrote over a hundred symphonic, chamber, chorus, film and
theater musical works, Iorgulescu said.
	   Vieru graduated from conservatories in Bucharest and Moscow and
for 40 years was professor at Romania's George Enescu Music
Academy.
	   He was to be buried Sunday at the Filantropia Jewish cemetery in
Bucharest.

Police remove Taiwanese flags

 &UR; With BC-Taiwan-National Day

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Police removed 21 Taiwanese flags Saturday that
were hung by anonymous Nationalist Chinese supporters on
footbridges and other public places to mark Taiwan's National Day.
	   Since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule last year, it has been
illegal to display Nationalist Chinese flags publicly in the
territory. China regards Taiwan as a renegade province.
	   Taiwan has been politically separate from mainland China since
1949, when the Nationalists fled there after being defeated by the
Communists. Its national day marks the 1911 overthrow of the
Chinese emperor by the Nationalists.
	   Many Taiwanese in Hong Kong celebrated their national day by
attending private receptions and parties.
	   Defacing Chinese and Hong Kong flags has also become illegal in
Hong Kong since the end of British rule.
	   Defacing a flag is punishable by a maximum three-year jail term
and a fine of 50,000 Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 6,410).

Pilczuk beaten as Dutch claim victories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ World 50-meter freestyle champion Bill
Pilczuk of the United States had an embarrassing loss in the Qantas
Skins swimming event in the 2000 Olympic pool Saturday.
	   Dutchman Pieter Van den Hoogenband took out the men's 50-meter
freestyle just a few minutes after his compatriot Inger De Bruijn
raced away with the women's 50-meter butterfly.
	   Pilczuk, who won the 50-meter title in Perth last January made a
disastrous start and recorded a slow time of 24.27 seconds to
finish last in the first of the heats.
	   ``I've never had an horrendous start like that,'' Pilczuk said.
``I was way too slow, it was embarrassing, I go faster than that in
practice.''
	   Van den Hoogenband (23.47) recovered from an average start to
sweep past Australia's three time Commonwealth 100m freestyle
silver medalist Chris Fydler to win the final and recive Aust dlrs
4,500 (US dlrs 2,700).
	   ``I knew I had a pretty good chance, I was the only one (in the
field) who swum the 50-, 100- and 200-meter freestyle finals at the
world championship, so I knew I was the man to beat,'' said Van den
Hoogenband.
	   South Africa's dual Olympic champion Penny Heyns beat her
Australian rivals Samantha Riley and Helen Denman in the women's
50-meter breaststroke.
	   South African Heyns (34.04s), the Atlanta Olympic 100- and
200-meter breaststroke champion, beat Denman (34.99s) in the fourth
and final race of the 50-meter elimination event.
	   Heyns said her coach did not know she was competing at the
event. ``Hopefully he won't mind now,'' she said.

Consultant-turned-character in Tintin comics broke stereotypes

 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS birthdate to 1905 sted 1907
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Chang Chong-Jen, who told the author of Tintin
comic books about the realities of a China oppressed by foreign
forces in the 1930s and became one of the characters, has died. He
was 93.
	   The artist-sculptor died of complications from a cold on
Thursday at an artists' retirement home in Nogent-sur-Marne,
outside Paris, said sources close to Chang.
	   In ``The Blue Lotus'' Chang helped Tintin's author Herge, the
pen name of Belgian-born George Remi, to break the stereotypic
style that characterized his earlier work as in ``Tintin in the
Congo,'' and to take a political tack.
	   Chang's death ``turns one of the most moving pages of the life
and work of Herge,'' the Belgian-based Herge Foundation said in a
statement Friday.
	   Born in Shanghai in 1905, Chang wrote and decorated movie sets
before pursuing sculpture in 1931 at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts
in Brussels.

Trying to avoid capture, smugglers throw refugee children of Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
into water &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LECCE, Italy (AP) _ The crew of a raft carrying illegal
immigrants from Kosovo and Albania threw refugee children into the
Adriatic to try to avoid capture, Italian authorities said
Saturday. Police dived into the sea to rescue all nine, including
babies.
	   The drama was part of a chaotic exodus that brought more than
300 refugees to southern Italy in the past three days. Interior
Minister Giorgio Napolitano decried the episode on Saturday, saying
it was evidence of the ``total absence of scruples'' among
criminals smuggling the refugees for pay.
	   Overnight between Thursday and Friday, crew members of a rubber
raft carrying about 30 refugees started throwing children into the
waves in their rush to unload before being intercepted by
authorities from Lecce, a town on the heel of the Italian boot.
	   ``The crew had pistols. They threw the children in the water
because the police from Lecce were drawing near,'' one woman told
state television RAI. ``They threw in a baby of four months.''
	   One woman was thrown in the water still clinging to a boy's
hand, while other parents screamed.
	   ``We almost couldn't believe our eyes. There was a moment we
couldn't move,'' said Giovanni Saraceno, police captain in the
town.
	   Authorities rescued the children and detained the entire group;
doctors examined the children Saturday and found them in good
health.
	   Italy is just across the Adriatic from Yugoslavia, where a
government push against ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo has
sent hundreds of refugees fleeing.
	   The roughly 30 refugees aboard the raft were among 274 refugees
detained Friday in the southern region of Puglia, including some
from Iraq. Saturday, authorities in the southern port city of Bari
caught 28 Kosovo refugees.
	   The influx was a key issue of talks that ended Saturday in
Trieste among interior ministers of 16 European countries,
Napolitano said.

Hard-liners reject their candidate's removal from office
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Bosnian Serb hardliners
have rejected the removal of a legislator from parliament for
threatening retaliation against NATO if it strikes neighboring
Yugoslavia, saying the removal is beyond the mandate of the
country's top international official.
	   Carlos Westendorp, who has the authority to supervise policies
in post-war Bosnia, removed Dragan Cavic from parliament earlier
this week and banned him from holding any other government
position.
	   Cavic, the vice president of the Serbian Democratic Party , had
warned Western powers that any NATO attack against Yugoslavia would
be perceived as an attack against all Serbs, including those in
Bosnia, and promised solidarity with Serbs in Serbia proper.
	   Cavic also said airstrikes or any NATO military action would
endanger the 1995 peace accord that ended the 3 1/2-year Bosnian
war.
	   Such statements were ``incitement to violence and a deliberate
threat to the security of the international community and to the
Dayton peace implementation process,'' Westendorp said.
	   Cavic won a seat last month in the parliament that governs the
Bosnian Serb half of the country.
	   The main board of the SDS, the strongest Serb party, said the
removal was beyond Westendorp's mandate in a statement published by
Bosnian Serb media on Saturday.
	   Simon Haselock, a spokesman for Westendorp, said that was was
``ludicrous.''
	   ``This decision stands,'' he said, saying that Westendorp has a
mandate to remove officials who speak and work against the Dayton
peace agreement. ``Mr. Westendorp has used his authority on other
occasions.''
	   Cavic won backing from Nikola Poplasen, the newly elected
president of the Serb half of the country who described the
reomoval as ``unfounded.''
	   In a letter addressed Saturday to the U.S. mediator for the
Balkans, Robert Gelbard, Poplasen said ``Cavic has simply repeated
a well-known fact, that an eventual (NATO) bombing of Serbia would
be the bombing of a part of the Serb nation.''
	   Poplasen's Radicals are allied with Cavic's SDS.

U.N. barges deliver food to hungry Sudanese
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Barges began this week to deliver food to
more than 100,000 Sudanese along the Sobat River, the U.N. World
Food Program said Saturday.
	   The delivery of 1,244 tons of food is the first by barges this
year to Upper Nile Province, the agency said in a statement issued
in Nairobi.
	   Three barges, which began a month-long journey on Oct. 1, will
bring food to 40 locations along the Sobat, WFP said. So far, the
convoy has delivered more than 300 tons of food to five locations,
enough to feed 22,000 people.
	   People living along the Sobat receive food aid by barge only
between May and November when river levels are high enough to allow
river traffic.
	   The Sobat joins the White Nile in the Ethiopian highlands.
	   Food stocks in Upper Nile Province are now at their lowest
because people are between planting and harvest seasons, the WFP
statement said.
	   WFP last delivered food by barge to the area a year ago.

Counselor of ethnic-Chinese rape victims killed in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A young ethnic Chinese activist who
was counseling women raped during Indonesia's riots in May was
found stabbed to death in her home, police said Saturday.
	   The body of 17-year-old Martadinata Haryono, a high school
senior, was found in her bedroom Friday night by her father with
multiple knife wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Several activists helping the victims or investigating the cases
have complained they have received death threats if they disclose
details of the rapes.
	   But police said Miss Haryono was the first volunteer to be
killed. It was not known if she, too, had received such threats.
	   Miss Haryono and her mother, Wiwin, both worked for Volunteers
for Humanity, one of several such groups recently established to
counsel ethnic Chinese victims of the unrest.
	   Colleagues said that Miss Haryono and her mother were planning
to travel to the United States with some of the rape victims
prepared to testify about the rapes to a human rights group.
	   ``This was so unfair. We just hope she wasn't killed because she
and her mother were helping rape victims,'' said Ester Indahyani
Jusuf Lubis, leader of Serambi Nusa Bangsa, a group formed in June
to fight racial discrimination in Indonesia.
	   ``People will now be afraid to tell anyone what happened during
the riots. This is terrorizing for Indonesia's ethnic Chinese,''
she said in an interview.
	   Human rights groups say that at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the unrest in Indonesia, which killed
1,200 people and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   Volunteers for Humanity was one of the first groups to report
that ethnic Chinese women and girls had been gang-raped during the
riots in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities.
	   Police said the assailant did not rob Miss Haryono's home,
located near a military complex in downtown Jakarta, but refused to
speculate what had motivated the killing.
	   They would not comment on a newspaper report Saturday that an
autopsy showed she had been sexually assaulted.
	   Miss Haryono, a student at Paskalis Catholic high school, had
counseled at least four rape victims, the Jakarta Post reported.
	   On Saturday, dozens of people visited her house in a densely
populated neighborhood of modest homes and open sewers, where some
people still make money by raising chickens and pigeons.
	   Miss Haryono's casket sat in one room adorned with flowers,
burning incense, her photograph and a crucifix. Her parents were
consoled by friends in an adjoining room.
	   Indonesians of Chinese descent are widely resented by the
country's Muslim majority for their wealth, their business acumen
and their Buddhist and Christian religions.
	   They are the country's most powerful economic group, controlling
about 70 percent of its private wealth and banking sectors.
	   During the rioting in May, which struck during Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in 30 years, many businesses and homes of the
ethnic Chinese minority were targeted by mobs.
	   Reports that mass rapes had occurred outraged Chinese
communities around the world and resulted in calls for tough action
by the governments of China and Taiwan.
	   Indonesia's government set up an independent inquiry into the
reported sexual assaults. It confirmed that rapes had taken place
during the riots, but it has yet to determine how many.
	   The military and police have repeatedly said they have no hard
evidence that sexual assault was widespread. But that has left them
open to criticism, especially from women's groups.
	   ``Whatever motivated the killing, we see it as a form of terror
against women activists,'' said Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, director
of the Indonesian Women's Association for Justice. ``The armed
forces and police must do more to guarantee our safety.''

Five dead in violence; dozens of militants reported killed
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RACHID KHIARI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Militant attacks and a bomb explosion
have left five people dead, while an army offensive has left dozens
of militant fighters dead, residents and independent press reported
Saturday.
	   As Algeria prepared for early presidential elections slated for
February, both the military and the Muslim militants have stepped
up their attacks in recent weeks in this petroleum-rich North
African nation.
	   In the latest violence, an armed group posing as police at a
roadblock stopped a truck carrying furniture and slit the throats
of three people inside before setting it on fire, local residents
said on condition of anonymity.
	   The incident Thursday took place outside El Affroun, 30 kms (18
miles) south of Algiers, they said.
	   In Blida, 50 kms (30 miles) south of the capital, the body of a
man whose throat was slit was found Thursday at a taxi stand near a
bus station, the newspaper Liberte reported.
	   Meanwhile, a bomb exploded while local civil guards were trying
to dismantle it in Tafessera, near the western town of Tlemcen on
the Moroccan border. The blast killed one of them and injured six
others.
	   A homemade bomb buried in the ground exploded Thursday near the
entrance of a technical school in the western city of Arzew, the
main port for Algeria's natural gas pipelines. One student was
injured, school officials said.
	   Authorities remained silent about army sweeps in three regions
over the past month, though informed sources and independent
newspapers reported several dozen militants were killed in the
operations. There was no word on army losses.
	   About a dozen ``katibates,'' or cells of the Armed Islamic Group
were encircled in the regions of Saida in the southwest, Babors in
the southeast and Bedjaia in northcentral Algeria.
	   The nearly 7-year-old insurgency has left more than 75,000
people dead since the military-backed government canceled January
1992 elections the Islamic Salvation Front was tipped to win.
	   President Liamine Zeroual has announced early presidential
elections to be held by February and that he was not running. The
move was seen as the result of pressure by hardliners on Zeroual, a
retired general who had sought talks with militants.

Zimbabwe second innings 293 all out on fourth day of India cricket
</HEADLINE>
test &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe slumped from 219-2 overnight to
a total of 293 Saturday on the fourth morning of their one-off
cricket Test against India.
	   The Zimbabweans began the day with an overall lead of 160 and
eight wickets in hand. But from this dominant position they added
only a further 74 runs as all those wickets disappeared before
lunch.
	   India now need 235 to win and break their drought in overseas
Test match victories. They have won only once outside India in 12
years.
	   If they fail to reach the target, Zimbabwe will chalk up only
their second victory since they were granted Test nation status in
1992. They have beaten only Pakistan in Harare.
	   The day began with such promise for the home side. But within
minutes they were in trouble. Night watchman Henry Olonga failed to
add to his score and Gavin Rennie was out first ball, bringing two
very quick scalps for Harbhajan Singh.
	   Rennie had been forced to retire hurt just before stumps Friday
when he was hit on the head by a ball from Javagal Srinath. He had
84 on the board and a potential century was in sight. But it was
not to be.
	   Alastair Campbell and Andy Flower engineered a partial recovery
but when Campbell was out for 25, Flower rapidly ran out of
partners. Flower was unbeaten on 41 and if somebody had stayed with
him, Zimbabwe would have been much better placed.
	   The last five Zimbabwe batsmen managed only nine runs between
them. The Indian spinners Anil Kumble and Singh had done the early
damage and they finished with 4-87 and 3-64 respectively, then
Srinath delivered the coup de grace by trapping Adam Huckle leg
before for one run in the pre-lunch over and uprooting Mpumulalo
Mbangwa's middle stump two balls later.
	   The target of 235 looks well within India's grasp, especially
with Sachin Tendulkar and Mohamad Azharuddin overdue for high
scores. But this Test has been full of surprises and upsets and
although the wicket is placid it could go either way.

Sri Lanka's opposition says more than 1500 soldiers killed in
</HEADLINE>
battle &QL; 
 &UR; EDS : This story was cleared by the Sri Lankan censor with minor
changes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ More than 1,500 government soldiers
were killed and 2,000 wounded when Tamil Tiger rebels attacked a
military garrison in northern Sri Lanka two weeks ago, an
opposition leader says.
	   The government listed a total of 186 soldiers as killed after
the rebels attacked the northern town of Kilinochchi on Sept. 27,
and another 789 as missing in action. The missing are likely among
the hundreds of bodies the military had recovered but has yet to
identify.
	   Ranil Wickremasinghe accused the government of launching
military campaigns for political gains without heeding military
strategists' advice. He told parliament on Friday that a large
number of weapons, eight troop carriers and 75 vehicles were
captured by the rebels.
	   The rebels captured Kilinochchi, but government soldiers
captured Mankulam, a town which sits astride a vital junction of an
east-west road. Kilinochchi is 170 miles (275 kilometers) north of
Colombo, and Mankulam is 30 kilometers (18 miles) south of
Kilinochchi.
	   The military claimed that it killed at least 717 rebels in
Kilinochchi and another 100 in the battle for Mankulam. The
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam said last week it lost 300
fighters.
	   Mankulam and Kilinochchi are strategically located along the
only road linking the military-held northern Jaffna Peninsula to
the mainland.
	   Government soldiers have captured two thirds of the highway in
an offensive launched in May 1997. The highway's capture will allow
the government to transport supplies to the northern peninsula
overland instead of by air and sea.
	   Wickremasinghe also asked the government to end news censorship
on war reports. The government bars reporters from visiting the
battle zone and the military censors reports about the fighting.
	   The rebels are fighting for a homeland for minority Tamils. They
claim discrimination by the majority Sinhalese, who dominate the
military and government.

200 Russian, CIS troops killed since 1993 in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ At least 202 troops with the Russian-led border
force in Tajikistan have been killed since it was deployed in 1993,
its commander said Saturday.
	   Speaking on the fifth anniversary of the force, Lt. Gen. Nikolai
Pugachev said there were no plans to reduce its size, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The Commonwealth of Independent States, a loose coalition of
former Soviet republics, maintains some 20,000 border guards along
Tajikistan's border with Afghanistan, mainly to block Tajik forces
opposed to the pro-Moscow government in Dushanbe. There are
frequent clashes with the Tajik opposition forces and heroin
smugglers based in Afghanistan.
	   The force has aided in the return of 10,000 refugees and
transported 5,000 tons (5,500 short tons) of humanitarian aid to
mountainous districts over the past five years, Pugachev said.

NATO says Serbs not complying, time running out
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo BRU101 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said Saturday that Serb forces were not meeting international
demands for a withdrawal from Kosovo and warned the alliance was
close to giving the order to launch air strikes.
	   ``There is still no compliance on the ground,'' Solana told
reporters after a meeting with ambassadors from the 16 NATO allies.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act.''
	   He said the ambassadors had ``cleared all the decisions that
need to be taken'' prior to an ``activation order'' that would
authorize NATO's military commander to launch air raids against
Serbia.
	   NATO officials said those decisions included agreements on rules
of engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations
working in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   Final approval of the air strike order is being held up by
constitutional procedures in some NATO allies, notably Germany
where the cabinet is to discuss the issue Monday and Italy
following the collapse of the government Friday.
	   Despite those delays, NATO officials said the activation order
would come in the coming days if the ongoing mission to Serbia by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke fails to produce a diplomatic
solution.
	   Solana said he was in close touch with Holbrooke and that NATO's
continued preparations for strikes were helping his negotiating
efforts. ``What we have done today is a very important boost for
Dick Holbrooke,'' Solana said.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Favorite Bangladesh reached the final of
a 10-nation Asian cricket tournament Saturday, defeating the United
Arab Emirates by six wickets in a low-scoring semifinal.
	   The UAE won the toss and decided to bat first but struggled
through its innings, scoring 103 runs in 46.4 overs _ their lowest
total in the tournament. Bangladesh's Mohammed Rafique picked up
three wickets.
	   Bangladesh began slowly, scoring only 10 runs in 10 overs. But
its batsmen quickly made up for lost time with some big hits,
scoring 106 runs in 32 overs for four wickets.
	   Rafique was declared the man of the match.
	   Hong Kong faces Malaysia in another semifinal Sunday. The winner
of that match will face Bangladesh in the final on Tuesday.
	   Ten national teams from across Asia _ Malaysia, Bangladesh,
Thailand, Papua New Guinea, the Maldives, Singapore, United Arab
Emirates, Hong Kong, Japan and Nepal _ are taking part in the
tournament.
	   Play began last Saturday and the winner will get a chance to
play at the Asian Cup in Bangladesh against other cricket giants
later this year.

	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A new civilian airport opened
on Saturday on what is part of the main base of American troops
serving in the NATO-led peace force in northern Bosnia.
	   The opening was in accordance with a memorandum of understanding
signed last year between Bosnian authorities and the U.S. peace
contingent. It provided for turning a part of the base near Tuzla
into a civilian, international airport.
	   While American engineers reconstructed and improved the tarmac
so that it can receive even the biggest planes, the regional Tuzla
government invested dlrs 1.5 million to build the airport terminal
and the necessary infrastructure. Reconstruction work took six
months.
	   Additional equipment was donated by the U.S. government and the
Frankfurt and Sarajevo airports, while Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
helped with the new airport terminal, said Mustafa Terzic, the
director of Tuzla airport.
	   ``We here were always a part of the World, but used detours when
traveling ...,'' Terzic said. ``This airport will bring us closer
to the world and the world closer to us.''
	   Local officials said they expect the airport to help rebuild the
war-torn economy in the region.
	   Before the 1992-95 Bosnian war, the airfield and surrounding
compound, 16 kilometers (10 miles) east of Tuzla, was a military
airport for the Yugoslav army. During the war it became a base for
U.N. peacekeepers.
	   A Bosnian Air plane carrying Bosnian government officials and
journalists was the first to land and officially open Tuzla airport
shortly after noon Saturday. More than 100 guests attended the
ceremony.
	   For the time being, American air controllers will remain in
charge of flights into and out of Tuzla, with weekly connections to
Hungary and Turkey.
	   Tuzla is the fourth civilian airport in Bosnia in addition to
airports in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, northwestern Banja Luka
and in the southern town of Mostar.

Mandela: White farmers could limit killings by improving conditions

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela told
white farmers on Saturday that improving conditions for black
workers could work as a self-defense strategy against a spate of
killings in farming communities.
	   Speaking at a summit addressing the violence, Mandela said that
some of the attacks were motivated by revenge for exploitation of
farmhands who continue to toil under apartheid-era conditions.
	   ``Elimination of poverty and inequality are the surest long-term
guarantee to eliminating crime, instability and intra-communal
tensions,'' Mandela said.
	   About 80 white farmers have been killed so far this year,
fueling charges by the mainly white, conservative opposition
parties that Mandela's government isn't concerned enough about the
victims because of their color.
	   In the most recent attack, an elderly farm couple died Friday of
axe wounds in their heads near Bloemfontein, about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) south of Johannesburg.
	   Since 1994, nearly 600 farmers have died in such attacks.
Mandela said that in addition to the human suffering it caused, the
violence could disrupt the country's ability to feed itself.
	   In an attempt to head off an increase in white vigilante groups,
the government has created a rural security response system that
includes volunteer commandos from the farms.
	   Mandela said that black workers should also be included as
commandos, but doubted their willingness to defend farmsteads where
they suffer low pay, squalid living conditions and abuse. When some
black workers are too old for field labor, they are often chased
off the farm but have nowhere to go.
	   ``The conditions under which (black workers) live do affect the
way they respond in the event of an attack,'' Mandela said.
	   Although the government has passed laws guaranteeing residency
rights to farm laborers, many workers are unaware of their rights,
farm worker groups say.
	   ``We do not believe that farm workers are responsible for the
violence against farm owners but, under different circumstances,
they could become part of the solution,'' said a statement from the
Nkuzi Development Association that handed out leaflets at the
summit.
	   Mandela, 80, broke doctor's orders to rest and recuperate from a
bout with exhaustion in order to deliver the 30 minute speech.
	   He spoke partly in Afrikaans, the language of descendants of
Dutch and other European settlers spoken widely in rural areas, to
reassure farmers that ``there is definitely no political campaign
or attempt to drive whites, especially Afrikaners, from their
land.''
	   The South African Agricultural Union, the National African
Farmers Union, and most major government ministries participated in
the meeting.
	   Mandela was convinced that South Africans will solve the rural
violence.
	   ``Both black and white, Afrikaans- and English- speakers, have
worked to confound the prophets of doom who predicted the political
change could not occur without rivers of blood flowing,'' Mandela
said.
	   Mandela was elected in 1994's first all-race elections that
ended apartheid.

Iraqi official reports to crown prince on U.N. talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister met Crown
Prince Hassan of Jordan Saturday to brief him on his talks with
U.N. officials on resolving the crisis over weapons inspections.
	   The meeting came as the minister, Tariq Aziz, arrived from the
United Nations in New York en route home. Hassan is acting as
regent while King Hussein receives cancer treatment abroad.
	   The state-run Petra News Agency said Hassan reiterated a call
for ``a swift closure of the file of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction in line with related U.N. resolutions, lifting the
sanctions on Baghdad and ending the suffering of the Iraqi
people.''
	   On Aug. 5, Iraq said it was ending cooperation with the U.N.
weapons teams because their chief, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move ended spot inspections of suspected weapons sites
because U.N. experts must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   U.N. experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.

Counselor of ethnic-Chinese rape victims killed in Indonesia

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A teen-age activist who was counseling
women raped during Indonesia's riots in May was found stabbed to
death in her home, police said Saturday.
	   The body of 17-year-old Martadinata Haryono, a high school
senior, was found in her bedroom Friday night by her father with
multiple knife wounds and a slashed neck.
	   Several activists helping the victims or investigating the cases
have complained they have received death threats.
	   But Maj. Gen. Pol Noegroho Djajoesman, the chief of Jakarta
police, was quoted as saying by the official Antara news agency
that police have found no evidence that the motive for her slaying
lay in her work.
	   Police say that Miss Haryono was the first volunteer to be
killed and that her home in downtown Jakarta was not robbed. It was
not known if she, too, had received threats.
	   Antara quoted the medical doctor who conducted the autopsy as
saying that preliminary examinations showed signs of a sexual
assault.
	   ``There were 10 wounds on her body and her head was almost cut
off at the throat,'' Dr. Mun'im Idris, who led the autopsy at
Jakarta's main hospital, was quoted as saying.
	   Police refused to comment on the report.
	   Miss Haryono and her mother, Wiwin, both worked for Volunteers
for Humanity, one of several such groups recently established to
counsel ethnic Chinese victims of the unrest.
	   Colleagues said that Miss Haryono, who was also an ethnic
Chinese, was planning to travel to the United States with her
mother and some victims prepared to testify about the rapes to a
human rights group.
	   ``This was so unfair. We just hope she wasn't killed because she
and her mother were helping rape victims,'' said Ester Indahyani
Jusuf Lubis, leader of Serambi Nusa Bangsa, a group formed in June
to fight racial discrimination in Indonesia.
	   ``People will now be afraid to tell anyone what happened during
the riots. This is terrorizing for Indonesia's ethnic Chinese,''
she said in an interview.
	   Human rights groups say that at least 168 women, mostly ethnic
Chinese, were raped during the unrest in Indonesia, which killed
1,200 people and led to the resignation of President Suharto.
	   Volunteers for Humanity was one of the first groups to report
that ethnic Chinese women and girls had been gang-raped during the
riots in Jakarta and other Indonesian cities.
	   Miss Haryono, a student at Paskalis Catholic high school, had
counseled at least four rape victims, the Jakarta Post reported.
	   On Saturday, dozens of people visited her house in a densely
populated neighborhood of modest homes and open sewers, where some
people still make money by raising chickens and pigeons.
	   Miss Haryono's casket sat in one room adorned with flowers,
burning incense, her photograph and a crucifix. Her parents were
consoled by friends in an adjoining room.
	   Indonesians of Chinese descent are widely resented by the
country's Muslim majority for their wealth, their business acumen
and their Buddhist and Christian religions.
	   They are the country's most powerful economic group, controlling
about 70 percent of its private wealth and banking sectors.
	   During the rioting, which struck during Indonesia's worst
economic crisis in 30 years, many businesses and homes of the
ethnic Chinese minority were targeted by mobs.
	   Reports that mass rapes had occurred outraged Chinese
communities around the world and resulted in calls for tough action
by the governments of China and Taiwan.
	   Indonesia's government set up an independent inquiry into the
reported sexual assaults. It confirmed that rapes had taken place
during the riots, but it has yet to determine how many.
	   The military and police have repeatedly said they have no hard
evidence that sexual assault was widespread. But that has left them
open to criticism, especially from women's groups.
	   ``Whatever motivated the killing, we see it as a form of terror
against women activists,'' said Nursyahbani Katjasungkana, director
of the Indonesian Women's Association for Justice. ``The armed
forces and police must do more to guarantee our safety.''

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard
Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Kosovo on Saturday, meeting
with ethnic Albanian leaders as part of a renewed effort toward a
diplomatic solution without NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who talked into the early hours Saturday with
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade and planned more talks with the
Yugoslav president later, had little to say about his mission after
several hours of talks in Pristina. But his stepped-up diplomacy
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid military
intervention.
	   Showing that the European Union is united with Washington in the
latest mission, Holbrooke was accompanied to Kosovo by Britain's
Yugoslav ambassador, Brian Donnelly.
	   Asked whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an
agreement can be reached, the U.S. envoy said in Pristina: ``We
always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody wants to
have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   ``On the other hand, the United Nations resolution is very clear
and ... the Yugoslav government is not in compliance with that
resolution,'' he said.
	   Standing by and waiting to issue a final attack authorization is
NATO, where Secretary-General Javier Solana assured that
differences within the alliance on airstrikes will be ironed out
early in the week.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in
Brussels.
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S.
officials were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement, with
momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the outcome.
	   In another hint of possible progress, American generals in
uniform were seen coming out of Yugoslav army headquarters in
Belgrade with Yugoslav counterparts Saturday. It wasn't clear what
the two military sides might be discussing, but they generally do
not communicate frequently.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political
leader Ibrahim Rugova, whom he praised for a moderate stance ``in a
situation where both sides have resorted to violence.''
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and Jim
O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state, apparently
were working separately on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his
seven-month crackdown on separatist forces in the province has
ended, and the Albanian side would have to acknowledge that it
might settle for less than full independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before the crackdown began. In addition, an international
monitoring force is proposed in order to oversee compliance.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by a
unilateral cease-fire that it put into effect Friday _ apparently
to put pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday, while the KLA said it was government troops who
were on the offensive. There were no casualties.
	   While Milosevic issued no immediate statements Saturday, a
Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to the West's
reported proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the spokesman, whose name was not available,
told BBC Radio 4. ``We cannot understand this.''

Vajpayee's troublesome ally says she will lay low for now
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's
most troublesome ally on Saturday said the ruling coalition was
strong and pledged her support to the government as long as it
worked for the good of the people.
	   Jayaram Jayalalitha, leader of the All India Anna Dravida
Munnetra Kazagham, nonetheless refused to rule out an alliance with
the main opposition Congress party in the future.
	   ``As a good strategist, I do not rule out any option,'' she said
of her alliance with the right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party.
	   Jayalalitha, speaking to journalists in the Indian capital New
Delhi, said said she had been unfairly blamed for trying to topple
the government.
	   Since the Southern Indian leader announced her support for the
government, she has kept it on tenterhooks, threatening to withdraw
support if her demands _ mainly the dismissal of her rival's
government in Tamil Nadu state _ are not met.

NATO says Serbs not complying, time running out

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said Saturday that Serb forces were not meeting international
demands for a withdrawal from Kosovo and warned the alliance was
close to giving the order to launch air strikes.
	   ``There is still no compliance on the ground,'' Solana told
reporters after a meeting with ambassadors from the 16 NATO allies.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act.''
	   He said the ambassadors had ``cleared all the decisions that
need to be taken'' prior to an ``activation order'' that would
authorize NATO's military commander to launch air raids against
Serbia.
	   NATO officials said those decisions included agreements on rules
of engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations
working in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   Final approval of the air strike order is being held up by
constitutional procedures in some NATO allies _ notably Germany,
where the cabinet is to discuss the issue Monday, and Italy,
following the collapse of the government Friday.
	   Despite those delays, NATO officials said the activation order
would come in the coming days if the ongoing mission to Serbia by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke fails to produce a diplomatic
solution.
	   Solana said he was in close touch with Holbrooke and that NATO's
continued preparations for strikes were helping his negotiating
efforts. ``What we have done today is a very important boost for
Dick Holbrooke,'' Solana said.

<TEXT>
	   TUZLA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ A new civilian airport opened
on Saturday on part of the main base of U.S. troops serving in the
NATO-led peace force in northern Bosnia.
	   The opening was in accordance with a memorandum of understanding
signed last year between Bosnian authorities and the U.S. peace
contingent. It provided for turning a part of the base near Tuzla
into a civilian international airport.
	   U.S. engineers reconstructed the tarmac to accommadate larger
planes and the regional Tuzla government invested dlrs 1.5 million
to build the airport terminal and the necessary infrastructure.
Reconstruction took six months.
	   Additional equipment was donated by the U.S. government and the
Frankfurt and Sarajevo airports, while Rome's Leonardo da Vinci
helped with the new airport terminal, said Mustafa Terzic, the
director of Tuzla airport.
	   For the time being, U.S. air controllers will remain in charge
of flights in and out of Tuzla, with weekly connections to Hungary
and Turkey.
	   Tuzla is the fourth civilian airport in Bosnia in addition to
airports in the Bosnian capital Sarajevo, northwestern Banja Luka
and in the southern town of Mostar.

Karpov agrees to compete in Las Vegas championship

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ilyumzhinov re-elected head of FIDE. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ World chess champion Anatoly Karpov has agreed to
compete in the world championship later this year, backing down
from his efforts to block the tournament, officials said Saturday.
	   Also Saturday, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov, billionaire president of the
southern Russian republic of Kalmykia, was re-elected head of the
Switzerland-based World Chess Federation until 2002.
	   Karpov won the world title in January and was to have held the
title for two years. But the World Chess Federation, or FIDE, has
since decided the championship should take place annually and
scheduled the next tournament for Nov. 29-Dec. 27 in Las Vegas.
	   Karpov had said he would file lawsuits in Switzerland and the
United States to stop the championship.
	   On Friday night, however, he signed an agreement in Kalmykia
with Ilyumzhinov saying he would compete, said Ilyumzhinov
spokesman Buyancha Galzanov.
	   A statement from Ilyumzhinov's office said he was ``able to find
compromises for securing stability and peace in the chess world.''
It was unclear what prompted Karpov to change his mind.
	   About dlrs 3 million in prize money will be on the line, and 100
of the top chess players in the world are scheduled to compete.

Iraqi official reports to crown prince on U.N. talks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister met Crown
Prince Hassan of Jordan Saturday to brief him on his talks with
U.N. officials on resolving the crisis over weapons inspections.
	   The meeting was a stopover for the minister, Tariq Aziz, who was
on his way home from meetings at the United Nations in New York.
Hassan is acting as regent while King Hussein receives cancer
treatment abroad.
	   The state-run Petra News Agency said Hassan reiterated a call
for ``a swift closure of the file of Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction in line with related U.N. resolutions, lifting the
sanctions on Baghdad and ending the suffering of the Iraqi
people.''
	   On Aug. 5, Iraq said it was ending cooperation with the U.N.
weapons teams because their chief, Richard Butler, refused to
certify that Iraq had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The move ended spot inspections of suspected weapons sites
because U.N. experts must be accompanied by Iraqi escorts.
	   U.N. experts must certify that Iraq has destroyed its
biological, chemical and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles used to deliver them _ before the council will lift
sanctions imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.

German industry opposes energy tax plans
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German industry lashed out Saturday at
plans by the new government to raise energy taxes, saying they
would worsen the nation's double-digit unemployment.
	   Social Democrats and their future coalition partner, the
ecology-minded Greens, meet Sunday to agree on exactly how much to
raise energy prices as part of wider tax reform both parties say
will actually spur the economy and create jobs.
	   Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder, returning from talks in
Washington with President Bill Clinton, sounded a somber note less
than two weeks after winning elections with a pledge to fight
joblessness.
	   ``The world economy has gotten not better, but dramatically
worse in the last six months,'' he told a party meeting in his home
state of Lower Saxony. ``It will not be easy.''
	   The incoming government says it wants higher energy taxes to
help finance a cut in contributions to lavish welfare-state
benefits _ a cost shared by companies and employees. Those charges
make German labor among the world's most expensive.
	   But Hans-Olaf Henkel, head of the Federation of German Industry,
said the government's plans amounted to a ``massive increase in the
burden on business.''
	   ``A negative effect on the labor market is a foregone
conclusion,'' he told the Cologne newspaper Express.
	   ``An `ecology tax' destroys jobs,'' said another industry
lobbyist, Michael Fuchs.
	   Both parties have reportedly agreed to bump up gasoline prices
by 6 pfennigs (3.75 cents) per liter, while still haggling over
taxes on heating oil and electricity.
	   Plans also call for tax relief for average wage earners to
promote consumer spending as well as curbing tax breaks for
industry and better-off individuals.
	   The Social Democrats, the dominant party after last month's
election, said they want to limit the impact of energy taxes. Franz
Muentefering, a top party official, said that energy-intensive
industries, including automakers, would be ``largely spared.''
	   But a poll published Saturday said 63 percent of Germans would
accept a 6-pfennig rise in gasoline prices if the taxes for social
programs are lowered at the same time. The Dimap poll gave no
margin of error.

Defying police, protesters gather in downtown Kuala Lumpur

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Several thousand demonstrators
defied authorities Saturday to gather for a huge rally in downtown
Kuala Lumpur to protest the arrest of a popular reformer politician
and to demand the prime minister's resignation.
	   Shouting ``Reforms, reforms,'' the protesters marched to the
National Mosque and then to the Independence Square where they sat
on the wide boulevard in front of the Federal Court and the High
Court.
	   Passing drivers honked their horns in a show of solidarity and
the crowd cheered back, raising their fists.
	   Activists held up posters and waved pictures of arrested
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim, who has emerged the biggest
challenger yet to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule.
	   Riot police with batons and shields watched on, and a truck
mounted with a water cannon was dispatched nearby. When people sat
on the road, police officers warned them that the assembly was
illegal. The authorities have banned all pro-Anwar rallies.
	   After more than 15 minutes of repeated requests by the police,
the crowd dispersed.
	   Some activists were seen shaking hands with the policemen and
thanking them for not using violence. But witnesses said
plainclothes policemen who went into the crowd to make some arrests
beat some protesters.
	   Earlier, activists had handed out leaflets to weekend shoppers
who mingled with the protesters in an area where most of the city's
malls are located.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired as finance minister and deputy prime
minister by Mahathir on Sept. 2, after they clashed over policies.
Anwar was arrested 18 days later.
	   Anwar's trial on charges of sexual misconduct and corruption,
which begins Nov. 2 in the High Court, near the site of Saturday's
protest, has drawn international attention. He appeared in court
with bruises, alleging he was beaten in captivity.
	   On Friday, police warned people to stay away from any pro-Anwar
gatherings. But officers said Saturday that they had been
instructed to exercise restraint.
	   Although support for Anwar has swelled in recent weeks,
particularly among the country's majority Muslim population, the
frequency of public protests have dropped since Anwar appeared in
court.
	   On Friday night, an opposition-sponsored rally in the southern
town of Semerah drew about a thousand people, who dispersed
peacefully when police arrived to break up the gathering.
	   The Malaysian People's Justice Movement, a fledgling coalition
of three main opposition parties and private groups, had expected a
turnout of 15,000 people.

	   The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the
Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
	   ``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign
minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam
Khomeini ... caused deep regret and sorrow among Iranians and all
over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the letter as saying.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
	   Last week, more half the members of Iran's hard-line parliament
signed a letter saying the death edict against Rushdie still
stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela told
white farmers on Saturday that improving conditions for black
workers could work as a self-defense strategy against a spate of
killings in farming communities.
	   Speaking at a summit addressing the violence, Mandela said that
some of the attacks were motivated by revenge for exploitation of
farmhands who continue to toil under apartheid-era conditions.
	   ``Elimination of poverty and inequality are the surest long-term
guarantee to eliminating crime, instability and intra-communal
tensions,'' Mandela said.
	   About 80 white farmers have been killed so far this year,
fueling charges by the mainly white, conservative opposition
parties that Mandela's government isn't concerned enough about the
victims because of their color.
	   In the most recent attack, an elderly farm couple died Friday of
ax wounds in their heads near Bloemfontein, about 400 kilometers
(250 miles) south of Johannesburg.

Johansson hands Daly win as Americans gain last four

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Per-Ulrik Johansson missed a 3-foot
putt at the last to hand victory to John Daly and Tiger Woods
carded a match-winning 66 Saturday as the United States pounced on
Swedish mistakes to make the semifinal of the Dunhill Cup.
	   Johansson came to the last all square with Daly and both players
left themselves short birdie putts to force a playoff. But the
Swede missed and Daly, who made 71, scored his seventh victory in
two Dunhill Cup competitions to put the Americans 1-0 ahead.
	   Mark O'Meara, at one stage two down to Patrick Sjoland, wound up
tied with the Swede on a 4-under 68 and Woods, playing last, gained
a 7-stroke victory over Mathias Gronberg despite missing a 3-foot
putt for bogey at the first.
	   Woods' 66 went with the 66 he scored against England on Thursday
and 70 against Japan on Friday. After three rounds at the home of
golf, he is 14 under par.
	   Daly, despite an eagle two at the 12th, was level with four to
play and, with O'Meara behind, it looked tricky for the
star-studded American team.
	   But Sjoland squandered a great chance to go two head of O'Meara
at the 16th, where he mishit an 8-foot birdie putt to leave it a
foot short and the American captain got back level when Sjoland
needed three shots to make the green at 17.
	   In Sunday's semifinal, which will be followed by the final, the
American trio will face either Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie,
or Spain, which has Jose Maria Olazabal on the lineup.
	   New Zealand, which was losing finalist to the Americans two
years ago and a semifinalist last year, gained the last four by
upsetting second seeded Australia 2-1.
	   Craig Parry gave the Australians the lead with a 70 and a
1-stroke victory over Michael Long. But Greg Turner edged Stuart
Appleby by one and Frank Nobilo, who has playing Dunhill Cup golf
for New Zealand since the competition started in 1985, downed Steve
Elkington by two after a level par 72.
	   The Kiwis will meet either defending titlist South Africa or
third seed Zimbabwe in the semifinal.

Iranian group adds over dlrs 300,000 to bounty on Rushdie

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A hard-line Iranian student group has
offered 1 billion riyals (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman
Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
	   The move came just weeks after the relatively moderate
government of President Mohammad Khatami distanced itself from the
death edict and an earlier reward of dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the
announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained
strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemed Islam. The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered
the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
	   The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite
Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death
sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333
to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported Saturday.
	   It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
	   The students had earlier delivered a letter of protest to the
Foreign Ministry, the paper said.
	   ``Your issuing of a joint statement with the British foreign
minister about Salman Rushdie and the historical edict of Imam

	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ Bjorn Borg won a tie-breaker
Saturday to defeat fellow Swede Mats Wilander in a semi-final match
at the MTN Champions at the University of Pretoria.
	   On Friday, former world champion Wilander had advanced after
winning a tiebreaker in his first round match against Iran's
Mansour Bahrami. The Swede fought all the way to the wire before
coming through in one hour 40 minutes.
	   In a match between former Davis Cup chiefs, Yannick Noah of

NATO says Serbs not complying, time running out

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC;

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
said Saturday that Serb forces were not meeting international
demands for a withdrawal from Kosovo, and warned the alliance was
close to giving the order to launch air strikes.
	   ``There is still no compliance on the ground,'' Solana told
reporters after meeting ambassadors from the 16 NATO allies.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act ... time is running out.''
	   NATO officials said ``a large percentage'' of the Serbian
special police units in Kosovo had not returned to barracks and
appeared to be digging in for the Winter.
	   Solana said the NATO ambassadors ``cleared all the decisions
that need to be taken'' prior to an ``activation order'' that would
authorize NATO's military commander to launch air raids against
Serbia.
	   NATO officials said those decisions included agreements on rules
of engagement, targeting, liaison with humanitarian organizations
working in Kosovo and the safety of NATO troops in Bosnia.
	   Final approval of the air strike order is being held up by
constitutional procedures in some NATO allies, notably Germany
where the cabinet is to discuss the issue Monday, and Italy
following the collapse of the government Friday.
	   Despite those delays, NATO officials said the activation order
would come in the coming days if the ongoing mission to Serbia by
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke fails to produce a diplomatic
solution.
	   The activation order would authorize Gen. Wesley K. Clark, the
supreme allied commander in Europe, to launch the air strikes.
However NATO officials said a few days grace would remain after the
order is given to allow Milosevic a last chance to back down before
air raids start.
	   Solana said he was in close touch with Holbrooke and that NATO's
continued preparations for strikes were helping his negotiating
efforts. ``What we have done today is a very important boost for
Dick Holbrooke,'' Solana said.
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
was ``an emerging consensus'' among the allies on a legal basis for
an alliance military strike without the need for a further U.N.
resolution.
	   The United States and Britain have argued the existing U.N. call
for an end to hostilities is all NATO needs to act, other allies
have argued that a more explicit authorization is needed. However
taking the question back to the U.N. Security Council would allow
Russia to veto the air strike plan.

Ivanisevic, Chang sail into Shanghai Open semifinals

<TEXT>
	   SHANGHAI, China (AP) _ Top-seeded Goran Ivanisevic and No. 2
Michael Chang battled past opponents Saturday to win their
semifinals matches and advance to the finals of ATP's Shanghai
Open.
	   Ivanisevic from Croatia regained the control that eluded him in
the first set, the only set he has dropped in four rounds of play,
to defeat sixth-seeded Ramon Delgado of Paraguay, 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
	   American Michael Chang was down 4-5 in the first set after a
series of errors, but managed to overcome fifth-seeded Paul
Haarhuis, Netherlands, 7-5, 6-3.
	   Chang said the support of the mostly Chinese crowd helped him
dig his way out of the first-set hole.
	   ``When they started getting behind me it was a great feeling and
that's why I enjoy playing so much in Asia. And the tide of the
match turned and it allowed me to go on. It was crucial for me,''
Chang said after the match.
	   Ivanisevic and Chang will face off on Sunday.

Hong Kong legislators divided over Britain's approach to China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ On the last day of his visit to this former
British colony, Prime Minister Tony Blair faced criticism from some
Hong Kong legislators Saturday over Britain's go-soft approach on
China.
	   The legislators said the good relations Blair had engineered
with China were good for Hong Kong. But the territory's democracy
advocates said a gentler approach on human rights in favor of
profitable commercial ties sends the ``wrong message.''
	   ``The kind of message he delivered is not strong enough,'' said
legislator Yeung Sum of the major opposition Democratic Party.
	   Among the topics discussed during the closed-door meeting
between Blair and the lawmakers were human rights in China and the
pace of democracy in Hong Kong.
	   Independent legislator Margaret Lee said after the briefing that
she had reservations about Blair's subdued approach in raising
sticky issues with Chinese leaders about political dissent and
human rights in favor of wider trade and investment ties with
Beijing.
	   ``If going softly means resorting to euphemism and avoiding
sharp issues then I'm not in favor of it,'' she added.
	   Newspapers were more cautious.
	   The Chinese-language Oriental Daily said cooperation with the
mainland was ``more intelligent'' than the headstrong approach
taken by Hong Kong's last British Gov. Chris Patten.
	   Sino-British relations previous to Hong Kong's handover 15
months ago were marked by pointed exchanges between Patten and
Beijing on a wide range of issues, including wider freedoms and
civil liberties for the people of Hong Kong.
	   In an editorial, The South China Morning Post said, ``It was
almost possible to forget the long years that Beijing and London
spent locked in battles of the handover.''
	   On Friday, Blair told Hong Kong business leaders that relations
with Britain were entering ``a new era'' with strong personal
relations between the leaders of the two countries and growing
commercial ties.
	   ``Britain's influence in Hong Kong has waned, but Blair's
encouraging remarks are still worth listening to,'' said the
Chinese-language Apple Daily on Saturday.
	   Britain and China announced a ``comprehensive partnership'' at
the outset of Blair's five-day visit to the mainland.
	   The visit to China _ the first by a British prime minister in
seven years _ ended much of the suspicion and bitterness over Hong
Kong's transition to Chinese rule.
	   After meeting with the legislators, the prime minister and his
wife visited a 64-year old Buddhist nunnery between the hills of
Kowloon and the sea, known for helping the poor and elderly.
	   Blair concluded his visit with a tour of a British-sponsored
exhibition of digital technology at the Pacific Place shopping mall
near downtown Hong Kong.
	   He was greeted by a large number of well-wishers who shook his
hand.

raids start.
	   Solana said he was in close touch with Holbrooke and that NATO's
continued preparations for strikes were helping his negotiating
efforts. ``What we have done today is a very important boost for
Dick Holbrooke,'' Solana said.
	   A NATO official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there
was ``an emerging consensus'' among the allies on a legal basis for
an alliance military strike without the need for a further U.N.
resolution.
	   The United States and Britain have argued the existing U.N. call
for an end to hostilities is all NATO needs to act, while other
allies have argued that a more explicit authorization is needed.
Taking the question back to the U.N. Security Council would allow
Russia to veto the air strike plan.

Malaysia irritated with neighbors' support for dissident
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES incorrect reference to Estrada canceling visit in
penultimate graf. &QL; 
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is getting increasingly
irritated with other Asian countries for sympathizing with jailed
dissident leader Anwar Ibrahim.
	   ``We should not interfere in the internal political affairs of
other countries, especially the friendly nations,'' tourism
minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Saturday in the latest such
outburst.
	   His comments came a day after Foreign Minister Abdullah Badawi
blasted nations like Indonesia and the Philippines for showing
solidarity for the ousted deputy prime minister, who was arrested
as he mounted a political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year-rule.
	   ``We cannot accept any interference,'' Abdullah told reporters
Friday.
	   World leaders expressed shock and concern after Anwar appeared
in court last month with bruises on his body and a black eye,
alleging he was hit repeatedly on the first night of captivity on
Sept. 20.
	   He was fired by Mahathir on Sept. 2 after being dubbed too
immoral to rule. Anwar faces trial beginning Nov. 2 on 10 counts of
corruption and illegal homosexual acts. He has denied all the
charges, saying they were fabricated to eliminate the challenge he
posed to Mahathir.
	   On Friday, Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail, said she had received a
``letter of inspiration'' from former Philippine President Corazon
Aquino, whose own husband was murdered 15 years ago for opposing
then Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos.
	   ``I can very well understand your present difficulties and I
want you to know that I truly admire you for your courage and
strength,'' Aquino said in the letter.
	   She said she had faith in ``people power,'' the popular support
that helped overthrow Marcos three years later.
	   Not only have the interviews given by Azizah since Anwar's
arrest helped kindle sympathy overseas, but many of Anwar's
supporters have also traveled to neighboring countries to criticize
Mahathir.
	   On Saturday, Sabbaruddin, the tourism minister, condemned one
such reported meeting between an Anwar supporter and Philippine
President Joseph Estrada in Manila.
	   ``They (foreign leaders) should have been more sensitive
especially if they are aware that this person is out to discredit
Malaysia,'' said Sabbaruddin.
	   A leading Malaysian daily said such remarks from Asian countries
were straining the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which
has traditionally promoted a policy of refraining from commenting
on other's internal affairs.
	   ``In international relations, ASEAN's strength has mainly been
its unity in fending off external aggression and in speaking up for
_ not against _ one another in public,'' the New Straits Times
editorial said.
	   ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie of Indonesia, who has voiced
concern over Anwar's injuries and detention, said recently he was
canceling a visit to Kuala Lumpur because of domestic concerns.
	   Thailand's powerful finance minister also joined a chorus of
condemnation by many world finance officials.

BayStars go 2-1, 4-5 against the Dragons
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Yokohama BayStars, who have clinched the
Central League's pennant race, were 2-1 and 4-5 in their
doubleheader Saturday against the Chunichi Dragons.
	   With their victory in second game, the Dragons secured their
second place in the league.
	   Hitoshi Nakane drove in a winning run on a sacrifice fly to
center in the bottom of the fourth inning of the first game, as
Yokohama edged Chunichi 2-1.
	   BayStars' starter Iori Sekiguchi struck out 10, while giving up
four hits and four walks in seven innings to collect his fourth win
for the season.
	   In the second game, Leo Gomez, formerly of the Chicago Cubs, hit
a tie-breaking solo homer in the top of the fourth inning, lifting
the Dragons to a 5-4 victory.
	   Dragons catcher Koichi Sekikawa and Teruyoshi Kuji connected for
three runs on back-to-back singles in the fifth.
	   In the Pacific League, Julio Franco, formerly of the Milwaukee
Brewers, batted in two runs in the top of the fifth inning, giving
the Chiba Lotte Marines a 4-2 victory over the Seibu Lions.
	   Kazuya Fukuura and Kiyoshi Hatsushiba hit back-to-back doubles
to drive in two more runs in the inning for a 4-0 lead.
	   The Lions and the league trailing Marines will face off again
Sunday, the only remaining game in the league.
	   The Lions, league champions again for the second straight year,
will meet the Central League champion Yokohama BayStars in the
best-of-seven Japan Series starting Oct. 17 at Yokohama Stadium.

Police arrest son of militant cleric jailed in U.S.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Police detained for 24 hours the son of
Sheik Omar Abdel-Rahman, the blind Egyptian cleric jailed in the
United States, police officials said Saturday.
	   The arrest Thursday of Abdullah Abdel-Rahman in Cairo came as
part of a ``routine security sweep and search of the area,'' said
the official, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   He was released Friday night and no charges were made.
	   Police arrested Abdel-Rahman as he drove up to his house in
Cairo, said Montasser el-Zayat, Abdel-Rahman's lawyer.
	   ``They arrested him, searched the house and took him away,''
el-Zayat told The Associated Press.
	   He said no reason was given for the arrest, which was his first.
	   Officials at the Interior Ministry, which is responsible for
Egypt's security forces, declined to comment on the case.
	   Abdel-Rahman, a third-year religious studies student at Al-Azhar
University, is not believed to be involved with activities linked
to the Islamic Group, which has fought an insurgency against the
government. But el-Zayat said he believes the arrest could have
come because ``he was campaigning on behalf of his father.''
	   Skeik Omar was the Islamic Group's spiritual leader. He was
sentenced to life in prison in 1995 for sanctioning a plot to blow
up the United Nations, the FBI headquarters, two tunnels and a
bridge.

Johansson hands Daly win as Americans gain last four
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS that Australia in semifinal sted New Zealand,
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Per-Ulrik Johansson missed a 3-foot
putt at the last to hand victory to John Daly and Tiger Woods
carded a match-winning 66 Saturday as the United States pounced on
Swedish mistakes to make the semifinal of the Dunhill Cup.
	   Johansson came to the last all square with Daly and both players
left themselves short birdie putts to force a playoff. But the
Swede missed and Daly, who made 71, scored his seventh victory in
two Dunhill Cup competitions to put the Americans 1-0 ahead.
	   Mark O'Meara, at one stage two down to Patrick Sjoland, wound up
tied with the Swede on a 4-under 68 and Woods, playing last, gained
a 7-stroke victory over Mathias Gronberg despite missing a 3-foot
putt for bogey at the first.
	   Woods' 66 went with the 66 he scored against England on Thursday
and 70 against Japan on Friday. After three rounds at the home of
golf, he is 14 under par.
	   Daly, despite an eagle two at the 12th, was level with four to
play and, with O'Meara behind, it looked tricky for the
star-studded American team.
	   But Sjoland squandered a great chance to go two head of O'Meara
at the 16th, where he mishit an 8-foot birdie putt to leave it a
foot short and the American captain got back level when Sjoland
needed three shots to make the green at 17.
	   In Sunday's semifinal, which will be followed by the final, the
American trio will face either Scotland, led by Colin Montgomerie,
or Spain, which has Jose Maria Olazabal on the lineup.
	   Second seed Australia gained the semifinal despite losing 2-1 to
New Zealand.
	   Craig Parry gave the Australians the lead with a 70 and a
1-stroke victory over Michael Long. But Greg Turner edged Stuart
Appleby by one and Frank Nobilo, who has playing Dunhill Cup golf
for New Zealand since the competition started in 1985, downed Steve
Elkington by two after a level par 72.
	   The Australians, who advanced because they had better results in
their previous two Group 4 matches, will meet either defending
titlist South Africa or third seed Zimbabwe in the semifinal.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq, once the world's largest producer of
dates, has lost about 14 million of its date palm trees during the
past eight years of U.N. sanctions, a U.N. study revealed.
	   The study said the date harvest in 1997 slumped to 625,000 tons
from 797,000 tons in 1996.
	   The study, by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, blamed
the drop in production on the decreasing number of trees _ from
more than 30 million to about 16 million.
	   ``The deteriorating inputs for cultivation and managing date
palm trees has led to low production,'' the study said.
	   It said FAO was assisting Iraqi farmers by aerial spraying their
date palm groves in the central and southern parts of Iraq.
	   ___
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ Kuwait is not protected from the global economic
crisis and steps toward economic reform must be expedited to face
the coming danger, an independent report said Saturday.
	   ``Although Kuwait's financial situation will be less difficult
than those of others around it, it will nonetheless be very
difficult because it will be hit in its two main sources of income:
oil and foreign investments,'' said a weekly report by Al-Shall
Economic Consultants.
	   The company is owned and managed by Jassem al-Saadoun, one of
Kuwait's most respected economists.
	   The report urged the government to cut on ``huge and
unnecessary'' spending, such as purchasing weapons, and to increase
revenues from sources other than oil and the state's portfolio of
foreign investments of more than dlrs 39 billion.
	   Reforms promised by the government are needed, the report said.
``And we hope this time, just for once, they would be real and
serious because ... the reality could be dangerous,'' it added.
	   The reforms include controversial steps such as charging for
public services and introducing income taxes.
	   ___
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Turkey risks losing about dlrs 7 billion
annually from an Arab trade boycott if it launches an attack on
Syria for its alleged support of Turkish Kurdish rebels, a Saudi
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   ``Turkey will risk its wide commercial interests with Arab
states if it attacks Syria,'' the London-based Asharq al-Awsat
quoted unidentified economic experts as saying.
	   ``The economic cost will be heavy for Turkey at a time when its
economy is facing many difficulties,'' it added.
	   Citing statistics about trade exchange between Turkey and Arab
countries, the paper put the losses at dlrs 7 billion a year.
	   Turkey accuses Syria of harboring Kurdish rebels seeking
autonomy in Turkey. Syria denies the charges.
	   Egypt has been trying to mediate between the two countries in an
attempt to head off a military confrontation.

Hartson fined 10,000 pounds for kicking teammate in the head
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ John Hartson has been fined 10,000 pounds (dlrs
17,000) for kicking West Ham teammate Eyal Berkovic in the head
during a training session two weeks ago.
	   Hammers manager Harry Redknapp said Saturday that Hartson had
been fined two weeks' pay, the maximum permissible under
Professional Footballers Association guidelines, and the money
would go to a cancer charity.
	   Redknapp said he decided to fine Hartson despite calls from
Berkovic not to impose a financial penalty on the Welsh
international.
	   ``John has apologized for the incident but he has still been
fined two weeks' wages,'' he said.
	   ``Hopefully that will be the end of the matter.''
	   The incident sparked outrage when a series of graphic
photographs published in hte Mirror on Wednesday showed Hartson
kicking a prone Berkovic in the face.
	   Berkovic, an Israeli international, was quoted as saying he was
in agony and was unable to eat for two days after the incident.
	   He also said he was considering leaving West Ham because he
could not ``forgive and forget'' what Hartson had done.
	   ``If my head was a ball it would have been (kicked into) the top
corner of the net,'' Berkovic said.

Cohen: Missile defense system in Gulf `imperative'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said
Saturday it has become ``imperative'' for American allies in the
Gulf to acquire a ballistic missile defense system to counter long
range weapons in the hands of countries such as Iran and Iraq.
	   Cohen said the United States has five defense systems under
research and development and ``we hope we hope we can share that
technology with Bahrain and other Gulf countries.''
	   He was speaking to reporters before leaving for Qatar, his
second stop in a six-nation Gulf tour, which includes the United
Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   ``Because of the proliferation of missile technology globally
but especially in the Gulf region, we believe it's important'' to
look at ways to cooperate with U.S. allies, said Cohen.
	   ``I think it becomes imperative that countries cooperate and
develop a theater missile protection system for their people and
for their forces,'' said Cohen, citing threats from Iran and Iraq.
	   The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently tested a
long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region.
	   Cohen said Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, continues
efforts to acquire missile technology that has a longer range than
it is permitted to have
	   During his three-day stay in Bahrain, which is home to U.S.
Navy's 5th Fleet, Cohen met high-ranking officials including the
emir Sheik Isa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the Crown Prince Sheik Hamad
bin Isa Al Khalifa and the Defense Minister Sheik Khalifa bin Ahmed
Al Khalifa.
	   Cohen said his meetings with Bahraini officials were ``very
successful.'' Among various issues, the two countries discussed the
threats posed by weapons of mass destruction programs in both Iraq,
Iran and terrorism. Cohen said both the United States and Bahrain
held similar opinions on the issues.

Lehmann hits second century in Rawalpindi test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAWALPINDI, Pakistan (AP) _ Australia's Darren Lehmann rode
roughshod over Pakistani bowling Saturday to hit his second century
as his team consolidated its lead on the third day of their
four-day match.
	   Australia, which got a 94-run first innings lead earlier in the
day, owed much to Lehmann's brilliant 100 as it finished the
penultimate day on 265 for eight _ an overall lead of 359 runs.
	   Skipper Mark Taylor, who batted at No. 5, at last got something
to cheer about on the tour with a sedate innings of 56. The
Australian captain, who had accumulated only 36 runs so far on the
tour in four innings, spent 155 minutes at the wicket for his much
awaited half century and was together with Ricky Ponting (1 not
out) when stumps were drawn for the day.
	   However it was Lehmann who gave some rough treatment to the
bowlers. He played some ferocious square cuts off spinners Muhammad
Naveed, Zahir Shah and left-arm spinner Shakeel Ahmed and hit 16
boundaries in his 95-ball century.
	   Lehmann made 103 in the first innings and never seemed troubled
in his second turn at the wicket. However, the left-hander quit the
field soon after completing his century with a groin problem.
	   Mark Waugh played a couple of attractive on drives and hit
run-a-ball 20 before he was bowled by Ahmed on a delivery that kept
low.
	   Australia lost their tail quickly after being strongly placed at
246 for four at one stage. Ahmed ran through their tail-enders and
finished the day with an impressive 6-61.
	   Earlier, the Pakistani tail-enders thwarted Australians for
another 90 minutes as the team resumed its first innings at the
overnight total of 196 for seven before Australia bowled it out for
261.
	   Ahmed stroked an unbeaten 28 while Azhar Mahmood hit a six off
Lehmann in his 33 runs before he was out leg before to Damien
Fleming.
	   Michael Kasprowicz was the top wicket-taker for Australia with
three for 92. Fleming (1-51), Collin Miller (2-38) off a steady 28
overs, Gavin Robertson (2-50) and Lehmann (1-18) were also among
the wickets.
	   Taylor, who sat out for the whole day Friday after injuring his
right hand on Thursday evening, took the field Saturday.

Davenport beats Sanchez-Vicario to reach final
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FILDERSTADT, Germany (AP) _ In her first match as the new No. 1,
Lindsay Davenport had to battle hard to beat Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 on Saturday to reach the final of
the Porsche Grand Prix.
	   Davenport dethroned Martina Hingis on Friday, and will be
officially No. 1 when the new rankings come out Monday.
	   ``I never thought I'd be No. 1 and I was very nervous,''
Davenport said. ``It was difficult today, Arantxa was very
difficult to play.''
	   Davenport will meet Sandrine Testud of France in Sunday's final
of the dlrs 450,000 indoor tournament.
	   Sanchez-Vicario is one of the seven women to have held the No. 1
before Davenport since the computer rankings started in 1975.
	   Serving for the match, Davenport had to save three break points.
She set up her first match point with an ace, but the Spaniard hit
a cross-court forehand winner to save it.
	   A backhand error by Sanchez-Vicario gave Davenport another match
point and she blasted a forehand winner to clinch the match.
	   Davenport moved into the No. 1 spot when Martina Hingis lost to
Dominique Van Roost of Belgium 3-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-4 in the
quarterfinals Friday. The defeat ended Hingis' 80-week reign in the
top spot.
	   But Davenport would have claimed the top ranking later in the
day anyway when she beat Nathalie Tauziat of France 7-6 (7-1), 7-5.
	   ``I haven't really grasped it yet,'' said the 22-year-old
American. ``I've always wanted to win a Grand Slam but No. 1 is
something very special. I'm only the eighth No. 1, it's very
exciting.''
	   Davenport won the U.S. Open last month and has lost only two
matches since Wimbledon.
	   Testud ended van Roost's run when she crushed the Belgian 6-2,
6-0 in the second semifinal Saturday.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a
death sentence for a German businessman convicted of having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, a decision that could
worsen relations between Iran and Germany.
	   Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate
relations'' with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, the court said.
Qassemi was sentenced to 100 lashes.
	   An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected in two
days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn the
verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German officials
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government will
protest to Iran's ambassador in Bonn, and continue to fight for
Hofer's exoneration.
	   The court ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow on both sides'
wish to improve relations,'' Kinkel said in a statement, which
appealed to Iran to ``ensure humaneness and justice.''
	   ``The verdict contradicts all expectations,'' he said.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with Qassemi, a medical student.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied that he had
converted to Islam and would marry the Iranian woman.
	   ``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear
Hofer of all charges,'' said Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari.

Syria calls Sharon's appointment `bullet of mercy' for talks
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Lebanese premier and media &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DAMASCUS, Syria (AP) _ Ariel Sharon's appointment as the Israeli
foreign minister serves as ``the bullet of mercy'' for the Middle
East peace process, an official Syrian newspaper said Saturday.
	   In Beirut, Lebanese newspapers denounced the appointment as a
``disaster'' for peace.
	   Many Arabs know Sharon for his role in Israel's 1982 invasion of
Lebanon. An Israeli tribunal looking into the invasion found him
indirectly responsible for the massacre of hundreds of Palestinian
refugees by pro-Israeli Christian Lebanese militiamen at two Beirut
camps.
	   Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu named Sharon foreign minister
on Friday, effectively putting the hard-liner in charge of
negotiating Israel's final borders with the Palestinians.
	   The appointment ``is a bullet of mercy to the (peace) process,
which has stopped on all tracks,'' said Tishrin newspaper, which
often speaks for the Syrian government.
	   It said Netanyahu has sent ``a clear message to all those who
are deluding themselves'' into thinking that Israel will change its
anti-peace stand.
	   Syrian-Israeli peace talks broke off more than two years ago.
	   Syria and the previous Israeli government had reached an
informal agreement on a full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
which Israel captured from Syria in 1967. But Netanyahu's
government rejected that agreement, saying it was never completed.
	   Lebanon's peace talks with Israel also have been suspended for
more than two years pending progress in Syrian-Israeli
negotiations.
	   The independent An-Nahar newspaper quoted Lebanese Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri as saying: Sharon's appointment makes Lebanon
and most world states ask: ``Does the Israeli government really
want peace as it is trying to delude the world?''
	   An-Nahar's columnist, Sahar Baasiri, said in a front-page
comment: `The mere announcement that he (Sharon) will lead
negotiations (with Arabs) is tantamount to disaster.''
	   ``The man is a hero of Arab defeats; he is the firmest believer
in the expansion of the land of Israel and in resolving the
Palestinian problem at the expense of Jordan. He is a liar,''
Baasiri wrote.
	   The conservative Ad-Diyar newspaper said in a front-page
comment: ``The history of Ariel Sharon is known. He has called for
burning Beirut, annexing the Golan, occupying the (West) Bank and
slaughtering and displacing the Arabs everywhere.''

Germany set to back Kosovo strikes

 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's outgoing Cabinet will give its
backing to possible NATO military strikes in Kosovo on Monday, the
defense minister was quoted Saturday as saying.
	   Germany's ability to act has been in question since Chancellor
Helmut Kohl was defeated in Sept. 27 elections. He formally remains
in power until Chancellor-elect Gerhard Schroeder takes office Oct.
27.
	   Kohl's Cabinet will ``give the green light'' Monday to a NATO
order that authorizes alliance military commanders to launch the
airstrikes, outgoing Defense Minister Volker Ruehe told the Bild am
Sonntag newspaper.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton met Schroeder in Washington on
Friday and said afterwards that the chancellor-elect had signaled
Germany's support for the so-called activation order.
	   Schroeder had met Kohl before his trip to coordinate policy on
Kosovo. But whether Germany will participate in any airstrikes
remained unclear.
	   Kohl's offer to NATO of 14 Tornado warplanes requires a vote in
parliament, but the newly elected lower house holds its first
session only on Oct. 26. The old parliament could be called into
session, but that is seen as politically awkward.
	   The Greens party, Schroeder's future coalition partner, approves
NATO airstrikes but rejects combat for German forces without a
clear United Nations mandate.
	   ``Any other basis for action raises infinite problems of
international law and sets a precedent,'' Greens co-chair Juergen
Trittin told Der Spiegel magazine. But he said the decision was up
to the old government.
	   Joschka Fischer, a Green in line to become foreign minister,
dodged tough questions on Kosovo after accompanying Schroeder in
the talks with Clinton.
	   He and Schroeder have ``little influence on the current
situation,'' he said late Friday on Germany's ARD television.

NATO strikes or no, Kosovars want to go West
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEX BANDY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BICSKE, Hungary (AP) _ Intense-looking men huddle around a
crackling battery-run shortwave radio, listening to the Albanian
service of Radio Free Europe-Radio Liberty.
	   Will NATO launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia over Kosovo? Will
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic back down? Will there be
peace? These are the questions being asked.
	   The question not being asked: When can we go home?
	   ``I listen to Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, RFE, BBC,
everything, all day, but peace will not come,'' Valci Zumer, a
28-year-old Kosovar refugee, says in a torrent of words in broken
English.
	   ``I don't want to stay in Hungary. Yugoslavia is 200 kilometers
(125 miles) away,'' he says, pointing southward. ``The war is
close, much too close.''
	   But he readily admits that even if peace were to be restored, he
wants to go West.
	   ``We all feel this way,'' he adds.
	   ``Over 90 percent of the people we have here want to go
elsewhere,'' says deputy camp director Susanna T. Harsfalvi.
	   Back in March, the Zumer family _ wife Emine, son Vallon, 5, and
daughter Vlora, almost 2, _ left their home town of Mitrovica,
boarding a bus for Austria.
	   Knowing they would not be allowed to enter Austria without a
visa, they got off the bus at the Hungarian-Austrian border and
crossed illegally, only to get caught by an Austrian border patrol.
	   They were then handed over to Hungarian authorities and ended up
in Bicske, 40 kilometers (25 miles) west of Budapest, but not as
far west as they'd like to be, says Zumer, wearing a San Jose
Sharks baseball cap.
	   The family of four, with a baby on the way, lives in a tiny
room, with a few personal belongings in cardboard boxes.
	   The house has six rooms, with one family to a room.
	   The refugee camp itself, built for a capacity of 330, houses 357
people, 118 of whom are children under 14.
	   A third of the residents are from Kosovo, some 20 are from
Bosnia and the rest from Africa, Asia and the Middle East.
	   In August, Zumer applied for refugee status, addressing his
request to the Canadian Embassy in Vienna.
	   When he received no reply, he and 35 others went to the Canadian
Embassy in the Hungarian capial, Budapest, on Sept. 28 and occupied
the embassy grounds, demanding a promise of passage to Canada.
	   After nine hours of tense negotiations with embassy oficials and
Hungarian authorities, riot police forcibly evicted them.
	   ``Things were quiet in the camp,'' says Harsfalvi, ``but I can
tell you, all the Kosovars had their fingers crossed for the 36,''
she said.
	   Zumer vows to keep trying to get to the West.
	   ``No more life for me, but I need life for my children,'' he
said with grim determination.

Primakov: If NATO uses force in Kosovo, Russia will rethink ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with Primakov, Foreign Ministry spokesman's
comments. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Saturday that if NATO uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo
crisis, Russia may have to revise its relationship with the western
alliance, Russian news agencies reported Saturday.
	   He reiterated that Russia would use its veto in the U.N.
Security Council to prevent airstrikes against Yugoslavia.
	   ``We cannot allow this resolution,'' Primakov was quoted as
saying by the Interfax news agency.
	   If NATO nevertheless goes ahead with airstrikes, ``it could
destroy the world's existing security system,'' he said, according
to the ITAR-Tass news agency. Such a move would set a dangerous
precedent for the use of force, without U.N. approval, against
other countries, he said.
	   Russia's parliament has already said it would review all
agreements between NATO and Russia if the western alliance were to
opt for force against Yugoslavia.
	   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov added his voice Saturday to the chorus
of Russians opposed to NATO airstrikes. He said that Yugoslavia
should be left to sort out the Kosovo conflict on its own.
	   ``If there is a need for resolving issues in Yugoslavia,
including with the help of military pressure, the U.N. Security
Council should sanction it,'' Interfax quoted Luzhkov as saying.
	   The popular, populist Luzhkov has indicated he plans to run for
Russia's presidency in the next elections in 2000.
	   Russia, a key ally of Yugoslavia, has condemned Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, but has staunchly opposed use of force against Yugoslavia.
	   ``Military, pirate-like methods'' will not solve the Kosovo
conflict, Luzhkov said.
	   Foreign Ministry spokesman Vladimir Rakhmanin told the Ekho
Moskvy radio station Saturday that NATO's discussions in Brussels
this weekend were increasingly focusing on a political settlement
of the crisis in Kosovo.

	   PARIS (AP) _ Capacity crowds at the Paris Auto Show forced
organizers to close the gates at least twice Saturday as the total
number of visitors neared the million mark, officials said.
	   Authorities began turning people away Saturday morning,
reopened, then closed again in the afternoon. They urged the
overflow crowd to return Sunday, the final day of the 12-day show.
	   Marking 100 years since the first one in Paris, the biennial
show had drawn more than 900,000 people since it opened to the
public Oct. 1 at the sprawling Porte de Versailles convention
center.
	   Along with the latest models, concept cars and high-tech
gadgetry, the show also included a historical retrospective of
sports cars.

Rebel cease-fire is a farce, Sudan army says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A rebel decision to unilaterally extend a
cease-fire by three months is only a pretext to cover troop
movements and training, Sudan's army spokesman was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   ``We in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the
rebellion movement'' because the rebels will use the time to
prepare for future combats, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said
in an interview with the daily Al-Rai Al-Akher.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said Thursday that it
will extend by another three months the current three-month
cease-fire when it end Wednesday to allow relief food to reach
civilians in war provinces like Bahr el-Ghazal in the south.
	   Khartoum has not officially responded to the announcement, and
Sirul-Khatim's comments are the first from a government official on
the cease-fire.
	   Sirul-Khatim, however, indicated that the ``government has its
position on this (cease-fire).''
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years with
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy from the
Muslim, Arab north.
	   About 1.5 million people have died in the war and related
famines caused by food and medical supplies being held up by the
fighting.

Cameroon president orders release of jailed journalist
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YAOUNDE, Cameroon (AP) _ A prominent Cameroonian journalist and
publisher has been released from prison after President Paul Biya
intervened on his behalf, government officials said Saturday.
	   Biya ordered the release of Pius Njawe late Friday, but gave no
explanation for the move, a presidential aide said on condition of
anonymity.
	   Njawe was sentenced to two years in prison after reporting that
Biya had heart troubles. The sentence was later reduced to one
year, which had not yet been completed.
	   Cameroon has come under intense pressure from human rights
groups for Njawe's imprisonment.
	   Although government critics in Cameroon lauded Njawe's release,
they also pointed out Biya's ability to influence the courts.
	   Opposition leaders have long said Cameroon's courts are subject
to control from the president. It is widely believe Njawe's
imprisonment was the direct result of Biya's intervention and not
through due legal process.
	   Last year the Supreme Court of Cameroon ordered Njawe's early
release from prison on another charge. He had been sentenced to six
months in prison for libeling Biya and the National Assembly.
	   His publication's relentless criticism of Biya has resulted in
frequent fines and libel cases.

crackling battery-run shortwave radio, listening to the Albanian
service of the Voice of America.
	   Will NATO launch airstrikes against Yugoslavia over Kosovo? Will
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic back down? Will there be
peace? These are the questions being asked.
	   The question not being asked: When can we go home?
	   ``I listen to Voice of America, Deutsche Welle, BBC, everything,
all day, but peace will not come,'' Valci Zumer, a 28-year-old
Kosovar refugee, says in a torrent of words.

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a
death sentence for a German businessman convicted of having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, a decision that could
worsen relations between Iran and Germany.
	   Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate
relations'' with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, the court said.
Qassemi was sentenced to 100 lashes.
	   An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected in two
days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn the
verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German diplomats
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel said his government will
protest to Iran's ambassador in Bonn, and continue to fight for
Hofer's exoneration.
	   The court ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow on both sides'
wish to improve relations,'' Kinkel said in a statement, which
appealed to Iran to ``ensure humaneness and justice.''
	   ``The verdict contradicts all expectations,'' he said.
	   Iranian law punishes sex between unmarried Muslims with
flogging. If the man is a non-Muslim, he faces the death penalty.
	   Hofer was sentenced to death in January soon after his arrest
for having sex with Qassemi, a medical student.
	   ``I'm surprised. I expected that today's verdict would clear
Hofer of all charges,'' said Hofer's lawyer, Malekhoushang Qahhari.
	   The appeals court had earlier assured German officials that
Hofer would be freed because the court was satisfied that he was a
Muslim and would marry the Iranian woman.

Rebel cease-fire is a farce, Sudan army says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Sudan-Food Barge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A rebel decision to unilaterally extend a
cease-fire by three months is only a pretext to cover troop
movements and training, Sudan's army spokesman was quoted as saying
Saturday.
	   ``We in the armed forces believe the cease-fire will benefit the
rebellion movement'' because the rebels will use the time to
prepare for future combats, Lt. Gen. Abdul-Rahman Sirul-Khatim said
in an interview with the daily Al-Rai Al-Akher.
	   The rebel Sudan People's Liberation Army said Thursday that it
will extend by another three months the current three-month
cease-fire when it ends Wednesday to allow relief food to reach
civilians in provinces in the south.
	   Khartoum has not officially responded to the announcement, and
Sirul-Khatim's comments are the first from a government official on
the cease-fire.
	   Sudan has been embroiled in a civil war for 15 years with
Christian and animist rebels fighting for more autonomy from the
Muslim, Arab north.
	   About 1.5 million people have died in the war and related
famines caused by food and medical supplies being held up by the
fighting.

Ziliute wins women's road race: Men on Sunday

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - Diana Ziliute of Lithuania, a
22-year-old Lithuanian with red hair and freckles, surprised the
veterans to capture the women's elite road race Saturday at the
World Cycling Chcmapionship.
	   Ziliute, who won the junior world title 1994, took the final
sprint over 28-year-old Leontien van Moorsel of the Netherlands,
who won the time trial title on Wednesday. German Hanka Kupfernagel
took third.
	   Ziliute's time was 2 hours, 35 minutes, 35 seconds.
	   Defending champion, 30-year-old Alessandra Cappellotto of Italy
was fifth.
	   Jeannie Longo, a 12-time world champion who turns 40 at the end
of this month, was ninth after leading until the final sprint of
the 102.2-kilometer (64.1-mile) race.
	   The men race on Sunday, the final event of the six-day
competition.
	   American Lance Armstrong, in a comeback from cancer, is in a
small group of favorites for the men's title. He won the event in
1993 before having to miss the worlds the last two years after
being diagnosed with cancer.
	   Michele Bartoli and Andrea Tafi head the strong Italian team
with Michael Boogerd and Leon van Bon the top Dutch riders.
	   In the women's race, Ziliute was part of a small group that
broke away just after the start of the sixth and final lap of the
17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit.
	   Up the final steep climb, Longo led the small group and held the
lead into the final straightaway until the final sprint.
	   ``Nobody wanted to be in front. I am not a sprinter. I tried my
best to push very hard on the last hill to break away,'' Longo
said.
	   Then the main group passed her easily with Ziliute having
control to win easily, raising her arms in the air.
	   Longo knew she was beaten when she couldn't shake the group.
	   ``I saw the other girls and I said to myself `No way' '', Longo
said. ``To be third, fourth, fifth or eighth means nothing to me. I
was after the championship.''
	   Longo had won the road title in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1995
in addition to three time trials and four track titles. She was
fifth in Wednesday's time trial.
	   Van Moorsel came on the final meters to take second ahead of
Kupfernagel, who took third in the time trial earlier in the week.
	   Another Lithuanian, Rasa Polikeviciute was fourth, raising her
arm in triumph when she saw Ziliute winning.
	   Earlier Saturday Ireland's Mark Scanlon won the junior men's
event over 120.4 kilometers (75 miles)

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard
Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Kosovo on Saturday, meeting
with ethnic Albanian leaders as part of a renewed effort toward a
diplomatic solution without NATO airstrikes.
	   Holbrooke, who talked into the early hours Saturday with
Slobodan Milosevic in Belgrade and planned more talks with the
Yugoslav president later, had little to say about his mission after
several hours of talks in Pristina. But his stepped-up diplomacy
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid military
intervention.
	   Showing that the European Union is united with Washington in the
latest mission, Holbrooke was accompanied to Kosovo by Britain's
Yugoslav ambassador, Brian Donnelly.
	   Asked whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an
agreement can be reached, the U.S. envoy said in Pristina: ``We
always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody wants to
have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   ``On the other hand, the United Nations resolution is very clear
and ... the Yugoslav government is not in compliance with that
resolution,'' he said.
	   Standing by and waiting to issue a final attack authorization is
NATO, where Secretary-General Javier Solana assured that
differences within the alliance on airstrikes will be ironed out
early in the week.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in
Brussels.
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S.
officials were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement, with
momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the outcome.
	   In another hint of possible progress, American generals in
uniform were seen coming out of Yugoslav army headquarters in
Belgrade with Yugoslav counterparts Saturday. It wasn't clear what
the two military sides might be discussing, but they generally do
not communicate frequently.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political
leader Ibrahim Rugova, whom he praised for a moderate stance ``in a
situation where both sides have resorted to violence.''
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and Jim
O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state, apparently
were working separately on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his
seven-month crackdown on separatist forces in the province has
ended, and the Albanian side would have to acknowledge that it
might settle for less than full independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before the crackdown began. In addition, an international
monitoring force is proposed in order to oversee compliance.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by a
unilateral cease-fire that it put into effect Friday _ apparently
to put pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Serbian media reported at least five KLA breaches of their
cease-fire Friday, while the KLA said it was government troops who
were on the offensive. There were no casualties.
	   While Milosevic issued no immediate statements Saturday, a
Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to the West's
reported proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the spokesman, whose name was not available,
told BBC Radio 4. ``We cannot understand this.''

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with German defense minister saying airstrikes support

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard
Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Kosovo on Saturday, meeting
with both President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leaders
amid indications of new hope for a diplomatic settlement.
	   Holbrooke, who talked into the early hours Saturday with
Milosevic in Belgrade and headed back for another meeting with the
Yugoslav leader later, had little to say about his mission after
several hours of talks in Pristina. But his stepped-up diplomacy
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid military
intervention.
	   Showing that the European Union is united with Washington in the
latest mission, Holbrooke was accompanied to Kosovo by Britain's
Yugoslav ambassador, Brian Donnelly.
	   Asked whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an
agreement can be reached, the U.S. envoy said in Pristina: ``We
always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody wants to
have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Standing by and waiting to issue a final attack authorization is
NATO, where Secretary-General Javier Solana said remaining
differences among the 16 members on airstrikes were all but erased
at a meeting of alliance ambassadors.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in
Brussels.
	   Germany's outgoing government, whose ability to act on the
matter had been in question, will formally back NATO military
strikes on Monday, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe was quoted as
saying by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and Jim
O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state, apparently
were working separately on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his
seven-month crackdown on separatist forces in the province has
ended, and the Albanian side would have to acknowledge that it
might settle for less than full independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which
is fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic
of Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before the crackdown began. In addition, an international
monitoring force is proposed in order to oversee compliance.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by a
unilateral cease-fire it said it put into effect Friday _
apparently to put pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   While Milosevic issued no immediate statements Saturday, a
Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to the West's
reported proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the spokesman, whose name was not available,
told BBC Radio 4. ``We cannot understand this.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's
opposition to any use of force by NATO, warning that his country
may have to revise its relationship with the alliance in that
event.
	   If NATO proceeds with airstrikes, ``it could destroy the world's
existing security system,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as
saying.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Partly cloudy skies prevailed across most of Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands during the night. The exception was along
southern coastal sections of Puerto Rico where scattered showers
were detected by the Doppler radar. Other showers were detected
over the water north of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico and
over the Mona Passage. The winds were from the southeast at 5 to 10
mph.
	   An upper level low pressure system that contributed to the
development of showers and thunderstorms across the interior and
northwest sections of Puerto Rico friday afternoon was now located
just north of the Hispaniola. This system was moving slowly west
but had a trough extending eastward into our area. Satellite
photographs also indicated abundant moisture moving north from the
northern coast of South America into our area. These two features
will combine with diurnal heating and other local effects to
produce scattered showers and isolated thunderstorms across our
area this afternoon. Since the prevailing low level winds are from
the southeast the showers and thunderstorms will be more
concentrated across the northern interior and northwest sections of
Puerto Rico as these winds interact with local sea breezes.
	   A change to a drier pattern is on its way as an upper area of
high pressure develops over the eastern Caribbean displacing the
upper level trough east of the islands by the end of the weekend.

Popular woman named new chief minister of Delhi state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
sacked the chief minister of its government in Delhi province
Saturday and named one of the most popular women in Indian politics
to succeed him, domestic news agencies reported.
	   Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma was asked to step down as his
Hindu nationalist party, which won an overwhelming majority in the
Delhi assembly five years ago, suffers increasing political
setbacks ahead of the November 25 state assembly election.
	   Sushma Swaraj, 46, who is currently the federal minister for
information and communication, will succeed him, Press Trust of
India reported. She will have to resign from the federal cabinet to
take up her new assignment.
	   Verma had been the target of several popular protests in recent
weeks as residents of New Delhi, India's capital, suffered a severe
power crisis in the summer, a long strike by thousands of private
commuter buses, a spurt in crine, and a 700 percent increase in the
prices of onions, Indians' staple vegetable.
	   Swaraj, one of the seven lawmakers elected from New Delhi in the
federal election this year, is a front-ranking leader of her party.
She had earlier declined the position of chief minister.
	   ``Now there's no choice,'' she was quoted as saying by PTI.

Chechen opposition threatens bloodshed if Maskhadov doesn't go
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Chechen opposition leader on Saturday threatened
violence if Chechen authorities do not remove President Aslan
Maskhadov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``There will be bloodshed if parliament and the Shariat
(Islamic) court fail to make objective decisions on the previously
submitted statement of the commanders' council, which contains
accusations against Maskhadov,'' opposition leader Shamil Basayev
was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   A conference of war veterans passed a symbolic, no-confidence
motion against Maskhadov last month. They accused him of violating
the constitution, and demanded that he step down.
	   ``We do not want to behead Maskhadov. We do not crave his blood.
(But) we say he is not fit to serve as the Chechen president,''
Basayev told an opposition rally in the Chechen capital Grozny on
Saturday.
	   Basayev accused Maskhadov betraying Chechnya by holding talks
with Russian officials. Despite his fight for Chechen independence,
Russia considers Maskhadov a moderate and has been willing to
negotiate with him.
	   The ITAR-Tass news agency said Basayev and his opposition
supporters thought Maskhadov was acting ``like the head of a
Russian region,'' instead of behaving like the leader of the
independent nation they aspire to be.
	   Basayev was prime minister under Maskhadov for the first six
months of this year. Since stepping down, he has been increasingly
critical of Maskhadov, and has led daily rallies against the
Chechen president for more than a week.
	   Maskhadov was a leading rebel commander during the 1994-96 war
of independence against Russia. As president, he has been unable to
bring law and order.
	   Chechnya insists it is an independent state, but no country,
including Russia, recognizes Chechnya's sovereignty.

Changing tack, Kohl heir reaches out to ex-communists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The man in line to become leader of
Germany's Christian Democrats says the party can no longer afford
to shun former East German communists after its stinging election
defeat last month.
	   Wolfgang Schaeuble backed off the staunch anti-communism of
outgoing Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his mentor, in an interview
published Saturday.
	   ``There has to be a right to correct earlier behavior,'' he told
Focus magazine.
	   The Christian Democrats lost heavily in economically depressed
eastern Germany on Sept. 27 while the successor party to the East
German communists, which Kohl vilified during the campaign,
increased their voter support.
	   Schaeuble, who is to succeed Chancellor Helmut Kohl as party
chairman at a convention next month, told Focus that the
center-right Christian Democrats must open up to former communist
party members.
	   ``If we want to have a better future together, we have to accept
that there were different life paths when the country was divided''
into East and West Germany during the Cold War, he said.
	   But he rejected calls from critics of Kohl's long leadership for
a major overhaul of the party's platform and personnel.
	   ``We don't have to change our political principles,'' he told
Focus.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard
Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Kosovo on Saturday, meeting
with both President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leaders
amid indications of new hope for a diplomatic settlement.
	   Holbrooke, who talked into the early hours Saturday with
Milosevic in Belgrade and began another meeting with the Yugoslav
leader late in the afternoon, had little to say about his mission
after several hours of talks in Pristina. But his stepped-up
diplomacy signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid military
intervention.
	   Showing that the European Union is united with Washington in the
latest mission, Holbrooke was accompanied to Kosovo by Britain's
Yugoslav ambassador, Brian Donnelly.
	   Asked whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an
agreement can be reached, the U.S. envoy said in Pristina: ``We
always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody wants to
have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Standing by and waiting to issue a final attack authorization is
NATO, where Secretary-General Javier Solana said remaining
differences among the 16 members on airstrikes were all but erased
at a meeting of alliance ambassadors.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in
Brussels.
	   Germany's outgoing government, whose ability to act on the
matter had been in question, will formally back NATO military
strikes on Monday, Defense Minister Volker Ruehe was quoted as
saying by the newspaper Bild am Sonntag.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   Talks on self-rule would involve concessions: Milosevic would
have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his seven-month crackdown on
separatist forces in the province has ended; and the Albanian side
would have to acknowledge that it might settle for less than full
independence.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and tens of thousands have
been driven from their homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown
Feb. 28 against the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army,
fighting to wrest Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic of
Yugoslavia.
	   Milosevic has defied U.N. orders to withdraw substantial forces
from the province, maintaining they are needed to prevent new
attacks by Kosovo Liberation Army ``terrorists.''
	   The international demands on Milosevic include an immediate end
to hostilities and a withdrawal of forces and heavy armaments to
levels before the crackdown began. In addition, an international
monitoring force is proposed in order to oversee compliance.
	   In a statement published Saturday in the province's ethnic
Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by a
unilateral cease-fire it said it put into effect Friday _
apparently to put pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's
opposition to any use of force by NATO, warning that his country
may have to revise its relationship with the alliance in that
event.
	   If NATO proceeds with airstrikes, ``it could destroy the world's
existing security system,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as
saying.

England, Bulgaria play 0-0 draw
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WEMBLEY, England (AP) _ England and Bulgaria played a 0-0 draw
Saturday before a disappointed 80,000 sellout at Wembley stadium,
leaving both teams without a victory in their first two European
2000 qualifying matches.
	   England was upset last month in its Group 5 opener, losing 2-1
to Sweden. Bulgaria lost 3-0 to Poland.
	   England dominated the first 20 minutes but failed to break
through as Bulgaria little by little began to carry the play in
what was an evenly played first half.
	   Alan Shearer headed high in the 55th minute off a perfect cross
from Graeme LeSaux, England's best chance early in the second half.
In the 78th, England's Sol Campbell fired high from 15 meters
(yards) in a match that had few clear scoring opportunities for
either side.
	   The lackluster match, in which England failed to breakdown a
solid Bulgarian defense, could turn up the heat on England's
often-criticized coach Glenn Hoddle.
	   England plays Luxembourg on Wednesday as Bulgaria faces Sweden.
	   Lineups:
	   England _ David Seaman; Gary Neville, Andy Hinchcliffe (Graeme
LeSaux, 35th), Robert Lee, Sol Campbell, Garteh Southgate, Darren
Anderton (David Batty 66th), Jamie Redknapp, Alan Shearer, Michael
Owen, Paul Scholes (Teddy Sheringham, 76th).
	   Bulgaria _ Zdravko Zdravkov, Radostin Kishishev, Zlatomir
Zagorcic, Valentin Naidenov, Ivailo Yordanov, Zlatko Yankov, Rosen
Kirilov, Hristo Stoichkov (Georgi Bachev, 60th), Marian Hristov,
Milen Petkov, Ilian Iliev (Ilia Gruev, 62nd).

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard

	   Germany's outgoing government, whose ability to act on the

	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators _ Fehmi
Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with political
leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full, durable and
verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and Jim
O'Brian, a special assistant to the secretary of state, apparently
were working separately on model documents for an interim agreement
on Kosovo.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to persuade the ethnic Albanians his

Albanian dailies, the KLA said it would continue to abide by a
unilateral cease-fire it said it put into effect Friday _
apparently to put pressure on Milosevic to reciprocate.
	   While Milosevic issued no immediate statements Saturday, a
Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to the West's
reported proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the spokesman, whose name was not available,
told BBC Radio 4. ``We cannot understand this.''
	   Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov reiterated Moscow's
opposition to any use of force by NATO, warning that his country
may have to revise its relationship with the alliance in that
event.
	   If NATO proceeds with airstrikes, ``it could destroy the world's
existing security system,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency quoted him as
saying.
	   Meanwhile, in evidence that NATO is pushing ahead with military
preparations, the Albanian government decided Saturday to let the
alliance use its ports and airports for any airstrikes, citing
``intensive contacts'' with NATO officials in the previous two
days.

Moldova does not want NATO military intervention in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ During a one-day visit to Bucharest,
Moldova's President Petru Lucinschi said Saturday the crisis in
Serbia's Kosovo province should be solved through political means.
	   ``There are still political and diplomatic ways to solve Kosovo
conflict,'' said Lucinschi. as quoted by the private news agency
Mediafax.
	   Lucinschi claimed Moldova's point of view was similar to
Romania's. He also said that ``Moscow tries to persuade NATO that a
political solution in Kosovo is the best.''
	   Romania's official stand on the Kosovo crisis was to be
formulated Sunday when President Emil Constantinescu convenes the
Supreme Defense Council.
	   Lucinschi was in Romania to launch his book ``The Last Days of
the U.S.S.R,'' describing the fall of the Soviet Union. In 1991,
Lucinshi was secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.
	   Moldova was part of Romania before World War II.

Henman advances to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS: will be UPDATED with Agassi/Rosset match &QL; 
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Sixth-seed Tim Henman booked a place
in his fourth final of the season, defeating Sweden's Thomas
Johansson on Saturday at the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors.
	   The 24-year-old Briton edged Johansson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5) in 2
hours and 10 minutes in the semifinals, extending his winning
streak to 11 victories.
	   ``I made it exciting there at the end,'' joked Henman, who lost
to Mark Philippoussis in the semifinals last year. ``I hadn't lost
my serve in a couple of days and when it happened it kind of threw
me for awhile.
	   ``I think the start of the third set was the most critical point
in the match,'' said Henman, the titlist in Tashkent this season.
``And I saved a couple of break points there at the end to stay in
it.''
	   Leading 2-1 in the first set, Henman scored four points to break
the Swede and jump ahead 3-1. Johansson had the opportunity to
break back at 4-2 but failed to convert a pair of break points.
	   Johansson, who defeated Boris Becker in the first round, began
the second set much more solidly, scoring the first six points.
	   Then, serving at 2-3 and up 30-0, Henman fired three shots into
the net, literally handing Johansson a 4-2 lead.
	   Henman produced a gutsy effort on Johansson's next serve but
nevertheless was unable to convert two break points.
	   Johansson once again broke Henman's next serve at 40-15 to even
the sets.
	   In the final set, the Briton broke at 2-2 then held serve to
jump to a 4-2 lead.
	   But Henman, serving and up 5-4, failed to close out the match
instead allowing Johansson to get back on serve, and force a
tiebreak.
	   Henman is currently eighth in the ``Road to Hannover''
standings, and Saturday's victory further cemented the Briton's
chances of qualifying for the ATP Tour World Championships next
month.
	   In Sunday's final, Henman will play either fourth-seed Andre
Agassi or home-favorite Marc Rosset, who played in the day's later
semifinal.
	   ``It would be exciting to play Rosset in the final here in
Switzerland,'' said Henman, who reached the top 10 in the ATP
rankings this season for the first time in his career. ``But
someone of Andre's stature is also always exciting to play.
	   ``It'll be tough no matter who I play.''

Scotland grabs 3-2 come-from-behind win over Estonia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EDINBURGH, Scotland (AP) _ Billy Dodds scored his second goal in
the 84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia in a Group 9 Euro 2000 qualifier Saturday.
	   In a frantic last 20 minutes, Dodds came off the bench and
scored his first a minute after taking the field to level the score
1-1 in the 70th minute.
	   Estonia hit-back to take the lead in the 76th minute as
18-year-old Maksim Smirnov scored, but Scotland leveled again at
2-2 through a Estonian own-goal by Sergei Hohlov-Simson in the
78th, setting up the winning goal.
	   Dodds scored the clincher with a 10-meter (yard) shot from just
outside the area to give Scotland its first win in 12 months.
	   Estonia's Hohlov-Simson _ the own-goal scorer _ opened the
scoring in the 35th minute when he headed in a lobbed corner kick
above the out-stretched hands of Scotland goalkeeper Jim Leighton.
	   Estonia extended its poor run to 28 losses in 32 international
matches since 1991. Estonia's most capped player Marko Kristal was
sent off in the 83rd minute on his second yellow card.
	   Scotland has four points in two qualifying games and Estonia has
four in three games.
	   Lineups:
	   Scotland: Jim Leighton, David Weir, Tommy Boyd, Colin
Calderwood, Colin Hendry, (Callum) Davidson, Kevin Gallacher, Billy
McKinlay, Ally McCoist, Iain Durrant, Allan Johnston. Subs: Matt
Elliott, Darren Jackson, Simon Donnelly, Billy Dodds.

<TEXT>
	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) _ Dutch fans booed French veteran
Jeannie Longo Saturday during the women's road race at the Cycling
World Championships as Longo finished ninth and missed out on her
13th world title.
	   The angry Dutch fans were reacting to comments Longo made about
local favorite Leontien van Moorsel following the Dutchwoman's
victory in Wednesday's time trial.
	   Longo called the event, in which she was the defending champion,
``a race for fat cows,'' in a reference to Van Moorsel whose
victory capped a comeback from emotional problems which led to her
weight ballooning. At one time she was 30 kilos (63 pounds) over
her weight when she won world titles in the early 1990s.
	   But the French 12-time world titlist said she was not distracted
by abuse from the crowd during Saturday's road race, in which Van
Moorsel won silver after sprinting past Longo in the final
straight.
	   ``I didn't care,'' Longo said. ``And the French fans were
cheering me on.''
	   Van Moorsel had no immediate comment on Longo at the post-race
press conference. She said she was delighted to come away from the
championships with a gold and a silver medal.
	   ``If somebody had offered me this before the week, I'd have
jumped at it,'' she said.
	   Longo, 39, denied there was any animosity between herself and
Van Moorsel during the 103.2- kilometer (64.1-mile) race.
	   ``Leontien was just another rider. I don't have anything against
Leontien,'' she said.
	   Although Longo said before the championships that this would be
her last major event, she said her defeat was not the end of her
career.
	   In a strong position coming off the final climb towards the
finish line, Longo was passed by eight riders in the final sprint.
Lithuania's Diana Ziliute, 22, won the dash for the line with Van
Moorsel in second and Germany's Hanka Kupfernagel third.
	   ``To be third, fourth, fifth or eighth means nothing to me. I
was after the championship,'' Longo said.
	   Asked if she had ridden her last race, Longo smiled and replied:
``Of course not.''

Woods shoots another 66 as Americans advance

 &UR; Eds: AMs, recasts, UPDATES with quotes, Spain beating Scotland,
South Africa reaching semifinal &QL; 
 &UR; By ROBERT MILLWARD &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. ANDREWS, Scotland (AP) _ Tiger Woods returned his second 66
in three days at St. Andrews Saturday and wished he were playing
the British Open instead of the Dunhill Cup team championship.
	   Woods latest 6-under par round took his aggregate from three
rounds to 14 under after his 70 on Friday. Saturday's triumph on
the Old Course gave him a 7-stroke victory over Mathias Gronberg as
the United States downed Sweden 2-0 to reach the last four, where
it will meet Spain for a place in the final.
	   Led by Jose Maria Olazabal, Spain downed host Scotland while the
other semifinal will be between Australia, led by former PGA
titlist Steve Elkington, and South Africa, which has Ernie Els on
the team.
	   Woods was asked if he wished he could repeat this spell of form
when the British Open returns to St. Andrews in two years time.
	   ``I wish it were this week,'' he said.
	   Playing third after John Daly had edged Per-Ulrik Johansson by
one and Mark O'Meara tied with Patrik Sjoland on 68, Woods said he
was playing the Old Course in the way he had always wanted.
	   ``I'm more experienced of links courses now and it's starting to
show,'' he said. ``I have learned a lot over the last two years and
I have always said that this type of golf on these courses is
better than in the States. There are more options. You have to be
very creative.
	   ``Today I would hit the ball to within 20 feet of the flag and I
was happy. If I got to within 16 feet I was ecstatic. These are
things we don't find at home in the States.''
	   Although Johansson missed a 30-foot putt at the last to hand
victory to Daly, the statistics point to a fourth American Dunhill
Cup triumph Sunday.
	   While Woods is 14-under after three rounds, Daly, who returned a
1-under 71, has a 7-1 Dunhill Cup record at a course where he also
won the British Open and O'Meara, this year's Masters and Open
champion, is 57-under from six visits to the Dunhill Cup.
	   Miguel Angel Jimenez pitched to within barely a foot to beat
Colin Montgomerie at the first extra hole to clinch Spain's place
in the last four. Montgomerie needed to hole a 15 footer to survive
but was well short.
	   Olazabal carded a 68 to down Gary Orr by three and Andrew
Coltart, thanks to a superb pitch to three feet at the last, gained
a one-stroke victory over Santiago Luna to force the
Montgomerie-Jimenez playoff.
	   Els and Zimbabwe's Nick Price both won their matches and it was
down to Retief Goosen to clinch a semifinal place against Mark
McNulty.
	   Winner of all five Dunhill Cup games last year when South Africa
won the title, Goosen had won both his matches this time too.
McNulty stayed with him until six to go when the Zimbabwean's game
fell apart with two bogeys and a double bogey and he carded a
4-over 76 to lose by five.
	   ``It's been quite a run so far,'' Goosen said. ``Maybe not the
toughest matches but still the eight points I've brought in the
last two years have been good.''
	   Second seed Australia gained the semifinal despite losing 2-1 to
New Zealand.
	   Craig Parry gave the Australians the lead with a 70 and a
1-stroke victory over Michael Long. But Greg Turner edged Stuart
Appleby by one and Frank Nobilo, who has playing Dunhill Cup golf
for New Zealand since the competition started in 1985, downed Steve
Elkington by two after a level par 72.
	   Both teams tied for points in Group 4 but the Australians
advanced because they had better results in their previous two
Group 4 matches.

Northern Ireland scores 1-0 win over Finland
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: WILL update with lineups &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland defended a
one-goal lead for an hour Saturday before clinching a 1-0 win over
Finland in the Group 3 Euro 2000 qualifier.
	   Keith Rowland scored his first international goal in the 31st
minute to claim the only goal of the match.
	   The Queens Park Rangers midfielder received a pass from Michael
Hughes and beat a defender before firing a left-footed shot past
Antti Niemi and into the far corner of the net.
	   Hughes almost added a second goal minutes later with a fierce
shot from near the goal area but Niemi pushed the ball wide.
	   The win atoned for Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey
in its Euro opener in Istanbul.
	   Finland, which beat Moldova 3-2 in its Euro opener, had ample
chances but Northern Ireland's Alan Fettis _ a third-choice
goalkeeper at Premier League team Blackburn Rovers _ proved he was
up to the task.

Two guerrillas reported killed in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARJAYOUN, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli troops and their allied
Lebanese militiamen fired tank shells at advancing guerrillas
Saturday, killing two of them, militia officials said.
	   The guerrillas were spotted trying to sneak into the village of
Rihan in the Israeli-occupied zone in southern Lebanon, officials
of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia said.
	   Two guerrillas were killed instantly in the shell fire and their
bodies were seized by militiamen, the SLA officials said, speaking
on customary condition of anonymity.
	   Rihan is about 10 kilometers (6 miles) north of Marjayoun, the
main town in Israel's self-styled ``security zone'' in the south.
	   Lebanese security officials could not immediately confirm the
report. Hezbollah, the dominant guerrilla group in Lebanon, also
did not immediately comment.
	   The identities of the dead guerrillas or their organizations
were not immediately known.
	   On Monday, two Israeli soldiers were killed and six others were
wounded in two roadside bombings in the occupied zone. The
Hezbollah claimed responsibility.
	   Hezbollah, or the Party of God, and other militant groups are
fighting to oust some 1,500 Israeli soldiers and 2,500 SLA
militiamen from the occupied zone, which Israel set up in 1985 to
protect its northern territory from guerrilla attacks across the
border.

Four women escape through police washroom
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Four women from former Soviet republics
escaped Saturday from the fifth floor of a police transit facility
where they were being held for deportation, police said.
	   A statement said two of them were arrested while the other two
are still at large.
	   Three police officers were arrested as being responsible for the
escape, the statement said.
	   The women, two from Moldavia, and one each from Lithuania and
Byelorussia, were arrested earlier this week in the northern port
city of Salonica after they were found without travel documents.
They were moved to Athens on Friday for deportation.
	   It said that the women asked to take a bath and were escorted
from the basement to the washroom on the fifth floor where the
police dormitories are also located.
	   The four managed to escape from a window and using a piece of
scrap cable clambered down to the terrace of an adjacent building.
Two of them were injured in their effort and were hospitalized.

Iranian appeals court upholds death sentence for jailed German

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ An Iranian appeals court Saturday upheld a
death sentence for a German businessman convicted of having a
sexual relationship with a Muslim woman, a decision that could
worsen relations between Iran and Germany.
	   Helmut Hofer, 56, will be executed for having ``illegitimate
relations'' with 26-year-old Vahideh Qassemi, the court said.
Qassemi was sentenced to 100 lashes.
	   An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected in two
days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn the
verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German officials
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   In Bonn, Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Azizi, was summoned to the
foreign ministry to hear a German protest over the verdict.
	   In a statement issued earlier, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow on both
sides' wish to improve relations.''
	   ``The verdict contradicts all expectations,'' he said.
	   Officials said Azizi expressed hope that the case will not harm
bilateral relations and promised a speedy trial.

Popular woman named new chief minister of Delhi state
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDS : UPDATES thruout with details, quotes. UPGRADES attribution. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party
sacked the chief minister of its government in Delhi province
Saturday and named one of the most popular women in Indian politics
to succeed him, party officials said.
	   Chief Minister Sahib Singh Verma was asked to step down as his
Hindu nationalist party, which won an overwhelming majority in the
Delhi assembly five years ago, slipped deeper in a whirl of
political setbacks ahead of the November 25 state assembly
election.
	   Sushma Swaraj, 46, currently the federal minister for
information, broadcasting and communications, will succeed him,
party spokesman Venkaiah Naidu said.
	   ``She is the leader of the future, she emerged as the consensus
candidate,'' Naidu told The Associated Press.
	   Swaraj is likely to resign from the federal cabinet to take up
her new assignment on Sunday, when Prime Minister Atal Bihari
Vajpayee would name her successor in the ministries headed by her,
the spokesman said.
	   In her tenure at the two ministries, Swaraj eased rules for
mobile telephone operators, launched a campaign against phone sex
companies and promised to use powerful transmitters to fight
television propaganda by India's arch rival Pakistan in the
disputed Jammu-Kashmir province.
	   Verma had been the target of several popular protests in recent
weeks as residents of New Delhi, India's capital, suffered a severe
power crisis in the summer, a long strike by thousands of private
commuter buses, a spurt in crime and a 700 percent increase in the
price of onions, Indians' staple vegetable.
	   Swaraj, one of the seven lawmakers elected from New Delhi in the
federal election this year, is a front-ranking leader of her party.
She had earlier declined the position of chief minister.
	   ``Now there's no choice,'' she was quoted as saying by PTI.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ U.S. trouble-shooter Richard
Holbrooke shuttled between Belgrade and Kosovo on Saturday, meeting
with both President Slobodan Milosevic and ethnic Albanian leaders
amid indications of new hope for a diplomatic settlement.
	   Holbrooke, who talked into the early hours Saturday with
Milosevic in Belgrade and began another meeting with the Yugoslav
leader late in the afternoon, had little to say about his mission
after several hours of talks in Pristina. But his stepped-up
diplomacy signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid military
intervention.
	   Showing that the European Union is united with Washington in the
latest mission, Holbrooke was accompanied to Kosovo by Britain's
Yugoslav ambassador, Brian Donnelly.
	   Asked whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an
agreement can be reached, the U.S. envoy said in Pristina: ``We
always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody wants to
have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Standing by and waiting to issue a final attack authorization is
NATO, where Secretary-General Javier Solana said remaining
differences among the 16 members on airstrikes were all but erased
at a meeting of alliance ambassadors.
	   ``If (Yugoslav President Slobodan) Milosevic does not comply, I
can tell you that NATO is ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in
Brussels.
	   The Albanian government decided Saturday to let the alliance use
its ports and airports for any airstrikes, citing ``intensive
contacts'' with NATO officials in the previous two days.

	   An appeal to the country's supreme court is expected in two
days, and legal experts said that court would likely overturn the
verdict. But the decision still came as a shock to German diplomats
and Hofer's lawyers, who had expected him to be released.
	   In Bonn, Iran's ambassador, Ahmad Azizi, was summoned to the
foreign ministry to hear a German protest over the verdict.
	   In a statement issued earlier, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel
said the court ruling ``inevitably throws a new shadow on both
sides' wish to improve relations.''
	   ``The verdict contradicts all expectations,'' he said.
	   Officials said Azizi expressed hope that the case will not harm
bilateral relations, and promised a speedy trial.

 &UR; Four women escape through police washroom &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Four women from former Soviet republics
escaped Saturday from the fifth floor of a police transit facility
where they were being held for deportation, police said.
	   A statement said two of them were arrested while the other two
are still at large.
	   Three police officers were arrested as being responsible for the
escape, the statement said.
	   The women, two from Moldova, and one each from Lithuania and
Belarus, were arrested earlier this week in the northern port city
of Salonica after they were found without travel documents. They
were moved to Athens on Friday for deportation.
	   It said that the women asked to take a bath and were escorted
from the basement to the washroom on the fifth floor where the
police dormitories are also located.
	   The four managed to escape from a window and using a piece of
scrap cable clambered down to the terrace of an adjacent building.
Two of them were injured in their effort and were hospitalized.

Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Kinshasa.
	   The airline official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
women and children were among the civilian passengers on the
aircraft. There was no immediate information on casualties as
rescue workers were still searching for wreckage.
	   The plane was one of several civilian aircraft that had been
taken over by rebel fighters in eastern Congo after they launched a
rebellion against President Laurent Kabila at the start of August,
the CAL official said.
	   It was unclear who controlled the aircraft that shot down.

Two participants in local rally die in accident
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A driver and his co-pilot taking part in
a local auto rally in Austria's Styria province were killed
Saturday when their Fiat Cinquecento veered off the course in a
bend, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   The car of Bernhard Geramb, 35, and his companion Christian
Neuhold spun out of control at a point where the surface changed
from tarmac to gravel. The two drivers succumbed to their grave
injuries at the site of the accident, APA said.
	   The accident occurred near Selzthal in the southern Styria
province. The competition was broken off after the accident.
	   Geramb was an experienced pilot, who took part in international
events this season, including the Monte Carlo Rally, APA said.
	   It was the second fatal accident in an Austrian auto rally event
this season. During a race on May 9, two German pilots were killed
when they collided with a wall.

	   KINSHASA: x x x shot down.
	   A rebel army of ethnic Tutsis and disaffected members of
Kabila's army launched an armed uprising against the government in
August. Rebel troops marched as far as Kinshasa's suburbs in late
August before a coalition of government troops and Congolese allies
helped repel the attackers.
	   Fighting has since shifted to eastern Congo, where the rebels
still control a number of key cities.
	   Kindu had been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days with
loyalist forces battling rebel gunmen trying to take control of the
strategic airbase in the town.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.

Taliban sends representative to Pakistan to meet UN envoy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Afghanistan-Fighting &QL; 
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ A representative of Afghanistan's
Taliban religious army is in to hold talks with the United Nations
special envoy on tensions with Iran, according to Pakistani
sources.
	   Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, who is close to the Taliban's reclusive
leader Mullah Mohammed Omar, arrived in neighboring Pakistan
Saturday night from aliban headquarters in southern Kandahar, said
the sources, speaking on customary condition of anoynymity.
	   Muttawakil is expected to reiterate the Taliban's invitation to
U.N. special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi to visit Omar at his
headquarters in Afghanistan.
	   Brahimi, who arrived in Pakistan last Thursday from Iran, is in
the region to try to find a peaceful end to a deadly standoff
between Iranian soldiers and Taliban troops on the border that
separates the two countries.
	   Until Saturday and Muttawakil's secrecy-cloaked arrival in
Pakistan, the Taliban leadership insisted on meeting Brahimi in
Kandahar.
	   However, it's believed that Pakistan, one of the Taliban's
closest allies, persuaded the Taliban leadership to send Muttawakil
to Pakistan.
	   Pakistan is one of only three countries to recognize the
Taliban. The movement has become increasingly ostracized in the
international community, chastized for its human rights record and
its harboring of Muslim militant Osama bin Laden.
	   Citing security reasons, Brahimi earlier said he could not
travel to Afghanistan.
	   The United Nations pulled all it international staff out of
Afghanistan last Aug. 21 after U.S. missiles slammed into suspected
terrorist training camps in eastern Afghanistan.
	   An Italian U.N. staff member was killed in Kabul on Aug. 21,
apparently by Taliban soldiers protesting the missile attack.
	   The U.N. has been negotiating with the Taliban to return to
Afghanistan.
	   The Taliban army control roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan and
the northern-based opposition the remaining 10 percent.
	   Iran sent its troops to its eastern border with Afghanistan
after the Taliban admitted killing nine Iranian diplomats and an
Iranian journalist in August in the northern city of
Mazar-e-Sharif.
	   Iran is demanding an apology from the Taliban, and wants the
culprits handed over to Tehran for trial and punishment. The
Taliban has refused, calling the slain Iranian diplomats
``conspirators''.

<TEXT>
	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of
Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, was unanimously elected as
the chairman of her opposition group Saturday, the first step
toward her goal of becoming the nation's president next year.
	   A scream of joy went up in the room when the wildly popular
Megawati, the only candidate on the ballot of her faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party, got every single vote in a show of
hands.
	   ``This is not the end of the struggle but the only the start,''
she said at the close of a three-day congress of her faction of the
minority Indonesian Democratic Party.

Save the Children charity withdraws staff over Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Britain's Save the Children charity
announced Saturday withdrawal of its foreign staff from Yugoslavia,
citing security reasons in strife-torn Kosovo and the failure of
the world community to solve the crisis.
	   In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in the Yugoslav
capital Belgrade, Save the Children said the ``disregard for
international humanitarian law displayed so graphically in the
crisis in Kosovo has severely limited the humanitarian effort.''
	   ``This, coupled with the failure of the international community
to take concerted humanitarian action ... has made it increasingly
difficult for impartial, non-political, humanitarian organizations
like Save the Children to function effectively,'' the statement
also read.
	   According to the charity, children make up to 65 per cent of the
hundreds of thousands displaced by the fighting in Kosovo and many
have been stranded in valleys on hillsides, exposed to the Balkan
cold.
	   Scores have died and many more children have been wounded, the
organization also said.
	   Save the Children has been present in Yugoslavia since 1993 and
set up its office in Kosovo in 1997.
	   ``We appeal to all those involved in the crisis to secure a
peaceful solution to the conflict, to respect all children's basic
human rights and to grant children their right to protection and
assistance,'' Mike Aaronson, the charity's director said.

Russian prime minister asks EU for food and medicine

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ In spite of the Russian government's insistence
that no grain imports are planned this year, an agricultural
delegation is heading to the United States for negotiations and the
prime minister has turned to the European Union for food and
medical aid, officials said Saturday.
	   Russian agricultural executives are heading to the United States
over the next few days to negotiate grain purchases, the
Agriculture Ministry said, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Bertrand Soret, the EU's chief spokesman in Russia, said that
Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov had told EU President
Jacques Santer in Moscow on Friday that aid in the form of food and
medicine ``would be welcome.''
	   The two-pronged effort to find additional sources of food
reflects the government's increasing concern over how it can cope
with the economic fallout from the plunge in the national currency,
the ruble, the sharp decrease in imports and Russia's worst grain
harvest in decades.
	   The government has already said it's planning to drop or lower
import duties on basic foods such as meat, butter and grain in an
attempt to restore the nation's stocks. Now it appears to be
looking for significant food aid from abroad for the first time in
several years.
	   Details on what food and medicine Russia needs and what the EU
could offer will be worked out in committees, Soret said. The EU
insists that the distribution of any such aid be carefully
controlled.
	   In recent years, the EU's humanitarian aid unit has given aid to
Russia on a small scale for specific projects. Last year, it gave
around dlrs 3 million to improve medicine and sanitation in the
war-shattered southern region of Chechnya. It also provided medical
aid to Russia to help victims of the 1986 nuclear accident at
Chernobyl.
	   The United States provided food aid to Russia in the early
1990s, as the nation battled runaway inflation after the collapse
of the Soviet Union.
	   The variety of goods on Russian store shelves has shrunk since
mid-August, when Russia's long-standing economic malaise burst into
crisis. The government defaulted on some of its debts and devalued
the ruble, sending the prices of imports soaring and Russian
consumers scurrying to stock up on what goods they could grab
before prices rose even further.
	   Overall imports _ which Russia had come to depend on for nearly
half its consumer goods _ plunged 45 percent in September because
most people can no longer afford them, the government announced
Friday.
	   The decline in some categories was even more dramatic.
Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and sugar
imports both fell more than 80 percent.
	   There have not been serious shortages of staple foods, but
inadequate supplies of medicines have been reported in hospitals
and pharmacies.
	   Deputy Agriculture Minister Vyacheslav Chervoivanov said Friday
that Russia would not import any grain this year, despite a paltry
harvest of 50 million tons (55 million short tons), Russian news
agencies reported. That's down from 88.5 million tons last year,
and the lowest in more than 40 years largely because of prolonged
droughts.
	   While no centralized grain purchases are planned,
representatives of Roskhleboprodukt _ a former state agency that
remains the main government contractor for grain purchases _ will
begin negotiating grain imports in the United States next week,
Interfax reported Saturday, citing sources in the Agriculture
Ministry.
	   Russia is reportedly looking to import as much as 3 million
metric tons (3.3 million short tons) of donated grains.
	   Russia has imported grain several times in recent years, mostly
for fodder, without major damage to the economy.

 &UR; Congolese rebels deploy anti-aircraft misiles around eastern air
base
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Saturday they had
deployed at least two surface-to-air missiles and more than 3,500
troops in preparation for a final assault on a strategic
government-held air base.
	   But Arthur Mulunda, a rebel brigade commander, denied his forces
had shot down a Congolese airliner near Kindu, 80 kilometers (50
miles) southwest of Kalima. He said rebel fighters had not fired on
any aircraft Saturday.
	   In Kinshasa, the Congolese capital, a Congo Airlines
representative said the rebels shot down a Boeing with 40
passengers aboard shortly after it took off from Kindu airport.
	   Mulunda said the government still controlled the Kindu airport,
4 kilometers (2 miles) outside town, but he said his men had
deployed two SAM-7 missiles to prevent government aircraft from
flying in reinforcements and supplies.
	   The origin or source of the missiles was not clear.
	   Rebel aircraft from the eastern stronghold in Goma 380
kilometers (235 miles) to the northeast made at least eight flights
to Kalima's grass air strip Saturday carrying ammunition and
troops. All supplies and troops are then trucked to the frontline
at Kindu.
	   Mulunda said rebels controlled three-quarters of the perimeter
around Kindu. He said a corridor leading southwest out of the town
had been left open for the civilian population to flee and escape
possible casualties.
	   After six days of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters _ ethnic
Tutsis and disenchanted soldiers in Congolese army backed up by
neighboring Rwanda _ had made little progress and failed to capture
the town outright.
	   The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt
against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400
tribes.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo. There
are unconfirmed reports that Chadian and Sudanese troops are
involved in the defense of Kindu.
	   Rebel commanders said their original 2,000 troops were meeting
stiff resistance from the government force of about 5,000. Mulunda
said rebel fighters had been reinforced lately by additional 1,500
soldiers.
	   Richard Mundo, another rebel commander, said the forces
controlled one-third of Kindu and preparations were being made for
a final assault, which he said would take place on Sunday or
Monday.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ his erstwhile allies who
installed him in power in May 1997 after an earlier eight-month
rebellion _ of sponsoring the new rebellion.
	   Both countries say they have legitimite security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila's side. The assistance was essential in routing
an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts
of Kinshasa in mid-August.

Recipient hopeful, determined; wanted back home for alleged fraud
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER BURNS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ A New Zealand man who received the first hand
transplant in decades remained hopeful his body would accept the
new appendage and said he couldn't wait to hug his family, a French
newspaper reported Saturday.
	   But the newspaper also reported the recipient, Clint Hallam, was
a con artist who lost his hand while doing time in prison for fraud
and that the transplant operation in Lyon forced an Australian
court to postpone a hearing on new fraud charges.
	   ``That's the way it is,'' said Australian doctor Earl Owen, who
co-led the transplant team, told Le Monde. ``Our recipient was an
adorable crook who abused me from day one. Because he's a talented
liar.''
	   Hallam, who resides in Perth, Australia, said that after the
Sept. 24 operation his first wish was to ``wrap both my arms''
around his wife and eight children, Le Monde said.
	   ``Two of my children only knew me with one hand,'' he told the
newspaper as he lay in stable condition at Edouard Herriot
Hospital, more than two weeks after the operation.
	   ``I look at it every morning when I wake up, and each time I see
a miracle,'' he said of his new hand.
	   The coming weeks would determine whether Hallam's body, with the
help of anti-resistance drugs, would become the first in history to
accept the new hand and forearm. It would take about two years to
determine if he regains full control.
	   Hallam had already established a record of sorts: the only other
known hand transplant was in Ecuador in the 1960s and the patient's
body rejected the hand after two weeks. Hallam was now well into
his third week.
	   For five years, doctors had tried to fully reattach Hallam's
hand after a 1984 chainsaw accident. In 1989, Hallam gave up and
had doctors amputate him at the upper forearm.
	   ``For years I had only one idea: I'm going to get a
transplant,'' he said. When he found the right experts, he hounded
them with faxes and phone calls. ``Nothing in the world was going
to stop me. Nothing.''
	   Hallam said he didn't think much about the donor, who remained
anonymous.
	   ``I don't ask that question,'' he said. ``It was probably
written that someday or another I would get my hand back. Not a
donor's. My hand.''
	   While in the Lyon hospital, Hallam was scheduled to attend a
court hearing in Australia on several charges of fraud, but the
date was put off until January, Le Monde said.
	   Hallam had already been given a two-year sentence for fraud in
New Zealand. It was in Rolleston Prison where he cut his hand with
a chainsaw in 1994, not, as Hallam had claimed, at a building
construction site.
	   But Dr. Owen said that what's important is that Hallam was
determined to pull through.
	   ``The strength and balance of Clint Hallam makes him a
remarkable patient,'' he said.

Chechen opposition threatens bloodshed if Maskhadov doesn't go

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES in new 4th graf with call for impeachment. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Chechen opposition leader on Saturday threatened
violence if Chechen authorities do not remove President Aslan
Maskhadov, the Interfax news agency reported.
	   ``There will be bloodshed if parliament and the Shariat
(Islamic) court fail to make objective decisions on the previously
submitted statement of the commanders' council, which contains
accusations against Maskhadov,'' opposition leader Shamil Basayev
was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   A conference of war veterans passed a symbolic, no-confidence
motion against Maskhadov last month. They accused him of violating
the constitution, and demanded that he step down.
	   On Saturday, the opposition went further, adopting a resolution
that calls for Maskhadov's impeachment ``in the interests of
staving off confrontation and civil war in the Chechen republic,''
Interfax said.

Church should mark convert's sainthood with contrition, miracle
</HEADLINE>
child's father says &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VATICAN CITY (AP) _ The Catholic Church should mark the
canonization of Edith Stein, an Orthodox Jew-turned-nun who died at
Auschwitz, with a full admission of wrongs it did Jews in the
Holocaust, the father of a girl saved by a miracle credited to
Stein urged Saturday.
	   The father, mother and 11 siblings of 14-year-old Teresia
Benedicta McCarthy of Brockton, Massachusetts, came to Rome to see
Pope John Paul II elevate Stein to sainthood on Sunday.
	   Benedicta's father also hopes to see the pope initiate a period
of contrition _ explicit contrition by all Christians for the
Holocaust.
	   ``A generalized `I'm sorry' is not the way the Catholic Church
operates forgiveness,'' said the Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy,
the girl's father.
	   Long an admirer of Stein, he said, ``The last thing she would
want ... would be that the canonization somehow was part of a means
to hide the atrocities of Christians in relation to Jewish people
during the Second World War.''
	   German Chancellor Helmut Kohl and a large contingent from
Stein's family also are expected to attend Sunday's ceremony at the
Vatican.
	   The canonization has sparked debate between Catholics and Jews.
Some Jewish leaders say she _ like 6 million others in the
Holocaust _ died because she was a Jew, and see the church as
singling out and laying claim to her martyrdom.
	   For their part, church leaders have expressed hope that her
canonization would boost dialogue and reconciliation between
Catholics and Jews _ something that has been a tenet of John Paul's
papacy.
	   Under John Paul, the Vatican in March came out with a
long-awaited statement of regret that Catholics did not say and do
more to stop Nazi persecution of Jews.
	   Born into a German Orthodox Jewish family on Yom Kippur in 1891,
Stein was an atheist by the time she converted to Catholicism. She
became a Catholic nun in 1922; 20 years later, the Nazis shipped
her and fellow converts in Holland to Auschwitz to punish Holland's
bishops for speaking out against Adolf Hitler.
	   She died there on Aug. 9, 1942. One Jew who escaped death speaks
of Stein tending to children and other women on the way to the
death camp, ``consoling, helping, calming them like an angel.''
	   In naming her a saint, the Roman Catholic Church said she
interceded almost a half-century after her death to save the life
of Benedicta.
	   At 2 1/2, the girl swallowed an overdose of Tylenol. She
suffered such liver damage that she was put on a priority list for
an organ transplant.
	   Then, overnight, Benedicta got better. Her liver was fine.
Benedicta's doctor wrote on her chart, ```This child has made a
miraculous recovery. Report to follow,'' her mother, Mary McCarthy,
recalled.
	   The church agreed. There was no medical explanation, the church
said, the only explanation was the prayers that the McCarthys and
their friends offered to Stein.
	   McCarthy had felt a link to Stein even before her canonization,
noting that the day she died _ Aug. 9 _ was both the day he was
ordained and the day some Catholics fast to mark the atom bombing
of Nagasaki and to pray for nonviolence.
	   McCarthy is a member of the Eastern Rite of the Catholic Church,
which allows ordination of married men. Benedicta was born on Aug.
8, 1984, which McCarthy noted was Aug. 9 in Auschwitz.
	   The name they picked for her _ Teresia Benedicta _ is the name
Stein chose in the church.
	   Benedicta was sightseeing with her brothers and sisters at St.
Peter's Square on Saturday, distinguished by her siblings only by
her lurid purple, lollipop-stained tongue.
	   Her mother saw no need for Sunday's canonization to cause ill
will.
	   ``I think she's someone in heaven for everyone to pray to, Jews
and Catholics alike,'' she said.
	   Her father _ like many church leaders _ thought it could build
good will, but only if it were a starting point for an honest
accounting.
	   ``It's important for the health of the church,'' he said. ``If
it doesn't name the sins of the church, it won't repent of them.
And they'll come back. They'll come back.''

Iranian group adds over dlrs 300,000 to bounty on Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with British foreign office reaction; FIXES typo in
riyal to rial in lede &QL; 
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A hard-line Iranian student group has
offered 1 billion rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman
Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
	   The move, reported in a newspaper Saturday, came just weeks
after the relatively moderate government of President Mohammad
Khatami distanced itself from the death edict and an earlier reward
of dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the
announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained
strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemed Islam. The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered
the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
	   The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite
Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death
sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333
to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported.
	   It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
	   In London, the British Foreign Office said it will ``likely
raise the matter with Iranian authorities.''
	   ``We deplore any organization placing a bounty on the head of a
British citizen,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The students had earlier delivered a letter to the Foreign
Ministry to protest Kharrazi's joint statement with Cook, the paper
said.
	   Kharrazi's statement ``caused deep regret and sorrow among
Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the
letter as saying.
	   However, the British spokesman noted that the students' offer of
a bounty ``clearly'' does not have any official backing from the
Iranian authorities. ``Our agreement is with the Iranian government
and it is that agreement that counts,'' he said.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
	   Last week, more than half the members of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

Pharmaceutical imports were down 71 percent, while milk and sugar
imports both fell more than 80 percent.

Iranian group adds over dlrs 300,000 to bounty on Rushdie

	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ A hard-line Iranian student group has
offered 1 billion rials (dlrs 333,333) to anyone who kills Salman
Rushdie, the second bounty on the British author's head.
	   The move, reported in a newspaper Saturday, came just weeks
after the relatively moderate government of President Mohammad
Khatami distanced itself from the death edict and an earlier reward
of dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi, who made the
announcement in New York, and his British counterpart, Robin Cook,
had portrayed the move as a way to improve ties that have remained
strained over the issue and agreed to exchange ambassadors.
	   Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini issued the fatwa, or religious
edict, on Rushdie in 1989, claiming his book ``The Satanic Verses''
blasphemed Islam. The semiofficial Khordad Foundation later offered
the initial reward to anyone who killed Rushdie.
	   The Association of Hezbollah University students said despite
Kharrazi's pledge, they were still ready to carry out the death
sentence against Rushdie and were willing to pay the dlrs 333,333
to any person who killed him, Kayhan newspaper reported.
	   It did not say where the students would obtain the funds.
	   In London, the British Foreign Office said it will likely raise
the matter with Iranian authorities.
	   ``We deplore any organization placing a bounty on the head of a
British citizen,'' a Foreign Office spokesman said on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The students had earlier delivered a letter to the Foreign
Ministry to protest Kharrazi's joint statement with Cook, Kayhan
said.
	   Kharrazi's statement ``caused deep regret and sorrow among
Iranians and all over the Muslim world,'' the paper quoted the
letter as saying.
	   However, the British spokesman noted that the students' offer of
a bounty ``clearly'' does not have any official backing from the
Iranian authorities. ``Our agreement is with the Iranian government
and it is that agreement that counts,'' he said.
	   Powerful government hard-liners, dismayed over Khatami's efforts
to improve ties with the West since he took office last year, were
not happy with the government position on Rushdie.
	   Last week, more than half the members of Iran's hard-line
parliament signed a letter saying the death sentence stands.
	   Rushdie had spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
issued the edict. He recently voiced relief the ordeal was over.

	   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels in eastern Congo shot down a
passenger jet carrying 40 people on Saturday, a Congo Airlines
executive said.
	   A missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing 727 Congo Airlines
jet shortly after take off from Kindu airport in eastern Congo,
said Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management
committee in the Congolese capital, Kinshasa.
	   The plane crashed into a densely forested area just outside of
Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of Kinshasa. Kindu
has been the scene of heavy fighting in recent days between
government loyalist troops and rebel forces battling to oust
President Laurent Kabila.
	   Papaioannou said women and children were among the civilian
passengers on the aircraft, but there was no immediate information
on casualties as rescue workers were still searching for the
wreckage.
	   ``The plane was hit by a missile that was fired by rebels,''
Papaioannou, citing initial airline and government reports on the
crash. ``It happened about three minutes after takeoff.''
	   The pilot struggled to bring the plane around for an emergency
landing before sending a final notice that the aircraft would not
make it back to the airport, the airline executive told The
Associated Press.
	   Papaioannou said the CAL jet had been recaptured by the
government side and was being used to ferry civilians in Kindu to
safety.
	   In August, several civilian CAL aircraft were taken over by
rebel fighters in eastern Congo after they launched their rebellion
against Kabila. The planes were used to shuttle soldiers to western
Congo near the capital.
	   A rebel army of ethnic Tutsis and disaffected members of
Kabila's army launched an armed uprising against the government in
August. Rebel troops marched as far as Kinshasa's suburbs in late
August before a coalition of government troops and Congolese allies
helped repel the attackers.
	   Fighting has since shifted to eastern Congo, where the rebels
still control a number of key cities.
	   Kindu had been the scene of fierce battles in recent days with
loyalist forces battling rebel gunmen trying to take control of the
strategic airbase in the town.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo.

Tunisian navy rescues 54 illegal emigrants abandoned by escort
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) _ The Tunisian navy has rescued 54 Africans
abandoned by their escorts as they tried to sail to Italy, a
Tunisian government newspaper reported Saturday.
	   Two boats skippered by Moroccans were found carrying the
emigrants -- nine from Somalia, 10 from Sierra Leone and 34 from
Ghana, the newspaper La Presse reported.
	   One boat left from a port near Ceuta and another left Libyan
waters to meet the first along the Tunisian coast, according to the
report. The captains had fled before the ships were seized.
	   Relations between Tunisia and Italy had strained over the summer
due to a resurgence in illegal emigration from North Africa. In
August, the two countries signed an agreement to repatriate illegal
immigrants who come from Tunisia.

	   VALKENBURG, Netherlands (AP) - Diana Ziliute, a 22-year-old
Lithuanian, surprised the veterans to capture the women's elite
road race Saturday at the World Cycling Championship.
	   Ziliute, who won the junior world title 1994, took the final
sprint over 28-year-old Leontien van Moorsel of the Netherlands,
who won the time trial title on Wednesday. German Hanka Kupfernagel
took third.
	   Ziliute's time was 2 hours, 35 minutes, 35 seconds. She rides
for an Italian team and has lived in Italy near Venice for three
years.
	   ``But, of course, for the world championships, I am
Lithuanian,'' Ziliute said in fluent Italian.
	   Defending champion, 30-year-old Alessandra Cappellotto of Italy
was fifth.
	   Jeannie Longo, a 12-time world champion who turns 40 at the end
of this month, was ninth after leading until the final sprint of
the 103.2-kilometer (64.1-mile) race.
	   The men's race is on Sunday, rounding off the six-day
competition.
	   American Lance Armstrong, in a comeback from cancer, is in a
small group of favorites for the men's title. He won the event in
1993 before having to miss the worlds the last two years after
being diagnosed with cancer.
	   Michele Bartoli and Andrea Tafi head the strong Italian team
with Michael Boogerd and Leon van Bon the top Dutch riders.
	   In the women's race, Ziliute was part of a small group that
broke away just after the start of the sixth and final lap of the
17.2-kilometer (10.7-mile) circuit.
	   Up the final steep climb, Longo led the small group and held the
lead into the final straightaway until the final sprint.
	   ``Nobody wanted to be in front. I am not a sprinter. I tried my
best to push very hard on the last hill to break away,'' Longo
said.
	   Then the main group passed her easily with Ziliute taking
control to win clearly, raising her arms in the air as she crossed
the line.
	   ``This year was incrediable , I had a great condition from the
very beginning until the very end,'' Ziliute said.
	   She recently won a World Cup race in the Netherlands.
	   ``Maybe the Netherlands is good luck for me. But also maybe the
weather. It was rainy, windy and cold. You find that in
Lithuania,'' she said.
	   Longo knew she was beaten when she couldn't shake the group.
	   ``I saw the other girls and I said to myself `No way,' '' Longo
said. ``To be third, fourth, fifth or eighth means nothing to me. I
was after the championship.''
	   Longo had won the road title in 1985, 1986, 1987, 1989 and 1995
in addition to three time trials and four track titles. She was
fifth in Wednesday's time trial.
	   Van Moorsel came on in the final meters to take second ahead of
Kupfernagel, who also took third in the time trial earlier in the
week.
	   Another Lithuanian, Rasa Polikeviciute was fourth, raising her
arm in triumph when she saw Ziliute winning.
	   Earlier Saturday Ireland's Mark Scanlon won the junior men's
event over 120.4 kilometers (75 miles)

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
Saturday of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly
softened his stand on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1991-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying the
alliance's preparations was helping Holbrooke's negotiating
efforts.
	   Solana said the final authorization of an attack would happen in
the next few days unless Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   While Milosevic had issued no new statements as of Saturday
evening, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to
the proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the unidentified spokesman told BBC Radio 4.
``We cannot understand this.''
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   ``This is an intense time,'' he added.
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and
Britain's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donnelly, accompanied
Holbrooke to Pristina. Hill then held more talks with ethnic
Albanians later.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   But holding talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both
sides: Milosevic would have to give up his full domination over the
southern Serbian province, and the Albanian side would have to
acknowledge that it might settle for less than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected the latest
U.S. proposal, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following
the latest carnage. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but
rejects the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic
Albanians, Serbian sources said.

Primakov: Early elections could lead to instability
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that
he opposed early presidential elections because they could lead to
instability in the country.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's opponents have been calling for the
president to step down, and some have tried to launch impeachment
proceedings against him.
	   On Thursday, parliamentary speaker Gennady Seleznyov suggested
holding a referendum on whether Yeltsin should resign, even though
such a move would violate Russian law.
	   Primakov told Russian reporters that early elections ``can
result in a situation which will not facilitate stabilization in
society,'' the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   ``On the contrary, it will lead to division and whip up
political passions,'' ITAR-Tass quoted him as saying.
	   Yeltsin has repeatedly affirmed his intention to serve out the
two years remaining in his term. He has also said he won't run
again in the 2000 elections.

favorite Marc Rosset in straight sets Saturday at the
f.XiFadLInq)?`kW.HR7doors, securjyLB%M1
J9''!2%91:!IB:%11jQ%%Q%9''+)Y7man.
	   Agassi received little resistance from the towering Swiss
power-server, cruising through his semifinal 6-4, 6-2 in just 54
minutes.
	   Henman, seeded sixth, booked his place in the final, edging
Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   ``The final should be a good one,'' said Agassi, who reached the
final without dropping a set. ``Henman seems to be a good indoors
player.
	   ``He'll pose a good challenge as an opponent and it should be an
entertaining final,'' Agassi said. ``It's nice to see player of Tim
Henman's class and professional style do so well.''
	   Agassi dominated the match from the very start, never giving
Rosset a chance to get into the match and stir up the support of
the 8,700 Swiss spectators crowded into the St Jakobshalle stadium.
	   The American broke Rosset's second serve in the opening set,
then served two consecutive love games in the second before
breaking to take a 4-2 lead.
	   ``I think I played very smart, very solidly,'' said Agassi.
``He's not an easy player to play. He's got a very powerful serve,
a very varied pace and he's unpredictable.''
	   Organizers breathed a sigh of relief as the two remaining seeded
players advanced to the final, after early round devastation saw
world No. 1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter as well as
Australian Open champion Petr Korda crash out.
	   Agassi, however, was not interested in names or numbers.
	   ``I'm not interested in playing Rafter or Pete,'' said Agassi.
``I want to play the best players and every week that changes.
	   ``This week Rafter and Pete weren't the best. Tim Henman was.''
	   Of course having Sampras drop out so early could also help
Agassi's chances of regaining the number one spot after three
years.
	   Currently ranked eighth in the world, the 28-year-old American,
who has just 68 points left to defend this season, is in a position
to finish the year as the world No. 1 in front of Sampras.
	   Agassi, who held the No. 1 ranking in the ATP back in April
1995, fell out of the top-100 at the end of 1997 for the first time
since he'd turned pro in 1985.
	   While Agassi has no Grand Slam or Super-9 titles this season,
his 56-13 match record is the best on the ATP Tour this season in
match victories and winning percentage.
	   ``I'm not interested in being No.1 at the end of the year,''
said Agassi, who won four titles this season, each without dropping
a set. ``I just want to establish myself as one of the best players
going into the Australian Open.
	   ``However, my main concern at the moment in Tim Henman.''
	   Agassi is currently fifth on the ``Road to Hannover'' standings,
and his victory over Rosset could help cement his place among the
top-eight, and secure the American a berth in the ATP Tour World
Championship next month.
	   Henman, who lost to Mark Philippossis in the semifinals last
year, extended his winning streak to 11 with his victory over
Johansson.

	   YEREVAN, Armenia (AP) _ Artashez Adamian missed just wide of the
right right post in the 81st minute, leaving Armenia with a 0-0
draw with Iceland in the second European Championship 2000
qualifier for both teams.
	   Armenia was more active in the first half of the game but failed
to break Iceland's defense.
	   It took more of the initiative when Tigran Yesaian, who scored
two goals in its first game against Andorra, entered as a
substitute in the 70th. He fed Adamian with a pinpoint pass in the
81st minute, but Adamian failed to finish.
	   The result before only 17,0000 in Ararat Stadium left Armenia
with a 1-1-0 record and four points in Group 4. The draw was
Iceland's second in two games.

Mandela: White farmers could help end killings in South Africa

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS to raise Mandela's assurances to white farmers &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday assured white farmers, frightened by hundreds of killings
of whites in rural areas, that there is no political campaign to
chase them from their farms.
	   Some of the attacks were motivated by revenge for the
exploitation of farmhands who still toil under apartheid-era
conditions, Mandela said at a summit on the violence. Improving
conditions for the black workers could help end the killings, he
said.
	   ``Elimination of poverty and inequality are the surest long-term
guarantee to eliminating crime, instability and intra-communal
tensions,'' he said.
	   About 80 white farmers have been killed so far this year,
fueling charges by the mainly white opposition parties that
Mandela's government is not concerned enough about the victims
because of their color.
	   In the most recent attack, an elderly farm couple died Friday
near Bloemfontein, about 250 miles south of Johannesburg. They had
ax wounds in their heads.
	   Since 1994, nearly 600 farmers have died in similar attacks.
Mandela said that in addition to the human suffering, the violence
could disrupt the country's ability to produce enough food to meets
its needs.
	   The government has created a rural security response system,
which includes volunteer commandos from the farms, in an attempt to
head off an increase in white vigilante groups.
	   Mandela said black workers should be included, but doubted their
willingness to defend farms where they suffer low pay, squalid
living conditions and abuse. Some black workers are chased off
their farms when they are too old for field labor even though they
have nowhere to go.
	   ``The conditions under which (black workers) live do affect the
way they respond in the event of an attack,'' Mandela said.
	   Although the government has passed laws guaranteeing residency
rights to farm laborers, many workers are unaware of their rights,
farm worker groups say.
	   ``We do not believe that farm workers are responsible for the
violence against farm owners but, under different circumstances,
they could become part of the solution,'' the Nkuzi Development
Association, one of the groups, said in a statement.
	   Mandela, 80, recuperating from exhaustion, disobeyed doctor's
orders to rest in order to deliver his 30-minute speech.
	   He spoke partly in Afrikaans, the language of the descendants of
Dutch and other European settlers that is widely spoken in rural
areas, to reassure farmers that ``there is definitely no political
campaign or attempt to drive whites, especially Afrikaners, from
their land.''
	   Mandela, elected in the all-race elections that ended apartheid
in 1994, said he was convinced that South Africans can stop the
violence.
	   ``Both black and white, Afrikaans- and English- speakers, have
worked to confound the prophets of doom who predicted the political
change could not occur without rivers of blood flowing,'' Mandela
said.

Humanitarian disaster in Kosovo must be averted, Kucan, Havel say
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The presidents of the Czech
Republic and Slovenia said Saturday they support any action that
would avert humanitarian disaster in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo, the news agency CTK reported.
	   ``In case the catastrophic developments (in Kosovo) are not
stopped, similar developments may happen in Albania and other
countries of the region,'' CTK quoted Slovenian President Milan
Kucan as saying after meeting his Czech counterpart Vaclav Havel in
the presidential residence in Lany outside Prague.
	   Kucan is on a visit in the Czech Republic.
	   Hundreds of people have been killed and hundreds of thousands
driven from their homes in Kosovo since Serbia launched its
crackdown on the ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army on Feb. 28.
	   NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said Saturday that Serb
forces were not meeting international demands for a withdrawal from
Kosovo, and warned the alliance was close to giving the order to
launch air strikes.
	   According to CTK, Havel supported possible NATO strikes, saying
that if an agreement cannot be reached by political means it is
necessary to use force to make the parties negotiate.
	   But in an interview with Czech radio also Saturday, Havel noted
the strikes would be unnecessary should politicians act earlier.
	   ``My basic feeling is that the world again noticed too late what
is going on (in Kosovo),'' Havel said. ``For the last fifteen
years, any alert observer must have known something would happen
there.''
	   ``Why do we make the same mistakes all the time?'' he asked.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st minute
Saturday to give World Cup champion France a 3-2 win over Russia in
a Group 4 European qualifier in Moscow.
	   The World Cup champions opened last month with a disappointing
1-1 draw with Iceland and Russia lost 3-2 to Ukraine.
	   In another key match Saturday, England slumped to a 0-0 draw
against Bulgaria, leaving both clubs without a win in their first
two matches.
	   The scoreless draw in Group 5 is bound to increase the pressure
on England coach Glenn Hoddle, who has been widely criticized for
the club's play following a 2-1 loss last month in Sweden.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Billy Dodds scored his second goal in
the 84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia in Group 9. Dodds came off the bench and scored his first a
minute after taking the field to level at 1-1 in the 70th.
	   Maksim Smirnov gave Estonia took the lead in the 76th, but
Scotland leveled again at 2-2 on an Estonian own-goal by Sergei
Hohlov-Simson in the 78th. Hohlov-Simpson scored for Estonia in the
35th.
	   Elsewhere in early games Saturday _ a day of 20 qualifiers:
	   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Keith Rowland scored in the 31st
minute as Northern Ireland beat Finland 1-0 in Group 3. The win
atoned for Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro
opener last month. Finland beat Moldova 3-2 last month.
	   In Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Slovakia defeated Liechtenstein 4-0 in
a Group 7 match with two goals from Robert Tomaschek and one each
from Miroslav Sovic and Peter Dubuvsky.
	   In Baku, Azerbaijan, Hungary won 4-0 in Group 7 with goals from
Pal Dardai, Bela Illes, Istvan Pisont and Miklos Feher.
	   In Yerevan, Armenia, Armenia and Iceland played a 0-0 tie in
Group 4 before 17,000 in Ararat stadium.

	   VALLETTA, Malta (AP) _ Croatia came from behind to beat modest
Malta 4-1 on Saturday in a Group 8 qualifying match for the 2000
European Championship.
	   The Maltese, who have usually served as a punching bag for
Europe's top teams, parried admirably and often caught the Croat
backline dozing off. But they crumbled after the interval despite a
1-0 lead earned by Hubert Suda on a 28th-minute penalty kick.
	   The Croats, who were forced to field a below optimal-strength
side due to injuries and suspensions, struggled to recover from the
early blow and were unable to take control until coach Miroslav
Blazevic reshuffled his ranks at the break.
	   Defender Dario Simic traveled forward and hit the Maltese net
with a header in the 54th minute. Davor Vugrinec, making his debut,
scored twice in the next 20 minutes, while master poacher and World
Cup top scorer, Davor Suker, added the final goal with a crisp
header in the 80th minute.
	   Croatia won third place in the World Cup in France last summer,
but the early hiccups against Malta revealed that the side has had
trouble maintaining the form that vaulted it to the top of world
soccer. Croatia lost to the Republic of Ireland 2-0 in its opening
qualifying match.

Question No. 1: How bipartisan is bipartisanship?
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; An AP News Analysis &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Bipartisanship, said Rep. Henry Hyde, the man
in charge of the House's newly authorized impeachment inquiry, is
essential or else ``the end product will not be trusted.''
	   On a different day, the Illinois Republican declared as the two
parties clashed over the release of President Bill Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony that bipartisanship ``doesn't
include surrender to everything the Democrats want.''
	   Reconciling those declarations is likely to occupy a substantial
amount of Hyde's energy in coming weeks as he presides over an
ideologically and politically divided Judiciary Committee embarking
on the third serious impeachment proceeding in the nation's
history.
	   At the end of the committee's work, according to lawmakers and
senior aides, none of whom was willing to speak for attribution,
the Republican-controlled panel is likely to approve articles of
impeachment against the president. They will probably center on
allegations of perjury and obstruction of justice, and the vote
could well occur along party lines.
	   Any such decision is several weeks off.
	   First come the lawyers' arguments over which witnesses to
subpoena, what facts are in dispute and other issues.
	   Then come midterm elections Nov. 3.
	   Hearings likely will begin a few weeks later, after both parties
have had a chance to digest results of the balloting and decide
what, if any, changes to make in their approaches.
	   A strong showing by Republicans could cause some Democrats in
the committee or the full House to show a willingness to reach
across party lines on impeachment. A weak showing by the GOP, on
the other hand, could cause some Republicans to flinch from
impeachment, and spark fresh talk of censure or some other lesser
punishment.
	   ``If there are Democratic gains, I think that's a signal,'' Hyde
told reporters late last week. ``If there are Republican gains,
that's a signal. If it's status quo, that's not a signal'' from the
public.
	   Nor can the committee predict Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr's plans. Last week, he wrote Hyde and Rep. John Conyers, the
panel's ranking Democrat, that his investigation continues.
Indictments are also a possibility.
	   In early phases of the impeachment review, Republicans have been
eager to make gestures in the direction of the Democrats without
compromising on their twin demands for an inquiry unlimited in
either time or subject.
	   For their part, Democrats have made clear their disapproval of
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, at the same time
depicting Republicans as conducting a partisan investigation. It's
a strategy driven in part by a desire to increase interest in the
coming elections among core Democratic voters who might otherwise
stay home on Nov. 3.
	   ``Democrats who support a continuation of the inquiry but with a
firm 30-day limit substantially improve their position in the race
for Congress,'' according to poll results released last week for
Emily's List, an organization of Democratic women.
	   ``Democrats who vote to support going forward with the inquiry
get hurt in their races,'' according to this analysis, shared with
Democratic leaders in the hours before the House vote.
	   In last week's vote on the House floor, only 31 of 206 Democrats
voted for the Republicans' open-ended inquiry after the party's
leader, Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, worked out an alternative
plan that satisfied both liberals and conservatives in the caucus.
	   ``It was generally perceived as a partisan vote,'' said one
Democratic aide, speaking with satisfaction, after the 258-176
tally.
	   Neither Speaker Newt Gingrich, the man Democrats love to attack,
nor Majority Leader Dick Armey spoke on the issue from the floor,
while both Gephardt and Democratic Whip David Bonior did.
	   In his remarks, Gephardt said to Republicans, ``This should not
be a party vote.''
	   ``Under the Republican plan, Congress will spend the next two
years mired in hearings, tangled in testimony, and grinding its
gears in partisan stalemate,'' said Bonior.
	   Several sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bonior
suggested after Republicans insisted on limiting debate to an hour
on the impeachment inquiry that Democrats protest by boycotting the
official photograph of the 105th Congress being staged on the House
floor that morning.
	   Hyde, who has declared a ``New Year's Resolution'' to wrap up
his work by the end of the year, agreed to double debate time to
two hours, without compromising on terms of the investigation.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Gustavo Petricioli Iturbide, who served as
Mexico's treasury secretary during the debt crisis of the 1980s and
was later ambassador to the United States, died Saturday.
	   Petricioli, 70, died of a heart attack at Los Angeles Hospital
in Mexico City, the government news agency Notimex reported.
	   President Miguel de la Madrid named Petricioli as treasury
secretary in June 1986, at a time when Mexico's foreign debt was
near dlrs 100 billion, largely as a result of the collapse of oil
prices at the start of the decade.
	   He served as ambassador to the United States from January 1989
to January 1993 during the administration of President Carlos
Salinas de Gortari, when Mexico negotiated the restructuring of its
debt.
	   During that period, Mexico also began negotiations with the
United States and Canada on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, the trade bloc which began Jan. 1, 1994.
	   Petricioli, who held a master's degree from Yale University,
also held positions at the Nacional Financiera development bank and
the Bank of Mexico.
	   He is survived by his mother and four children.

	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ For the first time in years, orphans at a
center in Bulgaria's capital see pot-holed streets around their
home repaired and clean. The reason: U.S. First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton visits them Sunday.
	   The orphanage is the second stop during a two-day visit to Sofia
by Mrs. Clinton, who flew out of Washington on Saturday. After her
arrival Sunday morning, she also is scheduled to address an
international women's conference.
	   From Bulgaria, the first lady travels to Prague on Monday to
meet Czech leaders and speak at a wide-ranging conference set up by
President Vaclav Havel and Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.
	   The women's meeting in Sofia will focus on their role in
identifying and dealing with the economic and social issues
southeastern Europe will face during the next century. Mrs.
Clinton's participation is based on years of active involvement in
advocating women's economic and human rights.
	   Later Sunday, Mrs. Clinton was to participate in a roundtable
discussion with representatives of of non-governmental
organizations on issues of civic participation, human rights and
social investment. In the evening she will attend a reception and
dinner with Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov and his wife,
Antonina Stoyanova.
	   Monday morning Mrs. Clinton is to appear at a forum with women
entrepreneurs on small business development at a local croissant
factory. Later she will visit the American College in Sofia and
speak to students.
	   The orphanage, called the Faith, Hope and Love Center, is run by
the Free and Democratic Bulgaria Foundation of John Dimitry
Panitza, a Bulgarian-born U.S. businessman, with the cooperation of
the British charity Child Hope. It currently hosts 20 children,
mainly from Bulgaria's 300,000-strong Gypsy minority.
	   ``We are happy that we were selected to host America's first
lady and we are eager to meet her,'' said center director Nadya
Nedkova.
	   Since 1993, foundation teams have been working with homeless
children in Sofia, providing them with food, clothes, medical aid
and hospital treatment.
	   The teams also organized literacy classes and games for the
children, advised them on crime, sex, drug addiction, smoking and
human values.
	   Since the center opened in a municipal building in 1995,
children included in the program have been given the opportunity to
choose whether they want to stay out in the street or join the
home, where the receive proper shelter, care and education.
	   ``I am very much pleased with conditions here,'' said
14-year-old Stefka Trayanova, whose parents were unable to care for
their 10 children. ``We are all proud that Mrs. Clinton is coming
to see us.''

<TEXT>
	   GAUHATI, India (AP) _ Armed with crude guns and poison-tipped
bows and arrows, tribespeople in India's insurgency-torn northeast
killed five forest guards and stole weapons from a forest camp
Saturday, police said.
	   The killings came after 17 people were killed overnight in
tribal clashes in the remote Darrang district of the mountainous
Assam state _ killings that came while a federal panel toured the
area in a law and order assessment.
	   At least 50 members of the minority Santhal tribe stormed the
Budubadha forest department camp in a tea garden in the Kokrajhar
district, about 1,000 miles east of New Delhi, and seized 16
rifles, police said.
	   The Santhals' efforts to arm themselves could lead to more
attacks against its rival, the majority Bodo tribe, police said.
Bloody skirmishes since 1996 between the two tribes have left 1,000
dead on both sides, officials say.
	   Members of the separatist Bodo Liberation Tiger Force and the
National Democratic Front of Bodoland were suspected in the killing
in Darrang, Press Trust of India reported. The guerrillas want to
carve out a separate Bodoland from Indian territory for the Bodos,
who consist of nearly 1.2 million of Assam's 22 million people.
	   The assailants in Darrang came armed with automatic weapons and
attacked three villages late Friday night killing 14 people in four
separate incidents. Two men and a woman were killed early on
Saturday, PTI said.
	   The victims included members of the majority Hindu community and
a linguistic minority, the Times of India said.
	   Officials in the state capital Gauhati told the visiting
parliamentary team that there has been no let up in violence in the
state.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Saturday that if NATO uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo
crisis, Russia may have to revise its relationship with the western
alliance, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said that Russia was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation in an interview with the NTV television station.
	   He was referring to a U.N. Security Council resolution, which
was approved on March 31, which imposed an arms embargo on
Yugoslavia. Russia was a party to that resolution.
	   ``We can't throw away a fraternal nation in such a situation,''
Ivashov said.
	   Primakov reiterated that Russia would use its veto in the U.N.
Security Council to prevent airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The Czech Republic clinched
a 3-1 away victory at Bosnia-Herzegovina on Saturday and firmed up
its lead in the qualifying Group 9 for the 2000 European
Championship.
	   The Czechs took the lead in the 12th minute on a magnificent
shot by Miroslav Baranjek from more than 25 meters (yards).
	   Pressing for an equalizer, Bosnia missed a few good chances and
conceded a second goal after a swift counter-attack in 59th minute
that ended with a header by Vladimir Smicer.
	   A Bosnian substitute, Marko Topic, provided a glimpse of hope
for the home-team, netting in the 88th minute after one of the rare
well-organized attacks.
	   But in the last moments of the match, Patrik Berger scored the
third goal from a free-kick from some 19 meters (yards). The ball
deflected off another Czech player, Pavel Kuka.
	   Although Bosnia had the initiative throughout the match, the
Czech Republic dominated with smart defense, good combinations in
midfield and fast counter-attacks.
	   ``We were playing against a super-strong team,'' admitted
Bosnian coach Dzemaludin Musovic after the match. He said the final
result ``may be showing the real difference between the two
teams.''
	   At the end of the match, more than 30,000 spectators applauded
the Czechs and booed their own national team.
	   Bosnia-Herzegovina and Czech Republic play in the group together
with Scotland, Faeroe Islands, Estonia and Litvania.

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Northern Ireland defended a
one-goal lead for an hour Saturday before clinching a 1-0 win over
Finland in the Group 3 Euro 2000 qualifier.
	   Keith Rowland scored his first international goal in the 31st
minute to claim the only goal of the match.
	   The Queens Park Rangers midfielder received a pass from Michael
Hughes and beat a defender before firing a left-footed shot past
Antti Niemi and into the far corner of the net.
	   Hughes almost added a second goal minutes later with a fierce
shot from near the goal area but Niemi pushed the ball wide.
	   The win atoned for Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey
in its Euro opener in Istanbul.
	   Finland, which beat Moldova 3-2 in its Euro opener, had ample
chances but Northern Ireland's Alan Fettis _ a third-choice
goalkeeper at Premier League team Blackburn Rovers _ proved he was
up to the task.
	   Lineups:
	   Northern Ireland: Alan Fettis, Aaron Hughes, Kevin Horlock,
Darren Patterson, Steve Morrow, Neil Lennon, Philip Mulryne, Keith
Gillespie, Keith Rowland, Michael Hughes, Iain Dowie.
	   Finland: Antti Niemi, Harri Ylonen, Juha Reini, Sami Hyypia,
Tommi Kautonen, Mika-Matti Paatelainen, Aki Riihilahti, Jari Ilola,
Simo Valkari, Joonas Kolkka, Jonatan Johansson.

Expletive-ridden poem by late Beatle John Lennon sold at auction
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A foul-mouthed poem written by the late Beatle
John Lennon earned 3,352 pounds (dlrs 5,350) at auction Saturday
for the fan who received it almost 30 years ago.
	   The typed work, made up of a four-letter expletive repeated 104
times and the single word ``you,'' was sent to poet Susan Baker in
1969 after she wrote to Lennon requesting a poem. Signed and titled
by Lennon and countersigned by his wife, Yoko Ono, it consists of
the four-letter word arranged in seven columns with ``you'' at the
center of the middle column.
	   The sale price included a cover letter in Lennon's handwriting
which read:
	   ``Dear Susan, here's the poem you wanted _ you can publish ...
but not make a record of it _ for it turns into a song then _ OK?''
	   Auctioneers Finan and Co. said Saturday that the buyer wished to
remain anonymous and left the auction shortly after the sale at a
hotel in Mere, western England.
	   Ms. Baker was the manager of a band called the Barrow Poets,
which offered performances of both poetry and music.

	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said
they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers from
a strategic airport facing a rebel assault.
	   A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being
evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of
Kinshasa. Neither claims could be confirmed independently.
	   Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management
committee speaking in Kinshasa, said a missile hit the rear engine
of the Boeing jet after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport.

rebels had deployed at least two surface-to-air missiles and more
than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final assault on the
government-held town.
	   ``The plane was hit by a missile that was fired by rebels,''
Papaioannou, citing initial airline and government reports on the

Italy's president starts consultations toward forming next
</HEADLINE>
government &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ President Oscar Luigi opened consultations with
leaders of Parliament on Saturday about picking Italy's next
premier. No clear front-runners emerged for the job _ and the old
premier made a show of running away from it.
	   Romano Prodi's center-left coalition fell in a failed vote of
confidence in Parliament on Friday. He said Saturday he would take
the job back only if his new government could stick to the policies
of its old one _ and only if it was feasible given the situation in
Italy's divided parliament.
	   ``It seems to me that neither of these two conditions exist,''
Prodi told reporters.
	   He didn't say what it would take to change those conditions to
his satisfaction, or flatly rule out taking back the post. His
Olive Tree coalition said it would nominate him for a new stint
when its leaders meet with Scalfaro on Tuesday.
	   Scalfaro started talks with leaders of the Senate and the
Chamber of Deputies on Saturday and will meet with leaders of
Italy's political parties on Monday and Tuesday.
	   At some point, he must decide whether to ask Prodi or someone
else to try to muster a new governing majority in Parliament or
call new elections _ something few think likely.
	   One possibility is naming a temporary government of nonpartisan
technocrats. Such a government would get Italy's parliament through
the volatile period of approving the 1999 budget _ and allow
inflamed political tempers to cool.
	   The collapse of Prodi's center-left government came as something
of a surprise. Its far-left ally, the Communist Refoundation, had
forced Friday's confidence vote when it withdrew its support for
the government, saying its proposed budget didn't do enough to
create jobs.
	   Prodi seemed to have won over enough Communists to make it _ and
he would have, if not for the sudden defection of a lawmaker in his
coalition.
	   He offered his resignation but Scalfaro asked him to stay on for
the interim.
	   Prodi said Saturday that Italy had to move quickly to fill the
vacuum at the center of its politics. The political crisis hit at a
time when Italy must decide whether to take part in any NATO strike
on Kosovo.
	   ``Stability is essential. This is a country that has recovered
its stability and unity,'' Prodi said. ``I hope that this crisis
will be resolved in a hurry because we are badly harmed by the
unstable situation of the past two days.''
	   Prodi presided over cost cuts that got Italy into the debut of
the Europe's common currency, outlasting all but one other
post-World War II Italian government in the process.

	   In August, several civilian CAL aircraft were taken over by
rebel fighters in eastern Congo after they launched their rebellion
against President Laurent Kabila. The planes were used to shuttle
soldiers to western Congo near the capital.
	   Papaioannou said the CAL jet had been recaptured by the
government side and was being used to ferry civilians in Kindu to
safety. The rebel commander said the plane was shot as it was
approaching the airport to land.
	   Arthur Mulunda, a rebel brigade commander, said his men had
deployed two SAM-7 missiles to prevent government aircraft from
flying in reinforcements and supplies.
	   Rebel aircraft from the eastern stronghold in Goma 380
kilometers (235 miles) to the northeast made at least eight flights
to Kalima's grass air strip Saturday carrying ammunition and
troops. All supplies and troops are then trucked to the frontline
at Kindu, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Kalima.

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING TO FIX GARBLE &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS, UPDATES with Agassi/Rosset match
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seed Andre Agassi defeated home
favorite Marc Rosset in straight sets Saturday to advance to the
finals against Tim Henman of Britain at the dlrs 1 million Swiss
Indoors.
	   Agassi received little resistance from the towering Swiss
power-server, cruising through his semifinal 6-4, 6-2 in just 54
minutes.
	   Henman, seeded sixth, booked his place in the final, edging
Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   ``The final should be a good one,'' said Agassi, who reached the
final without dropping a set. ``Henman seems to be a good indoors
player.
	   ``He'll pose a good challenge as an opponent and it should be an
entertaining final,'' Agassi said. ``It's nice to see player of Tim
Henman's class and professional style do so well.''
	   Agassi dominated the match from the very start, never giving
Rosset a chance to get into the match and stir up the support of
the 8,700 Swiss spectators crowded into the St Jakobshalle stadium.
	   The American broke Rosset's second serve in the opening set,
then served two consecutive love games in the second before
breaking to take a 4-2 lead.
	   ``I think I played very smart, very solidly,'' said Agassi.
``He's not an easy player to play. He's got a very powerful serve,
a very varied pace and he's unpredictable.''
	   Organizers breathed a sigh of relief as the two remaining seeded
players advanced to the final, after early round devastation saw
world No. 1 Pete Sampras and world No. 2 Patrick Rafter as well as
Australian Open champion Petr Korda crash out.
	   Agassi, however, was not interested in names or numbers.
	   ``I'm not interested in playing Rafter or Pete,'' said Agassi.
``I want to play the best players and every week that changes.
	   ``This week Rafter and Pete weren't the best. Tim Henman was.''
	   Of course having Sampras drop out so early could also help
Agassi's chances of regaining the number one spot after three
years.
	   Currently ranked eighth in the world, the 28-year-old American,
who has just 68 points left to defend this season, is in a position
to finish the year as the world No. 1 in front of Sampras.
	   Agassi, who held the No. 1 ranking in the ATP back in April
1995, fell out of the top-100 at the end of 1997 for the first time
since he'd turned pro in 1985.
	   While Agassi has no Grand Slam or Super-9 titles this season,
his 56-13 match record is the best on the ATP Tour this season in
match victories and winning percentage.
	   ``I'm not interested in being No.1 at the end of the year,''
said Agassi, who won four titles this season, each without dropping
a set. ``I just want to establish myself as one of the best players
going into the Australian Open.
	   ``However, my main concern at the moment in Tim Henman.''
	   Agassi is currently fifth on the ``Road to Hannover'' standings,
and his victory over Rosset could help cement his place among the
top-eight, and secure the American a berth in the ATP Tour World
Championship next month.
	   Henman, who lost to Mark Philippossis in the semifinals last
year, extended his winning streak to 11 with his victory over
Johansson.

Armani sticks to his conservative fashion guns
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos &QL; 
 &UR; By DANIELA PETROFF &QC; 
 &UR; AP Fashion Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - No matter that his hair is almost white, and
his favorite blue T-shirt no longer lies flat on the torso, Giorgio
Armani is still what the ``moda Milanese'' is all about.
	   His fashion is neither rock glam nor yuppie minimal. It is about
allowing women to express their own style by offering them sensible
feminine clothes in luxurious fabrics, with an almost obsessive
attention to detail.
	   When upscale Italian ready-to-wear burst onto the international
runway 20 years ago, he was hailed as a master of the new tailored
look, inspired by the way the stylish Milanese dressed.
	   Muted shades were a must; the jacket was all important.
	   Over the years the Milanese runway has seen everything from
Asian austerity, to Los Angeles glamour, to the bare bottoms and
bosoms that resulted in the consecration of underwear as outer
wear.
	   But throughout, Giorgio has stuck to his conservative feminine
guns, and today he still gets away with it.
	   His latest spring-summer 1999 presentation in his downtown
Milanese palazzo Saturday was an ode to contemporary good taste.
	   While many decree the demise of the jacket, Giorgio offers one
no woman can refuse: lightweight and deconstructed to resemble a
cardigan, with a skinny lapel and single invisible fastening.
Underneath, he suggests a simple silk T-shirt, or a chiffon
collarless blouse.
	   Trousers, all in soft fabrics, run the gamut from man-tailored
to cigarette. A thin tulle skirt covering adds an extra feminine
touch.
	   For daytime, the colors never get any brighter than light gray,
but nighttime comes alive in a myriad of hand-embroidered sequins
and glass beads on soft aquamarine, deep pink and glowing orange
organza.
	   The evening gown is unfussy and strapless, embroidered in
delicate Chinese patterns. The neckline dips but never plunges, the
back is bare, but stops in a square cut just below the waistline.
	   The latest Armani sandal is sure to be the rage next summer. The
glass-beaded thong, with comfortable rubber sole, was shown with
his evening wear, but could do a lot for a simple pair of jeans.
	   The quiet music that accompanied the show, the last of the nine
day spring-summer 1999 Milan preview showings, was a fitting
reminder that you don't have to blare out your fashion message to
be heard.

	   Mulunda said rebels controlled three-quarters of the perimeter
around Kindu. He said a corridor leading southwest out of the town
had been left open for the civilian population to flee and escape
possible casualties.
	   After six days of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters _ ethnic
Tutsis and disenchanted soldiers in Congolese army backed up by
neighboring Rwanda _ had made little progress and failed to capture
the town outright.
	   The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt
against President Laurent Kabila, whom they accuse of
mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400
tribes.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counter-offensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo. There
are unconfirmed reports that Chadian and Sudanese troops are
involved in the defense of Kindu.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ his erstwhile allies who
installed him in power in May 1997 after an earlier eight-month
rebellion _ of sponsoring the new rebellion.
	   Both countries say they have legitimite security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila's side. The assistance was essential in routing
an early rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts
of Kinshasa in mid-August.

Malaysian delegation arrives in Chechnya
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ A Malaysian trade and economic delegation met with
the president of breakaway Chechnya on Saturday, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The 10-member delegation is headed by Tansali Usman, the chief
adviser to Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad. It traveled
to Chechnya to discuss several economic projects with President
Aslan Maskhadov and other officials, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Such official visits are rare in Chechnya, which has been
plagued by kidnappings and other crime since the end of its 1994-96
war of independence against Russia.

Congolese rebels say they shot down government plane

<TEXT>
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said
they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into
a strategic airport facing a rebel assault.
	   A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being
evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of
Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed independently.
	   Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management
committee, said a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing jet
after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport.
	   A rebel military commander, who requested anonymity, said the
the plane was carrying troops, although he did not explain how he
knew this.
	   He said plane was shot down while approaching Kindu air base,
where the rebels had deployed at least two surface-to-air missiles
and more than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final assault on
the government-held town.
	   Papaioannou, citing initial airline and government reports on
the crash, said the plane was hit about three minutes after
takeoff.''
	   The pilot struggled to bring the plane around for an emergency
landing before sending a final notice that the aircraft would not
make it back to the airport, the airline executive told The
Associated Press in Kinshasa.
	   In August, several civilian CAL aircraft were taken over by
rebel fighters in eastern Congo after they launched their rebellion
against President Laurent Kabila. The planes were used to shuttle
soldiers to western Congo near the capital.
	   Papaioannou said the CAL jet had been recaptured by the
government side and was being used to ferry civilians in Kindu to
safety.
	   Earlier Saturday, Arthur Mulunda, a rebel brigade commander,
said his men had deployed two SAM-7 missiles to prevent government
aircraft from flying in reinforcements and supplies.
	   Rebel aircraft from the eastern stronghold in Goma 380
kilometers (235 miles) to the northeast made at least eight flights
to Kalima's grass air strip Saturday carrying ammunition and
troops. All supplies and troops are then trucked to the frontline
at Kindu, 80 kilometers (50 miles) southwest of Kalima.
	   Mulunda said rebels controlled three-quarters of the perimeter
around Kindu. He said a corridor leading southwest out of the town
had been left open for the civilian population to flee and escape
possible casualties.
	   After six days of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters _ ethnic
Tutsis and disenchanted soldiers in Congolese army backed up by
neighboring Rwanda _ had made little progress and failed to capture
the town outright.
	   The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt

mismanagement, corruption and warmongering among Congo's 400

	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a

are unconfirmed reports that Chadian and Sudanese troops are

	   Both countries say they have legitimite security interests in

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There were no surprises Saturday at the World
Equestrian Games as the best 25 riders competed for the
show-jumping final four spots.
	   Brazilian Rodrigo Pessoa made it in the top four, along with
World Champion Franke Sloothaak, who led Germany to the
show-jumping team title on Thursday; Olympic silver medalist Willi
Melliger of Switzerland; and France's Thierry Pomel.
	   Acclaimed by the Roman crowd, Pessoa finished with 9.92
penalties on bay Gandini Lianos.
	   Pessoa, the son of veteran Nelson Pessoa, has made his
equestrian career on the European circuit. Last April, he won the
Volvo World Cup show-jumping final.
	   Sloothaak, on San Patrignano Joly, arrived second with 10.39,
ahead of Willi Melliger on grey Calvaro V, who scored 10.65 penalty
points.
	   Thierry Pomel on Thor Des Chaines scored 12.40 to take the last
spot.
	   Aliston Firestone, the only American who had qualified in the
best 25, ended 14th, with 24.24. She rode bay Major.
	   The individual competition ends Sunday with the spectacular
final test where four finalists engage in a direct confrontation,
mounting each other's horses.
	   On the teams' side, Germany had won the gold medal, while France
arrived second and Britain clinched the bronze.
	   Earlier in the day, Werner Ulrich of Switzerland won the
individual driving event while the Netherlands took the gold in the
driving team competition.
	   Germany's Michael Freund, the 1994 World Champion at The Hague,
Netherlands, placed second. Dutch Ton Monhemius put it an
exceptional performance in the obstacles, the event's final test,
to clinch the bronze.
	   Ulrich made no mistakes Saturday and ended the competition with
a total of 141.02 penalty points, compared to Freund's 142.12 and
Monehmius' 142.92.
	   The best U.S. rider was Tucker Johnson, who placed fifth,
totaling 151.48 penalties.
	   James Fairclough finished 14th with 169.52 penalties, while Sam
Groenewould scored 182.84 to finish in the 20th position.
	   The Netherlands won the team driving competition with 286.08
penalties. Germany clinched the silver with 297.72 ahead of Sweden
which scored 303.20.
	   The United States was 5th with 321.00 penalties.
	   Driving, a discipline where carriages compete through a
difficult course filled with obstacles, was held in Pratoni del
Vivaro, 50 kilometers (30 miles) southeast of Rome, at a track
inaugurated during the Rome 1960 Olympic Games.
	   Held at three sites, the World Equestrian Games so far have
handed out 10 titles in five disciplines, including the Olympic
events of dressage, three-day-event and jumping.
	   Germany, which dominated the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, showed again
its strength in Rome, totaling so far 10 medals, including 5 gold
medals.
	   The Netherlands has won four titles, while the United States has
won three medals, as have France, Sweden and New Zealand.

Journalists, Palestinians: settlers opened fire on us
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers in the West Bank
opened fire Saturday in the direction of Israeli journalists,
seized a TV camera and assaulted Palestinian farmers, the
journalists and farmers said.
	   A settlers spokesman denied the charges.
	   The three Israelis, a reporter, a TV cameraman and a director,
were visiting olive groves near the Palestinian village of Hawara,
reporter Amira Hess told The Associated Press.
	   The Palestinians accused residents of the nearby settlement of
Yitzhar of harassing them whenever they enter the groves or try to
harvest the olives, she said.
	   Seeing the group, a settler opened fire with an automatic weapon
but nobody was hit, Hess said. ``He was firing bursts straight at
us from a distance of about 250 meters (yards), Hess said.
	   Settlers then rushed the group, punched one of the Palestinians,
hit another with a rifle butt and seized the camera'' said Hess,
who works for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
	   Israeli soldiers and police arrived on the scene and the
journalists and Palestinians withdrew. The camera was not returned.
	   The spokesman of Yitzhar, Yigal Amitai, said ``I know of no
shooting, nor seizure of a camera.'' He said the group were
trespassing.
	   Two months ago one of the settlers was shot dead by suspected
Palestinian attackers.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened
his stand Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
broke similar promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, and violated a
pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive against ethnic
Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours.
	   His visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels. He final
authorization would happen in the next few days unless Milosevic
complies fully with demands.
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both sides:
Milosevic would have to give up his full domination over the
southern Serbian province; and the Albanian side would have to
acknowledge that it might settle for less than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected the latest
U.S. proposal, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following
the latest carnage. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but
rejects the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic
Albanians, Serbian sources said.

Latvia wins 1-0 to stay unbeaten in Group 2
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Latvia followed its shock victory over
Norway with an impressive 1-0 victory over Georgia Saturday to stay
atop the Group 2 European Championship standings.
	   On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia came out charging and
scored only three minutes into the match with a brilliant corner
kick by Marian Pahar that was deftly tapped in by Andrei Shtolcer.
	   Despite falling behind early, Georgia continued to play a
defensive game until the start of the second half. The Georgians
had two chances in the opening minutes of the second half, but
Latvian goalie Oleg Karavajev got hold of the wet ball to save the
game.
	   Towards the end of the second half, the Latvians went into
defensive mode to protect the victory.
	   The game drew only 2,000 fans.
	   Lineups:
	   Latvia: Oleg Karavajev, Viktor Lukashevich, Vitalii Astafjev,
Mihail Zemlinskii, Valentin Lobanyev, Aleksei Sharando, Valerii
Ivanov, Imants Bleidelis, Marian Pahar, Vladimir Babichev, Andrei
Shtolcer.

Journalists, Palestinians: settlers opened fire on us
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   YITZHAR, West Bank (AP) _ Jewish settlers in the West Bank
opened fire Saturday in the direction of Israeli journalists,
seized a TV camera and assaulted Palestinian farmers, the
journalists and farmers said.
	   A settler spokesman denied the charges.
	   The three Israelis _ a reporter, a TV cameraman and a director _
were visiting olive groves near the Palestinian village of Hawara,
reporter Amira Hess told The Associated Press.
	   The Palestinians accused residents of the nearby settlement of
Yitzhar of harassing them whenever they enter the groves or try to
harvest the olives, she said.
	   Seeing the group, a settler opened fire with an automatic weapon
but nobody was hit, Hess said.
	   ``He was firing bursts straight at us from a distance of about
250 meters (yards), she said.
	   Settlers then rushed the group, punched one of the Palestinians,
hit another with a rifle butt and seized the camera,'' said Hess,
who works for the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.
	   Israeli soldiers and police arrived on the scene and the
journalists and Palestinians withdrew. The camera was not returned.
	   Yitzhar spokeman Yigal Amitai, said ``I know of no shooting, nor
seizure of a camera.'' He said the group was trespassing.

	   BURSA, Turkey (AP) _ Germany, the defending champion, stumbled
1-0 in Turkey on Saturday in its opening qualifier for the 2000
European Championship, falling victim to a curious goal by Hakan
Sukur.
	   The Germans, with a vastly reshuffled team from this summer's
World Cup because of injuries and retirements, failed to equalize
although Turkey played the last 18 minutes of the match with 10
men, following the expulsion of Tayfun Korkut.
	   Turkey picked up its second victory in as many games in Group 3,
while Germany now faces an uphill battle in trying to win the pool.
	   It was a bitter disappointment for the new German coach Erich
Ribbeck, whose team missed several good opportunities in the second
halftime.
	   In the 70th minute, Abdullah Ercan sent in a long-traveling
cross, German goalkeeper Oliver Kahn raced out to go for it but
collided with his libero Jens Nowotny. With the ball bouncing
around, Kahn fumbled another attempt to punch it away, landing the
ball onto Hakan's head.
	   The Turkish striker's header bounced off the post, hit the
clumsy Kahn and rolled over the line.
	   After a largely uneventful first halftime, Germany had more
chances in the second half.
	   New German captain Oliver Bierhoff forced Turkish goalkeeper
Rustu Rencbar into an acrobatic save in the 59th, and the Milan
striker was close to the target again off the ensuing corner.
	   Two minutes later, Bierhoff set up Ulf Kirsten, who failed to
control the ball well enough for a decent shot.
	   With 10 minutes left, Lars Ricken's long-range shot was
deflected by Rustu.
	   Rustu had made a good save early in the match by tipping over
the bar Joerg Heinrich's header.
	   Before 20,000 fans, referee Hugh Dallas of Scotland booked
Markus Babbel, Marko Rehmer and Jens Jeremies of Germany, while
Tayfun was sent off in the 72nd for his second yellow card.
	   ``It was an unfortunate goal,'' Ribbeck said. ``We created our
chances but we didn't use them. Still I think we deserved a draw.''

Forest fires threaten Siberian tigers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two forest fires raging in Russia's Far East are
posing a threat to the endangered Siberian tigers, the ITAR-Tass
news agency reported Saturday.
	   The fires are racing through the Sikhote-Alin wildlife reserve,
about 6,500 kilometers (4,060 miles) east of Moscow. The sanctuary
is the main breeding ground for the big cats, also known as white
or Amur tigers, ITAR-Tass said.
	   Only about 435 to 465 of the animals exist, down from 1,000 at
the turn of the century, according to the World Wide Fund for
Nature.
	   A firefighting official in the region said that winds were
pushing the fires up the mountains and driving tigers from their
habitat, ITAR-Tass said.

Primakov: If NATO uses force in Kosovo, Russia will rethink ties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from top military official. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said
Saturday that if NATO uses force to try to resolve the Kosovo
crisis, Russia may have to revise its relationship with the western
alliance, Russian news agencies reported.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said that Russia was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation in an interview with the NTV television station.
	   He was referring to a U.N. Security Council resolution, which
was approved on March 31, which imposed an arms embargo on
Yugoslavia. Russia was a party to that resolution.
	   ``I think that in this case, Russia will have a right to develop
full-scale military cooperation with the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia,'' Ivashov said. ``We can't throw away a fraternal
nation in such a situation.''
	   Ivashov accused western powers of fomenting the crisis in
Kosovo.
	   ``From the very beginning of the crisis in Kosovo and separatist
tendencies, all separatist leader received western support, NATO
support,'' he said.
	   Primakov reiterated that Russia would use its veto in the U.N.
Security Council to prevent airstrikes against Yugoslavia.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey shocked defending European champion Germany
1-0 Saturday on a late goal by Hakan Sukur, but World Cup champion
France had a better fate in qualifying play for Euro 2000 with a
3-2 in Russia on a late winner by Alain Boghossian.
	   In another key match Saturday, England slumped to a 0-0 draw
against Bulgaria, leaving both clubs without a win in their first
two matches.
	   Playing in Bursa, Turkey, Germany's revamped team and a new
coach _ Erich Ribbeck _ dropped its opening game in qualilfying
while Turkey has won its first two in Group 3.
	   In the 70th minute, Abdullah Ercan sent in a cross. German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn raced for it but collided with his libero
Jens Nowotny. With the ball bouncing around, Kahn fumbled another
attempt to punch it away, landing the ball onto Hakan's head.
	   The Turkish striker's header bounced off the post, hit the
clumsy Kahn and rolled over the line.
	   The victory set off wild celebrations _ not just in Turkey _ but
in Germany as some of the two million Turks who live in Germany
took to the streets to celebrate.
	   In Moscow, Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st minute as France
won 3-2 over Russia in Group 4. The World Cup champions opened last
month with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Iceland and Russia lost
3-2 to Ukraine.
	   In London, the 0-0 England-Bulgaria draw in Group 5 is bound to
increase the pressure on England coach Glenn Hoddle, who has been
widely criticized for the club's play following a 2-1 loss last
month in Sweden. Bulgaria lost its opener last month to Poland 3-0
and now is under a new coach Dimitar Dimitrov.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Billy Dodds scored his second goal in
the 84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia in Group 9. Dodds came off the bench and scored his first a
minute after taking the field to level at 1-1 in the 70th.
	   Maksim Smirnov gave Estonia took the lead in the 76th, but
Scotland leveled again at 2-2 on an Estonian own-goal by Sergei
Hohlov-Simson in the 78th. Hohlov-Simpson scored for Estonia in the
35th.
	   Elsewhere Saturday on a day of 20 qualifiers:
 &UR; GROUP 2 &QC; 
	   In Riga, Latvia, Lativa followed its shock victory over Norway
with an impressive 1-0 victory over Georgia to stay atop the group.
On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia came out charging and
scored only three minutes into the match with a brilliant corner
kick by Marian Pahar that was deftly tapped in by Andrei Shtolcer.
 &UR; GROUP 3 &QC; 
	   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Keith Rowland scored in the 31st
minute as Northern Ireland beat Finland 1-0. The win atoned for
Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro opener last
month. Finland beat Moldova 3-2 last month.
 &UR; GROUP 4 &QC; 
	   In Andorra La Vella, Andorra, Vitaly Kosovsky and Serhiy Rebrov
scored as Ukraine defeated Andorra 2-0. Ukraine has six points in
two matches.
	   In Yerevan, Armenia, Armenia and Iceland played a 0-0 tie before
17,000 in Ararat stadium.
 &UR; GROUP 6 &QC; 
	   In Larnaca, Cyrpus, Austria won 3-0 after Cyprus was reduced to
10 mean early in the game. Harald Cerny scored twice _ in the 53rd
and 61st _ and Hannes Reinmayr got the other in the 74th.
 &UR; GROUP 7 &QC; 
	   In Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Slovakia defeated Liechtenstein 4-0
with two goals from Robert Tomaschek and one each from Miroslav
Sovic and Peter Dubuvsky.
	   In Baku, Azerbaijan, Hungary won 4-0 with goals from Pal Dardai,
Bela Illes, Istvan Pisont and Miklos Feher.
 &UR; GROUP 8 &QC; 
	   In Valletta, Malta, Croatia came from behind to beat modest
Malta 4-1. The Maltese, who have usually served as a punching bag
for Europe's top teams, took a 1-0 lead on Hubert Suda's penalty
kick in the 28th. Croatia rallied with two goals Davor Vugrinec _
making his debut _ and one each from Dario Simic and Davor Suker.
 &UR; GROUP 9 &QC; 
	   In Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Czech Republic clinched a
3-1 away victory on goals by Miroslav Baranjek, Vladimir Smicer and
Patrick Berger. Substitute Marko Topic scored for Bosnia.

Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1991-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying the
alliance's preparations was helping Holbrooke's negotiating
efforts.
	   Solana said the final authorization of an attack would happen in
the next few days unless Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   While Milosevic had issued no new statements as of Saturday
evening, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to
the proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the unidentified spokesman told BBC Radio 4.
``We cannot understand this.''
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and
Britain's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donnelly, accompanied
Holbrooke to Pristina. Hill then held more talks with ethnic
Albanians later.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   There were no reports of fresh fighting in Kosovo on Saturday,
but three people were reported killed on the Albanian side of the
border when they walked into a minefield in the village of Pogaj,
Albania's Interior Ministry said.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation, in an interview with the NTV television station.

	   MOSCOW, Russia (AP) _ Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st minute
Saturday to give World Cup champion France a 3-2 victory over
Russia in Group 4 qualifying for the European 2000 championship, a
loss that left Russia with no points in two matches.
	   France opened the scoring in the 13th minute when Nikolas Anelka
connected on a perfect pass from Zinadine Zidane.
	   Fifteen minutes later, Anelka sent a cross from the left and
Robert Pires took advantage of a Russian mistake to put the
champions ahead 2-0.
	   Igor Yanovsky headed in the first goal for Russia in the 45th of
a corner kick, and Alexander Mostovoi equalized in the 55th from a
free kick as he curled the ball over the wall. Bernard Lama had no
chance to save the goal.
	   ``We were missing luck and experience,'' Russian coach Anatoly
Byshovets told reporters.
	   But in the 81st, Boghossian _ who came in as a substitute in the
47th _ got the winner. France was unable to make it 4-2 when
Laurent Blanc hit the bar after on a penalty kick in the final
minute.
	   Russia has no points and France has four points after a 1-1 draw
last month with Iceland.
 &UR; Lineups:
	   Russia: Sergei Ovchinnikov; Dmitri Khlestov, Dmitri Alenichev,

KLA spokesman calls for NATO intervention
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Jakup Krasniqi, the spokesman for
the Kosovo Liberation Army, Saturday called for NATO to intervene
in Serbia's embattled Kosovo province, Belgrade's Beta news agency
reported.
	   In a statement to Albanian state television in Tirana reported
by Beta, he said a NATO intervention would ``help the endangered
populace'' and stop ``ethnic cleansing of Kosovo.''
	   The KLA was defeated in a series of battles with Yugoslav and
Serbian forces in recent weeks. The fighting has killed hundreds of
people and displaced hundreds of thousands fleeing their homes.
	   Ethnic Albanians account for 90 percent of the population in
Kosovo, a province of Serbia, the dominant republic in rump
Yugoslavia.
	   ``It is necessary for the international community to
appropriately punish Milosevic's regime,'' Krasniqi was quoted as
saying.
	   He also said the KLA remains firmly devoted to the principles of
self-determination for which it is struggling and warned Kosovo
Albanian politicians to respect the will of the people expressed in
the officially unauthorized 1991 referendum in which a large
majority voted for independence.

	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Hungary's men beat out
France for both the epee and sabre team titles Saturday at the
world fencing championships.
	   While France took the titles in both the men's and women's
individual epee events, with Hugues Obry and Laura Flessel crowned
champions earlier in the week, the men's team was unable to
overcome a tight Hungarian squad.
	   To add insult to injury, the French men were also forced to hand
over their team sabre title to the Hungarians.
	   Instead the French settled for silver in both events,
surrendering 45-37 to the Hungarians in the epee event, and 45-42
in the sabre.
	   Russia took bronze in the epee event, defeating Belarus 45-30,
while Poland beat out Italy 45-43 for third place in the sabre.
	   Hungary sliced its way to the final with a 45-39 win over Russia
in the epee semifinal, while France had defeated Belarus 45-38 to
reach the gold medal showdown.
	   The Hungarians, third at last year's worlds in Capetown, edged
Italy 45-44 in the sabre semifinals for a place in the gold medal
duel, while the French team bested the Poles 45-42.

Agassi, Henman advance to final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ERICA BULMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BASEL, Switzerland (AP) _ Fourth-seeded Andre Agassi defeated
home favorite Marc Rosset in straight sets Saturday to move into
the title match at the dlrs 1 million Swiss Indoors where he will
face Britain's Tim Henman.
	   Agassi received little resistance from the towering Swiss
power-server, cruising through his semifinal 6-4, 6-2 in just 54
minutes.
	   Henman, seeded sixth, booked his place in the final by edging
Sweden's Thomas Johansson 6-3, 2-6, 7-6 (7-5).
	   ``The final should be a good one,'' said Agassi, who reached the
title match without dropping a set. ``Henman seems to be a good
indoors player.
	   ``He'll pose a good challenge as an opponent and it should be an
entertaining final. It's nice to see players of Tim Henman's class
and professional style do so well.''
	   Agassi dominated from the very start, never giving Rosset a
chance to get into the match and stir support from the 8,700 Swiss
spectators crowded into the St. Jakobshalle stadium. The American
broke Rosset's second serve in the opening set, then served two
consecutive games at love in the second before breaking to take a
4-2 lead.
	   ``I think I played very smart, very solidly,'' Agassi said.
``He's not an easy player to play. He's got a very powerful serve,
a very varied pace and he's unpredictable.''
	   Organizers breathed a sigh of relief as the two remaining seeded
players advanced to the final after early round devastation saw
top-ranked and Wimbledon champ Pete Sampras, No. 2 and U.S. Open
champ Patrick Rafter and Australian Open champion Petr Korda lose.
	   Agassi, however, was not interested in names or numbers.
	   ``I'm not interested in playing Rafter or Pete,'' said Agassi.
``I want to play the best players, and every week that changes.
	   ``This week Rafter and Pete weren't the best. Tim Henman was.''
	   Having Sampras lose so early could also help Agassi's chances of
regaining the No. 1 spot after three years, completing an
incredible comeback.
	   Ranked eighth on the ATP Tour, the 28-year-old American, who has
just 68 points left to defend this season, is in a position to
finish the year No. 1 in the world.
	   Agassi, who held the No. 1 ATP Tour ranking in April 1995, fell
to 141st last November and was out of the top 100 at the end of
1997 for the first time since he'd turned pro in 1985.
	   While Agassi has not won any Grand Slam or Super Nine titles
this season, his 56-13 match record is the best on the ATP Tour in
match victories and winning percentage.
	   ``I'm not interested in being No. 1 at the end of the year,''
said Agassi, who won four titles this season, each without dropping
a set. ``I just want to establish myself as one of the best players
going into the Australian Open.
	   ``However, my main concern at the moment in Tim Henman.''
	   Agassi is currently fifth in the ATP Tour World Championship
standings, and his victory over Rosset could help cement his place
among the top eight and secure for him a berth in the season-ending
tournament next month.
	   Henman, who lost to Mark Philippoussis in the semifinals last
year, extended his match winning streak to 11 with his victory over
Johansson.

Turkey shocks Germany 1-0 to set off celebrations in _ Germany

Russia-France game &QL;

 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey shocked defending European champion Germany
1-0 Saturday on a late goal by Hakan Sukur, but World Cup champion
France had a better fate in qualifying play for Euro 2000 with a
3-2 victory in Russia on a late winner by Alain Boghossian.
	   In another key match Saturday, England slumped to a 0-0 draw
against Bulgaria, leaving both clubs without a win in their first
two matches.
	   Playing in Bursa, Turkey, Germany's revamped team and new coach
_ Erich Ribbeck _ dropped its opening game in qualifying while
Turkey has won its first two in Group 3.
	   In the 70th minute, Abdullah Ercan sent in a cross. German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn raced for it but collided with his libero
Jens Nowotny. With the ball bouncing around, Kahn fumbled another
attempt to punch it away, landing the ball onto Hakan's head.
	   The Turkish striker's header bounced off the post, hit the
clumsy Kahn and rolled over the line.
	   The victory set off wild celebrations _ not just in Turkey _ but
in Germany as some of the two million Turks who live in Germany
took to the streets to celebrate.
	   In Moscow, Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st minute as France
won 3-2 over Russia in Group 4. The World Cup champions opened last
month with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Iceland and Russia lost
3-2 to Ukraine.
	   Nikolas Anelka scored in the 13th for France and Robert Pires
made it 2-0 15 minutes later. Igor Yanovsky made it 2-1 on a header
in the 45th and Alexander Mostovoi equalized in the 55th from a
free kick that beat keeper Bernard Lama.
	   In London, the 0-0 England-Bulgaria draw in Group 5 is bound to
increase the pressure on England coach Glenn Hoddle, who has been
widely criticized for the club's play following a 2-1 loss last
month in Sweden. Bulgaria lost its opener last month to Poland 3-0
and now is under a new coach Dimitar Dimitrov.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Billy Dodds scored his second in the
84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia in Group 9. Dodds came off the bench and scored his first a
minute after taking the field to level at 1-1 in the 70th.
	   Maksim Smirnov gave Estonia took the lead in the 76th, but
Scotland leveled again at 2-2 on an Estonian own-goal by Sergei
Hohlov-Simson in the 78th. Hohlov-Simpson scored for Estonia in the
35th.
	   Elsewhere Saturday on a day of 20 qualifiers:
 &UR; GROUP 1 &QC; 
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, Adrian Williams and Craig Bellamy scored
in the second half to give Wales a 2-1 win over Denmark. Soeren
Frederiksen gave Denmark a 1-0 lead in the 58th, but Williams tied
a minute later and Bellamy _ a substitute _ got the winner four
minutes from the end. Mogens Krogh played goal for the injured
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel. Both teams have three points in two
matches.
 &UR; GROUP 2 &QC; 
	   In Riga, Latvia, Lativa followed its shock victory over Norway
with an impressive 1-0 victory over Georgia to stay atop the group
with six points. On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia came out
charging and scored only three minutes into the match with a
brilliant corner kick by Marian Pahar that was deftly tapped in by
Andrei Shtolcer.
 &UR; GROUP 3 &QC; 
	   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Keith Rowland scored in the 31st
minute as Northern Ireland beat Finland 1-0. The win atoned for
Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro opener last
month. Finland beat Moldova 3-2 last month.
 &UR; GROUP 4 &QC; 
	   In Andorra La Vella, Andorra, Vitaly Kosovsky and Serhiy Rebrov
scored as Ukraine defeated Andorra 2-0. Ukraine has six points in

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened
his stand Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
broke similar promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, and violated a
pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive against ethnic
Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours.
	   His visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels. He final
authorization would happen in the next few days unless Milosevic
complies fully with demands.
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both sides:
Milosevic would have to give up his full domination over the
southern Serbian province; and the Albanian side would have to
acknowledge that it might settle for less than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected the latest
U.S. proposal, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following
the latest carnage. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but
rejects the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic
Albanians, Serbian sources said.
	   No fighting was reported Saturday in Kosovo, but three people
were reported killed on the Albanian side of the border when they
walked into a minefield in the village of Pogaj, according to
Albania's Interior Ministry.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation, in an interview with the NTV television station.

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Tight bowling by Jamaica's spinners
restricted the Leeward Islands to 181 in 50 overs in the crucial
Red Stripe Bowl cricket match at Sabina Park on Saturday.
	   After winning the toss and electing to bat, the champions got
off to a rousing start courtesy of openers Stuart Williams and
Wilden Cornwall. But once Cornwall was dismissed by legspinner
Bryan Murphy for 15 with the score on 38, the Leewards' innings
went into decline.
	   Accurate bowling from Murphy and offspinner Nehemiah Perry put
the brakes on the Leewards' batting with Murphy's ten overs costing
a mere 19 runs.
	   Leading the scoring for the Leewards was the experienced
lefthander Keith Arthurton who made a sedate 40 while middle-order
batsman Dave Joseph chipped in with 30 before he was run out in the
43rd over.
	   Both teams have three points, though Jamaica are playing their
second game to the Leewards' three. If the Jamaicans win, they
would join Barbados in the semi-finals.

Bulgaria says it is ready to allow NATO aircraft to use its
</HEADLINE>
airspace

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgarian leaders said Saturday they were
ready to allow NATO aircarft to use Bulgarian airspace if the
alliance launches airstrikes against neighboring Yugoslavia, but
said Bulgaria will not get directly involved in military
operations.
	   President Petar Stoyanov announced the decision after a
five-hour meeting of the Council on National Security _ a
consultative body including himself, the premier, the foreign,
defense and interior ministers, leaders of parliamentary parties
and top security officials.
	   The council is designed to forge political consensus on security
issues, but the final decisions are made by Parliament.
	   State radio quoted Stoyanov as saying that an immediate
parliamentary session on the council decision was not necessary.
	   But Premier Ivan Kostsov said Friday that the issue would be
taken to Parliament if NATO actually resorts to air attacks.
	   Kostov said the council meeting was called after NATO's North
Atlantic Council asked Bulgaria to allow unlimited access to its
airspace for possible military operations over Yugoslavia.
	   Georgi Parvanov, leader of the Socialist Party of former
Communists, was the only official at the meeting to oppose the
decision, the state news agency BTA reported.
	   ``Bulgaria is ready to give access to its air space in response
to the note of the North Atlantic Council,'' President Petar
Stoyanov said after the meeting.
	   ``The Republic of Bulgaria will also help with humanitarian and
logistic operations in the framework of NATO efforts to impose and
guarantee peace,'' he said.
	   But the president added: ``As a neighbor of Yugoslavia, the
Republic of Bulgaria won't participate directly or indirectly in
military actions in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.''
	   Stoyanov urged Belgrade authorities and the parties in the
Kosovo conflict to comply with U.N. resolutions in order ``to avoid
eventual military intervention by NATO.''

Primakov: We're open to foreign banks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov said Saturday that
Russia would welcome foreign banks.
	   ``I am in favor of giving western banks access to the Russian
market,'' he told Russian reporters, according to the ITAR-Tass
news agency.
	   ``We are open. We have not clammed up.''
	   Russia's banking system has been paralyzed by the nation's
economic crisis, as the government has defaulted on some of its
debts to banks and many inter-bank payments have been frozen.
Private accounts have been largely inaccessible.
	   Clients of six major private banks were to have applied by
Saturday to have their accounts transferred to the state savings
bank, where they would be guaranteed by the state. If the original
accounts were in hard currency, they would be converted into rubles
at an unfavorable rate.
	   Clients could also opt to keep their accounts at the private
banks at their own risk.

Mitchell lifts WBA super lightweight crown
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ U.S. fighter Sharmba Mitchell won the WBA super
lightweight title Saturday, beating Khalid Rahilou on points after
putting the French defending champion on the canvas four times.
	   In his first shot at a world title, Mitchell, a 28-year-old
southpaw from Washington D.C., dominated from the start and won on
a unanimous decision.
	   Boxing in strips of red, white and blue cloth instead of
conventional boxing shorts, the U.S. fighter nearly won the fight
as early as the second round.
	   First, he put Rahilou on his knees with a powerful left hand
blow to the body.
	   Then, sensing that the world title was nearly his, he came on
the attack again, and floored Rahilou a second time 20 seconds
later.
	   Rahilou, making his third defense of title, needed all his
reserves of strength to keep on his feet.
	   In the third round, another right hand blow from the American
had Kahilou on his knees again.
	   Rahilou took a count for a fourth time in round seven, when
Mitchell landed a mighy right hand to the head after the tiring
holder let his guard drop.
	   Mitchell is now 43-2.

	   RIGA, Latvia (AP) _ Andrei Shtolcer scored off a corner by
Marian Pahar after only three minutes and Latvia beat Georgia 1-0
Saturday for its second victory in as many matches in qualifying
for the 2000 European Championship.
	   On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia, which stunned Norway in
their opener, pushed from the opening kickoff and jumped ahead
quickly.
	   Despite falling behind, Georgia continued to play a defensive
game until the start of the second half. The Georgians had two
chances in the opening minutes of the second half, but Latvian
goalkeeper Oleg Karavajev got hold of the wet ball to save the
game.
	   Latvia continued to looke for a second goal until late in the
second half, when it went into defensive mode to protect the
victory.

	   LJUBLJANA, Slovenia (AP) _ Norway rose from a goal down to
defeat Slovenia 2-1 Saturday in a Group 2 qualifying match for the
2000 European Championship.
	   In a dynamic match allowing end-to-end action with few
stoppages, Slovenia struck first through Zlatko Zahovic in the 24th
minute with a close-range tap-in goal.
	   It was Zahovic's third tally in two qualifying games.
	   Slovenia fostered a quick passing game which had the crowd on
edge. However, the Norwegians worked well from behind to keep play
away from striking range.
	   Tore Andre Flo was a constant menace up front for the
Scandinavians, tussling for space and the chance to pounce on a
loose ball. The robust forward prevailed on the stroke of
half-time, connecting on a near-side cross with a diving header to
make it 1-1.
	   Kjetil Rekdal scored the winner for Norway in the 80th minute
when he redirected a deflected free-kick outside the box, low into
the goal.
	   Slovenia could have reversed the result. Zlatko Udovic and
Mladen Rudonja had several opportunities, but their shots either
sailed over the Norwegian goal or landed softly into the arms of
goalie Frode Grodas.
	   Instead, the Slovenes were left with only one point to show from
two qualifying matches. They managed a 2-2 away draw with Greece.
	   Lineups:
	   Slovenia: Marko Simeunovic, Darko Milanic, Marinko Galic,

well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying the
alliance's preparations was helping Holbrooke's negotiating
efforts.
	   Solana said the final authorization of an attack would happen in
the next few days unless Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   While Milosevic had issued no new statements as of Saturday
evening, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to
the proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the unidentified spokesman told BBC Radio 4.
``We cannot understand this.''
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and
Britain's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donnelly, accompanied
Holbrooke to Pristina. Hill then held more talks with ethnic
Albanians later.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   There were no reports of fresh fighting in Kosovo on Saturday,
but three people were reported killed on the Albanian side of the
border when they walked into a minefield in the village of Pogaj,
Albania's Interior Ministry said.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation, in an interview with the NTV television station.

Lithuania only manages 0-0 draw against Faeroes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania only managed a 0-0 draw with
the Faeroe Islands in a European Group 9 qualifier Saturday night.
	   It was the second straight goalless match for the Lithuanians,
who started their campaign at home against World Cup qualifier
Scotland early September.
	   Goalie Jakup Mikkelsen, who plays in Denmark for Herfolge, made
several outstandings saves for the Faeroes, including a 16-meter
shot by midfielder Valdas Ivanauskas in the 32nd minute.
	   A dull game with sporadic attacks, it was spoiled by heavy rain
and a wet field that led to many technical mistakes.
	   Three players were booked in a match watched by some 2,000 fans,
Raimond Cutautas and Ivanauskas of Lithuania and Oli Johannensen of
the Faeroes.
	   Lineups:
	   Lithuania _ Gyntaras Stauzi, Andraius Skirla, Saulius
Mikalaiuns, Raimond Cutautas, Virginiaus Baltusnikas, Tomas
Zyirjzdauskas, Gracydas Mikulinas, Valdas Ivanauskas, Aidis

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
Saturday of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly
softened his stand on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours. He said the situation had not changed from the
previous day.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying the
alliance's preparations was helping Holbrooke's negotiating
efforts.
	   Solana said the final authorization of an attack would happen in
the next few days unless Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   While Milosevic had issued no new statements as of Saturday
evening, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to
the proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a

	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to

``We cannot understand this.''

	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   It was not immediately clear whether talks would last through
the weekend. But Milosevic on Saturday canceled plans to attend a
summit of southeastern European leaders in Turkey starting Monday.

Dutch flair pays off in 2-0 victory over Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals from Jaap Stam and Peter van
Vossen gave coach Frank Rijkaard a 2-0 victory over Peru Saturday
in his first outing in charge of the Dutch side.
	   The first half was frustratingly goalless with the Dutch, a
semifinalist this summer in France, dominating in all areas of the
field except the Peru penalty box.
	   In the end it took a big defender's power at dead ball situation
to break the deadlock.
	   Manchester United's Stam first forced a brilliant parry from
Oscar Ibanez in the Peru goal with a pile-driving free kick then
rose to head home the resulting corner on 56 minutes.
	   The with a quarter of an hour to go Edgar Davids' chipped
through-ball found substitute Peter van Vossen, who celebrated his
return to international football with a coolly-taken goal.
	   Playing flowing, incisive football the Dutch created half a
dozen chances in the first half, the first for Marc Overmars after
intricate work from Patrick Kluivert and Dennis Bergkamp.
	   And Bergkamp went close himself on nine minutes with a trademark
curler from the edge of the box which just missed the post.
	   Kluivert missed three great chances, shooting wide from six
(meters) yards, almost scrambling the ball in after a Juan Reynoso
defensive error and striking the bar with a header from a corner.
	   Just before half time Edwin van der Sar turned a free kick from
Nolberto Solano round the post and the Newcastle United player went
close again near the end of the game, this time denied by Van der
Sar's feet.
	   Rijkard, veteran of 73 internationals including the Dutch 1988
European Championship-winning team, kept faith with most of the
Dutch World Cup stars, and SC Heerenveen's Jeffrey Talan was the
only new face in the starting lineup.
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar, Michael Reiziger, Jaap Stam,
Frank de Boer, Phillip Cocu, Edgar Davids, Jeffrey Talan, Ronald de
Boer (Clarence Seedorf 71), Patrick Kluivert, Dennis Bergkamp, Marc
Overmars (Peter van Vossen 68).
	   Peru: Oscar Ibanez, Jorge Soto, Juan Reynoso, Santiago Salazar,
Nolberto Salano, Juan Jayo, Gregorio Bernales, Jose Pereda, Roberto
Palacios, Carlos Flores (Jorge Hauman 58), Flavio Maestri.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ A driver and his co-pilot taking part in
a local auto rally in Austria's Styria province were killed
Saturday when their Fiat Cinquecento veered off the course at a
curve, the Austria Press Agency reported.
	   The car of Bernhard Geramb, 35, and his companion Christian
Neuhold spun out of control at a point where the surface changed
from pavement to gravel. The two drivers died at the site of the
accident before being transported to a hospital.
	   The accident occurred near Selzthal in the southern Styria
province. The competition was suspended after the accident.
	   Geramb was an experienced pilot who took part in international
events this season, including the Monte Carlo Rally, APA said.
	   It was the second fatal accident in an Austrian auto rally event
this season. During a race on May 9, two German competitors were
killed when their car collided with a wall.

	   UDINE, Italy (AP) _ Alessandro Del Piero broke out of a long
slump with a goal in each half to lead Italy past Switzerland 2-0
Saturday in a Euro 2000 qualifier.
	   Del Piero tallied in the 19th and 62nd minutes as Italy stayed
atop Group 1 with its second straight win, before a crowd of about
38,000 at Friuli Stadium.
	   The Juventus of Turin star had scored just once in his last 16
games for club and country, but finished a slick, three-man action
to give the hosts the early lead and then spun in a brilliant free
kick from atop the penalty area.
	   Despite playing with five defenders, Switzerland had trouble
containing Italy's surges forward and rarely threatened in coach
Gilbert Gress' first official game at the helm.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey shocked defending European champion Germany
1-0 Saturday on a late goal by Hakan Sukur, but World Cup champion
France had a better fate in qualifying play for Euro 2000 with a
3-2 victory in Russia on a late winner by Alain Boghossian.
	   In another key match Saturday, Alessandro Del Piero scored twice
to break a goal slump as Italy beat Switzerland 2-0 to stay atop
Group 1 with a maximum six points.
	   Playing in Bursa, Turkey, Germany's revamped team and new coach
_ Erich Ribbeck _ dropped its opening game in qualifying while
Turkey has won its first two in Group 3.
	   In the 70th minute, Abdullah Ercan sent in a cross. German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn raced for it but collided with his libero
Jens Nowotny. With the ball bouncing free, Kahn fumbled another
attempt to punch it away, landing the ball onto Hakan's head.
	   The Turkish striker's header bounced off the post, hit the
clumsy Kahn and rolled over the line.
	   The victory set off wild celebrations _ not just in Turkey _ but
in Germany as some of the two million Turks who live in Germany
took to the streets to celebrate.
	   In Moscow, Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st as France won 3-2
over Russia in Group 4. The World Cup champions opened last month
with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Iceland and Russia lost 3-2 to
Ukraine.
	   Nikolas Anelka scored in the 13th for France and Robert Pires
made it 2-0 15 minutes later. Igor Yanovsky made it 2-1 on a header
in the 45th and Alexander Mostovoi equalized in the 55th from a
free kick that beat keeper Bernard Lama.
	   In Udine, Italy, Del Piero scored against Switzerland in the
19th and 62nd in a comfortable win for Italy before 38,000 at
Friuli stadium. The Juventus star had scored only once in his last
16 games for club and country. He finished off a slick three-man
play for the early goal and then spun in a free kick from just
outside the penalty area.
	   Elsewhere Saturday on a day of 20 qualifiers:
 &UR; GROUP 1 &QC; 
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, Adrian Williams and Craig Bellamy scored
in the second half to give Wales a 2-1 win over Denmark. Soeren
Frederiksen gave Denmark a 1-0 lead in the 58th, but Williams tied
a minute later and Bellamy _ a substitute _ got the winner four
minutes from the end. Mogens Krogh played goal for the injured
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel. Both teams have three points in two
matches.
 &UR; GROUP 2 &QC; 
	   In Riga, Latvia, Lativa followed its shock victory over Norway
with an impressive 1-0 victory over Georgia to stay atop the group
with six points. On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia came out
charging and scored only three minutes into the match with a
brilliant corner kick by Marian Pahar that was deftly tapped in by
Andrei Shtolcer.
	   In Ljubljana, Slovenia, Norway came from behind to beat Slovenia
2-1. Zlatko Zahovic opened in the 24th, his third in two qualifying
games. But Tore Andre Flo scored in the final seconds of the first
half and Kjetil Rekdal got the winner in the 80th when he
redirected a deflected free-kick into the goal.
 &UR; GROUP 3 &QC; 
	   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Keith Rowland scored in the 31st
minute as Northern Ireland beat Finland 1-0. The win atoned for
Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro opener last
month. Finland beat Moldova 3-2 last month.
 &UR; GROUP 4 &QC; 
	   In Andorra La Vella, Andorra, Vitaly Kosovsky and Serhiy Rebrov
scored as Ukraine defeated Andorra 2-0. Ukraine has six points in
two matches.
	   In Yerevan, Armenia, Armenia and Iceland played a 0-0 tie before
17,000 in Ararat stadium.
 &UR; GROUP 5 &QC; 
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Poland stayed atop the group with six points
in two games after a 3-0 win over Luxembourg. Jerzy Brzeczek opend
the scoring in the 19th, striker Andrzej Juskowiak made it 2-0 on a
header in the 33rd and Miroslaw Trzeciak scored on another header
in the 64th
	   In London, the 0-0 England-Bulgaria draw is bound to increase
the pressure on England coach Glenn Hoddle, who has been widely
criticized for the club's play following a 2-1 loss last month in
Sweden. Bulgaria lost its opener last month to Poland 3-0 and now
is under a new coach Dimitar Dimitrov.
 &UR; GROUP 6 &QC; 
	   In Larnaca, Cyrpus, Austria won 3-0 after Cyprus was reduced to
10 mean early in the game. Harald Cerny scored twice _ in the 53rd
and 61st _ and Hannes Reinmayr got the other in the 74th.
 &UR; GROUP 7 &QC; 
	   In Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Slovakia defeated Liechtenstein 4-0
with two goals from Robert Tomaschek and one each from Miroslav
Sovic and Peter Dubuvsky.
	   In Baku, Azerbaijan, Hungary won 4-0 with goals from Pal Dardai,
Bela Illes, Istvan Pisont and Miklos Feher.
 &UR; GROUP 8 &QC; 
	   In Valletta, Malta, Croatia came from behind to beat modest
Malta 4-1. The Maltese, who have usually served as a punching bag
for Europe's top teams, took a 1-0 lead on Hubert Suda's penalty
kick in the 28th. Croatia rallied with two goals Davor Vugrinec _
making his debut _ and one each from Dario Simic and Davor Suker.
 &UR; GROUP 9 &QC; 
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Billy Dodds scored his second in the
84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia. Dodds came off the bench and scored his first a minute
after taking the field to level at 1-1 in the 70th.
	   Maksim Smirnov gave Estonia took the lead in the 76th, but
Scotland leveled again at 2-2 on an Estonian own-goal by Sergei
Hohlov-Simson in the 78th. Hohlov-Simpson scored for Estonia in the
35th.
	   In Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Czech Republic clinched a
3-1 away victory on goals by Miroslav Baranjek, Vladimir Smicer and
Patrick Berger. Substitute Marko Topic scored for Bosnia.
	   In Vilnius, Lithuania, Lithuania and Faeroe Islands played a 0-0
draw. The islanders have one point in four games and Lithuania has
two points in two.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened
his stand Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
broke similar promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, and violated a
pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive against ethnic
Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours. He said the situation had not changed from the
previous day.
	   His visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels. He said the
final authorization would happen in the next few days unless
Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   Milosevic issued no new statements Saturday.
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether talks would last through
the weekend. But Milosevic on Saturday canceled plans to attend a
summit of southeastern European leaders in Turkey starting Monday.

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ Lithuania only managed a 0-0 draw with
the Faeroe Islands in a European Group 9 qualifier Saturday night.
	   It was the second straight goalless match for the Lithuanians,
who started their campaign at home against World Cup qualifier
Scotland early September.
	   Goalleeper Jakup Mikkelsen, who plays in Denmark for Herfolge,
made several outstandings saves for the Faeroes, including a
16-meter shot by midfielder Valdas Ivanauskas in the 32nd minute.
	   A dull game with sporadic attacks, it was spoiled by heavy rain
and a wet field that led to many technical mistakes.
	   Three players were cautioned in a match watched by about 2,000
fans, Raimond Cutautas and Ivanauskas of Lithuania and Oli
Johannensen of the Faeroes.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities moved to shut
down a popular independent radio station late Saturday, a station
executive said _ a day after the government put into effect a
decree tightening state control over media.
	   Two inspectors from the telecommunications ministry, accompanied
by police, entered Radio Index offices and demanded the station
cease broadcasting because it doesn't have a legal license, said
deputy chief editor Aleksandar Vasic.
	   They said they were confiscating the station's equipment.
	   Vasic alerted other media but said employees would not resist.
	   Earlier in the day, the radio had changed frequencies and
claimed its signal was being jammed by a transmitter belonging to
the state-owned Serbian radio-television company.
	   On Thursday, Radio Index was suddenly evicted from premises it
had rented for years from state-run radio, but found another
location the same day.
	   The radio's chief editor, Nenad Cekic, had said the action was
apparent retaliation to his protests against the government
crackdown on independent media.
	   In instituting the crackdown, authorities branded foreign
programs aired on some radio stations as damaging, anti-Serb
propaganda, masterminded in the West to help Serbia's ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province to secede.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe assailed
the moves as amounting to ``a declaration of war against the
independent media.''
	   Radio Index did not relay foreign broadcasts but was critical of
the government. It has been operating on the same frequency for six
and a half years and had a contract to that effect.
	   At a government auction for licenses in May, it was among many
independent stations that were refused frequency licenses by the
government but continued operating without one.
	   Critics of President Slobodan Milosevic's government have said
he is using NATO threats to use force against Yugoslavia because of
its Kosovo offensive as a pretext for clamping down on opponents.

	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels in eastern Congo on Saturday said
they shot down a passenger jet ferrying 40 government soldiers into
a strategic airport facing a rebel assault.
	   A Congo Airlines executive said the victims were civilians being
evacuated from Kindu, about 1,000 kilometers (620 miles) east of
the capital, Kinshasa. Neither claim could be confirmed
independently.
	   Stavros Papaioannou, the president of the airline's management
committee, said a missile hit the rear engine of the Boeing jet
after the aircraft took off from Kindu airport.
	   A rebel military commander, who requested anonymity, said the
plane was carrying troops, although he did not explain how he knew
this.
	   He said the plane was shot down while approaching Kindu air
base, where the rebels had deployed at least two surface-to-air
missiles and more than 3,500 troops in preparation for a final
assault on the government-held town.
	   Alexis Tambwe Mwamba, one of rebel leaders, said from the rebel
stronghold at Goma, 380 kilometers (235 miles) northeast of Kalima,
that fighters had intercepted government radio messages in Kindu
and knew in advance of the arrival of the aircraft.
	   He said the government had been using the Boeing 727 to fly in
troops and ammunition in Kindu for several days.

Album of previously unreleased Marley songs not popular in Jamaica
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A new album of previously unreleased
Bob Marley songs may be causing a stir overseas but not in Jamaica,
where some fans of the reggae legend are crying exploitation.
	   Since its release several months ago, ``The Complete Bob Marley
and the Wailers: 1967-1972'' has earned rave reviews during
promotional stops in Canada and the United Kingdom, but not in the
home country of the late reggae star. Sales have been slow in
Jamaica.
	   ``Bob most likely would not have wanted these songs released,''
said a respected Jamaican musicologist who asked not to be named.
``It's all about making money.''
	   But respected Marley historian Roger Steffens, who has been a
part of the album's promotional tour, described the response to the
set as ``phenomenally positive.''
	   The album is distrubuted by JAD Records, which is owned by Danny
Sims, an American producer who worked with rhythm and blues singer
Johnny Nash and Marley while living in Jamaica during the late
1960s.
	   Marley wrote several of Nash's biggest hits including ``Stir It
Up'' and ``Guava Jelly.'' Both songs were produced by Sims, who
also produced the Marley classic ``Bend Down Low.''
	   Sims and Marley split in the early 1970s, but Sims retained
publishing rights to several of the dreadlocked singer's best-known
songs.
	   In 1996, Sims released ``Soul Almighty: The Formative Years,''
which comprised his first set of songs with Marley. Writing in
Billboard Magazine, Timothy White, author of the Marley biography,
``Catch A Fire,'' described it as ``worthless.''
	   Marley died in 1981 from cancer at age 36.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
Saturday of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly
softened his stand on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
on him in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which resumed Saturday afternoon after lasting into the
early hours. He said the situation had not changed from the
previous day.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final
authorization for an attack would happen in the next few days
barring a diplomatic breakthrough.
	   In another move showing NATO means business, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers,
one reconnaissance aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in
preparation for possible intervention.

Lesotho's king calls for unity, while parties prepare opposing
</HEADLINE>
rallies &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ Facing plans for dueling rallies by the
ruling and opposition parties, Lesotho's king asked protesters to
leave his royal palace on Saturday in a radio address that appealed
for unity.
	   King Letsie III's message came as the ruling and opposition
parties were preparing separate rallies for Sunday.
	   Upheaval in the tiny mountain kingdom surrounded by South Africa
began in early August, when opposition parties blockaded streets in
the capital of Maseru and moved onto the palace grounds. About 100
protesters remained camped on the grounds at the time of the king's
radio address.
	   Scores were killed after last month's South African-led
intervention to end an army mutiny and paralyzing protests by the
opposition, which charged May elections won by the Lesotho Congress
for Democracy were rigged.
	   The military action came under the auspices of the Southern
African Development Community.
	   The king stressed the need for Lesotho's politicians to put
aside their differences in deference to the interests of the
nation.
	   ``This should be done so that future generations should find a
peaceful and stable nation,'' he said. ``It is our responsibility
to ensure that this dream becomes a reality.''
	   The ruling Lesotho Congress for Democracy and opposition leaders
planned separate rallies on Sunday, but few details were available.
	   Lesotho Congress for Democracy deputy leader Kelebone Maope said
he was convinced his party would win new elections that could be
held in 15 to 18 months.
	   ``We will be telling (the rally) that it is important that these
troops stay here so that they can secure a democratically elected
government to be in office,'' Maope said.
	   Opposition alliance spokesman Vincent Malebo said leaders on
Sunday would encourage their supporters to ``fight on to the end.''
	   The two sides are to meet on Wednesday with representatives of
the Southern African Development Community, a 14-nation coalition,
to discuss peaceful resolution.

Dutch flair pays off in 2-0 victory over Peru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Goals from Jaap Stam and Peter van
Vossen gave the Netherlands a 2-0 victory over Peru Saturday and
Frank Rijkaard a winning debut as coach of the Dutch national side.
	   The first half was frustratingly goalless with the Dutch, a
semifinalist this summer in France, dominating in all areas of the
field except the Peruvian penalty area.
	   In the end it took a big defender's power at dead ball situation
to break the deadlock.
	   Manchester United's Stam forced Peruvian keeper Oscar Ibanez to
punch away his free kick, then outleapt the defense on the
resulting corner to head in the eventual game winner in the 56th
minute.
	   The Dutch added insurance with 15 minutes remaining. Edgar
Davids chipped a through-ball to substitute Peter van Vossen, who
celebrated his return to international play with a goal.
	   Playing a flowing, incisive game, the Dutch created half a dozen
chances in the first half, including the first for Marc Overmars
after intricate work from Patrick Kluivert and Dennis Bergkamp.
	   Bergkamp went close himself in the ninth minute with a trademark
curler from the edge of the box which just missed the post.
	   Kluivert missed three great chances, shooting wide from 6
meters, nearly scoring after a Juan Reynoso defensive error and
striking the bar with a header from a corner.
	   Just before halftime, Edwin van der Sar turned a free kick from
Nolberto Solano round the post and the Newcastle United player went
close again near the end of the game.
	   Rijkard, veteran of 73 internationals including the Dutch 1988
European Championship-winning team, kept faith with most of the
Dutch World Cup stars, and SC Heerenveen's Jeffrey Talan was the
only new face in the starting lineup.
	   ___ &QC; 
 &UR; Lineups &QC; 
	   Netherlands: Edwin van der Sar, Michael Reiziger, Jaap Stam,
Frank de Boer, Phillip Cocu, Edgar Davids, Jeffrey Talan, Ronald de
Boer (Clarence Seedorf, 71st minute), Patrick Kluivert, Dennis
Bergkamp, Marc Overmars (Peter van Vossen 68th).
	   Peru: Oscar Ibanez, Jorge Soto, Juan Reynoso, Santiago Salazar,
Nolberto Salano, Juan Jayo, Gregorio Bernales, Jose Pereda, Roberto
Palacios, Carlos Flores (Jorge Hauman, 58th), Flavio Maestri.

tiebreak Saturday to defeat fellow Swede Mats Wilander 7-6 (7-3),
4-6, 12-10 in the MTN Champions at the University of Pretoria.
	   Borg will face Australia's John Fitzgerald in Sunday's title
match of the senior tennis tournament. Fitzgerald advanced with a
7-6 (7-4), 6-3 victory over Yannick Noah of France.
	   Wilander graciously conceded Borg's challenge of an umpire's
decision and gave up a point at 10-10 in the tiebreak.
	   ``This is tennis, not life and death,'' Wilander said.
	   Fitzgerald has never played singles against Borg.
	   ``What can one really say about him. He's Borg,'' Fitzgerald
said. ``I'll be playing against a living legend.''
	   The doubles final will pit Fitzgerald and South African Kevin
Curren against Borg and Wilander.

Robbins regains Champions lead, Pak struggles

<TEXT>
	   OPELIKA, Alabama (AP) _ Kelly Robbins capitalized on a woeful
day by Se Ri Pak, and fired a 5-under-par 67 to reassume the lead
Saturday in the LPGA Tournament of Champions.
	   Robbins, the first-round leader, birdied seven holes, to finish
the third round at 10-under 206 at the 6,300-yard (5,670-meter),
par-72 Grand National. She has a four-stroke lead over Sherri
Steinhauer, whose 70 left her at 6 under.
	   Pak, who led by two strokes after Friday, went from 7 under to
even par as her second-round lead evaporated under a 79. A day
after her string of 103 holes without a bogey ended, Pak bogeyed
seven times. The 21-year-old South Korean didn't have a birdie.
	   Terri Steinhauer fired a 70 to come in four shots back, while
American compatriot Juli Inkster aced the 17th hole for her second
eagle of the day and a third-day 71. Inkster and Englishwoman
Alison Nicholas both are five strokes back. Nicholas fired a 68 to
come in tied with Juli Inkster at 5 under despite playing on a bum
left leg.
	   Nicholas came in just expecting to play 18 holes so that she
could keep her tour exemption after suffering abrasions and a
subsequent infection on her leg in a moped accident. International
players are required to play 15 events, and must finish a round to
count it as an event.
	   Defending champion Annika Sorenstam of Sweden struggled, double
bogeying on the 400-yard (360-meter), par-4 fifth hole and
three-putting from about a half meters (2 feet) on hole 14. The
leading money winner this year, Sorenstam managed to birdie two of
the last five holes to stay at 3 under with a 74.
	   Pak's collapse was contagious. Her playing partner, Swede Helen
Alfredsson, who was two strokes off the lead after two days, had a
76 Saturday.
	   Robbins is seeking her first victory since the opening
tournament of the season, the HealthSouth Inaugural, from Jan.
16-18. Robbins had nine birdies en route to a 66 on Thursday but
fell off with a 73 Friday.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO moved to the brink of
airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened his stand
Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused to make a
key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
president had signaled his willingness to comply with six main
demands in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional, U.S. demand to deploy
an international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to comment on the substance of his talks with
Milosevic, which lasted until around midnight or later for a second
straight night. He said the situation had not changed from the
previous day.
	   But his visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final
authorization for an attack would happen in the next few days
barring a diplomatic breakthrough.
	   In another move showing NATO means business, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers,
one reconnaissance aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in
preparation for possible intervention.
	   While Milosevic had issued no new statements as of Saturday
evening, a Serbian Foreign Ministry spokesman voiced objection to
the proposal to include a small NATO troop contingent in a
monitoring force.
	   ``It is not understandable why foreign troops have to come to
Kosovo _ to do what?'' the unidentified spokesman told BBC Radio 4.
``We cannot understand this.''
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations in Yugoslavia
indicated U.S. officials were making a new push for a diplomatic
settlement, with momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the
outcome.
	   It was not immediately clear whether talks would last through
the weekend. But Milosevic on Saturday canceled plans to attend a
summit of southeastern European leaders in Turkey starting Monday.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Christopher Hill, the U.S. ambassador to Macedonia, and
Britain's ambassador to Yugoslavia, Brian Donnelly, accompanied
Holbrooke to Pristina. Hill then held more talks with ethnic
Albanians later.
	   Resuming talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on the future of Kosovo is one of the key
international demands.
	   There were no reports of fresh fighting in Kosovo on Saturday,
but three people were reported killed on the Albanian side of the
border when they walked into a minefield in the village of Pogaj,
Albania's Interior Ministry said.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation, in an interview with the NTV television station.

Romania beats Portugal 1-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTO, Portugal (AP) _ A 90th minute goal by Dorinel Munteanu
gave Romania, playing with 10 men for the final 20 minutes, a 1-0
victory over home team Portugal in their European Championship
qualifier Saturday.
	   The result lifted Romania onto six points, against three for
Portugal, in group 7.
	   Bogdan Stelea saved a 22nd-minute Portuguese penalty, and
Munteanu scored from a free-kick in the dying seconds when Romania
was under fierce Portuguese pressure.
	   The powerful Romanian team, with its steely defending and slick
passing in attack, kept a tight grip on midfield even after
Laurentiu Rosu was shown his second yellow card and sent off after
70 minutes.
	   Catalin Munteanu several times pierced the Portuguese defense in
the first half, while Gheorghe Popescu came close with a thundering
free-kick from the edge of the area on the half-hour.
	   Portugal looked to its star players to break the stranglehold,
but Luis Figo of Barcelona and Rui Costa of Italy's Fiorentina were
constricted by the visitor's tight marking.
	   The home team's best first-half chance came after Joao Pinto was
fouled in the area and Paulinho Santos stepped up to take the
penalty kick, but Stelea easily blocked Santos's weak shot.
	   Portugal upped the pace after the interval. Figo and Ricardo Sa
Pinto repeatedly found space around the Romanian goal area as the
visitor's defense looked likely to unravel.
	   When Rosu was sent off, Portugal cranked up the pressure.
	   Joao Pinto put the ball in the Romanian net after 75 minutes but
the goal was disallowed for offside.
	   Figo fired a dipping volley narrowly wide and Jorge Costa's
short-range header forced a reflex save from goalie Stelea as time
ran out for the Portuguese.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Turkey shocked defending European champion Germany
1-0 Saturday on a late goal by Hakan Sukur, but World Cup champion
France had a better fate in qualifying play for Euro 2000 with a
3-2 victory in Russia on a late winner by Alain Boghossian.
	   In another key match, Alessandro Del Piero scored twice to break
a goal slump as Italy beat Switzerland 2-0 to stay atop Group 1
with a maximum six points.
	   Playing in Bursa, Turkey, Germany's revamped team and new coach
_ Erich Ribbeck _ dropped its opening game in qualifying while
Turkey has won its first two in Group 3.
	   In the 70th minute, Abdullah Ercan sent in a cross that German
goalkeeper Oliver Kahn raced to control. But he collided with his
libero Jens Nowotny. With the ball bouncing free, Kahn fumbled
another attempt to punch it away, landing the ball onto Hakan's
head.
	   The Turkish striker's header bounced off the post, hit the
clumsy Kahn and rolled over the line.
	   The victory set off wild celebrations _ not just in Turkey _ but
in Germany as some of the two million Turks who live in Germany
took to the streets to celebrate.
	   In Moscow, Alain Boghossian scored in the 81st as France won 3-2
over Russia in Group 4. The World Cup champions opened last month
with a disappointing 1-1 draw with Iceland and Russia lost 3-2 to
Ukraine.
	   Nikolas Anelka scored in the 13th for France and Robert Pires
made it 2-0 15 minutes later. Igor Yanovsky made it 2-1 on a header
in the 45th and Alexander Mostovoi equalized in the 55th from a
free kick that beat keeper Bernard Lama.
	   In Udine, Italy, Del Piero scored against Switzerland in the
19th and 62nd in a comfortable win for Italy before 38,000 at
Friuli stadium. The Juventus star had scored only once in his last
16 games for club and country. He finished off a slick three-man
play for the early goal and then spun in a free kick from just
outside the penalty area.
	   Elsewhere on a day of 20 qualifiers:
 &UR; GROUP 1 &QC; 
	   In Copenhagen, Denmark, Adrian Williams and Craig Bellamy scored
in the second half to give Wales a 2-1 win over Denmark. Soeren
Frederiksen gave Denmark a 1-0 lead in the 58th, but Williams tied
a minute later and Bellamy _ a substitute _ got the winner four
minutes from the end. Mogens Krogh played goal for the injured
Danish keeper Peter Schmeichel. Wales has three points and Denmark
one.
 &UR; GROUP 2 &QC; 
	   In Riga, Latvia, Lativa followed its shock victory over Norway
with an impressive 1-0 victory over Georgia to stay atop the group
with six points. On a wet, sometimes foggy pitch, Latvia scored
only three minutes into the match with a corner kick by Marian
Pahar that was deftly tapped in by Andrei Shtolcer.
	   In Ljubljana, Slovenia, Norway came from behind to beat Slovenia
2-1. Zlatko Zahovic opened in the 24th, his third in two qualifying
games. But Tore Andre Flo scored in the final seconds of the first
half and Kjetil Rekdal got the winner in the 80th when he
redirected a deflected free-kick into the goal.
 &UR; GROUP 3 &QC; 
	   In Belfast, Northern Ireland, Keith Rowland scored in the 31st
minute as Northern Ireland beat Finland 1-0. The win atoned for
Northern Ireland's 3-0 drubbing from Turkey in its Euro opener last
month. Finland beat Moldova 3-2 last month.
 &UR; GROUP 4 &QC; 
	   In Andorra La Vella, Andorra, Vitaly Kosovsky and Serhiy Rebrov
scored as Ukraine defeated Andorra 2-0. Ukraine has six points in
two matches.
	   In Yerevan, Armenia, Armenia and Iceland played a 0-0 tie before
17,000 in Ararat stadium.
 &UR; GROUP 5 &QC; 
	   In Warsaw, Poland, Poland stayed atop the group with six points
in two games after a 3-0 win over Luxembourg. Jerzy Brzeczek opend
the scoring in the 19th, striker Andrzej Juskowiak made it 2-0 on a
header in the 33rd and Miroslaw Trzeciak scored on another header
in the 64th
	   In London, the 0-0 England-Bulgaria draw is bound to increase
the pressure on England coach Glenn Hoddle, who has been widely
criticized for the club's play following a 2-1 loss last month in
Sweden. Bulgaria lost its opener last month to Poland 3-0 and now
is under a new coach Dimitar Dimitrov.
 &UR; GROUP 6 &QC; 
	   In Larnaca, Cyrpus, Austria won 3-0 after Cyprus was reduced to
10 mean early in the game. Harald Cerny scored twice _ in the 53rd
and 61st _ and Hannes Reinmayr got the other in the 74th. Austria
has four points, the same as Israel.
	   In Serravalle, San Marino, Israel routed San Marino's collection
of amateur players 5-0 on goals by Haim Ravivo, Avi Nimni, Alon
Mizrachi and Najuan Geryev. San Marino defender Mauro Valentini
scored an own-goal.
 &UR; GROUP 7 &QC; 
	   In Porto, Portugal, a 90th minute goal by Dorinel Munteanu gave
Romania, playing with 10 men for the final 20 minutes, a 1-0
victory over Portugal. The win gave Romania six point in two games,
the same as Slovakia. Bogdan Stelea saved a 22nd-minute Portuguese
penalty, and Munteanu scored from a free-kick in the dying seconds
when Romania was under fierce Portuguese pressure.
	   In Vaduz, Liechtenstein, Slovakia defeated Liechtenstein 4-0
with two goals from Robert Tomaschek and one each from Miroslav
Sovic and Peter Dubuvsky.
	   In Baku, Azerbaijan, Hungary won 4-0 with goals from Pal Dardai,
Bela Illes, Istvan Pisont and Miklos Feher.
 &UR; GROUP 8 &QC; 
	   In Valletta, Malta, Croatia came from behind to beat modest
Malta 4-1. The Maltese, who have usually served as a punching bag
for Europe's top teams, took a 1-0 lead on Hubert Suda's penalty
kick in the 28th. Croatia rallied with two goals Davor Vugrinec _
making his debut _ and one each from Dario Simic and Davor Suker.
 &UR; GROUP 9 &QC; 
	   In Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Czech Republic clinched a
3-1 away victory on goals by Miroslav Baranjek, Vladimir Smicer and
Patrick Berger. Substitute Marko Topic scored for Bosnia. The
Czechs lead group with six points in two games.
	   In Edinburgh, Scotland, Billy Dodds scored his second in the
84th minute to give Scotland a come-from-behind 3-2 win over
Estonia. Dodds came off the bench and scored his first a minute
after taking the field to level at 1-1 in the 70th. Maksim Smirnov
gave Estonia the lead in the 76th, but Scotland leveled an own-goal
by Sergei Hohlov-Simson in the 78th. Hohlov-Simpson scored for
Estonia in the 35th.
	   In Vilnius, Lithuania, Lithuania and Faeroe Islands played a 0-0
draw. The islanders have one point in four games and Lithuania has
two points in two.

Hungary's men beat out France for epee, sabre team titles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LA CHAUX-DE-FONDS, Switzerland (AP) _ Hungary's men beat out
France for both the epee and sabre team titles Saturday at the
World Fencing Championships.
	   While France took the titles in both the men's and women's
individual epee events, with Hugues Obry and Laura Flessel crowned
champions earlier in the week, the men's team was unable to
overcome a tight Hungarian squad.
	   Additonally, the French men also were forced to hand over their
team sabre title to the Hungarians.
	   Instead the French settled for silver in both events, losing
45-37 to the Hungarians in the epee event, and 45-42 in the sabre.
	   Russia took the epee bronze, defeating Belarus 45-30, while
Poland beat out Italy 45-43 for third place in the sabre.
	   Hungary sliced its way to the final with a 45-39 win over Russia
in the epee semifinal, while France had defeated Belarus 45-38 to
reach the gold medal showdown.
	   The Hungarians, third at last year's worlds in Capetown, edged
Italy 45-44 in the sabre semifinals for a place in the gold medal
duel, while the French team bested the Poles 45-42.

Duval's late flurry gives him one-shot lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HANK KURZ Jr. &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WILLIAMSBURG, Virginia (AP) _ David Duval responded to a
back-nine challenge by making birdies on Nos. 15 and 16 Saturday
and took a one-shot lead into the final round of the Michelob
Championship.
	   Duval lost his lead for one hole to playing partner Phil
Tataurangi of New Zealand, but there was a two-shot swing when he
birdied the par-5 15th and Tataurangi made a bogey. Duval then made
a 3 1-2-meter (12-foot) birdie putt on No. 16.
	   He finished three rounds over the 6,853-yard (6,168-meter) River
Course at Kingsmill with a 13-under 200 total. The American won
this event last year with a 13-under total, beating Duffy Waldorf
and Grant Waite in a playoff for his first victory.
	   ``It certainly tried my patience,'' Duval said of his
3-under-par 68, which included two bogeys. ``I wasn't holing a
whole lot of putts. ... But I looked at it like I was bound to make
a putt at some point.''
	   American Gary Hallberg, who pulled into a tie for the lead at 11
under after 10 holes only to make consecutive bogeys, regained
three strokes over the last five holes, capping his round with an
11-meter (36-foot) birdie putt on No. 18.
	   ``That was just, `Lag it up there,' and it went in,'' Hallberg
said. ``It's my longest putt of the week. My longest in a long
time, actually.''
	   Seeking his first victory since 1992 and first top-10 finish
since 1994, Hallberg finished three rounds one shot behind Duval,
with Tataurangi another shot off the pace and American Frank
Lickliter fourth, three shots back.
	   Hallberg had a 66 Saturday, Tataurangi a 69 and Lickliter a 70.
	   Duval, Tataurangi and Hallberg shared the lead on two occasions,
both times at 11 under. Hallberg dropped out the first time with
bogeys at Nos. 11 and 12, and Duval dropped back when Tataurangi
made a 3-meter (10-foot) putt on No. 14.
	   But the 26-year-old New Zealander didn't last long in the top
spot, hitting his second shot into the nasty rough on the 15th,
hitting a lousy chip and three-putting. Duval two-putted for birdie
from 12 meters (40 feet).
	   Duval's birdie on No. 16 gave him a two-shot lead, but only
briefly as Hallberg started his 11-meter (36-foot) putt just a few
seconds later.
	   Hallberg, a three-time winner on the U.S. tour in his career,
said he almost gave up the game a few years back, but decided
instead to tear his game down and rebuild it piece by piece, just
like many young players are doing.
	   ``I just started doing that a year ago at age 39,'' he said,
``and I'm pretty excited with the results. ... It feels good to not
suffer out there.''
	   American Payne Stewart, five strokes off the lead at the start
of his round, and Australian Bradley Hughes were four back. Stewart
shot his second straight 67, trimming seven strokes from par after
a bogey-bogey start, and Hughes shot a 69.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO moved to the brink of
airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened his stand
Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused to make a
key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between
Belgrade and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said the Yugoslav
president had signaled his willingness to comply with six main
demands in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures would include withdrawing more troops from
Kosovo, allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up
serious talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their
self-rule which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an
international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke has declined comment on specifics of his latest
meetings with Milosevic, which lasted until after midnight for a
second straight night. He said earlier the situation had not
changed from the previous day. There was no immediate comment from
either side following the talks' end early Sunday, and no
indication on when or whether they would resume.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO allies moved to the brink
of agreeing on airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened
his stand Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused
to make a key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   On a day of shuttle diplomacy by Richard Holbrooke between

	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
broke promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war and violated a pledge
earlier this year to halt his offensive against ethnic Albanian
militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke has declined comment on specifics of his latest

second straight night. He said earlier the situation had not
changed from the previous day. There was no immediate comment from
either side following the talks' end early Sunday, and no
indication on when or whether they would resume.
	   His visit to Pristina and return to Belgrade for more talks
signaled a glimmer of hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt
a crackdown in Kosovo that has killed hundreds and displaced
upwards of 300,000 from their homes.
	   Stepping up the pressure on Milosevic, NATO Secretary-General
Javier Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels. He said the
final authorization would happen in the next few days unless
Milosevic complies fully with demands.
	   In another move showing NATO means business, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers,
one reconnaissance aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in
preparation for possible intervention.
	   Also Saturday, Bulgarian leaders said they were ready to allow
NATO aircarft to use Bulgarian airspace for airstrikes against
neighboring Yugoslavia but that Bulgaria will not get directly
involved in military operations.
	   President Petar Stoyanov announced the decision after a
five-hour meeting of the Council on National Security, which was
called after a request by NATO's North Atlantic Council to use the
airspace.
	   Milosevic issued no new statements Saturday.
	   The independent Nasa Borba daily reported Saturday that
Milosevic told Holbrooke that he wouldn't even consider accepting
foreign troops in Kosovo.
	   During his Pristina visit, Holbrooke was noncommittal when asked
whether the continuing talks meant he has faith an agreement can be
reached.
	   ``We always believe it's better to keep talking, and nobody
wants to have to resort to violence or military action.''
	   It was not immediately clear whether talks would last through
the weekend. But Milosevic on Saturday canceled plans to attend a
summit of southeastern European leaders in Turkey starting Monday.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Philip Reeker, a spokesman, said Holbrooke and his aides were
conducting two-track talks _ on a political level and on
Milosevic's compliance, ``because compliance has got to be full,
durable and verifiable.''
	   Talks on self-rule would involve concessions by both sides:
Milosevic would have to give up his full domination over the
southern Serbian province; and the Albanian side would have to
acknowledge that it might settle for less than full independence.
	   Chief ethnic Albanian negotiator Agani has rejected the latest
U.S. proposal, saying Kosovo could not remain in Serbia following
the latest carnage. The Serbian side was close to accepting it, but
rejects the idea that Kosovo police would be dominated by ethnic
Albanians, Serbian sources said.
	   No fighting was reported Saturday in Kosovo, but three people
were reported killed on the Albanian side of the border when they
walked into a minefield in the village of Pogaj, according to
Albania's Interior Ministry.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation, in an interview with the NTV television station.

 &UR; Cohen: U.S. aware of terrorist attack plans on American sites &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Cohen's comments in Qatar; CHANGES

 &UR; By JABER AL-HARMI &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ The United States has evidence that a
``number of terrorist attacks'' have been planned against American
interests abroad, Defense Secretary William Cohen said Saturday.
	   As a result, heightened security at U.S. Embassies and other
facilities will continue ``for a long time,'' Cohen told reporters
after his talks with Qatar's Foreign Minister Sheik Hamad bin
Jassem bin Jaber Al Thani. He did not elaborate.
	   Cohen arrived here earlier Saturday from Bahrain as part of his
six-nation Gulf tour, which includes the United Arab Emirates,
Oman, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.
	   This is his first visit to the Gulf since two near-simultaneous
Aug. 7 bombings on U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania killed 224
people, including 12 Americans.
	   The United States blames Osama bin Laden, a wealthy former Saudi
citizen who lives in Afghanistan, for the bombings. In retaliation,
the U.S. military fired a barrage of missiles at camps run by bin
Laden and a factory in Sudan that Washington said made a precursor
for nerve gas. The Sudanese maintained it made pharmaceuticals.
	   Asked at the news conference if the U.S. government fears more
attacks on its interests abroad, Cohen replied: ``We have
sufficient evidence to believe that a number of terrorist actions
have been planned and an attempt will be made to carry them out.''
	   ``We intend to remain as vigilant as possible ... We need to
work very cooperatively with all of our allies and all our friends
to combat this type of terrorism from being carried out,'' he said.
	   Cohen also said the United States will not interfere if Iran and
Afghanistan's Taliban militia become embroiled in a war. Border
tensions have escalated over the killings of eight Iranian
diplomats and a journalist by the Taliban in August.
	   Earlier, in Manama, Bahrain, Cohen told reporters that it has
become ``imperative'' for American allies in the Gulf to acquire a
ballistic missile defense system to counter long range weapons in
the hands of countries such as Iran and Iraq.
	   Cohen said the United States has five defense systems under
research and development and ``we hope we can share that technology
with Bahrain and other Gulf countries.''
	   ``Because of the proliferation of missile technology globally
but especially in the Gulf region, we believe it's important'' to
look at ways to cooperate with U.S. allies, said Cohen.
	   The United States sees Iraq and Iran, which recently tested a
long-range missile, as major threats to the Gulf region.
	   Cohen said Iraq, which is under U.N. sanctions, continues
efforts to acquire missile technology that has a longer range than
it is permitted to have
	   Cohen spent three days in Bahrain, which is home to U.S. Navy's
5th Fleet.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian authorities moved to shut
down a popular independent radio station late Saturday, a station
executive said _ a day after the government put into effect a
decree tightening state control over media.
	   Two inspectors from the telecommunications ministry, accompanied
by police, entered Radio Index offices and demanded the station
cease broadcasting because it doesn't have a legal license, said
deputy chief editor Aleksandar Vasic.
	   They said they were confiscating the station's equipment.
	   Vasic alerted other media but said employees would not resist.
	   Earlier in the day, the radio had changed frequencies and
claimed its signal was being jammed by a transmitter belonging to
the state-owned Serbian radio-television company.
	   On Thursday, Radio Index was suddenly evicted from premises it
had rented for years from state-run radio. It found another
location the same day.
	   The radio's chief editor, Nenad Cekic, had said the action was
apparent retaliation to his protests against the government
crackdown on independent media.
	   In instituting the crackdown, authorities branded foreign
programs aired on some radio stations as damaging, anti-Serb
propaganda, masterminded in the West to help Serbia's ethnic
Albanians in Kosovo province to secede.
	   The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe assailed
the moves as amounting to ``a declaration of war against the
independent media.''
	   Radio Index did not relay foreign broadcasts but was critical of
the government. It has been operating on the same frequency for six
and a half years and had a contract to that effect.
	   At a government auction for licenses in May, it was among many
independent stations that were refused frequency licenses by the
government but continued operating without one.
	   Critics of President Slobodan Milosevic's government have said
he is using NATO threats to use force against Yugoslavia because of
its Kosovo offensive as a pretext for clamping down on opponents.

Leeward Islands defeats Jamaica in Red Stripe Bowl
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with final results &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Defending champions the Leeward Islands
moved into a strong position to join Barbados as semi-finalists
from Zone Two of the Red Stripe Bowl cricket tournament, with an
exciting 15-run win over Jamaica at Sabina Park Saturday.
	   With Barbados and the Leewards both having six points, Jamaica,
with three points, must beat Barbados impressively to gain a
semi-final place.
	   The Leewards gallantly defended their modest 181 for seven made
in 50 overs, thanks to penetrative bowling from their fastbowlers
who dismissed the Jamaicans for 166 in the 46th over.
	   West Indies fastbowler Kenneth Benjamin led the Leewards
Islands' bowling with three wickets for 25 runs in his ten overs.
He wrapped up the Jamaican innings in the 46th over his final when
the last three batsmen were dismissed.
	   First, Benjamin trapped a dangerous-looking Nehemiah Perry leg
before wicket for 21 before Andre Coley was run out two balls
later. Benjamin then clean-bowled Bryan Murphy to give the Leewards
a dramatic win.
	   Earlier, the Leewards had struggled against the Jamaican
spinners after winning the toss and batting with West Indies
discard Keith Arthurton, who made 40 to be their leading batsman.
	   But their bowlers stuck to the task with Jamaica losing their
last four wickets in the space of ten runs with lanky fastbowler
Curtly Ambrose picking up the key wicket of topscorer Wavell Hinds,
who made 55.
	   Despite losing their first two wickets for 14 runs, the
Jamaicans looked on track for their second win of the tournament
when a third wicket partnership between Hinds and Christopher Gayle
carried the score to 62.
	   But when the lefthanded Gayle, who hit three boundaries in pacer
Hamish Anthony's second over, was out in the 23rd over, the home
team lost wickets regularly.
	   Among those wickets were captain Jimmy Adams who made 28 before
he was out attempting a big hit in the 35th over. Ambrose removed
the aggressive Hinds six overs later to set the stage for
Benjamin's late burst.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO moved to the brink of
airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly softened his stand
Saturday on international demands over Kosovo but refused to make a
key concession in talks with a U.S. envoy.
	   After another long night of talks between the Yugoslav president
and U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke, the Serbian government issued a

BELGRADE: immediate comment.
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   On a day when the U.S. trouble-shooter shuttled between Belgrade
and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said earlier that the
Yugoslav leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six
main demands in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures, based on a U.N. Security Council resolution last
month,
	   would include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo, allowing
humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious talks with
the secessionists on the restoration of their self-rule which he
abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an
international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   Washington is pressing for a monitoring force because Milosevic
is known for breaking his promises during Bosnia's 1992-95 war, as
well for violating a pledge earlier this year to halt his offensive
against ethnic Albanian militants in Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke has declined comment on specifics of his latest
meetings with Milosevic, which lasted until after midnight for a
second straight night. He said earlier the situation had not
changed from the previous day.
	   There was no immediate indication after the talks ended early
Sunday on when or whether they would resume.

Hitchcock, Finley, Caminiti move Padres within one game of Series,
</HEADLINE>
4-1 &QL; 
 &UR; By BERNIE WILSON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ Sterling Hitchcock allowed one run and three
hits in five-plus innings and Steve Finley and Ken Caminiti came
through with clutch two-out RBI hits to lead the San Diego Padres
within one game of the World Series with a 4-1 victory over the
Atlanta Braves on Saturday.
	   The victory gave San Diego a 3-0 lead in the National League
Championship Series and need only a victory at home on Sunday or
Monday to go to the American Major League Baseball championship
series for only the second time.
	   No team has ever come back from a 3-0 deficit in the history of
American MLB postseason play.
	   Saturday's game was the first NLCS game in San Diego since 1984,
when the Padres won three straight over the Chicago Cubs to reach
their only World Series. The only player left from that team is
eight-time batting champion Tony Gwynn.
	   Hitchcock struck out six and walked five while his Atlanta
counterpart, Greg Maddux, allowed two runs and five hits in five
innings, his shortest postseason outing since lasting just 3 1-3
innings with the Cubs in 1989. He struck out three and walked two.
Maddux, a four-time Cy Young winner, has lost three straight NLCS
starts and four of five.
	   San Diego reliever Trevor Hoffman came on with the bases loaded
and two out in the eighth and threw three straight pitches past
pinch-hitter Javy Lopez to end the threat.
	   With the Padres trailing 1-0, Hitchcock started the winning
rally when he poked Maddux's first pitch just beyond the reach of
diving shortstop Walt Weiss with one out in the fifth. With two
outs, Finley doubled into the left-center gap to score Hitchcock.
After Gwynn was intentionally walked, Caminiti singled up the
middle to score Finley with the go-ahead run.
	   San Diego had to survive a tense bases-loaded situation in the
sixth. Hitchcock walked Andres Galarraga and was relieved by Donne
Wall. Andruw Jones singled, Maddux sacrificed and pinch-hitter Ryan
Klesko was intentionally walked. Wall then struck out pinch-hitters
Michael Tucker and Greg Colbrunn, hitting for Maddux.
	   Tucker hit a long foul ball down the right field line and
Colbrunn hit a long foul to the left side.
	   The Padres added two runs with two outs in the eighth. Wally
Joyner walked and scored when left fielder Klesko misplayed Carlos
Hernandez's double, allowing Hernandez to take third. He then
scored on Lopez's passed ball.

Album of previously unreleased Marley songs not popular in Jamaica

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A new album of previously unreleased
Bob Marley songs may be causing a stir overseas but not in Jamaica,
where some fans of the reggae legend are crying exploitation.
	   Since its release several months ago, ``The Complete Bob Marley
and the Wailers: 1967-1972'' has earned rave reviews during
promotional stops in Canada and the United Kingdom, but not in the
home country of the late reggae star. Sales have been slow in
Jamaica.
	   ``Bob most likely would not have wanted these songs released,''
said respected Jamaican musicologist Dermot Hussey. ``It's all
about making money.''
	   But respected Marley historian Roger Steffens, who has been a
part of the album's promotional tour, described the response to the
set as ``phenomenally positive.''
	   The album is distrubuted by JAD Records, which is owned by Danny
Sims, an American producer who worked with rhythm and blues singer
Johnny Nash and Marley while living in Jamaica during the late
1960s.
	   Marley wrote several of Nash's biggest hits including ``Stir It
Up'' and ``Guava Jelly.'' Both songs were produced by Sims, who
also produced the Marley classic ``Bend Down Low.''
	   Sims and Marley split in the early 1970s, but Sims retained
publishing rights to several of the dreadlocked singer's best-known
songs.
	   In 1996, Sims released ``Soul Almighty: The Formative Years,''
which comprised his first set of songs with Marley. Writing in
Billboard Magazine, Timothy White, author of the Marley biography,
``Catch A Fire,'' described it as ``worthless.''
	   Marley died in 1981 from cancer at age 36.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ While NATO moved to the brink of
airstrikes, Slobodan Milosevic reportedly has softened his stand on
international demands over Kosovo but refused to make a key
concession in talks with a U.S. envoy. After another long night of
talks between the Yugoslav president and U.S. envoy Richard
Holbrooke, the Serbian government issued a statement saying all
U.N. demands had been fulfilled. It did not elaborate. Serbia is
the dominant republic of Yugoslavia. But it was not immediately
clear whether the government was simply reiterating previous claims
that it is in compliance. Holbrooke had no immediate comment. On a
day when the U.S. trouble-shooter shuttled between Belgrade and
Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said earlier that the Yugoslav
leader had signaled his willingness to comply with six main demands
in order to head off intervention. (YUGOSLAVIA-KOSOVO)
	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels shot down a jetliner carrying 40
civilians in eastern Congo, firing a missile that hit the rear
engine of the plane, an airline official said. Rebels said the
aircraft was ferrying government troops. he Boeing 727 crashed
Saturday, shortly after takeoff into a densely forested area just
outside of Kindu, about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) east of the
capital, Kinshasa, said Stavros Papaioannou, an official for Congo
Airline. There was no immediate word of casualties because rescue
workers were still searching for wreckage. Papaionnou said from
Kinshasa that the victims were civilians being evacuated from
Kindu. Spokesmen for the 3,500-strong rebel force preparing to
attack Kindu acknowledged downing the plane but said it was
carrying 40 government soldiers. (CONGO-DOWNED PLANE)
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ With continuing economic woes creating doubts
about its food supply, officials acknowledged Saturday that Russia
is seeking food aid from Europe and grain purchases from the United
States. The report comes despite previous assurances by the
government that no grain imports were planned this year. But the
two-pronged food hunt reflects the government's increasing concern
over how it will cope with fallout from the plunge in the national
currency, the sharp decrease in imports and Russia's worst grain
harvest in decades. Russian agricultural executives are heading to
the United States over the next few days to negotiate the
purchases, the Agriculture Ministry said, according to the Interfax
news agency. (RUSSIA-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia is lashing out at
neighboring Asian countries for sympathizing with dissident leader
Anwar Ibrahim, whose detention sparked yet another protest
Saturday. ``We should not interfere in the internal political
affairs of other countries, especially the friendly nations,''
tourism minister Sabbaruddin Chik said Saturday in the latest such
criticism. His comments came a day after Foreign Minister Abdullah
Badawi blasted Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines for showing
solidarity for the ousted deputy prime minister, who was arrested
as he mounted a political challenge to Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's 17-year-rule. Even as the tourism minister spoke,
thousands of demonstrators defied authorities again Saturday and
rallied in downtown Kuala Lumpur to support the jailed reformer
politician and to demand the prime minister's resignation.
(MALAYSIA-POLITICS)
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Saturday assured white farmers, frightened by hundreds of killings
of whites in rural areas, that there is no political campaign to
chase them from their farms. Some of the attacks were motivated by
revenge for the exploitation of farmhands who still toil under
apartheid-era conditions, Mandela said at a summit on the violence.
Improving conditions for the black workers could help end the
killings, he said. About 80 white farmers have been killed so far
this year, fueling charges by the mainly white opposition parties
that Mandela's government is not concerned enough about the victims
because of their color. (SOUTH AFRICA-FARM KILLINGS)

Album of previously unreleased Bob Marley songs not popular in
</HEADLINE>
Jamaica &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD CAMPBELL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A new album of previously unreleased
Bob Marley songs may be causing a stir overseas but not in Jamaica,
where some fans of the reggae legend are crying exploitation.
	   Since its release several months ago, ``The Complete Bob Marley
and the Wailers: 1967-1972'' has earned rave reviews during
promotional stops in Canada and the United Kingdom, but not in the
home country of the late reggae star. Sales have been slow in
Jamaica.
	   ``Bob most likely would not have wanted these songs released,''
said Dermot Hussey, a Jamaican musicologist. ``It's all about
making money.''
	   But respected Marley historian Roger Steffens, who has been a
part of the album's promotional tour, described the response to the
set as ``phenomenally positive.''
	   The album is distributed by JAD Records, which is owned by Danny
Sims, an American producer who worked with rhythm and blues singer
Johnny Nash and Marley while living in Jamaica during the late
1960s.
	   Marley wrote several of Nash's biggest hits including ``Stir It
Up'' and ``Guava Jelly.'' Both songs were produced by Sims, who
also produced the Marley classic ``Bend Down Low.''
	   Sims and Marley split in the early 1970s, but Sims retained
publishing rights to several of the dreadlocked singer's best-known
songs.
	   In 1996, Sims released ``Soul Almighty: The Formative Years,''
which comprised his first set of songs with Marley. Writing in
Billboard Magazine, Timothy White, author of the Marley biography,
``Catch A Fire,'' described it as ``worthless.''
	   Marley died in 1981 from cancer at age 36.

 &UR; Eds: Items include John Lennon poem, Indian film.

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ A foul-mouthed poem written by the late Beatle
John Lennon earned 3,352 pounds (dlrs 5,350) at auction Saturday
for the fan who received it almost 30 years ago.
	   The typed work, made up of a four-letter expletive repeated 104
times and the single word ``you,'' was sent to poet Susan Baker in
1969 after she wrote to Lennon requesting a poem. Signed and titled
by Lennon and countersigned by his wife, Yoko Ono, it consists of
the four-letter word arranged in seven columns with ``you'' at the
center of the middle column.
	   The sale price included a cover letter in Lennon's handwriting
which read:
	   ``Dear Susan, here's the poem you wanted _ you can publish ...
but not make a record of it _ for it turns into a song then _ OK?''
	   Auctioneers Finan and Co. said Saturday that the buyer wished to
remain anonymous and left the auction shortly after the sale at a
hotel in Mere, western England.
	   Ms. Baker was the manager of a band called the Barrow Poets,
which offered performances of both poetry and music.
 &UR; ___
	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Producer and director Roger Corman has
announced a science fiction project in a sprawling southern Indian
film complex, which he says will cost half what it would in
Hollywood.
	   The film, ``Nightfall,'' will be based on a short story by
science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about a planet which has six
suns and never sees night, Corman told reporters Thursday in
Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh. Corman owns the production company Concrorde-New Horizon.
	   Corman's film, the first Hollywood film project in the city,
will be shot at the Ramoji Film City, a new 6.5 billion rupees
(dlrs 154 million) complex housing state-of-the-art studios on
2,000 acres (800 hectares).
	   ``The film will tell the story of this planet, its civilization
and how it was destroyed. It will be a story of science,
rationalism and religion,'' Corman said. He planned the release for
the end of 1999.
	   Corman sold his earlier company, New World Pictures, in 1983.
His productions include Suburbia, Carnosaur, Big Bad Mama, Eat My
Dust, Rock and Roll High School, Screwballs, Death Stalkers and
Love Letters.

Brazilians set to find out force of post-election austerity
</HEADLINE>
measures &QL; 
 &UR; BY ALEX DUFF &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Many Brazilians aren't sure what
to expect when President Fernando Henrique Cardoso unveils the
tough austerity measures that he promised before his re-election a
week ago.
	   But one thing is certain: His remedy for Brazil's ailing economy
will surely be bitter. Cardoso has promised to announce by Oct. 20
a range of austerity measures that are expected to slash jobs and
government spending. Interest rates may also stay pegged at 50
percent.
	   ``The (country's) financial adjustment will be dramatic,
definitive and permanent,'' said Demosthenes Madureira de Pinho
Neto, foreign affairs director at Brazil's Central Bank, earlier
this week.
	   Neto said government spending for 1999 would be cut by around
dlrs 20 billion (reals 25 billion). That would ease Brazil's budget
deficit of more than dlrs 60 billion (reals 71 billion), a
staggering 7.3 percent of its gross domestic product.
	   But such steps should improve investor confidence _ now at a low
ebb, with around dlrs 30 billion withdrawn from the country in
August and September.
	   ``It's all up to him (Cardoso) now to fight off an economic
crisis but I'm not sure how he intends to do it,'' said Anderson da
Silva Pereira, 20, one of 35 million Brazilians who voted for
Cardoso.
	   Cardoso appears set to increase taxes on bank transaction
charges, said Michel Temer, president of the Chamber of Deputies,
after a meeting with the president this week. Such an adjustment
would not have an immediate effect on most Brazilians.
	   A more painful measure, however, may be public sector job cuts
that would increase Brazil's rising unemployment, which now stands
at 8 percent.
	   On Saturday, Cardoso did not appear worried. He was shown in
televised footage on a yacht off Brazil, enjoying a post-election
break.
	   His critics weren't nearly so relaxed.
	   Opposition leader Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who lost the
election to Cardoso, claimed Cardoso was merely acting as a puppet
for the International Monetary Fund as it tries to halt the global
financial crisis.
	   ``The president is prohibited from saying what he intends to do
to face the crisis because it is not the government but the IMF
which is preparing the measures for Brazil,'' he said.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto
Pinochet continues to make a ``very positive'' recovery at a London
hospital, a day after undergoing surgery to correct a herniated
disc, his Senate office said Saturday.
	   The medical team attending the 82-year-old retired general will
let him to leave his bed on Sunday and walk a few steps, a brief
statement from the office said. The only medication he has needed
are mild painkillers.
	   Pinochet is in London with his wife and two daughters. The name
of the hospital where he was operated on has not been disclosed.
	   Pinochet seized power in a bloody 1973 coup and ruled until
1990. He remained commander-in-chief of the army until last March,
when he was sworn in as a senator-for-life, a post established for
him by a constitution his regime drafted.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A shootout Saturday on a bus traveling
between Mexico City and the popular tourist destination of
Teotihuacan left a policeman and a robber dead, authorities said.
	   Details were sketchy about the shootout and it was not
immediately known if any tourists were aboard.
	   The government news agency Notimex reported that two passengers
were seriously injured, but a deputy prosecutor from the Mexico
State attorney general's office, Alejandro Arley Angeles, said he
could not confirm that.
	   Angeles said the bus was on a regular route from Mexico City to
Teotihuacan, site of pre-Hispanic pyramids, when gunmen forced it
stop and tried to rob the passengers.
	   Notimex said a policeman, Vicente Arturo Moreno Herrera,
confronted the robbers and a shootout ensued. Moreno and a robber
were killed; the other two gunmen fled.

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A second straight day of marathon
talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and a U.S. envoy
suggested new hope for a settlement to head off NATO airstrikes,
but produced no word of a deal.
	   Even as NATO moved to the brink of airstrikes, Milosevic
apparently refused to make a key concession in talks Saturday with
Richard Holbrooke _ allowing an international monitoring force in
Kosovo _ despite a reported willingness to meet other demands.
	   ``I'm not aware at this point that any agreement has been
reached,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said early Sunday in
Washington, after talks in Belgrade had ended.
	   Holbrooke had no immediate comment, and it was not known when or
whether talks would resume. He said earlier the crisis remained as
serious as ever.
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ Milosevic's
government issued a statement early Sunday saying all conditions
necessary for a political settlement had been met and all U.N.
demands fulfilled.
	   But the government has insisted for days that it is in
compliance with last month's Security Council resolution, something
world leaders strongly dispute.
	   On a day when the U.S. trouble-shooter shuttled between Belgrade
and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said he had signaled his
willingness to comply with six main demands in order to head off
intervention.
	   Those measures include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo,
allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious
talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their self-rule
which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an
international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   The day-long diplomacy Saturday signaled at least a glimmer of
hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo
that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from
their homes.
	   Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, Washington
ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible
intervention.
	   Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final
authorization for an attack would happen in the next few days
barring a diplomatic breakthrough.
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S.
officials were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement, with
momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the outcome.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met with three ethnic Albanian negotiators
_ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and then with
political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Restarting talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on Kosovo's political status is one of the
key international demands.

Despite modest agenda, China-Taiwan talks could be a breakthrough

	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ As China and Taiwan prepare for their
first high-level meeting in five years, their longstanding struggle
is producing a rare sign of hope in Asia.
	   More than two years ago, relations between the military power
and the island it regards as a renegade province produced a
confrontation that drew the world's attention.
	   Infuriated by Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui's unofficial
visit to the United States in June 1995, China launched military
exercises that involved missile test-firing off Taiwan.
	   In March 1996, Beijing stepped up the ante by firing three
ballistic missiles that landed close to Taiwan's two main
international ports. U.S. forces responded by sending two Navy
battle groups to the Taiwan Straits, and the standoff soon ended.
	   On Oct. 14, Taiwan's chief negotiator, Koo Chen-fu, will meet in
Shanghai, China, with his counterpart, Wang Daohan, in their first
get-together since the two held a watershed meeting five years ago
in Singapore to begin a regular dialogue.
	   The agenda of the two elder statesmen is modest. And in
interviews with The Associated Press, Taiwan's foreign minister and
its chief spokesman said the two sides should once again focus on
bilateral issues such as fishing disputes, because they remain far
apart regarding the goal of one day reunifying.
	   ``We would like to resume our dialogue, reduce our
misunderstandings, and deal with existing issues that need to be
solved,'' said Foreign Minister Jason Hu.
	   ``I don't think it would serve any purpose to talk about
reunification at this moment. If we don't even trust each other,
there is not enough good will on either side,'' he said.
	   In a separate interview, Chen Chien-jen, Taiwan's government
spokesman, said: ``China has not even renounced the use of force
against us, and it still treats us as a local government, which no
one on this island can accept.''
	   Nevertheless, Taiwan and China both appear determined to end
their stalemate and to restart their ruptured dialogue. If they
succeed, it could be one of the few breakthroughs crisis-ridden
Asia has seen lately.
	   In fact, since U.S. forces ended the Chinese brinkmanship with
Taiwan in 1996, the region has suffered one setback after another:
	   _A major economic crisis that now shows signs of going global;
	   _A nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan;
	   _A border standoff between Afghanistan and Iran;
	   _Social unrest that unseated Indonesia's leader and now
threatens Malaysia's; and
	   _A rocket test-firing by North Korea that angered Japan.
	   China and Taiwan have been enemies since Mao Tse-tung's
Communists took over the mainland in 1949, and forced Chiang
Kai-shek's Nationalists to flee to the island.
	   Today, Taiwan is a rollicking democracy with a vibrant
free-market economy, while China is still trying to dig out from
decades of central planning.
	   China does all it can to prevent other countries and the United
Nations from recognizing Taiwan as an independent nation.
	   A campaign by President Lee to raise Taiwan's international
profile was set back this summer when U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Washington wouldn't back an independent Taiwan or let it into
the United Nations. Clinton's statement pleased China and
apparently gave it an incentive to meet with Taiwan again.
	   Signs of the challenges that await the Oct. 14-19 China-Taiwan
talks include one of the locations where they will be held, and
comments that both sides have made ahead of time.
	   Koo, an 81-year-old top official in Taiwan's governing party,
and Wang, an 84-year-old former Shanghai mayor, are only expected
to exchange pleasantries during their talks in Shanghai.
	   Because Koo loves opera, one session will take place during a
private performance of a Chinese opera noted for its clanging
cymbals, colorful costumes, and shrill female arias.
	   But before Koo's visit to China ends on Oct. 19, he also is
scheduled to meet with Chinese President Jiang Zemin in Beijing.
	   Chinese officials have insisted that the Koo-Wang meeting should
prepare China and Taiwan to begin discussions about reunification.
They have urged the island to show its sincerity and to change its
``ambivalent attitude'' toward the talks.
	   Taipei responded by canceling a military exercise on Oct. 12
that was to show Taiwanese how their forces and U.S.-made weapons
could defend the island against a Chinese invasion. It would have
been Taiwan's largest display of military might in years.
	   But Koo has said his goal is only to cultivate an atmosphere for
more talks in the future. ``We have taken the first step, but there
is still a long way to go,'' he told reporters.
	   Yang Kai-huang, a China expert at Soochow University in Taipei,
said Koo and Wang are both well-versed in the skill of ``getting
their points across indirectly while avoiding direct
confrontation'' and will use that to keep the talks going.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ On a hot summer night, a Circle Line boat is
packed for a ``blues cruise'' up the East River and out to the
Statue of Liberty, with Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown and his band
making music that sparkles like the lights of the boat on the
water.
	   Many think of Brown as a bluesman; he won his 1982 Grammy Award
for ``Alright Again'' _ best blues album. But his musical range
goes well beyond blues.
	   Born in Louisiana, he grew in Texas up with his father's Cajun,
country and bluegrass music and didn't even hear blues until he was
15. In the 1960s he was playing country music. In 1976 he and his
quintet were playing a folk festival in Washington when a State
Department official heard them and sent them off to tour Africa.
	   On April 18, when ``Gatemouth'' celebrated his 74th birthday, he
was performing at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. His newest album
is ``Gate Swings,'' big-band jazz.
	   ``Gate,'' people call out to him on the boat, and line up to be
photographed with him. He's beaming, dressed in a black hat and
blue Western shirt with silver buttons.
	   He used to wear zoot suits or white tails. But ``Western never
changes and you're always dressed,'' he says.
	   Brown remembers well the night in 1947 at the Bronze Peacock
nightclub in Houston when he first electrified a big crowd.
	   ``T-Bone Walker got sick. He ran for the restroom. I happened to
be in the club. I ran up on the stage and picked up his guitar. I
was green but I had no lack of confidence. His band asked what I
was going to do. I didn't even know the key. I started to play.
	   ``I made dlrs 650 in tips in 15 minutes. I was guitar rich there
for a while. It was an all-black audience, 1,100 people. It was
right after the war; people had money.''
	   Walker was mad when he came back to the stage, Brown says. ``He
took his guitar away from me. It put too much pressure on him. I
put pressure on people. I do. I'm not going to be in second place.
I never have felt pressure in my life, from nobody.''
	   On that Houston stage, on the spot, he composed and sang a song:
``My name is Gate. I just got in your town. You don't like my
style, I will not hang around...''
	   When he recorded it later, he called it ``Gatemouth Boogie.''
	   He has written well over 100 songs, including his band's theme
song, ``Bits and Pieces.'' He was once told that you couldn't work
a Texas blues club if you couldn't play ``Okie Dokie Stomp.'' It
became his signature tune.
	   While Gate talks, his band rehearses. ``That's `Front Burner,'
one of Basie's tunes. We're going to put it on the next album,'' he
says. Then he hums Duke Ellington's ``Caravan,'' deciding it
swings. ``I pick tunes that got movement to them,'' he says.
	   From his father he learned to shun negative or vulgar lyrics,
won't play songs ``that make you feel like going out and shooting
your mother-in-law.'' He considers rap a fad but doesn't condemn
it. ``I guess all kids go through a fad. That's one of them. My fad
was big-band stuff. It's my favorite.''
	   Why is he called Gatemouth? ``Wait till my book comes out,'' he
says. But it has been written that he was so gabby at school that a
teacher told him, ``Your mouth swings like a gate,'' and it stuck.
	   Brown is slim and wiry. ``I eat very little,'' he says. ``I
don't overcrowd my stomach. I don't use drugs or drink alcohol. The
only pop I like is root beer. I've been drunk twice in my life.
Getting ready to go in the Army did it the first time. A beautiful
female caused it one time. It made me so sick I never did it
again.''
	   He used to chain-smoke cigarettes, now smokes a pipe.
	   Early on, Brown got advice from both Count Basie and Duke
Ellington. When the Basie Band played in Orange, Texas, Brown's
home town, he listened from a back door. Basie saw him, beckoned
him inside and asked if he played music. Brown said he was trying.
``Just keep on playing. You'll be good someday,'' Basie replied.
	   In 1948, Brown played the Twenty Grand, a Detroit nightclub, and
saw Ellington in the audience. He did his usual stunts of splits
and putting the guitar behind his back. He recalls Ellington
telling him: ``Forget the clowning and play your instrument. Let
your instrument do all the work.''
	   ``It made me mad but I never did it again,'' Brown says.
	   ``I used to do crazy things like youngsters do. Once I wrapped a
rope around me some way and swung across 2,000 people in an
auditorium in Houston, playing guitar. The band was supposed to
catch me when I swung back but they missed. I swung back out and
had to turn loose and fell in on the crowd. Women and men grabbed
me and saved me. I didn't do that no more.''
	   He still plays about 200 dates a year. During October and
November, he plays 22 dates, three of them in Canada. He usually
tours abroad twice a year. In February he performed in France,
Slovenia, Austria and Belgium. In July he appeared in Norway,
Sweden, France, Denmark, Germany and Finland. Last year's concert
cities included Johannesburg and Singapore.
	   On the blues cruise, a dlrs 25-a-ticket event, a party of Wall
Streeters in suits requests ``Della's Got the Blues,'' which he
wrote in 1971 in Europe. Brown obliges, and throws in a pertinent
ad-libbed line: ``Wall Street is shaking and so is your stock.''
	   He plays a country tune, then an impressive arrangement of Earl
Doggett's ``Honey Boy,'' and a new tune with eerie keyboard
tremolos, ``Swamp Ghost.'' He gives his young trumpet and saxophone
players a rest while he plays viola on a Cajun tune, ``Big
Mammou,'' and fiddles so fast his bow blurs on ``Up Jumped the
Devil.''
	   He hears talking in the audience. ``You want to get throwed off
the boat? I'll do it,'' he says sternly. ``You didn't pay your
money to hear yourselves talk. Settle down back there.''
	   He doesn't have to say it again.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ It was a day set aside to talk about love, and
Tatyana needed some help.
	   Not for herself, but for her son.
	   ``Why didn't your son call himself?'' asked Seva Kaplan, the
48-year-old host of the New York area's only radio talk show for
Russian immigrants.
	   ``He's shy, he refused,'' Tatyana said, listing his fine
qualities and reading out his phone number.
	   Then, her son's romantic prospects presumably improved, Tatyana,
a 65-year-old native of Moscow, had one more thing to say: She's
fully behind President Bill Clinton.
	   Love, politics, local traffic jams and the woes of Russia mix
easily on Narodnaya Volna, or the People's Wave, a call-in show
listened to avidly by Russian emigrants in the neighboring states
of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut.
	   It brings them news on things that matter naturally to
immigrants -- citizenship problems, keeping financially afloat --
and eases them into what doesn't come naturally to Russians:
speculating on the life and future of a nation's ruler.
	   ``People who come from a closed society aren't used to knowing
much about their leaders,'' Kaplan said, running his hands through
his short, sandy hair.
	   Kaplan, who only asks callers for their first names, says he is
the only Russian radio talk show host in the United States, and
people from all over the country often call in after hearing about
him. Radio stations in other states have asked him to syndicate the
show, but he cannot afford to customize the show for other markets.
	   He leases his radio time from Multicultural Broadcasting, which
also provides space to independent producers of shows in several
other languages, including Spanish, Ukrainian, Italian and
Japanese.
	   ``It's just a way to help people free their minds,'' Kaplan, 48,
said of the show, which is broadcast 6 a.m. to 8 a.m. Monday
through Friday on WPAT-AM.
	   Kaplan, who left Moscow for the United States 10 years ago and
speaks English fluently, doesn't limit his contact with listeners
to the average of 25 callers per program. He usually fields dozens
of calls from people with questions who phone after the program.
	   Kaplan also encourages English speakers to call, although those
just looking to practice their Russian language skills do so at
their own risk.
	   One caller during a recent matchmaking program spoke very broken
Russian, explaining that he learned a little from his mother who
used to live in Moscow.
	   ``Let's not waste our valuable time,'' Kaplan said in English.
``Are you looking for a girl?''
	   Kaplan's new sidekick, 31-year-old Anna Pekerman, pointed to
herself, signaling that she would take over this call. ``Are you
looking for somebody like your mother?'' she asked.
	   Kaplan started his show in August 1997 in conjunction with the
local Russian daily newspaper, Novoye Russkoye Slovo (New Russian
Word), which provides him with an office to use as a studio at
their headquarters in lower Manhattan.
	   ``I prefer anything that has a fun flavor,'' Kaplan said,
sipping coffee after the show.
	   The radio operation occupies barely half the space provided,
allowing room for two chairs and wall shelves with hundreds of
compact discs organized by musical category.
	   Kaplan's background is in electrical engineering and computer
science. But he has learned enough about being a radio show host to
weave local, national and international news into his programming,
as well as traffic reports and sports.
	   Advertisements, interspersed every few minutes in Russian and
English, range from local Russian businesses to a large Canadian
telecommunications corporation.
	   Kaplan doesn't allow any wasted time, even during commercial
breaks, when rustling can be heard as he underlines sections to
read from the many Russian and English newspapers and entertainment
schedules spread out on the desk and the floor.
	   Kaplan and Pekerman, who emigrated as a child, face each other
across a wide, white table. A few feet (meters) away, producer
Dmitry Istratov controls the sound, phones and commercials.
	   Kaplan, who rarely raises his smooth voice, does most of the
talking on the air and off, teaching Pekerman his basic rules of
radio _ there should never be an empty pause during the show _ and
dropping in the occasional Russian adage that she is ``too young to
remember.''
	   Pekerman, formerly an advertising art director, said she is
often surprised by what their listeners consider controversial _
including special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's report calling for
Clinton's impeachment for allegedly lying in court about sexual
relationships.
	   Many Russian immigrants have criticized Kaplan for devoting time
to the report, saying the president's personal life should not be
discussed in public.
	   Kaplan said he does not know how many people listen to his show
but cites a census estimate of 1 million Russians in the tri-state
region as his potential audience.
	   His fans agree.
	   ``All Russian speakers in this region know Seva Kaplan and
listen to his show,'' said Lyuba Chernova, a Russian teacher who
lives in New Jersey. ``People either love him or they don't love
him because he says what he think.''

Apollo 12 moonwalker shares paintings, stories in new book

<TEXT>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida (AP) _ He landed on the moon with the
steely precision of a test pilot, yet surveyed everything through
an artist's sentimental eyes. Three decades later, Apollo 12
moonwalker Alan Bean is sharing his paintings and stories in a
book.
	   Bean wants to ``tell it like it was'' on the moon so others can
be as excited about space travel as he is. He also wants to
provide, as the only astronaut-turned-painter, an artistic record
of ``one of the great adventures of humankind.''
	   The result is ``Apollo: An Eyewitness Account by
Astronaut/Explorer Artist/Moonwalker Alan Bean,'' a glossy,
176-page anthology published this month by The Greenwich Workshop
Press.
	   ``I want kids to read this. I did it for the long term,'' says
Bean, 66, the fourth man to walk on the moon. ``I was always
inspired by the Western paintings of Remington and Russell, and I
thought maybe I can do a similar thing about the space frontier
that they did with the Western frontier.''
	   Because most of Bean's 120 moonscapes are owned by private
individuals, the book is especially valuable.
	   It's the most complete retrospective of his moondust-sprinkled
art.
	   ``For the last 10 years, I've painted on commission so when a
painting is finished it goes into somebody's house never to be seen
again, really, by groups,'' says Bean. ``So I knew that I needed to
have a book.''
	   Each of the 93 paintings in ``Apollo'' is accompanied by a brief
story that Bean wrote while creating the artwork.
	   All six manned moon landings are represented _ mostly his own,
of course _ as well as lunar-orbiting Apollo 8 and aborted Apollo
13.
	   Among the titles: ``Armstrong, Aldrin, and an American Eagle'';
``A Giant Leap''; ``Houston, We Have a Problem''; ``The Last Man on
the Moon''; ``Lunar Grand Prix''; ``Sunrise Over Antares'', and
``Tiptoeing on the Ocean of Storms.''
	   Bean recruited art lover John Glenn, the first American to orbit
the Earth and a passenger on space shuttle Discovery's upcoming
flight, to write the introduction to ``Apollo.'' For the text, Bean
teamed up with Andrew Chaikin, author of the 1994 book ``A Man on
the Moon.''
	   ``He saw the same monochromatic world as the other astronauts,''
Glenn writes of Bean, ``yet with an artist's eye he also saw
intrinsic beauty in the rocks and boulders and their textures and
shapes.''
	   Unlike the 11 other moonwalkers, Bean returned to Earth in
November 1969 with vivid descriptions of color, shadow and light.
(He and Pete Conrad spent 31 hours on the lunar surface and made
two outside excursions.)
	   Bean, who served as the lunar module pilot, went on to command
Skylab, NASA's first space station, while continuing to squeeze in
evening art classes when he wasn't training. He quit NASA in 1981,
a few months after the space shuttle's debut, to pursue an art
career.
	   ``I loved being an astronaut,'' says Bean. ``I would have loved
flying the space shuttle, but there were people there who could do
it as well as I could or better. Yet no one was interested in doing
this other job, which was recording it artistically.''
	   Bean's gamble paid off. His paintings fetch between dlrs 18,000
and dlrs 70,000 apiece; he completes about four a year. He works
surrounded by seven Lhasa apsoes _ his ``little girls'' _ in a
studio at his Houston home.
	   To set his art apart, Bean uses aircraft plywood as his canvas.
He covers the board with a white acrylic texturing compound, then
creates a rough lunarlike surface with the geologist's hammer and a
sharp-edged bit that he used on the moon. He stamps footprints onto
the compound with a replica of the soles of his moon boots.
	   For added authenticity, Bean stirs in moondust.
	   He cuts up the dusty patches from his spacesuit and sprinkles
pieces onto the texturing compound. He also blends in fragments of
the charred heat shield from his Apollo 12 capsule, and flecks of
gold foil that covered the hatch as insulation.
	   Obsessed with accuracy, Bean scrutinizes NASA archival
photographs from the moon before painting. He also studies pictures
he took of NASA technicians in spacesuits and poses toysize models
he built of moonwalkers, rovers and landers. He illuminates the
models with a single high-intensity light adjusted to mimic the sun
angle present at the time of the depiction.
	   ``Can't go back,'' Bean says matter-of-factly.
	   Only twice has Bean had to recall a painting. He mistakenly
added a 16-mm camera to the Apollo 17 lunar rover in ``Fender
Lovin' Care'' and made the aft heat shield on the Apollo 8 capsule
square instead of rectangular in ``Homeward Bound.'' He got the
paintings back after some begging, fixed them and returned them to
their anxious owners.
	   ``Nobody knew but me,'' says the perfectionist Bean.
	   But he notes: ``If you don't get it right, you can forget it. It
isn't going to be a historical painting. It's just going to be a
painting of some guys running around on the moon.''
	   As the moonwalkers grow older _ two of the 12 are dead _ their
recollections become increasingly important, says Bean. Apollo 15's
James Irwin died in 1991; Apollo 14's Alan Shepard died in July.

<TEXT>
	   FREDERICK, Maryland (AP) _ William Cochran used to worry when
people touched his mural.
	   But after 5 1-2 years of visitors murmuring in amazement as
their fingertips would brush the concrete surface while he worked,
the artist understands.
	   ``It's human nature,'' Cochran says, ``and part of the fun of
the mural.''
	   The urge to touch, to connect, is what the work, a painted
bridge over Carroll Creek, is all about. It tricks the eye with
trompe l'oeil stonework, dazzles the mind with more than 100 images
seemingly carved into the sandstone blocks and warms the soul with
its message of community spirit.
	   ``Bridges take separate land and they make common ground,'' the
artist says. ``Bridges connect.''
	   He painted the last symbol on the 100-foot-long (30-meter-long)
bridge Sept. 12 at a dedication ceremony for the Community Bridge
in the heart of downtown Frederick. It was a community event for
the more than 1,000 residents who contributed money or symbol
suggestions to the dlrs 300,000 project.
	   The mural is so convincingly detailed that passersby have
suggested trimming its painted ivy and scouring its faux algae
stains. Each step alongside or beneath the bridge reveals another
bit of astonishing artwork, by turns classical, whimsical,
spiritual.
	   After marveling at the life-size images of a fountain, iron
gate, Grecian-style statue and solemn angel, one discovers the
mural's many smaller symbols _ some just inches high.
	   A steaming cup of coffee; a black hand clasping a white one; a
school bell; a motorcycle; a porch swing; a rose. All were
suggested _ in letters, conversations, photographs and e-mails _ in
response to Cochran's question: ``What object represents the spirit
of community to you?''
	   The artist says he turned down offers of up to dlrs 25,000 to
paint corporate or organizational logos on the bridge.
	   Cochran, 43, trained in English, philosophy and metaphysics,
painted half a dozen murals before envisioning the Community
Bridge.
	   He persuaded the Board of Aldermen to use dlrs 70,000 they had
earmarked for cladding the bridge in real stone as seed money for a
project that would involve the entire community. It has taken dlrs
166,000 in public funding, dlrs 50,000 from the Carroll Creek
Rotary Club and more than dlrs 80,000 in private donations.
	   Mayor James S. Grimes, who championed the project as an
alderman, personally donated dlrs 5,000.
	   ``The bridge and its uniqueness has brought national recognition
to the city of Frederick,'' Grimes says. ``The fact that it's being
done by one of our own reflects the mixed society we have in this
historic community.''
	   Cochran wouldn't reveal his fee but said he has worked 60 hours
a week since early 1993 to realize his vision. The bridge stands
beside an art museum, the Delaplaine Visual Arts Center, in the
center of a planned complex of new office and apartment buildings.
	   ``It should be a work that will anchor the spirit of community
in this new public space and help catalyze economic development,
public involvement and social and cultural transformation,''
Cochran says.
	   Last year, the bridge won a Project of the Year Award from the
American Public Works Association. The project's World Wide Web
site, bridge.skyline.net, has inspired a similar national art
project in South Africa.
	   Jack Becker, managing editor of Public Art Review, called the
Community Bridge remarkable for ``its ability to reach out locally
and globally with a very clear purpose and process while
maintaining the highest artistic integrity.''
	   The mural has already won the hearts of Fredericktonians.
	   ``I go into a store downtown to get something for the mural and
they say, `Is that for the mural? Just take it.' And that happens
over and over again,'' Cochran says.
	   In painting the bridge, he says, he has learned that everyone
wants to connect with others.
	   ``The bridge reminds us you can always find a bridge, build a
bridge, walk across a bridge,'' Cochran says. ``We're not divided.
We're on common ground.''

Album revives country music cheating songs

<TEXT>
	   NASHVILLE, Tennessee (AP) _ In country music, there's no such
thing as an ``inappropriate relationship.'' It's just plain old
cheating.
	   And there are no ``legally accurate'' explanations, only
confessions.
	   How's this for direct: ``Hell yes, I cheated, even though it was
wrong. She gave me something, I'd been missing at home. You know I
love you, but I can't pretend. Hell yes, I cheated. And I'll do it
again.''
	   That's from ``Hell Yes, I Cheated,'' a minor hit in 1977 for
James Pastell. Written by Glenn Sutton and Larry Cheshier, it is
performed by Ted Roddy on a new CD titled ``The Wandering Eyes:
Songs of Forbidden Love.''
	   ``It is politically incorrect, but (cheating is) out there still
happening,'' said Rosie Flores, who also sings on the album.
``People do have affairs.
	   ``I always thought that they stopped doing cheating songs
because it's such a bad thing, a bad subject,'' she said. ``It's
something that people don't want to admit. But many people can
relate to those songs.''
	   Elsewhere on ``Songs of Forbidden Love,'' Kelly Willis combines
Philly Soul and the Nashville Sound on her redo of Billy Paul's
``Me and Mrs. Jones'' _ retitled ``Me and Mr. Jones'' _ with its
chorus line of, ``We got a thing going on.''
	   Roddy jauntily explains what a nice guy he is for cleaning up
those ``Cheatin' Traces'' before his wife finds them, as Roddy,
Flores and Chris O'Connell tell a cheating tale from the respective
viewpoints of the husband, wife and mistress on ``The Game of
Triangles.''
	   Country-music history is peppered with cheating songs, and
singers like Mel Street _ to whom ``Songs of Forbidden Love'' is
dedicated _ made a specialty of them. Street's biggest hit,
``Lovin' on Back Streets,'' reached No. 5 in 1972. He committed
suicide in 1978.
	   ``Songs of Forbidden Love'' was produced by Dave Sanger, drummer
for Western Swing band Asleep at the Wheel and owner of Lazy S.O.B.
Recordings of Austin, Texas, which released the album. The songs
were recorded in Sanger's home studio.
	   The album re-creates the classic Nashville Sound, complete with
lush background vocals and prominent pedal steel guitar. It grew
out of a boring recording session involving Sanger and Jason
Roberts, Asleep at the Wheel's fiddler.
	   ``He just turned 23 _ he's just a pup _ but he knows all this
country music,'' Sanger said. ``I grew up in San Diego on rock 'n'
roll, so while we were sitting around I requested cheesy cheating
songs from him.''
	   Roberts made a compilation tape of the songs for Sanger, leading
to the idea to redo some of them for an album.
	   If the old theme seems fresh, it's because Nashville has weaned
itself from the cheating-song business in the past 25 years as
country music has appealed to a broader audience.
	   ``Back in the '70s country music was not as popular as it is
now,'' Sanger said. ``They were appealing to a different crowd so
that honky-tonk music was for honky-tonks. ... In today's world
getting a blatant cheating song by a corporate (record) executive
may be tough.''
	   Lazy S.O.B. Recordings previously released a theme CD of songs
about Route 66, the legendary road through the American heartland
traveled by so many before the interstate system arrived in the
1960s. Cheating songs seemed like a worthy follow-up.
	   ``It's too good not to do, because no one does those songs
anymore and they're great songs, so if someone's going to do it why
not somebody like me who has got nothing to lose?'' Sanger said.

Long overlooked, military films show World War II in vivid color

<TEXT>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Bright red pools of blood stain the deck of a
landing craft evacuating soldiers wounded on the beaches of
Normandy on D-Day, June 6, 1944.
	   In a second movie segment, yellow tracer rounds fly through blue
sky over Europe, hitting a German plane that spins out of control
and crashes into a green field.
	   And in another clip, Dutch children wave tiny orange flags in a
show of patriotism as Allies liberate Amsterdam from the Nazis.
	   These rare color images, overlooked for more than 50 years,
bring World War II to life as never before. Hollywood has endlessly
recreated the war, with Steven Spielberg's blockbuster ``Saving
Private Ryan'' being the latest effort.
	   But the newly unearthed films are not fiction. They were shot by
military cameramen, and historians believe the impact of the 150
hours of real-life footage will last longer than that of any
matinee fare or familiar wartime newsreels in black and white.
	   ``This will take World War II out of the Civil War era and
remind people and forcibly hit people that this happened only
yesterday,'' said Stephen Ambrose, author of the best-selling book
``D-Day'' and founder of the National D-Day Museum in New Orleans.
	   The collectors, Melvyn Paisley and Lars Andersen, plan to donate
copies of the films this fall to the museum, which is scheduled to
open in 2000.
	   Some clips will be on display for museum goers, while other
footage will be archived for researchers and documentary
filmmakers.
	   For the few veterans and their relatives who have seen some of
the films at veterans' gatherings, it has been an emotional
experience.
	   Kathleen Saunders cried at a reunion of the 362nd Fighter Group
in Seattle last year when she saw a clip showing her father, then
in his mid-20s, in the cockpit of a P-47 Thunderbolt fighter.
	   Lt. Col. Richard Cline had died in a plane crash after the war,
when his daughter was only 13 months old. Before the reunion, she
had never seen a moving picture of him.
	   In the clip lasting only several seconds, Cline puts on his
flight helmet and smiles for the camera before taking off to strafe
enemy tanks and troops. After seeing it, Saunders realized that her
20-year-old son's smile is the same as her father's.
	   Saunders, of Lakeland, Fla., called the fliers' images ``a
window into their daily lives. It is a very brief thing, but for us
it is an incredible moment in time.''
	   Much of the film was shot by professional filmmakers who
volunteered or were drafted into the armed services. Some worked
for John Ford, the legendary Hollywood director. Other footage was
shot by military cameramen from Canada, Germany, Japan and the
former Soviet Union.
	   Paisley, a World War II fighter pilot and former assistant
secretary of the Navy who lives in McLean, Va., got involved in the
search for the movies in 1996.
	   At a reunion of P-47 pilots, he met Lars Andersen, an amateur
military historian who has been collecting color World War II
movies since the mid-1980s.
	   Andersen was there to show a rare film he unearthed of P-47s in
action. Paisley saw footage of himself receiving the Distinguished
Service Cross from Gen. Henry ``Hap'' Arnold in Luxembourg in 1945.
	   The two teamed up and began a search that has led them to dusty
government archive vaults in Washington, D.C., and across Europe.
	   Andersen and Paisley made copies of government film and acquired
other footage from private sources. Although much of what they
obtained is available to the public, few have ever searched for it.
Before Andersen and Paisley started the collection, only five hours
of color World War II film was known to exist.
	   ``The idea is to gather it from all the sources we can all over
the world. If it's preserved properly, the film will last
forever,'' said Andersen, an industrial salesman from Southampton,
N.Y.
	   Paisley thinks there may be another 150 hours of color film
still to be found.
	   What the two have found so far covers a wide spectrum of wartime
scenes.
	   There are shots of French peasants cutting hay by hand in fields
as Allied artillery less than 100 feet away fires at German
positions. There is film of Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini
visiting the Axis' Eastern Front in the former Soviet Union.
Footage taken during V-E Day in Paris shows jubilant residents
waving American and British flags.
	   Many American cameramen who made World War II films in color and
black and white were assigned to the Office of Strategic Services,
the forerunner of the CIA. They went on covert assignments carrying
small movie cameras, sometimes behind enemy lines.
	   George Hjorth, now 76, joined John Ford's military movie making
crew just after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor in December 1941.
	   Three days before D-Day, Hjorth (pronounced Yorth) parachuted
into German-occupied Normandy. He was met by members of the French
resistance, who hid him until the night before the invasion.
	   Hjorth's assignment: To film the invasion from the other side.
	   In the pre-dawn darkness before the invasion, Hjorth was
escorted to Omaha Beach and left alone in a clump of bushes and
rocks.

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Given the setting, Rod Stewart was politely
asked to cool it with the soccer balls.
	   The shaggy-haired British rocker loves to climax his concerts by
booting soccer balls into the audience. But amid the grandeur of a
renovated bank headquarters on Wall Street, a misplaced kick could
knock over a magnum of Dom Perignon or carom off a shiny marble
pillar.
	   And people who have paid dlrs 15,000 for a chance to hear
``Maggie May'' don't want any unexpected items landing in their
lap.
	   The concert lured singer Paul Anka, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz and real estate baron Donald Trump, who were sprinkled
among a gaggle of gowned models and their adoring dates. Waiters in
tuxedos offered caviar on silver platters to Stewart's concert
audience, who later dined on rack of lamb.
	   Stewart's opening night performance at the Cipriani Dinner
Concert Series in Manhattan late last month is easily the most
dramatic example of how the concert business has changed since the
days of dollar cover charges in roadhouse bars.
	   Ticket prices have risen dramatically during the 1990s, to the
point where paying dlrs 100 for a few hours of music isn't as
shocking as it seemed just a few years ago. And the growing,
lucrative market for corporate shows means an audience of
teen-agers in jeans is an outdated image.
	   Small wonder that Stewart serenaded the Cipriani's crowd with
``Some Guys Have All the Luck.''
	   ``This has been a great surprise for us. We kind of thought
you'd just be sitting there,'' Stewart said when the Wall Street
titans rose from their seats to dance and take roses from their
table centerpieces to throw on stage. There's no telling if Stewart
was sincere or just a veteran showman throwing malarkey; he wasn't
talking later.
	   Cipriani's concert stage is in a building once renovated by the
architects responsible for New York's historic Grand Central
Station, but it had remained empty for several years. With such a
majestic lobby, and the financially flush 1990s putting so much
money in the wallets of tycoons who work nearby, the company
thought the time was right for high-end entertainment.
	   Really high end.
	   Customers write checks for either dlrs 150,000, dlrs 125,000 or
dlrs 100,000, buying a yearly subscription for a table that seats
10. The series includes dinner and 10 concerts at an intimate
setting with no more than 820 people. The inaugural lineup also
includes Diana Ross, Whitney Houston, Celine Dion, Aretha Franklin
and Tony Bennett.
	   ``There's really no model for it,'' said Louis Rose, the
facility's general manager. ``I think back to the old-fashioned
dinner clubs that are long gone.''
	   Cocktail hour begins at 7 p.m., with a fully stocked bar and the
waiters circulating with appetizers. Guests descend a marble
staircase for a candlelight dinner an hour later. The concert
begins promptly at 9:15 p.m., after coffee and dessert is cleared
away. Artists perform for a little more than an hour and the night
is done.
	   ``That's all they want,'' Rose said. ``For a lot of these
people, they don't want to be out that late. If they want to, they
can always go out to a restaurant later.''
	   It's the type of gig many artists would have winced at a few
years ago. Remember John Lennon's crack to a royal audience to
rattle their jewelry if they approved of the music?
	   But times have changed.
	   Cipriani's is far from the typical concert experience, of
course. But even the typical event will lighten your wallet. The
average price of a concert ticket increased from dlrs 32 to dlrs
37.50 between 1995 and 1997 _ rising faster than tickets for
movies, live theater or family shows, according to the
Entertainment Marketing Letter.
	   Throw in some food and T-shirts, and the average cost of a night
out for a family of four at a pop concert is dlrs 187.70, the trade
publication said.
	   ``It's definitely still cheaper than Broadway shows,'' said Gary
Bongiovanni, editor of the concert trade publication Pollstar,
``but it's catching up.''
	   Pink Floyd, the Eagles and Barbra Streisand were the pioneers in
taking ticket prices to new levels. They noticed their aging fans
were becoming more affluent and figured if ticket scalpers can
consistently mark up prices for good seats, they could, too.
	   The idea quickly spread.
	   ``More and more artists and their representatives looked at what
was happening and said, `Why can't we do the same thing?'''
Bongiovanni said. ``Some were successful and some weren't.''
	   Also relatively new to pop concerts is the idea of ``gold
circle'' seating, or paying a premium price for tickets close to
the stage. Sometimes, the gold circle is awfully wide, Bongiovanni
said.
	   A lot of money is changing hands in the lucrative new world of
pop concerts. Rose won't say how much Cipriani is paying the acts
to perform, but it's rumored to be somewhere around dlrs 800,000.
	   Cipriani's idea is so new that some artists are uncomfortable
with it; Streisand and Bette Midler declined offers. The act Rose
had at the top of his wish list _ the Rolling Stones _ are plainly
more familiar with the new business realities.
	   ``They came back with a number that they would think about doing
it for, but we couldn't touch it at this point,'' he said.
	   The Stones and other musicians participate in a new but
expanding concert circuit of acts who are paid big money to
entertain at corporate functions and private parties. Bob Dylan and
his son Jakob's band, the Wallflowers, have never performed
publicly on the same bill but they did for a corporate show,
Bongiovanni said.
	   While the prices charged by Cipriani are enough to get heads
spinning among most music fans, New York's financial row is
obviously a much different place. While Rose gulped slightly at
wobbling Wall Street's recent fluctuations, he had reason to be
secure.
	   ``We had most of the tables sold at that point,'' he said. ``It
was payment in full.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A second straight day of marathon
talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and a U.S. envoy
suggested new hope for a settlement to head off impending NATO
intervention, but no word of a deal.
	   Even as NATO moved to the brink of airstrikes, Milosevic
apparently refused to make a key concession in talks Saturday with
Richard Holbrooke _ allowing an international monitoring force in
Kosovo _ despite a reported willingness to meet other demands.
	   ``I'm not aware at this point that any agreement has been
reached,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington
after talks had ended after midnight in Belgrade for the second
night in a row.
	   Holbrooke, who said earlier Saturday that the crisis remained as
serious as ever, had no immediate comment. A U.S. spokesman said
early Sunday that no statement would be forthcoming but that talks
were likely to resume later in the day, probably at noon (1000
GMT).
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ the Serbian
government that Milosevic effectively controls issued a statement
saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement had been
met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.

Five Questions with Gretchen Mol: on the brink of 'it'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo NY348 &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Actress Gretchen Mol has played opposite
Leonardo DiCaprio and Matt Damon, been directed by Woody Allen and
is on the brink of great things in Hollywood.
	   But let's face it: Right now, she's mostly known for The Cover.
	   That would be the Vanity Fair cover picture in the September
issue. The 25-year-old New Yorker is wearing a thin, slinky dress
cut down to Ecuador, leaving very little to the imagination.
	   ``It's pretty provocative and I know that,'' said Mol. ``I'm not
sure what the different reactions are. I know when I saw it, I
thought about my family. But everyone's been positive. The response
has been really encouraging.''
	   The magazine pondered whether Mol is the next ``it'' girl, then
helped the cause by showing a lot of Mol's ``it'' inside with an
Annie Leibovitz-shot photo spread that also included, of all
things, a picture of Mol in sexy pose in an old outhouse.
	   Whether Mol's acting rises to the level of the early hype
remains to be seen. Her two biggest roles are those
girlfriend-to-the-male-star numbers, playing alongside Damon in the
marginally successful ``Rounders'' and DiCaprio in the upcoming
``Celebrity'' directed by Allen. Before that she appeared in the
independent film, ``The Last Time I Committed Suicide.''
	   1. OK, how do you pronounce your last name?
	   Mol: Mall. It's like shopping mall. It's actually Dutch.
	   2. Did you know the magazine cover would be that racy?
	   Mol: I didn't really know. Of course, I saw the dress, and we
were at the beach and everything. I was pretty sure it was going to
be the cover. It was really a collaborative effort. Annie was
really aware of making me comfortable.
	   3. Have you ever posed in an outhouse before?
	   Mol: When we came upon that, it wasn't part of the shoot. We
were in this terrific place in Martha's Vineyard, and here in the
middle of this beautiful foliage was this old, old wooden outhouse
that was really so terrific. I'm fascinated, when driving around,
of seeing broken-down old barns and things like that. When Annie
had me sit in it, she took the Polaroid. It was so beautiful. It
didn't seem like this was an outhouse. I didn't conjure up those
thoughts.
	   4. What was it like working with Matt Damon and Leonardo
DiCaprio?
	   Mol: I feel I was very lucky to be able to work with both of
them, especially at a time before a lot of this (their fame)
happened. It didn't have that same intimidation that I might have
had now. With Matt, he has such a knowledge of filmmaking. He's
really smart and sensitive. Leonardo was really fun and we had a
great time. He's a little more carefree. A lot of the 'down time'
was spent with him being very entertaining.
	   5. What was it like working with Woody Allen?
	   Mol: He sort of keeps you in the dark. It relieves you of a lot
of responsibility. You don't get the whole script. You show up on
the set and you don't know what to expect. All of the actors are
put into that situation. There's anxiety and it creates real
spontaneity.

	   ``The Rolling Stone Women in Rock Collection'' (Razor and Tie) _
Various Artists
	   As an intellectual exercise, these compilations are as
ridiculous as writers who trot out the hoary ``women in rock''
articles every time a new generation invades the charts. How about
men in rock? Or left-handers in rock? Lending credence to sexist
barriers only keeps them up longer.
	   And with licensing rules being what they are, it's almost
impossible to fashion a complete collection. There will always be
deserving favorites left out because the artists _ or their record
companies _ decided not to participate. Joni Mitchell's an obvious
omission here. So is Blondie.
	   Better to judge this compilation on a nonintellectual basis: How
do these three discs sound when you put them into a CD player and
press shuffle? On that level, it's a slam dunk.
	   At the risk of sounding like a complete snob, this collection is
far more challenging and satisfying because it is programmed by
rock critics instead of someone who looked only at chart positions.
It allows the set to include a song like Lucinda Williams' ``Side
of the Road,'' which not only wasn't a hit but was out of print at
the time this compilation was put together.
	   Its definition of rock is refreshingly broad, from Big Mama
Thornton's rendition of ``Hound Dog'' to Patsy Cline's ``Crazy'' to
Queen Latifah and Monie Love's ``Ladies First.'' By no means are
big hits avoided: Anyone can argue about the quality of Jewel's
``Who Will Save Your Soul,'' but there's no denying it's a
benchmark that deserves its place here.
	   If you listen closely, without the shuffle play, a story emerges
about assertiveness and the role of women in society over the last
50 years.
	   Better not to get intellectual about it, though. Just enjoy.
	   _By David Bauder, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Dada'' (MCA) _ Dada
	   Dadaism is alive and well _ and self-titled this time.
	   The Los Angeles band Dada introduced itself in 1992 with an
edgy, sarcastic trip through ``Disneyland,'' the first cut off
``Puzzle.'' The edges are fuzzed a bit in its fourth album, but
much of the alternative bite continues.
	   ``Information Undertow'' laughs at the 24-hour ability to know
everything (``I lit up my Apple, surfed through the shrapnel,
accessed my online babe''). ``Playboy in Outerspace'' rocks through
the downside of nightlife. The West Coast dream gone bad is relived
in the album's first single, ``California Gold.''
	   The group sputters a bit when it tries to slow things down, as
in ``This Thing Together.'' Thankfully, it more than makes up the
difference with rattling gems like ``Beautiful Turnback Time
Machine.'' Its songs have a bouncy creativity that supplants any
surreal effects you'd expect from a band with a name like Dada.
	   _ By Matt Kohlman, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Hatful of Rain, The Best of Del Amitri'' (A and M) _ Del
Amitri
	   Del Amitri still satisfies with a ``Hatful of Rain, The Best of
Del Amitri.'' The Scottish pop band has never reached top-billing
success despite a consistent run of catchy, thoughtful tunes. But
even those who don't know Del Amitri from Dell Computer should
recognize more popular songs, like ``Kiss This Thing Goodbye'' and
``Roll to Me.''
	   The rest of the album balances out nicely for the faithful who
are familiar with the band's quest for love in ``Stone Cold Sober''
or its geographic lovesickness in ``Not Where It's At.'' The album
also is bracketed by two worthy additions, ``Cry to Be Found'' and
``Don't Come Home Too Soon.''
	   There's only a little downfall to the album. ``Spit in the
Rain,'' previously unreleased in the United States, is a throwaway.
And surprisingly, it doesn't include ``Hatful of Rain,'' a charmer
off ``Waking Hours,'' the first of Del Amitri's four albums.
Certainly, it's a well-chosen irony for a band that knows how to
weave life's ironies into music.
	   _ By Matt Kohlman, Associated Press Writer.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   ``Smoke and Steel'' (Alligator Records) _ The Kinsey Report
	   If you're looking for a cradle for urban blues, it doesn't get
any more urban than Gary, Ind., home of The Kinsey Report. Brothers
Donald, Ralph and Kenneth came out of the steel mill town. They
spent their early days as a band backing their father, ``Big
Daddy'' Kinsey, before their first record for Alligator, ``Edge of
the City,'' in 1988. That record defined a genre of blues steeped
in hard rock.
	   To that, the Kinseys added the lessons learned from their father
about gospel. They refined the sound through four recordings and
endless touring in the last 10 years leading to ``Smoke and
Steel,'' by far their best effort.
	   Donald Kinsey, who has appeared with Bob Marley, Peter Tosh and
the Staple Singers, plays guitar with a barely controlled fury. His
leads are clean and tight but with a hardness he has retained since
his days in a heavy-metal band. Kinsey hangs his work on the strong
beat provided by brothers Ralph on drums and Kenneth on bass. The
Kinseys also have refined their songwriting over the years. Themes
range from timelessness of love gone bad to a topical look at black
church fires.
	   ``Smoke and Steel'' is the Kinseys at their grittiest best.

After more than 40 years, 'Lord of the Rings' being made into three
</HEADLINE>
movies &QL; 
 &UR; By MICHAEL FLEEMAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Entertainment Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ As a movie property, the famed J.R.R. Tolkien
fantasy ``The Lord of the Rings'' showed itself briefly, then, like
a hobbit with a magic ring, disappeared, not to be seen again.
	   Published in the mid-1950s as a sequel to Tolkien's ``The
Hobbit,'' ``The Lord of the Rings'' trilogy features vivid tales of
good and evil in the ancient, mythical lands of dwarfs, elves,
hobbits and men. It has sold 50 million copies worldwide and has
been translated into two dozen languages. But it has inspired only
one movie: a mediocre animated feature 20 years ago.
	   Now, in a major gamble, New Line Cinema has committed more than
dlrs 130 million to produce, back-to-back, three special
effects-filled, live-action films based on the books ``The
Fellowship of the Ring,'' ``The Two Towers'' and ``The Return of
the King.'' Filming begins next year and the first installment is
expected by Christmas 2000.
	   The ambitious project is the result of an unusual financial
alliance between rival studios: New Line and Miramax Films. It puts
at the helm Peter Jackson, the New Zealand director of the
critically acclaimed ``Heavenly Creatures, '' a haunting 1994 movie
starring Kate Winslet about two teen-age girls whose friendship
leads to tragedy.
	   Choosing Jackson was a leap of faith for the producers because
he is not well known to the general public and has had no big
commercial successes.
	   But New Line executives, who approved the series in August, were
impressed with the long, international popularity of the Tolkien
books, the potential for a merchandising bonanza, and the vision
and commitment of Jackson.
	   ``There is no question that it has a significant gamble
component. We decided to accept the gamble,'' said Robert Shaye,
chairman of New Line, who suggested the ``Rings'' movies could
reach the cinematic success of another famous film series, George
Lucas' ``Star Wars'' movies.
	   Though reluctant to project film grosses, Shaye said the
studio's ambition is ``to come close to 'Star Wars.'''
	   Tolkien, an Oxford University professor, wrote his ``Hobbit''
sequel during and after World War II. The ``Rings'' trilogy was
published in the mid-1950s and became a counterculture, then
mainstream hit when it caught on in the United States a decade
later.
	   The trilogy follows the adventures of Frodo Baggins, a hobbit _
a diminutive creature that Tolkien once described as an
``unobtrusive but very ancient people; more numerous formerly than
they are today; for they love peace and quiet and good tilled
earth.''
	   Set in a land called Middle Earth, the story has Frodo and his
trusty servant, Sam, carrying the Magic Ring of Invisibility to the
center of the kingdom of the evil Dark Lord Sauron so the ring can
be destroyed and humanity saved.
	   In a foreword to a 1965 paperback edition, Tolkien explained he
had ``the desire of a taleteller to try his hand at a really long
story that would hold the attention of the readers, amuse them,
delight them, and at times maybe excite them or deeply move them.''
	   Which is the same motivation, more or less, of Hollywood
filmmakers, who have long seen the Tolkien books as a prime source
of movie magic.
	   Tolkien, who died in 1973 before ever seeing a movie version of
``Rings,'' sold movie rights to United Artists, but no film was
ever made. Then, in the 1970s, the rights were sold to producer
Saul Zaentz, hot off his first film, ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest.''
	   Zaentz made ``Rings'' into an animated film covering the first 1
1-2 books of the trilogy. ``The Lord of the Rings'' was released in
1978 to lukewarm reviews and an unenthusiastic public.
	   ``We didn't make as good a film as I hoped that we would make,''
recalled Zaentz, whose other credits include Academy Award-winners
``Amadeus'' and ``The English Patient.''
	   ``It didn't lose any money; it did make some money. But somehow,
the animation didn't quite work for me.''
	   For another two decades, Zaentz protectively held onto the
Tolkien rights _ he also owned the rights to ``The Hobbit'' _
rejecting one suitor after another.
	   ``We wanted to see someone make it who we felt could really make
it, someone who really just didn't want to make a hit picture and
move on, someone who really knew what they were doing,'' he said.
	   That person turned out to be Jackson, whose work on ``Heavenly
Creatures'' impressed Zaentz. The producer also liked Jackson's
idea of the ``Rings'' as a live-action treatment with wide use of
computer effects. It was Jackson's spellbinding computer-generated
fantasy sequences that helped make ``Heavenly Creatures'' such a
critical triumph.
	   In January 1997, Miramax optioned the ``Rings'' rights with
Jackson attached as director.
	   But after 18 months of development, Jackson clashed with
Miramax; Jackson and writing partner Fran Walsh wanted to make at
least two films, while Miramax was pressing for one.
	   ``When you're adapting what is widely believed to be one of the
most loved books in the world you have to be very careful,''
Jackson said.
	   Miramax finally allowed Jackson to find another studio. New Line
leaped on the project, reimbursing Miramax about dlrs 10 million
for development and committing dlrs 130 million for production.
Miramax keeps a financial interest as executive producer.
	   Best known for the ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' slasher series,
New Line has had recent hits in ``Blade'' and ``Rush Hour.'' Its
biggest project before ``Rings'' was the dlrs 85 million ``Lost in
Space,'' which got a mixed critical and public reception.

	   LONDON (AP) _ David Hare has written an adaptation of the
hottest play of the London theater season, starring no less a
figure than Nicole Kidman in her English stage debut.
	   Minutes away during September, he could be found on stage
appearing in a separate play, ``Via Dolorosa,'' written for himself
to perform.
	   In the spring, he'll be represented on Broadway for the fourth
consecutive season with the American premiere of his acclaimed play
``Amy's View,'' starring Judi Dench.
	   His last Broadway play, ``The Judas Kiss'' with Liam Neeson,
closed as recently as August, after commercially successful runs in
London and New York. Last winter, New York's Lincoln Center Theater
hosted Chekhov's ``Ivanov,'' starring Kevin Kline, in a new version
by Hare, while London's Almeida Theater revives his 1978 play
``Plenty'' next year.
	   How does he do it?
	   ``I don't work in other media,'' the 51-year-old Hare said early
one recent evening prior to the openings of ``Via Dolorosa'' and
``The Blue Room.''
	   The latter is the 100-minute sexual rondelay that has had
English critics salivating over leading lady Kidman, a Hollywood
film name whose body alone convinced some commentators that they
had gone to heaven.
	   ``All my writing friends write films,'' said Hare, who has
scripted such movies as ``The Secret Rapture'' and ``Damage'' and
both wrote and directed ``Paris By Night'' and ``Strapless.''
	   ``Other writers write films or TV, and if they write films, nine
out of 10 don't get seen,'' he said. ``The reason I work in the
theater is because it's a place where there is some fairly simple
relation between a work and its being put on.''
	   ``I want to see things happen,'' he said. ``Everything I write
gets done.''
	   Still, even Alan Ayckbourn _ who has written well over 50 plays
_ hasn't sustained the profile of late to match that of Hare, whose
gift for attracting celebrities to his material doesn't hurt at the
box office.
	   ``The Blue Room,'' for instance, was long ago earmarked for
Kidman, who had been mentioned for various other theater ventures
in both London and New York.
	   ``It was always her. She always wanted to do it,'' Hare said of
his star, who appears opposite Scottish actor Iain Glen in the new
version of Austrian dramatist Arthur Schitzler's ``Reigen,'' or
``La Ronde.'' With the two actors playing five characters each, the
play has become a hot property for the rest of its run through Oct.
31 at the 251-seat Donmar Warehouse in Covent Garden.
	   Hare admits to being ``quite nervous of the idea'' of adapting
such a well-known source, but was intrigued by the obstacles it
posed.
	   ``Stage adaptations of `La Ronde' have been traditionally not
very successful, and I liked the challenge of that _ that they
usually fail,'' he said.
	   And given his own history of writing rich roles for women, he
was keen to give the 31-year-old Kidman a chance to shine in a
medium she had not tested outside her native Australia.
	   ``She's a feminist actress,'' he said, ``and I think they're
incredibly rare. There are very few who walk on to the stage with
the assumption that they are stronger, cleverer, more attractive
than the person they are speaking to.''
	   ``Nicole is extraordinary because she doesn't have any sense of
playing No. 2, ever,'' he said. (In real life, Hare has a Nicole of
his own _ fashion designer Nicole Farhi, whom he married in 1992.)
	   Still, one could argue, Kidman's considerable talents pale next
to Hare's own. Night after night, he held a Royal Court Theater
audience spellbound during his 90-minute solo play ``Via
Dolorosa.''
	   ``It's partly a meditation on what art can and cannot do,'' Hare
said of the venture, which closed Oct. 3 after its scheduled
month-long run.
	   The play, inspired by four separate visits Hare took to the
Middle East, is expected to be reprised off-Broadway in the spring,
again with Hare, around the time that ``Amy's View'' reaches
Broadway.
	   If ``The Blue Room'' reopens on Broadway in 1999 as expected,
Hare could have three plays in New York simultaneously _ the sort
of feat usually achieved in the musical sphere by the likes of
Andrew Lloyd Webber.
	   That convergence of work across the Atlantic pleases Hare no
end, despite critical brickbats he has suffered in Manhattan for
``The Knife'' and ``The Secret Rapture.'' (His contretemps with
then-New York Times drama critic Frank Rich over the latter work
has become the stuff of theater legend.)
	   ``I always feel my reputation as a playwright was made in New
York in 1982 when I did `Plenty,''' Hare recalled of the
off-Broadway hit that moved to Broadway and was nominated for a
Tony for best play (as were later hits ``Racing Demon'' and
``Skylight'').
	   An analysis of a fractured and fallen country as filtered
through the splintered mind of one central female character,
``Plenty,'' Hare said, `was much, much better received in New York
than in London, so for me New York has always been the place where
my plays are presented.''
	   And with four plays on in London within six months, what could
Hare possibly do for an encore?
	   ``That's enough,'' he said with a laugh, raising a mock-alarm.
``Definitely enough.''

Jean Reno: cinema's multinational mystery man

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ International film star Jean Reno was
international long before he ever became a film star.
	   The son of Spanish parents chased out of their homeland by a
fascist dictator came into the world shortly after World War II in
Casablanca, Morocco, the celebrated international crossroads
immortalized on screen by Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman.
	   Young Juan Moreno roamed the exotic urban oasis in North Africa,
speaking in multiple tongues, learning a different language at
home, at school and at the movies, where everything he saw was a
foreign film.
	   ``In those days the cinema for me was John Wayne, Jean Gabin,
Jean-Paul Belmondo, Alain Delon, William Holden, James Dean, Marlon
Brando,'' Reno says, lounging in a Manhattan hotel suite, sipping
mineral water.
	   As relaxed as the journey from late summer to fall, the veteran
actor currently watching Robert De Niro's back in ``Ronin''
casually describes his family's 1960 move to France, which became
his adopted country.
	   He looks the part of the classic grizzled Frenchman: oblong
face, close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard and a pair of mournful,
magnetic eyes.
	   He grew into manhood in France, was drafted into the French Army
and was trained as a commando in Germany.
	   ``Logical, eh? I was always traveling with a bag in my hand,''
Reno chuckles.
	   Travel remained the norm as an actor. Reno got his start in the
1970s with a traveling theater company that crisscrossed France. He
has gone on to make movies all over Europe and in the United
States, with recent blockbuster credits including ``Mission:
Impossible,'' ``Godzilla'' and now John Frankenheimer's
action-thriller, ``Ronin.''
	   Dream come true? Not really.
	   ``No, I had no big dreams in my mind,'' Reno says of his early
aspirations, as he remembers a time when he sometimes performed for
free, supporting himself with day jobs like truck driver,
accountant and photo shop clerk.
	   ``A play, a character, a place, a director _ a salary, if it's
possible,'' Reno says, chuckling again. ``The joy was just to have
a stage and an audience.''
	   Not that he's complaining about how things turned out. After
winning praise in director Costa Gavras' 1979 film, ``Claire de
Femme,'' Reno teamed up with director Luc Besson in several films,
among them ``The Big Blue,'' ``La Femme Nikita'' and his hit, ``The
Professional.''
	   He starred in France's No. 1 box office hit, the 1993 comedy
``Les Visiteurs'' and its recent sequel. At the top of his game,
Reno is nevertheless the first to acknowledge that international
stardom didn't come without supreme sacrifice.
	   ``I divorced. I paid for my success. You have to pay always,''
Reno says, speaking softly. ``So, it changed my life, but it's OK.
I don't know nobody who doesn't pay.''
	   Reno's French accent is undeniably thick, but doesn't impede
clear communication. Still, his agile mind is sometimes victimized
by a clumsy tongue.
	   Asked to define his greatest challenge performing in English,
Reno says, ``To be believable and understable.''
	   He knows it didn't come out right.
	   ``Understable?'' he asks, laughing at himself. ``Understandable.
You see, I still have to work.''
	   Without missing a beat, Reno proceeds to get laughs doing his
movie star impersonations: John Wayne (``Howdy, pilgrim''), Elvis
Presley (``Thank you very much'') and De Niro (``You talking to
me?''). He tells about cracking up his ``Ronin'' co-star with De
Niro's famous line from ``Taxi Driver.''
	   ``He made that little smile he has, you know, and tried to
stop,'' Reno says.
	   Trying to describe his feelings about working with De Niro, Reno
is stymied by more than the language barrier. ``Robert,'' he says
(pronouncing it Row-bear). Then he pauses, momentarily lost for
words.
	   ``Metaphor,'' he finally says. ``In an orchestra, the first
violin. A lot of colors inside the music he's playing. That's
Robert De Niro. A little bit of green, do-do-hmmm. A little bit of
dark, bo-bo-hmmm. You see. Easy. That's him.''
	   He is reminded that fans and critics alike have ascribed a
similar virtuosity and ease to his work, and he laughs off any such
a comparison as joking or incredible flattery.
	   ``I do what I need to do, all that I can do, to furnish the
work. That is all,'' he says. ``I have been lucky, but there is
never a guarantee. I'm older now and it's always difficult.''
	   More confident than he sounds and with success firmly in hand,
Reno admits hitting 50 this year profoundly affected his psyche.
	   ``It's a problem. How much time do we have? Fifty. How much time
do we have?'' Reno asks, concerned about his four children, two
from his first marriage, ages 21 and 18, and two, ages 2 1-2 and 3
months, with his current love.
	   ``More attention to kids, more attention to the woman you live
with. More attention to the difficulties of people you love, their
pain. Because it's almost done. How much time do we have?
	   ``It's almost done. So you're not in a hurry to prove to
yourself that, in fact, you can exist, that people love you, that
you can be somebody.''

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A second straight day of marathon
talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and a U.S. envoy
suggested new hope for a settlement to head off NATO airstrikes,
but produced no word of a deal.
	   Even as NATO moved to the brink of airstrikes, Milosevic
apparently refused to make a key concession in talks Saturday with
Richard Holbrooke _ allowing an international monitoring force in
Kosovo _ despite a reported willingness to meet other demands.
	   ``I'm not aware at this point that any agreement has been
reached,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington
after talks had ended after midnight in Belgrade.
	   Holbrooke, who said earlier Saturday that the crisis remained as
serious as ever, had no immediate comment. A U.S. spokesman said
early Sunday that no statement would be forthcoming but that talks
were likely to resume later in the day, probably at noon (1000
GMT).
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ the Serbian
government that Milosevic effectively controls issued a statement
saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement had been
met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   The government has insisted for days that it is in compliance
with last month's Security Council resolution, something world
leaders strongly dispute.
	   Hundreds have died and thousands have been displaced from their
homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 against the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting to wrest
Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   On a day when the U.S. troubleshooter shuttled between Belgrade
and Kosovo's capital, Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said
Saturday that he had signaled his willingness to comply with six
main demands in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures, 10th graf

Rebels shoot down airliner in eastern Congo

	   KALIMA, Congo (AP) _ Rebels shot down a jetliner carrying 40
civilians in eastern Congo, firing a missile that hit one of the
plane's rear engines, an airline official said. Rebels said the
aircraft was ferrying government troops.
	   The Boeing 727 crashed Saturday, shortly after takeoff into a
densely forested area just outside of Kindu, about 620 miles (1,000
kilometers) east of the capital, Kinshasa, said Stavros
Papaioannou, an official for Congo Airline.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties as rescue workers were
still searching for wreckage.
	   Papaioannou said from Kinshasa that the victims were civilians
being evacuated from Kindu. Spokesmen for the 3,500-strong rebel
force preparing to attack Kindu acknowledged downing the plane but
said it was carrying 40 government soldiers.
	   Rebel leader Alexis Tambwe Mwamba said fighters had intercepted
government radio messages in Kindu and knew in advance of the
aircraft's arrival. He said the government had been using the
Boeing 727 to fly in troops and ammunition in Kindu for several
days.
	   There was also a dispute over the plane's direction. The airline
said it was hit minutes after takeoff, while rebels said they fired
as the plane made its landing approach.
	   The pilot struggled to bring the plane around for an emergency
landing before reporting that the aircraft would not make it back
to the airport, Papaioannou told The Associated Press.
	   Rebel spokesmen refused to say how the plane was brought down,
but Arthur Mulunda, a rebel brigade commander, said his men had two
SAM-7 missiles in their arsenal to prevent government aircraft from
flying in reinforcements and supplies to Kindu.
	   The rebels were apparently referring to the SA-7, a Russian-made
anti-aircraft missile with a launcher that looks like a bazooka.
According to Jane's Defense Library, it is in common use among
guerrilla and terrorist groups throughout the world.
	   In August, rebels took over several civilian CAL aircraft in
eastern Congo after they launched their rebellion against President
Laurent Kabila. The planes were used to shuttle soldiers to western
Congo near the capital.
	   Rebel aircraft from the eastern stronghold in Goma made at least
eight flights to Kalima's grass air strip Saturday carrying
ammunition and troops. All supplies and troops are trucked to the
frontline at Kindu.
	   Mulunda said rebels controlled three-quarters of the perimeter
around Kindu. He said a corridor leading southwest out of the town
had been left open for civilians to flee and escape possible
casualties.
	   After six days of battling for Kindu, rebel fighters _ ethnic
Tutsis and disenchanted Congolese army soldiers backed up by
neighboring Rwanda _ had made little progress and failed to capture
the town outright.
	   The rebels see Kindu as a major prize in their two-month revolt
against Kabila, whom they accuse of mismanagement, corruption and
warmongering among Congo's 400 tribes.
	   Kabila has turned Kindu into a launching pad for a
counteroffensive against rebel positions in eastern Congo. There
are unconfirmed reports that Chadian and Sudanese troops are
involved in defending Kindu.
	   Kabila accuses Rwanda and Uganda _ former allies who installed
him in power in May 1997 after an eight-month rebellion _ of
sponsoring the new fighting.
	   Both countries say they have legitimate security interests in
eastern Congo and accuse Kabila of failing to rid the common border
area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.
	   Tanks, aircraft and troops from Angola, Zimbabwe and Namibia are
supporting Kabila. The assistance was essential in routing an early
rebel offensive in the west that had reached the outskirts of
Kinshasa in mid-August.

	   LONDON (AP) _ A foul-mouthed poem written by the late Beatle
John Lennon earned 3,352 pounds (dlrs 5,350) at auction Saturday
for the fan who received it almost 30 years ago.
	   The typed work, made up of a four-letter expletive repeated 104
times and the single word ``you,'' was sent to poet Susan Baker in
1969 after she wrote to Lennon requesting a poem. Signed and titled
by Lennon and countersigned by his wife, Yoko Ono, it consists of
the four-letter word arranged in seven columns with ``you'' at the
center of the middle column.
	   The sale price included a cover letter in Lennon's handwriting
which read:
	   ``Dear Susan, here's the poem you wanted _ you can publish ...
but not make a record of it _ for it turns into a song then _ OK?''
	   Auctioneers Finan and Co. said Saturday that the buyer wished to
remain anonymous and left the auction shortly after the sale at a
hotel in Mere, western England.
	   Ms. Baker was the manager of a band called the Barrow Poets,
which offered performances of both poetry and music.

	   HYDERABAD, India (AP) _ Producer and director Roger Corman has
announced a science fiction project in a sprawling southern Indian
film complex, which he says will cost half what it would in
Hollywood.
	   The film, ``Nightfall,'' will be based on a short story by
science fiction writer Isaac Asimov about a planet which has six
suns and never sees night, Corman told reporters Thursday in
Hyderabad, the capital of the southern Indian state of Andhra
Pradesh. Corman owns the production company Concrorde-New Horizon.
	   Corman's film, the first Hollywood film project in the city,
will be shot at the Ramoji Film City, a new 6.5 billion rupees
(dlrs 154 million) complex housing state-of-the-art studios on
2,000 acres (800 hectares).
	   ``The film will tell the story of this planet, its civilization
and how it was destroyed. It will be a story of science,
rationalism and religion,'' Corman said. He planned the release for
the end of 1999.
	   Corman sold his earlier company, New World Pictures, in 1983.
His productions include Suburbia, Carnosaur, Big Bad Mama, Eat My
Dust, Rock and Roll High School, Screwballs, Death Stalkers and
Love Letters.
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ ``Judas!'' a guy in the audience shouts.
	   ``I don't believe you,'' Bob Dylan replies, dramatically drawing
out the last word. ``You're a liar.''
	   The crowd snickers nervously, and Dylan and his band begin to
play the opening notes of the next song.
	   Spurred on by the heckle, someone on stage, perhaps even Dylan
himself, urges the band to play loud, unleashing a scorching
version of ``Like a Rolling Stone.'' The band is accustomed to
being booed; this night is not the first time an audience has
reacted angrily to getting something completely different from what
it expected.
	   But that concert in 1966 was a classic showdown. It caught Dylan
at the zenith of his career, surprising an unsuspecting audience
with his merger of poetic lyrics and electrified rock 'n' roll. The
concert, never before officially released on vinyl or CD, will be
in record stores Oct. 13.
	   The show gained a treasured place in the homes of Dylan
collectors when it became one of the first illegally bootlegged
records in the early 1970s.
	   The official release from Columbia/Legacy Recordings, titled
``Live 1966: The `Royal Albert Hall' Concert _ The Bootleg Series
Vol. 4,'' contains every bit of music from that night. It also
jokingly continues an error generated by bootleggers: The
performance actually took place in Manchester, England, on May 17,
1966.
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ A new album of previously unreleased
Bob Marley songs may be causing a stir overseas but not in Jamaica,
where some fans of the reggae legend are crying exploitation.
	   Since its release several months ago, ``The Complete Bob Marley
and the Wailers: 1967-1972'' has earned rave reviews during
promotional stops in Canada and the United Kingdom, but not in the
home country of the late reggae star. Sales have been slow in
Jamaica.
	   ``Bob most likely would not have wanted these songs released,''
said Dermot Hussey, a Jamaican musicologist. ``It's all about
making money.''
	   But respected Marley historian Roger Steffens, who has been a
part of the album's promotional tour, described the response to the
set as ``phenomenally positive.''
	   The album is distributed by JAD Records, which is owned by Danny
Sims, an American producer who worked with rhythm and blues singer
Johnny Nash and Marley while living in Jamaica during the late
1960s.
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) - No matter that his hair is almost white, and
his favorite blue T-shirt no longer lies flat on the torso, Giorgio
Armani is still what the ``moda Milanese'' is all about.
	   His fashion is neither rock glam nor yuppie minimal. It is about
allowing women to express their own style by offering them sensible
feminine clothes in luxurious fabrics, with an almost obsessive
attention to detail.
	   When upscale Italian ready-to-wear burst onto the international
runway 20 years ago, he was hailed as a master of the new tailored
look, inspired by the way the stylish Milanese dressed.
	   Muted shades were a must; the jacket was all important.
	   Over the years the Milanese runway has seen everything from
Asian austerity, to Los Angeles glamour, to the bare bottoms and
bosoms that resulted in the consecration of underwear as outer
wear.
	   But throughout, Giorgio has stuck to his conservative feminine
guns, and today he still gets away with it.

Kosovo _ despite a reported willingness to meet other demands.
	   ``I'm not aware at this point that any agreement has been
reached,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington
after talks had ended after midnight in Belgrade for the second
night in a row.
	   Holbrooke, who said earlier Saturday that the crisis remained as
serious as ever, had no immediate comment. A U.S. spokesman said no
statement would be forthcoming and that talks were likely to resume
later Sunday.
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ the Serbian
government that Milosevic effectively controls issued a statement
saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement had been
met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   But the government has insisted for days that it is in
compliance with last month's Security Council resolution, something
world leaders strongly dispute.
	   On a day when the U.S. trouble-shooter shuttled between Belgrade
and Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said he had signaled his
willingness to comply with six main demands in order to head off
intervention.
	   Those measures include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo,
allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious
talks with the secessionists on the restoration of self-rule which
he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an
international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his
commitments, would include some NATO troops.
	   ``Milosevic won't make any concessions that go against the
interests of the Serbian people,'' Dragan Tomic, Serbian Parliament
speaker and a close Milosevic ally, said Saturday. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The weekend of intensive diplomacy signals at least a glimmer of
hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo
that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from
their homes.
	   Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, Washington
ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible
intervention.
	   Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final
authorization for an attack would happen in the next few days
barring a diplomatic breakthrough.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they
stop being in force for us,'' said Col. Gen. Leonid Ivashov, head
of the Defense Ministry's main department for international
cooperation.
	   In Kosovo, Holbrooke met Saturday with three ethnic Albanian
negotiators _ Fehmi Agani, Iljaz Kurtesi and Edita Tahiri _ and
with political leader Ibrahim Rugova.
	   Restarting talks between the ethnic Albanians and the
Milosevic-led government on Kosovo's political status is one of the
main international demands. But the Albanians say they are
reluctant to sit down at a table with the Serbs because of all the
bloodshed of recent months.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A second straight day of marathon
talks between President Slobodan Milosevic and a U.S. envoy
suggested new hope for a settlement to head off NATO airstrikes,
but produced no word of a deal.
	   Even as NATO moved to the brink of airstrikes, Milosevic
apparently refused to make a key concession in talks Saturday with
Richard Holbrooke _ allowing an international monitoring force in
Kosovo _ despite a reported willingness to meet other demands.
	   ``I'm not aware at this point that any agreement has been
reached,'' White House spokesman P.J. Crowley said in Washington
after talks had ended after midnight in Belgrade.
	   Holbrooke, who said earlier Saturday that the crisis remained as
serious as ever, had no immediate comment. A U.S. spokesman said no
statement would be forthcoming and that talks were likely to resume
later Sunday.
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ the Serb government
that Milosevic effectively controls issued a statement saying all
conditions necessary for a political settlement had been met and
all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   The government has insisted for days that it is in compliance
with last month's Security Council resolution, something world
leaders strongly dispute.
	   Hundreds have died and thousands have been displaced from their
homes since Milosevic launched a crackdown Feb. 28 against the
ethnic Albanian Kosovo Liberation Army, which is fighting to wrest
Kosovo province from Serbia, the main republic of Yugoslavia.
	   About 90 percent of Kosovo's 2 million inhabitants are ethnic
Albanians, and most favor independence.
	   On a day when the U.S. troubleshooter shuttled between Belgrade
and Kosovo's capital, Pristina, sources close to Milosevic said
Saturday that he had signaled his willingness to comply with six
main demands in order to head off intervention.
	   Those measures include withdrawing more troops from Kosovo,
allowing humanitarian aid to the refugees and opening up serious
talks with the secessionists on the restoration of their self-rule
which he abolished in 1989.
	   But the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said
Milosevic refused to budge on an additional demand to deploy an
international monitoring force in the secessionist Serbian
province. The force, aimed at seeing if he was living up to his

	   ``Milosevic won't make any concessions that go against the

speaker and a close Milosevic ally, said Saturday. Serbia is the
dominant republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The weekend of intensive diplomacy signals at least a glimmer of
hope in efforts to avoid NATO action to halt a crackdown in Kosovo
that has killed hundreds and displaced upwards of 300,000 from
their homes.
	   Showing Milosevic it means business if talks fail, Washington
ordered the deployment of six B-52 bombers, one reconnaissance
aircraft and 13 tankers to Britain in preparation for possible
intervention.
	   The planes will be among 260 U.S. aircraft already committed by
the United States to support possible air operations against Serb
forces. Most of the force already is in Europe, either stationed at
bases there or aboard the aircraft carrier Dwight D. Eisenhower,
which is currently in the Mediterranean Sea, the Pentagon said.
	   A Pentagon statement announcing the deployment reiterated the
U.S. threat that if Milosevic fails to meet with the U.N. demands,
``NATO has plans to use force to gain his compliance by using
airstrikes that will damage his ability to conduct military
operations.''
	   Also stepping up the pressure, NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the 16 members all but erased their remaining
differences on airstrikes at a meeting of alliance ambassadors
Saturday.
	   ``If Milosevic does not comply, I can tell you that NATO is
ready to act,'' Solana told reporters in Brussels, saying final
authorization for an attack would happen in the next few days
barring a diplomatic breakthrough.
	   Still, the flurry of weekend negotiations indicated U.S.
officials were making a new push for a diplomatic settlement, with
momentum toward airstrikes on hold pending the outcome.
	   Meanwhile, a top Russian military official said Moscow was
prepared to take Yugoslavia's side in case of NATO airstrikes, and
provide weapons if necessary.
	   ``If the norms of international law are violated ... then they

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Marathon talks between President
Slobodan Milosevic and a U.S. envoy suggested a new chance for a
Kosovo settlement, but brought no deal by Sunday with NATO on the
verge of approving an attack on Yugoslavia.
	   Even as NATO allies cleared the way for airstrikes, Milosevic
refused to meet a key demand in seven hours of talks Saturday with
Richard Holbrooke _ allowing an international monitoring force in
Kosovo.
	   Holbrooke refused to discuss details of negotiations and gave no
suggestion of any impending breakthrough heading into the
resumption of what he said would be ``continuous'' talks later
Sunday.
	   ``Nothing has changed, and the situation is very serious,'' he
told reporters after ending talks at midnight and then spending
nearly four hours on the phone reporting to Washington.
	   ``On Monday, NATO will meet to authorize action,'' he said. ``We
meanwhile will continue an intense effort to find a peaceful,
acceptable, fully verifiable compliance system, as an alternative
to the other choice'' _ use of force.
	   After another long evening of talks _ the fifth meeting between
Holbrooke and the Yugoslav leader in six days _ the Serbian
government that Milosevic effectively controls issued a statement
saying all conditions necessary for a political settlement had been
met and all U.N. demands fulfilled.
	   But Holbrooke said ``we certainly don't agree.''
	   On a day when the U.S. trouble-shooter shuttled between Belgrade

Kosovo is not Bosnia: It's simpler, but infinitely more

complicated &QL; 
 &UR; With Yugoslavia-Kosovo

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The first mistake in trying to apply
the lessons of Bosnia to Kosovo is imagining them as the same
conflict. The flavor is Balkan, but the sauce is of another color.
	   There are similarities, of course: Both conflicts are part of
the disintegration of the former Yugoslavia, both frighten the West
with their potential for developing into a wider conflict and both
involve Serbs.
	   But Bosnia was an international conflict pitting three homegrown
belligerents against each other, individually or in coalitions,
along with two independent countries to the north and the east.
And, importantly, they spoke the same language.
	   Kosovo is an internal conflict in a province that's part of
Serbia, the dominant Yugoslav republic. It involves disgruntled
ethnic Albanians and Serbs _ two cultures, two tongues, one
territory.
	   In the end, NATO brought its air power to bear in Bosnia, a
peace agreement was signed in Dayton, Ohio, and the West proclaimed
success. Those missiles and bombs are being brought out and
programmed again. Today, however, the political objective is much
more murky.
	   Espen Barth Eide, a Balkans expert at the Norwegian Institute
for International Affairs, says the impression that NATO air power
ended the Bosnian war is false, with the NATO strikes coming while
the Croat-Muslim alliance already was winning against the Serbs.
	   The eventual use of airstrikes in the Kosovo conflict, where
majority ethnic Albanians are fighting Serbs for independence,
seems aimed at bringing President Slobodan Milosevic to his knees,
pushing out his police and military and forcing negotiations.
	   In Bosnia, Milosevic was an integral part of the peace
negotiations, a partner in the final agreement that brought the war
to a close. In Kosovo, he is the intransigent foe, defying the West
and trying to give just enough to fend off the bombs.
	   Ethnic cleansing Bosnian style mostly meant driving a minority
from their property and replacing them with families from the
majority. In Kosovo, minority Serbs are chasing out the majority.
Ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of the population, and their
vacant, shell-shattered houses are not being filled with victorious
Serbs.
	   As in Bosnia, the plight of refugees in Kosovo also fuels
Western efforts to act before winter strikes. Fewer have been
forced to flee this time _ 275,000 in Kosovo compared to a million
during the Bosnian war.
	   Yugoslavia is weaker today than six years ago _ its strength
sapped by international economic sanctions and bankrolling the
Bosnian and Croatian wars. But this time Milosevic's forces are
prepared to defend home territory, not aid allies abroad. That
should toughen their resolve.
	   In terms of hardware, NATO will find itself faced with a
formidable Yugoslav air defense more deadly than anything the
Bosnian Serbs had at their disposal. Whether Milosevic's generals
will be able to use the mostly Russian weapons effectively remains
to be seen.
	   And ground troops _ if ever used _ will face a different
reception than in Bosnia.
	   NATO ground troops went into an independent Bosnia on the basis
of an agreement signed by all parties. Troops coming into Kosovo on
the heels of airstrikes would be welcomed by the Albanians.
	   But they would have to work with intensely resentful Serbs, all
the way up to the top _ to Milosevic.

	   SANUR, Indonesia (AP) _ Celebrating crowds choked the streets of
Bali early Sunday after opposition delegates unanimously reelected
Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter of Indonesia's founding
president, as chairwoman of their party faction.
	   The vote was the first step in Megawati's bid for Indonesia's
presidency.
	   Megawati, daughter of independence leader and former President
Sukarno, was the only candidate on the ballot of her faction of the
Indonesian Democratic Party and got every vote _ along with shrieks
of joy and wild applause.
	   After the show of hands Saturday, the 900 delegates from
Indonesia's 27 provinces chanted, ``Mega must win.''
	   Megawati, who was elected to a five-year term, was not present
when the vote was taken, but spoke late Saturday night at the
conclusion of the three-day conference at a Bali resort hotel.
	   ``This is not the end of the struggle but the only the start,''
she said.
	   Congress delegates implored her to stand as a candidate for
Indonesia's presidency against incumbent leader B.J. Habibie after
a general elections are held next year.
	   During the party congress, she had promised that if she wins
office she would investigate corruption allegations against former
President Suharto, who did everything he could while in power to
thwart her career.
	   She said she would rid Indonesia of corruption and ease the
plight of millions hit by food shortages, soaring prices and
unemployment from the nation's worst economic crisis in three
decades.
	   Throughout the meeting, much of Bali was bedecked with red party
flags and banners. Convoys of motorcycles and trucks paraded though
the streets almost continuously late into the night and early
morning in support of Megawati. Police reported no trouble.
	   In her greatest show of support to date, an estimated 50,000
rallied on Friday to hear her speak.
	   Some say she has a good chance at becoming president. Other
analysts and diplomats, however, caution that it is too early to
predict how much support Megawati's party will attract at
parliamentary election scheduled for next May.
	   The members of the new parliament plus a group of government
appointees will later form an assembly that will select a new
president.
	   Habibie, a friend and former close ally of Suharto, has said he
will run again for office. Habibie has control of the well heeled
ruling Golkar party and is supported by the powerful military.
	   But discontent against his presidency is rising amid the worst
economic crisis in decades. Protests and calls for him to quit have
become familiar as millions of Indonesians slip below the official
poverty line.
	   Suharto replaced Megawati's nationalistic father in 1966, after
the military crushed what it said was a communist coup. Suharto
ruled with an iron fist for 32 years before being forced to quit in
May after riots left 1,200 people dead.

	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ With NATO poised to order airstrikes
against Yugoslavia, a U.S. envoy ended two days of talks with
President Slobodan Milosevic early Sunday without an agreement to
defuse the Kosovo crisis.
	   The envoy, Richard Holbrooke, gave no hint of an impending
breakthrough, saying ``nothing has changed.'' Calling the situation
``very serious,'' he said talks would continue later Sunday to
avert NATO airstrikes.

	   CLEVELAND (AP) _ Back off the window ledges and stop dialing for
help, Yankees fans. Your team has resurfaced in the AL championship
series just in time.
	   New York was a loss away from putting its record-setting season
in peril, but Orlando ``El Duque'' Hernandez pitched seven shutout
innings, and the Yankees evened the best-of-7 ALCS at two games
apiece Saturday night with a 4-0 win over Cleveland.
	   One day after the Indians hit four homers, and two games removed
from Chuck Knoblauch's notorious Game 2 blunder, things are going
the Yankees' way again.
	   They're still not hitting like the team that dominated the AL
since April, getting only only four hits. But they were aggressive
on the bases and got some quality relief to back Hernandez.
	   Even New York owner George Steinbrenner, who tried to fire up
the Yankees with a pregame clubhouse visit, couldn't complain about
anything on this night.
	   All the calls seemed to go New York's way. Second base umpire
Jim McKean was involved in two plays, and although neither effected
the outcome, they won't ease the scrutiny the men in blue have come
under in the wake of the Knoblauch incident.
	   Hernandez, the Cuban rookie who said his biggest game before
Saturday was getting on a boat to flee his homeland, gave up three
hits in seven-plus innings, and Paul O'Neill homered for the
Yankees, who with their 119th win broke the 1906 Chicago Cubs'
record for most in a year.
	   Cleveland, which eliminated New York in the first round last
October, missed a chance to push the Yankees closer to an early
winter vacation. And now the defending AL champion Indians must
deal with David Wells in Game 5 on Sunday afternoon. Win or lose,
they'll have to go back to New York and face David Cone in Game 6
on Tuesday at Yankee Stadium.
	   Wells, who limited them to just five hits in 8 1-3 innings to
win the series opener, will face Chad Ogea.
	   Hernandez's brother, Livan, was the World Series MVP last year
when Florida beat Cleveland in seven games. He's an early candidate
for the same honor in this series after his 115-pitch performance.
Protecting a three-run lead, he got out of a sticky two-on, one-out
situation in the sixth by striking out both Manny Ramirez and Jim
Thome.
	   Reliever Mike Stanton got out the same predicament in the eighth
by getting a double play.
	   Dwight Gooden, released by the Yankees last winter and
resurrected in Cleveland this year, pitched well but was unable to
give the Indians a commanding two-game lead in the season. The
right-hander made his ninth postseason start still seeking his
first October win.
	   Gooden, ejected after 22 pitches in his previous playoff start
this year against Boston, lasted 4 2-3 innings this time. He
allowed three hits, struck out three and walked three. However, he
left trailing by three runs.
	   Leading 1-0 on O'Neill's homer in the first, the Yankees added
two more runs in the fourth on a ground-rule RBI double by Chili
Davis and a sacrifice fly by Tino Martinez.
	   Martinez finally broke an 0-for-19 ALCS slump with a double in
the ninth and also got an RBI _ his first in 15 career league
championship games.
	   Gooden walked O'Neill leading off the fourth, and after O'Neill
stole second, Williams walked on a 3-2 pitch. Davis dropped his
double down the left-field line and the ball skipped into the
stands to score O'Neill.
	   Williams was put back at third on the play, and he scored a
moment later when Martinez lifted a fly ball that Indians center
fielder Kenny Lofton appeared to catch before dropping while
transferring the ball to make a throw.
	   However, McKean, who would later be hit by catcher Sandy
Alomar's throw near second base on a steal attempt, ruled Lofton
had dropped the ball before the out could be recorded and Martinez
was safe at first.
	   Hernandez was living on the edge through the first three
innings. The Indians hit the ball hard, but right at Yankees. He
didn't get a groundball out until his 11th batter, but he settled
in and gave New York the start it desperately needed.
	   Knoblauch, who singled to open Game 3, gave the Indians a scare
when he flied out to the warning track in right on Gooden's first
pitch. With two outs, O'Neill hit one even farther, connecting for
his second postseason homer.

Australian torch relay to start from Uluru
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Olympic gold medalist Nova
Peris-Kneebone will start the Australian leg of the 2000 Olympic
torch relay from Uluru, the Outback's famous geological landmark.
	   Uluru is the name given by indigenous land owners to the
formation called Ayers Rock by white settlers and is in the
Northern Territory.
	   Sydney Organizing Committee president Michael Knight on Sunday
made the announcement of the starting point for the 100-day
Australian relay while flanked by members of the traditional owners
of Kata Tjuta National Park, which encompasses Uluru.
	   ``Uluru is not only known world wide but is also a place of
immense historical and cultural significance,'' Knight said. ``Lots
of areas had legitimate claims for the starting point but what
better symbol of national unity could there be than to go to the
very center of our country.
	   ``It is in the geographical heart of Australia, is of great
spiritual significance to many Australians and is part of the
Outback character of Australians.''
	   Peris-Kneebone became Australia's first Aboriginal to win an
Olympic gold medal when she was a member of the field hockey team
in Atlanta. She has since switched to track and field and won the
200-meter event at the Commonwealth Games last month.
	   Peris-Kneebone, who is from Darwin in the Northern Territory,
had earlier said the decision to have her launch the relay when the
flame arrives in Australia in June 2000 would be received well in
Aboriginal communities.
	   ``Every time I go back home or travel to remote communities
around Australia the Aboriginal people show they love sport,''
Peris-Kneebone said when she was awarded the honor in August. ``To
have an Aboriginal person carrying that flame is going to make a
lot of people very proud.''
	   The torch will leave Uluru on June 8, 2000 and will travel
through all Australian states and territories ahead of the Sept. 15
opening ceremony in Sydney.

Treasurer links reform to 2000 Olympics
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CANBERRA, Australia (AP) _ Parliament should quickly pass new
tax legislation so overseas visitors to the 2000 Olympic Games pay
their share of sales taxes, a government official said Sunday.
	   The conservatives won last week's election after campaigning on
a platform to overhaul Australia's taxation system by installing a
Goods and Services Tax, or GST. The government plans to introduce
the GST on July 1, 2000 _ in time for the Sept. 15 start of the
Olympics.
	   While the conservatives hold a majority in the House of
Representatives, the tax legislation may be held up in the Senate,
where the Australian Democrats and independents will hold the
balance of power.
	   Democrats leader Meg Lees said the party agreed with the general
approach to a GST but did not want the tax to apply to food.
	   Federal treasurer Peter Costello said Sunday that the tax plan
was not open to negotiation and its speedy introduction was
essential.
	   ``When Australians go to Olympics overseas, they pay value added
taxes, they pay GST,'' Costello said on the Nine Network's Sunday
program.
	   ``Why would we not want people coming to Australia to make a
contribution to taxes? So we decided it was important to have the
GST in place before the Olympics.''
	   International experience indicated it would take 12 months from
time of passage of tax legislation to actual implementation,
Costello said.
	   That meant legislation had to pass both houses of parliament by
June 30, 1999.
	   ``We won't be looking at any alternative other than the
implementation of our package,'' Costello said. ``We think that
this has gone to the Australian people and the people have decided
this.''

Strong earthquake damages buildings in northern Indonesia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A strong earthquake rocked an area of
northern Indonesia and destroyed some buildings, but there were no
immediate reports of casualties, an official said Sunday.
	   The quake, with a magnitude of 5.5, struck the towns of Donggala
and Palu at 11:29 p.m. (1629 GMT) Saturday, said Waan Tarmin of
Meteorology and Geophysics agency in Jakarta.
	   Two houses and a stall in a vegetable market collapsed, and the
walls of scores of other homes cracked in Donggala on Sulawesi, an
island northeast of Jakarta, Tarmin said.
	   The town also lost its electricity, and the Antara national news
agency reported that people who rushed out of their homes refused
to go back inside, fearing aftershocks.
	   In the town of Palu, 200 kilometers (120 miles) to the north,
the foundations of many homes and buildings also cracked under the
force of the temblor, including an office of the Antara news agency
and a hotel, Tarmin said.
	   The quake's epicenter was about 18 kilometers (11 miles)
northwest of Donggala.
	   Earthquakes with a magnitude of five can cause considerable
damage, and ones of six can lead to severe damage.

Texas A&AMP;M stops Nebraska's 19-game winning streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   COLLEGE STATION, Texas (AP) _ Nebraska's 19-game winning streak
was snapped by Texas A and M, which beat the second-ranked
Cornhuskers 28-21 for its first victory over a Top 10 team since
1975.
	   Sedrick Curry's interception with 59 seconds left stopped
Nebraska's final drive, ended the nation's longest major-college
winning streak and handed Huskers coach Frank Solich his first loss
since replacing Tom Osborne.
	   ``We're down and hurt right now,'' Solich said. ``We're not
accustomed to taking a loss.''
	   Nebraska, which has won or shared three of the last four
national titles, lost for just the fourth time in 69 games and
suffered its first defeat since a 37-27 loss to Texas in the Big 12
championship game in 1996.
	   No. 18 Texas A and M ended a nine-game losing streak against Top
10 teams by beating Nebraska (5-1, 1-1 Big 12) at its own ground
game.
	   The Huskers were outrushed 259-141 by the Aggies (5-1, 2-0). Two
A and M runners gained over 100 yards _ Dante Hall with 113 and
Ja'Mar Toombs with 110.
	   ``We've been so close so many times to beating Top 10 teams like
Florida State and UCLA,'' offensive lineman Cameron Spikes said.
``This time we didn't shoot ourselves in the foot.''
	   Nebraska, which beat A and M 54-14 last December in the Big 12
title game, fell behind 28-7 in the fourth quarter before rallying.
But the comeback fell short when Curry intercepted a pass by Bobby
Newcombe.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 1 Ohio State 41, Illinois 0;
No. 4 Tennessee 22, No. 7 Georgia 3; No. 5 Kansas State 16, No. 14
Colorado 9; No. 6 Florida 22, No. 11 LSU 10; No. 8 Florida State
26, Miami 14; No. 13 Penn State 27, Minnesota 17; No. 15 Oregon 51,
Washington State 29; No. 16 West Virginia 37, Temple 7; California
32, No. 19 Southern California 31; No. 20 Arkansas 23, Memphis 9;
No. 21 Missouri 35, Iowa State 19; No. 22 Notre Dame 28, Arizona
State 9; Georgia Tech 47, No. 23 North Carolina State 24; and No.
24 Syracuse 63, Cincinnati 21.
	   In late games, it was No. 3 UCLA at No. 10 Arizona, and Purdue
at No. 12 Wisconsin.
 &UR; No. 1 Ohio St. 41, Illinois 0 &QC; 
	   At Champaign, Ill., Joe Germaine threw for 307 yards and three
touchdowns as Ohio State (5-0, 2-0 Big Ten) shut out Illinois.
	   The Buckeyes' defense scored a touchdown, kept constant pressure
on Illinois quarterback Kurt Kittner and limited Illinois (2-4,
1-2) to 57 yards rushing.
 &UR; No. 4 Tennessee 22, No. 7 Georgia 3 &QC; 
	   At Athens, Georgia, Tee Martin threw two 3-yard TD passes in the
third quarter and Tennessee's defense shut down Georgia.
	   Tennessee (5-0, 3-0 SEC) extended its winning streak over
Georgia (4-1, 2-1) to eight games and handed the Bulldogs their
ninth straight loss at Sanford Stadium against Top 25 opponents.
The Volunteers played without injured running back Jamal Lewis, who
gained 232 yards against Georgia last year.
 &UR; No. 5 Kansas St. 16, No. 14 Colorado 9 &QC; 
	   At Boulder, Colorado, Eric Hickson ran for 137 yards, Martin
Gramatica kicked three field goals and Kansas State withstood a
late Colorado rally to win its 13th straight game.
	   The Wildcats (5-0, 2-0 in Big 12) led 16-0 early in the fourth
quarter before Colorado (5-1, 2-1) rallied. Kansas State matched
the longest winning streak in school history.
 &UR; No. 6 Florida 22, No. 11 LSU 10 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, receiver Travis McGriff took a lateral
from Doug Johnson and threw a 49-yard TD pass to Travis Taylor for
the clinching score.
	   The victory avenged LSU's 28-21 upset victory last year and kept
Florida (5-1, 3-1 SEC) one game behind Tennessee in the SEC East.
Mistake-prone LSU (3-2, 1-2) lost its second straight.
 &UR; No. 8 Florida St. 26, Miami 14 &QC; 
	   At Miami, Peter Warrick caught a 62-yard scoring pass and set up
another touchdown with a 50-yard catch as Florida State beat Miami
for the fourth consecutive year.
	   Warrick finished with 190 yards on seven catches for the
Seminoles (5-1). Chris Weinke became only the second Florida State
quarterback in 14 years to beat Miami (3-2) in the Orange Bowl,
throwing for 316 yards and two TDs.
 &UR; No. 13 Penn St. 27, Minnesota 17 &QC; 
	   At Minneapolis, Penn State broke open a close game with Corey
Jones' 65-yard TD catch in the third quarter.
	   Penn State (4-1, 1-1 Big Ten), which rallied to beat Minnesota
by a point last year, got a career-best four field goals from
Travis Forney and seven sacks from its defense against Minnesota
(3-2, 0-2).
 &UR; No. 15 Oregon 51, Washington St. 29 &QC; 
	   At Pullman, Washington, Reuben Droughns ran for 217 yards and
scored four touchdowns as Oregon routed Washington State.
	   Akili Smith, the nation's leading passer, was 15-of-22 for 280
yards and three touchdowns for Oregon (5-0, 2-0 Pac-10). Washington
State (3-3, 0-3) had an eight-game home winning streak broken.
 &UR; No. 16 West Virginia 37, Temple 7 &QC; 
	   At Philadelphia, backup Alvin Swoope rushed for a career-high
141 yards and two touchdowns _ all in the first half _ as West
Virginia won its Big East opener without star Amos Zereoue.
	   Zereoue, the league's second-leading rusher, didn't play because
of a bruised thigh. But the Mountaineers (4-1, 1-0) didn't miss him
against winless Temple (0-6, 0-2).
 &UR; California 32, No. 19 Southern California 31 &QC; 
	   At Los Angeles, Marcus Fields scored on a 3-yard run with 3:30
left as California overcame a 21-point, second-half deficit.
	   Southern California (4-2, 2-1 Pac-10) led 31-10 in the third
quarter, but Cal (4-1, 2-0) scored 16 points in a five-minute span
over the end of the third and start of the fourth to rally for only
its second win in the Coliseum since 1970.
 &UR; No. 20 Arkansas 23, Memphis 9 &QC; 
	   At Memphis, Clint Stoerner made up for a poor first half with a
52-yard TD pass to Michael Williams early in the third quarter as
Arkansas (5-0) beat Memphis (0-5).
	   The Razorbacks led 13-3 at the half even though Stoerner
completed only 11 of 29 passes. His third straight completion of
the second half was good for Williams' first career touchdown.
 &UR; No. 21 Missouri 35, Iowa St. 19 &QC; 
	   At Ames, Iowa, Devin West ran for 252 yards and Corby Jones
accounted for three scores despite a sore toe.
	   Missouri (4-1, 2-0 Big 12) capitalized on a muffed punt and an
interception for touchdowns and hurt Iowa State (2-4, 0-3) on
Jones' option pitchouts to West, whose rushing total was the
second-best in Missouri history.
 &UR; No. 22 Notre Dame 28, Arizona St. 9 &QC; 
	   At Tempe, Arizona, Autry Denson scored twice on 1-yard runs and
A'Jani Sanders returned one of three Notre Dame interceptions 25
yards for another score.
	   Jarious Jackson threw a 7-yard TD pass to Malcolm Johnson for
the Irish (4-1). Arizona State (2-4) was limited to a 22-yard field
goal by Stephen Baker and J.R. Redmond's 1-yard TD run.
 &UR; Georgia Tech 47, No. 23 N.C. State 24 &QC; 
	   At Raleigh, North Carolina, Jason Bostic scored on a blocked
punt and fumble return and Joe Hamilton added three touchdowns as
Georgia Tech used a 28-point second quarter to beat North Carolina
State.
	   The Yellow Jackets (4-1, 3-0 ACC) moved into a tie for the
league lead with No. 9 Virginia. N.C. State (3-2, 1-1), which has
beaten Florida State and Syracuse this season, had trouble with its
special teams.
 &UR; No. 24 Syracuse 63, Cincinnati 21 &QC; 
	   At Syracuse, New York, Donovan McNabb threw four TD passes in
the first half, including two to Kevin Johnson, as the Orangemen
beat winless Cincinnati.
	   Syracuse (3-2), coming off a 38-17 loss at North Carolina State,
scored on its first five possessions to build a 35-7 halftime lead
against the Bearcats (0-6).

Chinese Democracy Wall activists mark movement's 20th anniversary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Two Chinese democracy activists marked the 20th
anniversary of the Democracy Wall movement on Sunday by urging
exiled colleagues to press for the release of jailed activists, a
rights group reported.
	   Xu Wenli and Qin Yongmin, who were active in the 1978-79 period
of free expression in Beijing, made the plea in taped speeches to
be played at a conference of exiled dissidents on Sunday in New
York, the Hong Kong-based Information Center of Human Rights and
Democratic Movement in China said.
	   The tapes were made from speeches Xu and Qin made over the
phone.
	   The center said Sunday marked the anniversary of the first
poster on a wall in central Beijing that became a focal point for a
period of unusually free political debate in China. Activists
called for freedom, democracy and human rights.
	   Wei Jingsheng and other key writers in the movement were
arrested and the movement was crushed in 1979. Wei spent all but
six months of the next 18 years in prison until he was released in
November and sent into exile.
	   The Hong Kong center said 12 dissidents who were involved in the
Democracy Wall movement were arrested between 1989 and this year
and are now in prison, labor camps or detention centers.
