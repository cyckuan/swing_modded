<P>
   &UR; !text! &LR; Over the last two-plus years, no one has wielded more
mastery of the Senior PGA Tour than Hale Irwin, and in the U.S.
Senior Open, the tour's most important major tournament, he
convened a clinic as to why.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin mounted a relentless charge and delivered a spectacular
finish Sunday at Riviera Country Club, obliterating the commanding
lead of Raymond Floyd, holding off the surprising surge of Vicente
Fernandez, and winning the championship the hard way _ by rolling
in a 12-foot, downhill birdie putt on the final hole, Riviera's
dastardly 18th.
</P>
<P>
   And then his celebration knew no bounds. Irwin pumped his right
fist into the air. Then both fists. Once he got his hands on the
great silver goblet that is this tournament's trophy, he wouldn't
let go, even sitting with it wedged between his knees when he later
met the press.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder this guy has been so testy this entire weekend:
Obviously, this championship meant much more to him than anyone
realized.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the strength of a 1-over-par total of 285, as he shot
a 2-under round of 69 on the final day. That was one stroke better
than Fernandez and two ahead of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   It also completed an impressive weekend rally. Irwin was well
off the pace after opening with a 77 on Thursday. The previous
worst score a U.S. Senior Open champion had to overcome in the
first round was a 74.
</P>
<P>
   The title is not an end-all for his career, Irwin said, ``but it
kind of puts a stamp on where I've been trying to get to with at
least those Open championships.... I guess it meant more to me
because I wanted to be one of those few who won both.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Open titles on both sides of age 50. Irwin took
the U.S. Open championship in 1974, '79 and '90, but the Senior
Open had eluded him in 3{ seasons on this tour, even though few
other titles had.
</P>
<P>
   Dominant? The adjective is almost inadequate to describe what
he's accomplished. Since the start of '96, Irwin has played in 60
events, and this marked his 53rd top-10 finish and 16th victory.
He's played 14 events this year and has finished in the top five in
each and every one of them (this was his fifth win).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it boils down to Hale's the best senior player out
there. He showed it to the world today,'' said Floyd, Irwin's
playing partner on the final day. ``He did what he needed to do. He
played beautifully all day....
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a tour dominated the way he has done the last
two years. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like awe. More likely, it was shell shock.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd began the day with a three-stroke lead, having put
together two outstanding rounds of 70, followed by a respectable 73
on Saturday. But Floyd, whose approach irons landed well short of
the green all day long, bogeyed two of the first five holes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin caught him within seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later came a surprise contender, Fernandez, an
Argentine in his third year among the seniors (he played only on a
short time on the PGA Tour). Fernandez, with a blistering final
round of 3-under 68, created a three-way tie with a birdie on No.16
and then took the lead when he sank a 15-foot par putt on No.17 as
both Floyd and Irwin were bogeying 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin didn't get all those victories in all those
tournaments by being faint of heart. As he walked up the fairway at
15, he said, he told his caddie he would need a couple of birdies
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered, delivered. Irwin played left-right break to roll in a
25-foot birdie putt on 16, then averted what would have been an
18-hole playoff today by sinking that dead-straight 12-footer on
18.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin nearly had three straight birdies to close out that
charge. On a 25-foot attempt from the edge of the 17th green, the
ball just caught the right lip, took a circle tour of the cup and
kicked out. Irwin, in disbelief, flopped dramatically onto his back
on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt,'' he said of Open championships, ``that they
test your management and patience _ the mental part of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, he certainly recovered quickly to mount his
assault on 18. It mirrored, in miniature, his recovery from that
dreadful start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no talking about it,'' Irwin, who ducked the press
that day, said of his dismal first round, ``because I wanted it
flushed from my mind. I wasn't that far out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he's been playing this tour, it was a cinch he was fully
capable of playing his way back into the tournament. And winning
it.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin becomes the seventh player to couple a U.S. Open
championship with a U.S. Senior Open title (the latter event began
in '80). It's select company. The others: Arnold Palmer, Jack
Nicklaus, Gary Player, Billy Casper, Lee Trevino, Orville Moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``My timing was not quite on this week,'' said Irwin. ``Coupled
with my desire to win this event, that puts you on that edge of
maybe you are trying too hard, maybe you are pushing it just a
little bit. That's why I kept telling myself, `Back away from it.
Back away from it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had collected himself and locked his relentlessly
precise game into place, the rest of the senior field probably had
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   As usual. &UR; !dlim! &LR; !end! &QL;

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from General Motors and the United
Automobile Workers union worked around the clock Sunday to settle
strikes at two GM auto parts factories here, struggling over a few
final details of GM's future investments in the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival of 18 flat-bed
trucks at one of the factories. As more than 100 striking workers
cheered and waved green strike placards, the trucks brought back
parts-making equipment that GM had removed from an auto body parts
factory here over Memorial Day weekend, triggering the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the talks said late on Sunday night
that a deal was fairly likely on Monday. Charlotte Grimes, a GM
spokeswoman, said just before midnight that marathon talks were
under way at both the struck factories here and at three other
factories where the UAW has threatened strikes, but that no
settlement had yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The other three factories are an assembly plant here and parts
factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. Workers have also
threatened strikes in recent days at a sports utility vehicle
factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., but GM has viewed walkouts at those
factories as less likely and has not tried to settle them on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the issues in the strike have already been settled, UAW
officials said, including health and safety disputes and the
minimum number of auto parts that some workers have to produce each
day. The UAW wants GM to promise that it will install the latest
equipment here, and that it will not sell or close either factory.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of 29 GM assembly plants in North America have
closed for lack of parts from the struck factories here, and more
than 100 GM parts factories have also shut down partly or entirely
because the assembly plants are closed. GM has temporarily laid off
192,000 workers, braking growth in the entire American economy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM abruptly agreed Saturday evening to return dies used in
making parts, and the UAW agreed to have up to 160 workers cross
picket lines to clean the dies, make any needed repairs and install
them in huge mechanical presses.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, chairman at the UAW unit at one of the struck
factories here, said Sunday that the workers would actually run the
presses and produce a few parts to make sure that the dies were
functioning properly, but would return then to the picket lines if
a settlement still had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been under pressure to settle the strikes. GM
dealerships are running short of popular pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, raising the risk that customers might start
shopping elsewhere and never return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's warned last week that it might start a
formal review of GM's credit rating, and any reduction in that
credit rating would raise the company's borrowing costs and make it
more expensive for GM to offer auto loans. The duration of the
strikes here has also put in danger GM's schedule for the
introduction of 1999 models, including a new line of highly
profitable, full-sized pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been alarmed by a federal lawsuit that GM filed and
by arbitration hearings that ended here on Saturday evening. In the
lawsuit and in arbitration, GM has contended that the strikes here
violate its national agreement with the UAW, and has sought rulings
that would limit the UAW's ability to stage crippling,
factory-level strikes in the future. GM would likely withdraw its
lawsuit and arbitration grievance if a settlement is reached here.
</P>
<P>
   The national agreement allows strikes over assembly line speed
increases, subcontracting and health and safety grievances. The UAW
has raised all of these issues in the strike but its main demand
has been that GM invest in more modern equipment for the factories
here, even though the factories have high costs and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A UAW official who insisted on anonymity acknowledged in an
interview Sunday that some of these same investment issues were now
among the final sticking points, but refused to provide details,
saying, ``I can't say that because we can't strike over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been calling for GM to use the strikes
as an excuse to close inefficient factories and stop production of
money-losing car models like the Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But while GM has threatened publicly to do both, Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said at a news
conference on Saturday evening that GM had not mentioned to him any
plans to close factories. The UAW has expressed no objection to the
elimination of some models provided that the factories are
converted to other production instead of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the flat-bed trucks arriving here carried one to three
stamping dies. The dies resemble gigantic metal molds, a dozen feet
long and weighing almost 10 tons. The dies are used to stamp auto
body parts from galvanized steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first die to return was for pickup truck hoods and had the
nickname ``Bob'' scrawled on the side with yellow chalk. After the
trucks had passed through the factory gates, the workers loudly
sang ``Solidarity Forever,'' the UAW's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   GM removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend for fear of a
strike by workers here angry about the company's decision last
spring to cancel plans to install the latest equipment here. But
the removal of the dies ended up triggering a walkout by the 3,400
workers here on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,800 workers at a speedometer and spark plug factory
several miles away then went on strike on June 11, partly to show
support for the auto body parts workers and partly because of
worries that GM would continue to winnow their work force through
attrition while buying more parts from non-union outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM moved the dies over Memorial Day weekend to a stamping
factory in Mansfield, Ohio, but never used them there. Canadian
auto workers, who will be building the first of the new pickups,
declared that they would refuse to accept any parts from the moved
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have also said that the dies were damaged
accidentally during the trip to Mansfield, but GM officials have
refused to confirm or deny this.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size and weight, stamping dies are remarkably
fragile, and will produce defective parts unless mounted with great
precision in huge mechanical presses. Striking workers here were
dismayed to see that some of the dies arriving here were stacked on
each other, which can cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, a 49-year-old pipe fitter who has been working
with dies here for 31 years, said that it could take anywhere from
two days to two weeks to put the dies back in service, depending on
how much damage they have suffered. &QL;

CHANGES BRING FUSION TOGETHER

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ His first practice as Miami Fusion head
coach was Friday, the day that Ivo Wortmann replaced Carlos Cordoba
for the expansion team, in last place in Major League Soccer's
Eastern Conference with an 8-11 record and just 14 points.
</P>
<P>
   During Friday and Saturday's practices, Wortmann, who is the
director of coaching at the Adidas Soccer Academy at the
Bollettieri Sports Camp in Bradenton, Fla., stressed where to start
marking the opponent, the balance between playing zone and
man-to-man, and how vital it is to play as a team.
</P>
<P>
   There were lineup changes, too. Some players who hadn't been
getting much time were made starters. Like Matt Kmosko, Henry
Gutierrez, and Pablo Mastroeni, all midfielders. There also was a
change of defensive alignment, the Fusion moving from a 3-6-1 setup
to a 4-4-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was the switch of goalkeepers. Fusion keeper Jeff
Cassar has a strained right quadriceps, and his backup, Scott
Budnick, has fractured ribs. So David Winner, who was with the
Revolution for three days in early July, got the start over
20-year-old Matt Napoleon. Finally, Carlos Valderrama, the Fusion's
best setup man (four assists in nine games), didn't make the trip.
He preferred to sit under a tree in the shade rather than
participate in Wortmann's first practice, and Saturday he didn't
even show up. He was unhappy that Fusion officials hadn't spoken to
him before letting Cordoba go.
</P>
<P>
   With all that, the Fusion still beat the Revolution, 2-1, the
team's first road win in regulation. Afterward, the Miami players
gave Wortmann a standing ovation upon his entrance to the locker
room, and he was presented with the game ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody was just happy to win, that's why we gave
him a standing ovation,'' said Fusion forward Dan Stebbins. ``He
brings enthusiasm, intelligence. He expects a lot of us. Any time
you change a situation things look great in the beginning, but the
key to this team is the long term and (Sunday) was the first
step.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He organized the players to do a completely different role,''
Fusion midfielder Diego Serna said, ``as well as to give a totally
different style of play, that and working together.''
</P>
<P>
   Wortmann had seen many MLS games, the Fusion among them. ``I'm a
professional coach and I follow international soccer,'' said
Wortmann, 48, a former member of the Brazilian national team and
the head coach of the Saudi Arabian national team. He has coached
for 18 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   His first goal is to get the Fusion into the playoffs. The
Fusion are now in fifth place, having moved past the Revolution
with the 3 points. Miami is 1 point behind fourth-place Tampa Bay,
which has 18 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players made me happy because they followed the game plan
and they played with high energy,'' Wortmann said. ``I believe we
have good players in Miami. By working hard, and with this effort,
we can get into the playoffs. My job is to help the players make a
practical decision on the field. If the players don't want to help
me, nothing happens.''
</P>
<P>
   What's awaiting Wortmann now is a sitdown session with
Valderrama.

Astros' Wagner tries to pitch in, but he's eager to do more
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PEARLAND _ Sunday was a good news/bad news sort of day at the
home of Billy and Sarah Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   First, the bad news:
</P>
<P>
   The Astros were handed a tough loss by the San Diego Padres, and
there wasn't a darn thing Billy could do about it except give
encouragement and offer words of advice to his large-screen
Mitsubishi television set.
</P>
<P>
   The winning run scored while his good friend Mike Magnante was
on the mound in the 10th inning. Wagner, who is on the 15-day
disabled list, made every pitch with Magnante even though the two
relievers were more than a 1,000 miles away.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was the good news:
</P>
<P>
   If the Padres had to win, Wagner was glad friend and neighbor
Donne Wall was the pitcher of record. This only qualified as
partially good news because Wall has bragging rights; at least for
the time being.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner took comfort in the fact the Astros still managed to take
the season series from San Diego, which could be a confidence
booster should the teams meet in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The best news was that Sunday was the last day Wagner would have
to ride out Astros games from his recliner. Although he's not
eligible to come off the DL until Aug. 1, Wagner will be in uniform
tonight at the Astrodome when the Florida Marlins drop in for a
four-game series. After that, he hopes to pitch in a couple of
minor-league games before joining the Astros on their upcoming road
trip in Pittsburgh or Miami.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick of seeing the games from a distance and not being
able to participate, and I'm sick of not being dressed and ready to
play,'' said Wagner, who hasn't been on the mound since being
struck in the head by a line drive July 15 at Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just glad this is the last day I've got to sit and watch
our team play on TV. This is the worst feeling in the world because
I know I shouldn't be here just sitting at home on a vacation while
my teammates are out there doing their jobs when I'm not doing
anything. There's just nothing I can do, and I'm tired of it. I've
enjoyed my time with my wife, but I'm not supposed to be here. I
like being out there fighting the battles with my teammates.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's battle was all too familiar to Wagner, who spent
another day trying to sit still while his teammate went to war
without him. He calls pitches and tries _ successfully on most
counts _ to predict how each scenario will develop, seemingly to
feel like he's a part of the action.
</P>
<P>
   Watching a game with Wagner is like sitting in a broadcast booth
with a homer for an announcer. The commentary is endless, and the
Astros can do no wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd never make it as a broadcaster,'' he said. ``I'd never be
able to say anything negative about our guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But analyzing has been the extent of Wagner's involvement since
his injury, and Sarah has been his primary audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``We watched the first couple of games together, but then I
think I started to get on her nerves,'' he said. ``I kind of get
into the games, so sometimes I'd end up watching upstairs and she'd
watch downstairs.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, that was the case Sunday. Sarah, who is
expected to give birth to the couple's first child any day, was
napping when the game began, and she watched the ending downstairs
with Magnante's wife, Jill, and their infant son, Mark, who helped
take Wagner's mind off the game for a couple of innings.
</P>
<P>
   As Wagner rolled around on the floor with Mark, it was obvious
he can't wait to experience fatherhood. Some day, Wagner will sit
in his study with his own child and reminisce about the awards and
memorabilia that adorn the walls and shelves. One of the newest
additions is a autographed ball from Wagner's idol, Nolan Ryan, who
sent it as somewhat of a get-well card after Wagner was struck in
the head.
</P>
<P>
   It's getting late in the game, and the Astros are trailing by a
run. Wagner, now snacking on pizza, yells downstairs to warn Jill
that her husband is warming up in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``She gets so nervous when Mags pitches,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Wagner's getting pretty nervous, too. The Astros need a
ninth-inning rally against Trevor Hoffman, who is going for a
major-league record 42nd consecutive save. Wagner predicts this is
the day Hoffman will blow it, and he's right. As Moises Alou steps
into the batter's box, Wagner puts on his announcer's cap again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll probably throw changeups and sliders,'' Wagner said of
Hoffman. ``Mo is a great fastball hitter. If he throws a fastball,
we might tie this game up.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman's first pitch was a fastball right down the middle of
the plate, and Alou crushed it into the left-field seats. As a
fellow closer, Wagner could feel Hoffman's pain, but he didn't
exactly feel sorry for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see people fail, but it's kind of refreshing to know
that you're not the only one it happens to,'' Wagner said. ``There
have been nights when I've given up a home run or blown a save and
come home and search ESPN to see if anyone else did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, it was a new game. Wagner inched toward the edge of
his seat, and it became quite obvious he is a better performer than
he is a spectator. The longer the game dragged on, the more fidgety
he became. Wagner was a conversational host over the first eight
innings, but the closer in him came out over the final two frames.
</P>
<P>
   It was time to get focused.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so frustrating not to at least be there and give your
team some support,'' he said. ``This is hard. It's a no-win
situation with Mags and Donne out there. I absolutely hate that
situation. Whoever wins, you're happy for them, but whoever loses,
you're going to be sad for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite his longtime friendship with Wall, Wagner's allegiances
were clearly with Magnante and the Astros. In fact, he even hoped
out loud that Wall would lose on an error or some misfortune that
didn't result from Wall pitching badly.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't work out that way. Astros manager Larry Dierker
instructed Magnante to intentionally walk Carlos Hernandez, and
Andy Sheets beat Magnante with a single to left, scoring Ruben
Rivera, who had reached on a flukish double that dropped between
second baseman Craig Biggio and right fielder Richard Hidalgo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Man, I hate not being out there,'' he said. ``In all
likelihood, I should have been pitching that last inning. That's my
job.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Wagner loves his job, the injury has helped him view
his profession in a different light. Although he repeatedly has
said he has no fear of returning to the mound, he realizes how
lucky he is to be able to entertain the thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could have killed me,'' Wagner said of the line drive off
Kelly Stinnett's bat. ``It could have taken me away from my wife
and my kid. But you have to go out there and pitch with the faith
that God will protect you. When I think about the things I'm
missing with the team and then think about things I could have
missed with my wife and kid, it puts it all into perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has changed the way I look at baseball. It's not do or
die, you just do the best you can and hope it's good enough.
Baseball is just a game. You should appreciate it, enjoy it and be
thankful that you have a chance to play it, but it's still just a
game.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's a game Wagner is tired of watching on TV.

   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from General Motors and the United
Automobile Workers union worked around the clock Sunday to settle
strikes at two GM auto parts factories here, struggling over a few
final details of GM's future investments in the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival of 18 flat-bed
trucks at one of the factories. As more than 100 striking workers
cheered and waved green strike placards, the trucks brought back
parts-making equipment that GM had removed from an auto body parts
factory here over Memorial Day weekend, triggering the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the talks said late on Sunday night
that a deal was fairly likely on Monday. Charlotte Grimes, a GM
spokeswoman, said just before midnight that marathon talks were
under way at both the struck factories here and at three other
factories where the UAW has threatened strikes, but that no
settlement had yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
   The other three factories are an assembly plant here and parts
factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio. Workers have also
threatened strikes in recent days at a sports utility vehicle
factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., but GM has viewed walkouts at those
factories as less likely and has not tried to settle them on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the issues in the strike have already been settled, UAW
officials said, including health and safety disputes and the
minimum number of auto parts that some workers have to produce each
day. The UAW wants GM to promise that it will install the latest
equipment here, and that it will not sell or close either factory.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of 29 GM assembly plants in North America have
closed for lack of parts from the struck factories here, and more
than 100 GM parts factories have also shut down partly or entirely
because the assembly plants are closed. GM has temporarily laid off
192,000 workers, braking growth in the entire American economy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM abruptly agreed Saturday evening to return dies used in
making parts, and the UAW agreed to have up to 160 workers cross
picket lines to clean the dies, make any needed repairs and install
them in huge mechanical presses.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, chairman at the UAW unit at one of the struck
factories here, said Sunday that the workers would actually run the
presses and produce a few parts to make sure that the dies were
functioning properly, but would return then to the picket lines if
a settlement still had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been under pressure to settle the strikes. GM
dealerships are running short of popular pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, raising the risk that customers might start
shopping elsewhere and never return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's warned last week that it might start a
formal review of GM's credit rating, and any reduction in that
credit rating would raise the company's borrowing costs and make it
more expensive for GM to offer auto loans. The duration of the
strikes here has also put in danger GM's schedule for the
introduction of 1999 models, including a new line of highly
profitable, full-sized pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been alarmed by a federal lawsuit that GM filed and
by arbitration hearings that ended here on Saturday evening. In the
lawsuit and in arbitration, GM has contended that the strikes here
violate its national agreement with the UAW, and has sought rulings
that would limit the UAW's ability to stage crippling,
factory-level strikes in the future. GM would likely withdraw its
lawsuit and arbitration grievance if a settlement is reached here.
</P>
<P>
   The national agreement allows strikes over assembly line speed
increases, subcontracting and health and safety grievances. The UAW
has raised all of these issues in the strike but its main demand
has been that GM invest in more modern equipment for the factories
here, even though the factories have high costs and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A UAW official who insisted on anonymity acknowledged in an
interview Sunday that some of these same investment issues were now
among the final sticking points, but refused to provide details,
saying, ``I can't say that because we can't strike over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been calling for GM to use the strikes
as an excuse to close inefficient factories and stop production of
money-losing car models like the Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But while GM has threatened publicly to do both, Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said at a news
conference on Saturday evening that GM had not mentioned to him any
plans to close factories. The UAW has expressed no objection to the
elimination of some models provided that the factories are
converted to other production instead of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the flat-bed trucks arriving here carried one to three
stamping dies. The dies resemble gigantic metal molds, a dozen feet
long and weighing almost 10 tons. The dies are used to stamp auto
body parts from galvanized steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first die to return was for pickup truck hoods and had the
nickname ``Bob'' scrawled on the side with yellow chalk. After the
trucks had passed through the factory gates, the workers loudly
sang ``Solidarity Forever,'' the UAW's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   GM removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend for fear of a
strike by workers here angry about the company's decision last
spring to cancel plans to install the latest equipment here. But
the removal of the dies ended up triggering a walkout by the 3,400
workers here on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,800 workers at a speedometer and spark plug factory
several miles away then went on strike on June 11, partly to show
support for the auto body parts workers and partly because of
worries that GM would continue to winnow their work force through
attrition while buying more parts from non-union outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM moved the dies over Memorial Day weekend to a stamping
factory in Mansfield, Ohio, but never used them there. Canadian
auto workers, who will be building the first of the new pickups,
declared that they would refuse to accept any parts from the moved
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have also said that the dies were damaged
accidentally during the trip to Mansfield, but GM officials have
refused to confirm or deny this.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size and weight, stamping dies are remarkably
fragile, and will produce defective parts unless mounted with great
precision in huge mechanical presses. Striking workers here were
dismayed to see that some of the dies arriving here were stacked on
each other, which can cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, a 49-year-old pipe fitter who has been working
with dies here for 31 years, said that it could take anywhere from
two days to two weeks to put the dies back in service, depending on
how much damage they have suffered. &QL;

GLORIOUS DAY FOR SUTTON 
</HEADLINE>
 OF FAME-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY WHITESIDE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ Very early in life, Don Sutton had to learn
about patience, and rejection. His ability to deal with both kept
the pitcher going in the major leagues for 23 years. Now he has
entered baseball's Hall of Fame, and the Hall is richer for it.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton's moment of glory came Sunday as he became the 233d
person to be given baseball's highest honor. His rise from being
the son of a tenant farmer to the 57th pitcher inducted into the
Hall touched a lot of people. Sutton won 324 games, 12th highest on
the all-time list. But with only one 20-victory season on his
ledger, there always were doubters as to whether he belonged.
</P>
<P>
   His induction was not only an appreciation of excellence, but
also a tribute to his longevity, something you don't see much of in
baseball these days. To reach the 300-victory plateau, Sutton had
to pitch for five teams, including two stints with the Dodgers, for
whom he pitched from 1966-80 and again in 1988. Along the way he
made it to four World Series and four All-Star Games. He went 19-9
twice and averaged 14 wins a season.
</P>
<P>
   His biggest break came in 1966, when as a rookie in spring
training he was told he was being groomed as one of the starters to
replace Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale, who were contract holdouts.
Both eventually came back and reclaimed their spots in the
rotation. But Sutton became a fixture for 14 years. He also pitched
for the Astros, Brewers, Athletics, and Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his obvious talent, Sutton had trouble rising from the
shadows. Fortunately, he learned how to deal with rejection and
failure early in his life. It helped him to survive even after he
retired in '88. Sutton made the Hall of Fame on his fifth attempt.
It is doubtful any of the modern pitchers will follow his path to
success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's important to players anymore to play as
long as some of us did,'' said Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be willing to sacrifice and chase long-term
goals,'' said Sutton. ``I think you have to be deeply motivated.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton said his first lesson about the struggle to Cooperstown
happened in 1964, the year before he turned pro. Two major league
teams recruited him him out of Tate High School outside Pensacola,
Fla. Both gave him tryouts and decided against offering him a
contract, although for different reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The first pink slip came from the Single A Fresno Giants, who
released the skinny 6-foot-1-inch righthander. Next came a tryout
with the Kansas City Athletics, then managed by Haywood Sullivan
(later to become Red Sox general manager). Chief scout Whitey
Herzog liked what he saw and offered Sutton a contract worth
$17,500. He sealed the deal with a handshake and called owner
Charles O. Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ``If not for that phone call,'' said Sutton, ``I would have been
with the Kansas City A's and maybe none of this would have
happened. Herzog offered me the $17,500, a white Buick Riviera
convertible with red trim, and my college education. Mr. Finley
gets onto the phone, and without as much as a hello says, `What's
your nickname?' I told him I didn't have one.
</P>
<P>
   ``His reply was that he had either signed or was about to sign
some guys named Blue Moon, Jumbo Jim, or Catfish, and if I didn't
have a nickname, I couldn't be signed. And then he hung up on me.
He left my face blank and Whitey wondering what he said. I handed
him the phone and (the deal) was dead.''
</P>
<P>
   But all's well that ends well. Sutton signed with the Dodgers
and made the 1966 club, thanks to the walkout by Drysdale and
Koufax. Walter Alston gambled on the 19-year-old with just one
year's experience. The rest is history.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton shared his day with four selections by the veterans
committee _ Larry Doby, George Davis, Joe Rogan, and executive Lee
MacPhail. Media choices were Sam Lacy of the Baltimore
Afro-American and Dodgers announcer Jaime Jarrin, a Latin voice in
baseball for 40 years.

DON'T SHED ANY TEARS FOR MINGOLLA 
</HEADLINE>
 CLASSIC-MINGOLLA-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL HARBER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SUTTON, Mass. _ It was a bittersweet weekend for Pleasant
Valley's Ted Mingolla. The tournament chairman watched his 34-year
relationship with the PGA Tour come to a conclusion.
</P>
<P>
   Mingolla saw veterans like Jody Sindelar leave the club in
tears, realizing that they would never play PV again. Mingolla gave
many aspiring Tour players exemptions over the years. Several, like
Sindelar, Paul Azinger, Blaine McCallister, and Billy Andrade,
returned this weekend to say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   Of course Mingolla, who never has been one to hide his emotions,
is sad to see the PGA Tour leave, ``but I'm not going to get
weepy-eyed about it.''
</P>
<P>
   With good reason. There will be professional golf here next
summer when the LPGA returns to Pleasant Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The dates and title sponsor will be announced before the end of
the summer. Boston-based Entertainment Sports Equities holds the
rights to the LPGA tournament in the Boston area and last week,
ending months of speculation, it was announced Mingolla and his PV
staff would be hosting the tourney.
</P>
<P>
   Mingolla had an inkling that the LPGA would be coming to
Pleasant Valley next year. ``Knowing that there will be a
tournament here makes this final PGA event bearable,'' he said. ``I
don't want to think what it would be like if we didn't have the
LPGA coming here.'' If Pleasant Valley wasn't hosting an LPGA event
next year, ``I think I would have spent this weekend in my office
with Mully (his pet dog) watching the tournament on television.''
</P>
<P>
   There is women's golf history at Pleasant Valley. The LPGA
Championship was held here in the early 1960s, when Mingolla's late
father, Cuzzy, ran the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mingolla attended the LPGA Friendly's Classic at Agawam CC
earlier this summer. ``It was interesting,'' he said. ``I tried to
low-profile it, but a sportswriter from Springfield saw me there.''
</P>
<P>
   LPGA officials already have visited Pleasant Valley. ``(LPGA
vice president) Jim Webb made a preliminary inspection of the golf
course and they liked what they saw,'' said Mingolla. ``We'll
probably make a few changes, build a few new tees for the women.''
</P>
<P>
   The women's tees at PV measure 5,800 yards and the men play from
6,600 yards. ``The LPGA likes their courses around 6,300 yards, so
there will be some changes,'' Mingolla said. ``I just hope the LPGA
comes in soon and makes some recommendations so that we can get
started.''
</P>
<P>
   Mingolla said he is looking forward to working with the women
professionals. ``I understand that they do everything they can to
support a tournament,'' he said. ``They are more friendly with the
fans and the sponsors. I'm looking forward to the women golfers and
their enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Women's golf is going through the ceiling,'' said ESE
president David Rogers, who was among the crowd of 60,000 Sunday
and hopes to match those figures next year. ``It's just getting
bigger and bigger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Se Ri Pak is their Tiger Woods. Laura Davies is their John
Daly. Annika Sorenstam and the rest of the Swedish contingent are
something else,'' said Mingolla. ``It's going to be very
exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers said 12 courses were evaluated last winter, but when he
heard Pleasant Valley was losing the PGA, ``It just made sense to
go there. They have a great staff and it is a great facility. I was
talking to some of the volunteers and they said they've been
working this tournament for 28 years and they can't wait for next
year when the women come here. They know how to run a tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good move for us,'' said Mingolla. ``I think we'll
become one of the top LPGA events in a matter of a few years. No
matter how much we raised the purse for the men, we'd always be a
second-tier event.''
</P>
<P>
   The purse for the LPGA event has not been announced, but it is
expected to be in the $800,000 range, which means all the top money
winners would be expected to attend.
</P>
<P>
   So next year Mingolla will not go to PGA Tour events and beg
golfers to show up for his tournament. He doesn't have to shake
down any sponsors, either. All he has to do is run a tournament. So
you can understand why he wasn't weepy Sunday.

MCGINEST HOPING FOR RUSH ORDER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ Willie McGinest doesn't live in a cave. He
knows that when he signed a five-year, $25 million deal with an $8
million signing bonus in the offseason, some questioned the wisdom
of Patriots owner Bob Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five million for 4 1/2 sacks, with 2 1/2 coming in the
postseason?
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't bother me at all,'' said McGinest of the criticism.
``It comes with the territory. I was injured. There was nothing I
could do about it. If I was healthy and played the full season, I
would have had the same kind of year I had the years before that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday in an intrasquad scrimmage before an overflow crowd of
more than 7,000, the defensive end put on a show, sacking Scott
Zolak and Jim Murphy twice each as McGinest's Blue team
(essentially the first team) beat the White squad, 21-3. McGinest
had no problem busting through the second-team offensive line, and
often raced past second-round pick Rod Rutledge, a tight end from
Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   McGinest has started strong and so far has avoided injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, my role is to stay healthy,'' he said. ``I started
out last year's camp with two or three injuries _ my groin and then
my hamstring and then a couple of games later my knee. It took me a
while to get back into it and get everything better, but toward the
end it started to come together for me. I've been trying to do some
things to help avoid those injuries this year like stretching a
lot, working out, and trying to eat right.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest, the former No. 1 pick from Southern California,
probably would have been pursued by several teams in the free agent
market. Surely, the Patriots weren't overly eager to part with $25
million. But if they lost McGinest, they would have had to spend
that much or more for a suitable replacement. So the team stepped
to the plate, and now is hoping the injury bug doesn't strike
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard watching from the sidelines,'' McGinest said. ``I
get into the games. I care. I want us to win and I was happy that
we were able to win some games I didn't play in.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got back it felt good, but our defense had to start
stepping it up. As a defensive player, you can't really worry about
what the offense is doing, but it felt like we were the only ones
out there sometimes and if we planned on going anywhere we knew we
had to step up. I thought we finished strong and now we want to
start out that way.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said Sunday's game was fun, ``but any time it's a
scrimmage you can't go full-speed because they know your plays and
we know theirs, and you're going up against your own guys anyway.
You especially can't hit the quarterback, but you can still battle
out there and run your moves. I did all right, but it's camp.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest said the defense has a big advantage over last year at
this time because of its familiarity with one another and the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're pretty comfortable,'' McGinest said. ``We don't have any
new schemes. We're 10 steps ahead of last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do expect a lot of ourselves. We have a lot of talented
guys and we've been playing together for a long time. Everyone
depends on each other. We've got guys who are under contract for a
while and we know we're going to be together. Chris Slade signed
last year and Willie Clay is out there with the leadership thing.
We have a good, young player in Lawyer Milloy who can really hit.''
</P>
<P>
   The starting right cornerback position is a concern, and
McGinest said Chris Canty, who had a nice breakup of a long pass by
Zolak to Anthony Ladd, has had a good camp. But he believes rookie
Tebucky Jones needs to get on the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old saying, `You can't make the club in the tub,'''
McGinest said. ``(Jones) has a lot of talent and confidence and
when he gets out there he'll be comfortable. It takes a long time
to get back when you're hurt as a rookie because you have a lot of
catching up to do. I know because I was hurt my rookie year.''
</P>
<P>
   McGinest's bookend, Ferric Collons, had an outstanding scrimmage
at left end, and Henry Thomas, despite missing a few days because
of a swollen knee, was also a force against the run.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ted Johnson was in on several plays in the first half
of the 100-play scrimmage, but didn't play much in the second half
because of a strained left hamstring. Standing out on the White
defense were second-year linebackers Bernard Russ and Vernon
Crawford. It wasn't a good day for the White secondary, as Terry
Glenn, Vincent Brisby, Troy Brown, and Tony Gaiter excelled. Glenn
caught a 41-yard pass at the start of the game while Gaiter went 66
yards on a TD strike from Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can make a big difference on the field, and this is a year
where I'd like to forget all about the injuries last year and let
it loose,'' McGinest said. ``It's going to be fun. But it'll only
be fun if we play to our capabilities, and that includes me.''

THIS MAJOR ATTRACTED MINOR INTEREST IN L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The 1999 U.S. Senior Open will be held in Des
Moines, Iowa, and _ no offense to the U.S. Senior Open or Des
Moines _ they're made for each other.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Senior Open and Los Angeles, apparently, are not.
</P>
<P>
   This turned into a terrific tournament Sunday after three rounds
dominated by Raymond Floyd and a bunch of glorified crabgrass. Jack
Nicklaus, bless his hip, finished with the lowest round by anybody
all week, although his 67 was too much too late. The rules of golf,
laid out in the funniest sports book since ``Ball Four,'' came into
play in the unusual incident that ruined Brian Barnes. Old pros
Floyd and Hale Irwin battled each other and the heat on a rare
breezeless day at Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   And ultimately Irwin, the best and mentally toughest of the
senior golfers, though not on top of his game early on, summoned
three perfect holes to close out a dramatic one-stroke victory over
Vicente Fernandez with a 12-foot birdie putt on 18.
</P>
<P>
   To which Los Angeles responded with a barely stifled yawn.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Golf Association said 25,500 fans came through the
gates Sunday, and even in the unlikely case that figure is
accurate, it's barely half of what the final round of the PGA
Tour's Nissan Open attracts each March.
</P>
<P>
   There were open spots along the fairway gallery ropes as Irwin
and Floyd trudged up the 18th, and plenty of elbow room on the
natural amphitheater behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   The four-round crowd count, 76,500, was precisely 76.5 percent
of the lofty attendance goal set by tournament director Bill
Knight.
</P>
<P>
   Putting on a brave face, Knight called the fans' response
``reasonable... We're happy with it. We're not jumping up and down
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   But after only 7,000 fans showed up on Thursday, the tournament
organizers had to cut back on overhead. For one thing, they reduced
the number of parking-lot shuttle buses.
</P>
<P>
   All of which is significant not because we're concerned about
the shuttle-bus industry but because Riviera would love to host the
!ital!real!off! U.S. Open _ the last in Southern California was Ben
Hogan's victory at Riviera 50 years ago _ and this might have been
an audition.
</P>
<P>
   The next unassigned U.S. Open is the 2004 edition, though it's
unlikely the event would return to the state that soon, since it
was held at the Olympic Club in San Francisco this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this course would be a wonderful venue for a U.S. Open
championship,'' Irwin said (and why wouldn't he?) after winning
with a 1-over-par 284 at Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   The question is whether anybody would show up.
</P>
<P>
   Now, explaining the relative apathy this week might be
impossible, short of interviewing everybody who !ital!wasn't!off!
there. But theories, we have theories.
</P>
<P>
   There's the worn-out excuse that Los Angeles offers too many
sports and entertainment options. Over the weekend, you could have
gone to see ``Armageddon,'' ``Disturbing Behavior'' and ``Fear and
Loathing,'' and that's only one Dodgers game.
</P>
<P>
   And with the advent of Viagra, senior golf's fan base has one
more thing to do with its free time.
</P>
<P>
   Better, there's the argument that PGA, LPGA and Senior PGA Tour
events are so commonplace in Southern California _ eight this year,
12 if you count the winter ``silly season'' _ that a ``major
tournament'' is one too many for the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Supporting that theory is the fact that this week's tournament
officially outdrew the '95 PGA Championship at Riviera (though
enthusiasm for that event was dampened by the requirement that fans
purchase a week's strip of tickets).
</P>
<P>
   Certainly the USGA can't complain about the amount of publicity
it received. The two L.A. newspapers published special sections
before the tournament. Then again, the cover stories were all about
Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer being on their last legs. That made you
want to come out to see them but only to help them across the
street.
</P>
<P>
   Then the competition started. The rough was so thick, you could
lose a baseball, let alone a golf ball, in it. Suddenly, what
should have been a stroll through golf history, a chance to watch
Jack roll in one more long birdie and Arnie make one more charge,
turned into an afternoon watching Grandpa take the Weed-Whacker to
the back lawn.
</P>
<P>
   The regular senior-tour events are highly entertaining, the
players taking the competition seriously but also recognizing
they're museum pieces in a nostalgia exhibition. They sign
autographs, joke with the crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Put the word ``major'' in front of the event, and try to make
Irwin's first triumph in the U.S. Senior Open sound as important as
his three in the !ital!real!off! U.S. Open, and the thing actually
becomes harder to take seriously.
</P>
<P>
   L.A. fans didn't take it seriously this week, at least not
enough of them. It will be different in Des Moines, probably.
</P>
<P>
   Said Knight, the tournament director: ``It'll be like the Super
Bowl in Des Moines.''

MARINERS MUST GIVE BASEBALL MINDS CHANCE TO WORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ This will not be just another week in baseball. Not
for the Mariners. Not for Woody Woodward. Not for the team's
quasi-accountable owners, who still have time to reverse themselves
and let their baseball people make baseball decisions.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a good deal to be made for Randy Johnson, Woodward
must be allowed to make it, because it is too big a waste to get
nothing for the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a deal for the beloved Edgar Martinez _ one that
Martinez likes and is good for him and the M's _ Woodward must have
the right to pull the trigger, even if no one in Seattle wants
Martinez to go.
</P>
<P>
   There is much at stake over the next seven days. The maintenance
of a competitive ballclub _ one that fits the owner-dictated
payroll constraints _ needs almost hourly monitoring right now. You
can't be knee-jerk in big trade decisions. But you can't be rooted
in cement, either.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward, the Mariners' vice president of baseball operations,
must have the chance to do his job _ especially now.
</P>
<P>
   This week, the M's are home for two crash-and-burn series
against the best teams in the American League. Cleveland and New
York will come to town to push the Mariners, the owners and
Woodward to their limit.
</P>
<P>
   This will be the week that tells the tale of 1998 and beyond:
Are the M's in or out of the playoff hunt? Do they trade or stand
pat? Do they play for '98 or do they think about '99, the new
stadium and beyond?
</P>
<P>
   One thing's for sure, this is not a week for the weak of heart.
</P>
<P>
   If the hot M's climb to within five or six games of the AL West
lead, maybe Woodward has to consider making a deal to bolster the
M's stretch run _ a notion unthinkable before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   But if Cleveland beats the M's and the gap between Seattle and
the best of the AL West stays near double digits, then Woodward
might have to stop thinking about '98 and consider any deal that
will benefit the team in '99 and beyond. Guaranteed, the fans will
appreciate that kind of forward thinking.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the scenario is by Friday, the guy in charge of trades
must have the chance to react to the fluidity of the market.
</P>
<P>
   If Cleveland general manager John Hart decides he wants Johnson
and Martinez on his team, then Woodward has to be in a position to
react to the slew of players Hart might offer.
</P>
<P>
   The word is, Cleveland outfielder David Justice, second baseman
Enrique Wilson, first baseman Richie Sexson and reliever Paul Shuey
might be on the table in exchange for Johnson and Martinez.
</P>
<P>
   Woodward has to have the green light to at least consider this
kind of franchise-altering deal.
</P>
<P>
   Say what you will about Woodward. He has traded away Mariner
heartthrobs and prospects as if the club's farm system had the
power to clone major leaguers. But he has never shied away from
trading deadlines deals. He has been fully accountable.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it has taken Woodward too long to pull off certain deals.
Last season, for instance, the Phillies were willing to trade
closer Ricky Bottalico and the White Sox were offering a slew of
bullpen help.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Woodward could not get the owners to OK payroll increases
fast enough, which is why he was left to trade Jason Varitek and
Derrick Lowe to Boston for Heathcliff Slocumb and Jose Cruz to
Toronto for Mike Timlin and Paul Spoljaric.
</P>
<P>
   (And if you look at how Cruz has struggled and Timlin has
pitched the last month, the Toronto deal doesn't look too bad now.)
</P>
<P>
   But the point is, Woodward has never blinked in the face of a
tough decision. He has made the deals that sacrificed long-term
health for short-term glory _ a philosophy that can't be knocked
when you're trying to cash in on a team that has had a roster as
star-studded as the Mariners'.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's crunch time again. Friday is the trading deadline. It
is a date that means there are two months left in the season. The
contenders have a chance to bolster their rosters, while the losers
have to think about next season.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings us to the Mariners. Are they in or out? Do they
stand pat or do they make a move?
</P>
<P>
   The problem here in Marinerville is that the power to do what
might need to be done has been taken from Woodward. The owners have
issued a hands-off Randy Johnson edict _ a hand-tying move that has
kept Woodward from fulfilling his job description, which is to
improve the team according to the incredibly tense and
fast-changing climate of the baseball market.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Pelekoudas, M's vice president of baseball administration,
said late last week that the team is in contention for the AL West
division title. That bold stance was bolstered when the M's won two
in Baltimore this weekend. This second-half surge has only made
this critical week more tense for the M's. It has put more pressure
on the line, on Woodward's shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Now the M's come home. It is crunch time. By week's end, if a
deal presents itself that makes sense for the long-term health of
the Mariners, the owners must let the Mariner baseball people have
the freedom to do their job. No time left to fool around in a
season of too much fooling around.

BOUNCES GO MARINERS' WAY

<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ If you can't make conversation about baseball this
week in Seattle, then you've never heard of the infield fly rule or
a four-seam fastball.
</P>
<P>
   The long-simmering issue of Randy Johnson will come to a head by
the interleague trade deadline Friday night, and the M's thickened
the plot Sunday by completing a two-of-three series victory here
against Baltimore, splicing speed between clutch hitting for a 10-4
triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got some ground to make up,'' right fielder Jay Buhner
conceded. ``But if the teams ahead of us keep losing, it's going to
be a nice little turnaround for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's still a ways to go.''
</P>
<P>
   But a little less today. As the M's were having their way with
the Orioles, both Anaheim and Texas were being shellacked, so as
Seattle points to an eight-game homestand against American League
powers Cleveland, New York and Boston starting Tuesday night, the
M's are 8{ games behind Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   That's the best state of affairs for the Mariners since they
were 8{ back on June 2, after giving away a game to the Orioles
here in this same park.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to get back to .500,'' insisted Jamie Moyer (8-7),
who won his third straight decision. ``I keep saying it, but I
really mean it. I've never seen a team win a division or a wild
card without getting to .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can get to .500, obviously we stand to pick up some
ground, and we'll have gained some momentum by doing that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seattle had five two-out hits that produced seven runs in three
different innings. And a team not known for its wheels took
advantage of Scott Erickson's slow windup for a club record-tying
five steals, including a personal-high three by Ken Griffey Jr.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just ran, I guess,'' Griffey shrugged. ``I always have the
green light. I just never run.''
</P>
<P>
   With victories in the final two games of the series, the M's
blunted Baltimore's thunderous momentum mounted on 14 wins in 15
games.
</P>
<P>
   Pretty much all you need to know about this one was revealed in
two batted balls, one by the Mariners, one by the Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   In the third inning, with John Marzano at third base and two
outs, Alex Rodriguez hit a grounder to the left of shortstop Jeff
Reboulet. The ball scooted under Reboulet's glove for an error,
something about as rare in Baltimore as those who remember Robert
Irsay fondly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe things are starting to even up a little bit,'' Buhner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oriole fans, used to watching a club that had made a major
league-low 47 errors, perhaps weren't wise to the ways of what such
a miscue can do. The Mariners, who know only too well, quickly
showed them.
</P>
<P>
   After Griffey walked, he and Rodriguez worked separate steals.
Edgar Martinez then stung a two-run single off Erickson, the league
leader in complete games, David Segui stroked the first of his four
hits, and Buhner struck a two-run double for a 5-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Buhner was fortunate to be intact to tell about that other
aforementioned ball, lofted to right by Brady Anderson leading off
the fifth inning. On a sunny afternoon, Buhner fought the high sky
and a background of light shirts in the stands and completely lost
the ball.
</P>
<P>
   As he settled into a crouch, waiting for the worst, Buhner
almost got it. The ball hit him square in the belt buckle, and he
was able to cradle it with his glove hand for the out.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I never have another one like that, it'll be OK,'' Buhner
said. ``You can't practice that. I didn't come to the ball, the
ball came to me.''
</P>
<P>
   By then, the M's had a 7-3 lead, stretched by two runs in the
top of the fifth when, with the bases loaded, Shane Monahan turned
on an 0-and-2, hanging breaking ball from Erickson for a double
into the right-field corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made about eight bad two-strike pitches and they got
hits,'' lamented Oriole manager Ray Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got two strikes on guys and couldn't put them away,''
Erickson said. ``I was a little bit wild. Once I got two strikes, I
really couldn't strike anybody out.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether Baltimore could have survived without Reboulet's big
error is debatable. Erickson, who also leads the majors in hits
allowed, gave up eight in a laborious five innings. But the
mistake, leading to Baltimore's second three-error game of the
year, removed any doubt.
</P>
<P>
   If the M's had time to admire their handiwork, they would know
that in rebounding from the opening defeat to win the series
against a hot club, they accomplished something substantial.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just got beat Friday night,'' Mariner manager Lou Piniella
said. ``(Mike Mussina) made good pitches. We've bounced back from
that type of situation fairly well. It's when we get sloppy that's
the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Sloppy, the M's know only too well. They hope to get a lot more
familiar with bouncing back.

BONILLA'S ACTIVE DATE A DEBATE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Los Angeles Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman said
Sunday he wasn't sure that Bobby Bonilla would return to action
from left-wrist tendinitis on Thursday. But whether that has been
told to Bonilla might be a different story.
</P>
<P>
   Bonilla said he expects to come off the 15-day disabled list
when he is eligible Thursday to join the Dodgers against the host
Philadelphia Phillies. Bonilla, who had wrist surgery during the
offseason, was placed on the DL on July 17, retroactive to July 15.
</P>
<P>
   Since being traded from the Florida Marlins to the Dodgers in
the May 15 blockbuster seven-player deal, Bonilla has batted .202
with one home run in 124 at-bats. When he returns, he will likely
be sent to left field and Adrian Beltre will stay at third base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I was staying longer on the DL,'' said Bonilla.
``Do you all (the media) know something I don't? It's really up to
them. When I come off is when I come off. They haven't told me
anything differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a lot of patience. I don't think a lot of people around
me have the same patience. It is really out of my control. I
thought I was going to be in Florida doing rehab, and the next
thing I know I was on a plane to L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Important trip?: How big is the Dodgers' upcoming 10-game
road trip? Well, Bonilla described it by saying, ``It's huge ...
huge.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers begin a three-game series at Philadelphia on Tuesday
before playing four against ex-Dodgers star Mike Piazza and the New
York Mets (Friday-Aug. 3) and finishing with three contests against
the Montreal Expos (Aug. 4-6). Bonilla said the Dodgers can't
underestimate Philadelphia and Montreal, and they have to be
prepared to play in the ``zoo'' setting of New York's Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to determine how the next two months go,'' Bonilla
said. ``Why? Well, we're five games out (of the wild card).
Stranger things have happened, but this will be a good indicator.
We are on the road for one of the longest trips of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, however, begged to differ.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say it's do or die,'' he said. ``Every game is
important, and this (trip) is important. We just have to try and
stay within striking distance. Than if we can get everyone back
healthy, we'll have another run at these teams in August and
September.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Labor issue: Dodgers catcher Charles Johnson, who was
expected to take the game off, was dismissed from being in uniform
after his wife, Rhonda, went into labor. With Johnson unavailable
and usual backup Tom Prince starting, outfielder Trenidad Hubbard
became the emergency backup.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, 32, was actually an all-conference catcher at Southern
University. But Hubbard said he relinquished his catching duties
with Houston's Double-A Columbus in 1990 because of his knack for
stealing bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd block the ball and catch if they needed me to. I'd go out
there without a (protective) cup on, just as long as I play,'' said
a joking Hubbard, who last caught for the Colorado Rockies in 1996
during an exhibition game against their Triple-A team.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard didn't catch against Arizona. Prince threw out two base
runners.
</P>
<P>
   __ Upcoming matchups: Dodgers left-hander Brian Bohanon (3-6,
3.21) will face Phillies right-hander Tyler Green (6-7, 4.66) on
Tuesday. Dodgers right-hander Dave Mlicki (5-4, 3.89) will meet
Phillies right-hander Carlton Loewer (4-3, 7.20). Dodgers
right-hander Chan Ho Park (9-5, 4.07) will face Phillies
left-hander Matt Beech (3-6, 5.00).

U.S. 500 marred by tragedy
<TEXT>
<P>
   Moore captures wild race featuring 62 lead changes
</P>
<P>
   By TERRY BLOUNT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   BROOKLYN, Mich. _ When Greg Moore crossed the finish line a few
feet in front of Jimmy Vasser and Alex Zanardi, the Omega timing
computer failed to list Moore as the winner of the U.S. 500.
</P>
<P>
   The computer was set up to accept a maximum of 60 lead changes,
more than double any other CART event had ever recorded. But
Moore's pass of Vasser on the final lap was the 62nd lead change of
Sunday's race, something no one involved in the racing series would
have imagined possible.
</P>
<P>
   The 70,000 fans at the Michigan Speedway saw one of the most
exciting races in years. But the event was marred by a freakish
accident that killed three spectators and injured six when a wheel
off Adrian Fernandez's car flew into the grandstand after he hit
the wall late in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a great show,'' Moore said. ``But when something like
that happens, it puts a damper on the entire day. I feel so bad for
the families of those people.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the drivers knew what had happened until the race was
over, but they all knew they had participated in a rare passing
festival that left the outcome in doubt until the final seconds of
the 250-lap event over the two-mile, high-banked Michigan Speedway
oval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, I've never seen a race like that in my
life,'' said Chip Ganassi, owner of the Target team that has Vasser
and Zanardi. ``From my vantage point, it's pretty damn exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser finished .008 seconds (about three feet) ahead of Zanardi
after the teammates had passed each other more than a dozen times
during the race.
</P>
<P>
   The reason for all the passing was the new Handford Device,
which is a change in the rear wing that was used for the first time
to try to slow the cars on the superspeedway. It worked, but the
main effect of the change was an air tow that enabled the cars to
pass each other, almost at will.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a NASCAR race without bumpers,'' said Michael
Andretti, who finished sixth behind fourth-place Scott Pruett and
fifth-place Richie Hearn, but only 1.5 seconds behind Moore. ``It
was hairy out there with a lot of wheel-to-wheel racing, but that's
what racing is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fans witnessed more than 100 lead changes in the race, but a
lead change isn't official unless the driver leads that lap. Nine
drivers led at least one lap.
</P>
<P>
   ``I loved it,'' said Moore, 23, a Canadian who won for the
second time this season. ``But it did make things difficult. Guys
could get in the draft and get by you pretty quickly. There was
nothing you could do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a good thing for superspeedways. It was great
for the fans, and it was 100 times more exciting than St. Louis
(another oval-track race).''
</P>
<P>
   The previous record for lead changes in a CART race was 27 at
Michigan in 1982 and 1985. The drivers eclipsed that mark Sunday
only five laps past the halfway mark. The race included six lead
changes in the last 10 laps, and five in the final five laps.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those last five laps were pretty intense,'' said Moore, who
drives the Player's Reynard Mercedes. ``I think I passed Jimmy with
three laps to go, but then he got back ahead of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just decided to follow him for one lap, and then I got a
good run on him in turn 1 of the last lap. I was weaving back and
forth to try to break the draft, then I looked in my mirror and saw
they weren't going to catch me.''
</P>
<P>
   Vasser, who won the event in 1996, was hoping to win again at
Michigan in his 100th career start as a CART driver.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to come in second, but Greg did a fantastic job,''
Vasser said. ``I just led the wrong lap and they came flying right
back on me.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic racing, but I didn't get the breaks at the
end. We all said before the race that you didn't want to lead at
the white flag (next-to-last lap), but it's hard not to take the
lead when you are out there driving. It was a lot of fun out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   The one person who disagreed with that assessment was Zanardi,
who was hoping to set a CART record with a fifth consecutive
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that is racing,'' said Zanardi, whose engine
caught fire on the last lap. ``It was funny, but it wasn't real
racing. You couldn't pull away from anybody. Guys would pass you,
and there was nothing you could do. But it was the car, not the
driver. I would call this a show, but I wouldn't call it racing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if the fans saw that every week they would lose
interest. Some of that passing was a waste of time. It didn't take
a lot of skill to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore showed enough skill to work his way to the front despite
stalling his engine on two occasions in the pits.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a problem with the pit-lane speed limiter that would
cause the engine to die when we stopped,'' Moore said. ``But my
crew worked it out and kept me in it. This is a long race and I'm
still learning at these tracks. This is the first 500-mile race
where I've finished on the lead lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore won $100,000 for the victory. He had failed to finish in
the top 10 in the three previous races, including 25th- and
27th-place finishes.

   ``My team wasn't down, but I could tell some of them didn't have
that same gleam in their eyes as they had earlier in year,'' Moore
said. ``I think they got it back today.''

SHAW PLAYS SAVIOR
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With yet another debacle on the horizon, the Los
Angeles Dodgers' version of Superman swooped in from the bullpen to
save the day once again.
</P>
<P>
   After entering the eighth inning with a five-run lead over the
Arizona Diamondbacks, the non-Jeff Shaw members of the Dodgers'
bullpen were rattled once again by allowing three runs and leaving
the bases loaded with just one out. The All-Star, however, got the
next two batters to ground out to end the inning before earning his
30th save during the Dodgers' 5-3 victory over the Diamondbacks in
front of 37,353 on Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The good news from Shaw, however, could not overcome the bad
caused when Dodgers starter Ismael Valdes left the game in the
sixth inning with a muscle strain on the left side of his back.
</P>
<P>
   Valdes (9-9), who threw five scoreless innings, allowing four
hits, will be re-evaluated today. Valdes, who is 6-2 at home this
season and owns a three-game winning streak, has never had back
problems in his major-league career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now it is sore and it's hard to say if I'll make my next
start,'' said Valdes, who has also been bothered by the flu
recently. ``I don't want to miss a start, but I have no control of
it. No one likes this situation and this is new to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm worried. It's painful. I can't pitch with pain and deliver
good.''
</P>
<P>
   After throwing his first pitch to leadoff pinch-hitter Jorge
Fabregas in the sixth, Valdes winced, said catcher Tom Prince. And
after Valdez felt worse on his second pitch, Dodgers manager Glenn
Hoffman and assistant trainer Stan Johnston checked out the
right-hander and watched him struggle through a couple practice
tosses before summoning Mark Guthrie from the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is scary. Hopefully it is not severe,'' said Hoffman, who
noted Valdes was throwing in the 90-mph range before the injury.
``When you're pitching, you use all the muscles in your side, back
and legs. When one is (injured), it can alter their pitching. That
is what we have to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Guthrie followed by allowing no runs, struck out three and
allowed just one hit during his first two innings. But after
entering the eighth with a 5-0 advantage, Guthrie allowed the bases
to be loaded with no outs on a double, a hit batter and a single.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Fox followed with a two-run single that trimmed Arizona's
deficit to 5-2 and brought images back of the Dodgers' debacle on
Thursday. On that night, relievers Antonio Osuna and Scott Radinsky
played a huge part in blowing a five-run lead against the Houston
Astros in the eighth inning during an eventual loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Arizona) took advantage of our voodoo eighth innings,'' said
Guthrie, who snapped his scoreless streak at 102/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   After Osuna came in and caused a pop fly for one out, Radinsky
allowed an RBI single to cut the Dodgers' lead to 5-3 and hit the
next batter. Despite facing a bases-loaded situation with no outs,
Shaw forced ex-Dodger Karim Garcia to hit the ball to the mound for
a force out at the plate. Then he got Brent Brede to ground out to
end Arizona's threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming into the eighth inning is not unusual for me,'' said
Shaw, who has retired 32 of the 37 batters he has faced over 11
innings in nine appearances with the Dodgers. ``I did it a lot as a
set-up guy in Cincinnati and I'm doing it here.''
</P>
<P>
   By the way, the Dodgers also received a solo home run from Matt
Luke in the first inning and four runs in the third _ two on a home
run by Eric Karros _ all off $6 million Arizona starter Andy Benes.
Luke's round-tripper was his fifth in nine games. Karros went 2 for
4 with a double, home run and two RBI to extend his hitting streak
to six games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' victory was their ninth in 14 games and kept them
five games behind the Chicago Cubs in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is asking too much to recover from five runs,'' said Benes
(7-11), who allowed five runs on eight hits in five innings. ``Five
runs is a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   And so is the possibility of losing Valdes for the
wild-card-seeking Dodgers.

NEW YORK CITY POLICE OFFICER IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER BEING SHOT
IN HEAD
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: The following story is an added starter on The New York
Times front page.)  (sw) 
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City police officer was fighting for his
life after being shot in the head on Sunday night on Staten Island,
apparently by a 17-year-old parolee who was wanted for questioning
on a new murder charge, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gerard Carter, 28, was on a routine patrol of the
West Brighton Houses project when he was shot at 9:25 p.m. in front
of 810 Henderson Avenue, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a press
conference at St. Vincent's Hospital in Staten Island. He was
listed in critical condition, and was undergoing brain surgery.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Shatiek Johnson, was paroled in April after serving
one and a half years for a 1996 manslaughter conviction, the police
said. He was arrested earlier this summer on a farebeating charge,
but somehow slipped through the parole system. He was most recently
wanted for questioning in the July 16 murder of Eric Trotman, 20,
in Staten Island, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's incident was the most serious shooting of a New
York City police officer since May, when a police officer was
fatally shot in Brooklyn while trying to arrest a parolee.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani used the occasion to rail _ again _ against a parole
system that he has long said needs to be reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of the parole system putting the lives
of police officers and other innocent citizens at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A Police Department spokeswoman, Officer Valerie St. Rose, said
Carter was sitting in a marked police van, in uniform and on duty,
when at least one shot pierced the front windshield.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors reported hearing two quick shots that they said
sounded like discharges from a handgun. Then they saw the wounded
officer, face down, slumped over the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Carter's partner, Eric Storch, 29, was not wounded in the
shooting but was traumatized, said police spokesman Officer Dennis
Laffin. He was treated at and released from Bayley Seton Hospital,
said a spokeswoman there.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred in a section of Staten Island that is
dominated by the sprawling West Brighton Houses housing projects.
There is a large courtyard in the middle of the projects, and that,
according to neighbors, was where the officer was shot on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The police are known to maintain a visible presence in the
projects, mainly to crack down on beer drinking and drug activity,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Carter was driving on a pathway through the
housing development, with Storch at his side, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   They were seeking to question Johnson, who had missed a day of
community service _ his sentence after the farebeating arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The officer saw one and perhaps three people and slowed the van
to a stop, the police said. At the point, Johnson approached and
fired through windshield, hitting Carter in the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Storch returned the fire with one or two shots, both of which
missed their target.
</P>
<P>
   After the shots rang out, the police responded with breathtaking
speed and urgency, the neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came from every angel,'' said one woman who declined to
give her name. ``They came from all angles.''
</P>
<P>
   The police said that they believed that the suspect was still in
the housing projects, and were preparing to conduct an apartment by
apartment search.

A LEAGUE OF HIS OWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ERIC NOLAND  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Over the last two-plus years, no one has wielded
more mastery of the Senior PGA Tour than Hale Irwin, and in the
U.S. Senior Open, the tour's most important major tournament, he
convened a clinic as to why.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin mounted a relentless charge and delivered a spectacular
finish Sunday at Riviera Country Club, obliterating the commanding
lead of Raymond Floyd, holding off the surprising surge of Vicente
Fernandez, and winning the championship the hard way _ by rolling
in a 12-foot, downhill birdie putt on the final hole, Riviera's
dastardly 18th.
</P>
<P>
   And then his celebration knew no bounds. Irwin pumped his right
fist into the air. Then both fists. Once he got his hands on the
great silver goblet that is this tournament's trophy, he wouldn't
let go, even sitting with it wedged between his knees when he later
met the press.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder this guy has been so testy this entire weekend:
Obviously, this championship meant much more to him than anyone
realized.
</P>
<P>
   It came on the strength of a 1-over-par total of 285, as he shot
a 2-under round of 69 on the final day. That was one stroke better
than Fernandez and two ahead of Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   It also completed an impressive weekend rally. Irwin was well
off the pace after opening with a 77 on Thursday. The previous
worst score a U.S. Senior Open champion had to overcome in the
first round was a 74.
</P>
<P>
   The title is not an end-all for his career, Irwin said, ``but it
kind of puts a stamp on where I've been trying to get to with at
least those Open championships.... I guess it meant more to me
because I wanted to be one of those few who won both.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be Open titles on both sides of age 50. Irwin took
the U.S. Open championship in 1974, '79 and '90, but the Senior
Open had eluded him in 3{ seasons on this tour, even though few
other titles had.
</P>
<P>
   Dominant? The adjective is almost inadequate to describe what
he's accomplished. Since the start of '96, Irwin has played in 60
events, and this marked his 53rd top-10 finish and 16th victory.
He's played 14 events this year and has finished in the top five in
each and every one of them (this was his fifth win).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it boils down to Hale's the best senior player out
there. He showed it to the world today,'' said Floyd, Irwin's
playing partner on the final day. ``He did what he needed to do. He
played beautifully all day....
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a tour dominated the way he has done the last
two years. It's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   That might sound like awe. More likely, it was shell shock.
</P>
<P>
   Floyd began the day with a three-stroke lead, having put
together two outstanding rounds of 70, followed by a respectable 73
on Saturday. But Floyd, whose approach irons landed well short of
the green all day long, bogeyed two of the first five holes.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin caught him within seven holes.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime later came a surprise contender, Fernandez, an
Argentine in his third year among the seniors (he played only on a
short time on the PGA Tour). Fernandez, with a blistering final
round of 3-under 68, created a three-way tie with a birdie on No.16
and then took the lead when he sank a 15-foot par putt on No.17 as
both Floyd and Irwin were bogeying 13.
</P>
<P>
   But Irwin didn't get all those victories in all those
tournaments by being faint of heart. As he walked up the fairway at
15, he said, he told his caddie he would need a couple of birdies
down the stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Ordered, delivered. Irwin played left-right break to roll in a
25-foot birdie putt on 16, then averted what would have been an
18-hole playoff today by sinking that dead-straight 12-footer on
18.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin nearly had three straight birdies to close out that
charge. On a 25-foot attempt from the edge of the 17th green, the
ball just caught the right lip, took a circle tour of the cup and
kicked out. Irwin, in disbelief, flopped dramatically onto his back
on the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always felt,'' he said of Open championships, ``that they
test your management and patience _ the mental part of your game.''
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, he certainly recovered quickly to mount his
assault on 18. It mirrored, in miniature, his recovery from that
dreadful start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no talking about it,'' Irwin, who ducked the press
that day, said of his dismal first round, ``because I wanted it
flushed from my mind. I wasn't that far out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The way he's been playing this tour, it was a cinch he was fully
capable of playing his way back into the tournament. And winning
it.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin becomes the seventh player to couple a U.S. Open
championship with a U.S. Senior Open title (the latter event began
in '80). It's select company. The others: Arnold Palmer, Jack
Nicklaus, Gary Player, Billy Casper, Lee Trevino, Orville Moody.
</P>
<P>
   ``My timing was not quite on this week,'' said Irwin. ``Coupled
with my desire to win this event, that puts you on that edge of
maybe you are trying too hard, maybe you are pushing it just a
little bit. That's why I kept telling myself, `Back away from it.
Back away from it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Once he had collected himself and locked his relentlessly
precise game into place, the rest of the senior field probably had
no chance.
</P>
<P>
   As usual.

AIR-BASE LAB TEAM TESTED FOR RADIATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. _ Air Force officials are testing
base workers for radiation after a small amount of radium
discovered in a recycling truck contaminated a base lab.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials don't believe there is any serious health
risk from the material discovered about two weeks ago, they said
Sunday. Nevertheless, two buildings were closed and tests were run
on the four people who handled the material, about one-half inch
wide and an inch long. There also was testing of several others in
the area when the radium was being examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urine samples of people who handled the material or entered
either building have been taken to determine if any ingestion
actually occurred,'' said Dennis Shoffner, spokesman for the base
in northern Los Angeles County. Results of the tests have not yet
been returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the two buildings remain closed, although other
portions have been decontaminated and reopened. ``People have begun
to reoccupy those areas that have been determined safe,'' Shoffner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Radium, commonly used in cancer treatment, can be fatal to
humans in high concentrations and can lead to bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the radium found at the base is still unknown. It
was discovered when a load of scrap metal that recycler Paul Ogden
brought to a Los Angeles recycling center set off radiation
sensors. Ogden believes he acquired the material when he made a
pickup at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've handled material, I've never seen an
incident like this,'' said Ogden, a Mojave resident who has
recycling contracts with the Air Force base. ``It seems to be an
isolated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogden, in the recycling business for five years, drove the load
back to the base July 14 after the recycling center would not let
it in. He took it to the base, he said, rather than tear apart the
load piece by piece to find what set the sensors off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do the responsible thing for my safety and the
safety of others,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the base, Air Force officials determined that the
radioactive source was the piece of metal in a 6-inch stainless
steel tube. They placed the potentially deadly material into a
pipe, along with brass shavings to keep it from moving. They sealed
the pipe with caps.
</P>
<P>
   It was transported to the base's hazardous material facility and
then taken to the base's bio-environmental safety lab where it was
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an analysis sample was taken from the source, some of the
brass-filing packing material spilled,'' Shoffner said. ``This
material is thought to have rubbed off surface material from the
source tube, thus carrying a small amount of material.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force investigation team specializing in radiation
assessment has been on the base since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined if the material in fact originated at
the base, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   `We have no indication that it was ours to begin with,''
Shoffner said. ``It's a complete mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Air Force has permits to possess and use several
small, sealed sources of radioactive material for X-rays and
calibration of laboratory instruments, officials said the material
from Ogden's load does not appear to be in the same form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that we use here,'' Shoffner said. ``We don't
have any record that we had it or that we used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Baldenweg of the Radiologic Health Branch at the California
Department of Health Services inspected Ogden's business and found
no evidence that radioactive material had leaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four people testing to see if there's any
contamination,'' Baldenweg said. ``There was no detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldenweg and several Air Force official also visited Ogden's
home.

KENT'S HOMER MAKES A WINNER OF MESA 
BY DAVID BUSH
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Jeff Kent, himself a product of one of general
manager Brian Sabean's deals, made one of the latest Giants'
transactions look good Sunday, when he belted a home run leading
off the 10th inning to give the Giants a 2-1 victory over the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   Kent's 13th homer of the year, a drive to left that stayed under
the Candlestick Point jet stream, made a winner of Jose Mesa (1-0),
who until last Thursday belonged to the Cleveland Indians. Mesa was
one of four new Giants Sabean added in last week's one-day dealing
frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   In his second appearance with the Giants, Mesa struck out all
three batters he faced in the 10th inning, following starter Orel
Hershiser (seven innings, one run) and Robb Nen (two shutout
innings).
</P>
<P>
   Knowing he had Mesa in reserve, manager Dusty Baker had been
able to use his closer, Nen, in the seventh inning of a 1-1 tie.
Look for more such maneuverings when the Giants, who still trail
the Cubs by three in pursuit of the wild card, open an eastern road
trip tomorrow night in Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very nice,'' Baker said of the double-barreled late
relief corps, which brings back memories of late 1997 and Rod Beck
and Roberto Hernandez. ``Robb hadn't pitched in almost a week
(since last Monday), and now he's tuned up for Montreal.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershiser, who held the Reds to four hits and the single run
that came in the first inning, also welcomes the addition of Mesa,
a former teammate in Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose gives us a 1-2 punch out there,'' said Hershiser, who
showed the crowd of 34,638 a performance reminiscent of his
six-game winning streak two months ago. Hershiser had been 1-2 with
a 5.21 ERA since the All-Star break, but he feels his touch never
went away.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've felt really good the whole second half, I just haven't
gotten the results,'' Hershiser said. ``I threw pretty much the
same today. It's not like I was out there trying to reinvent the
wheel.''
</P>
<P>
   Reggie Sanders tripled to lead off the game and scored on a
sacrifice fly, but after that, Hershiser permitted just three
harmless singles and a walk, with only one other runner advancing
as far as second base.
</P>
<P>
   But all that earned him was no decision, largely due to
Cincinnati second-year right-hander Brett Tomko. He went the first
nine innings and held the Giants to just a run on two hits. Rey
Sanchez tripled in the fourth, when two Cincinnati outfielders
clanged into one another while diving for the ball. Kent drove
Sanchez in with a sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   But when the teams got into the bullpens, the Giants were
sturdier. Nen got himself into some trouble with a throwing error
and walk in the eighth but was rescued when Darryl Hamilton made a
sliding catch of Eddie Taubensee's shallow fly ball to end the
inning. He dusted off the effects of Willie Greene's leadoff single
in the ninth, then turned things over to Mesa, who knocked off the
three Cincinnati hitters he saw in just 14 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't try for strikeouts,'' Mesa said. ``You throw too many
pitches that way. I guess they were just not seeing the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   But to take the rubber game of the three-game series, the Giants
still needed a run. Kent, who was an RBI machine over the weekend,
took care of that when he belted the second pitch from reliever
Stan Belinda (4-7) over the left-field fence.
</P>
<P>
   That gave Kent, who joined the Giants in the winter of '96-97 in
the Matt Williams trade, 11 RBIs and four homers in the series,
following an 0-for-21 skid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a home-run hitter,'' said Kent, who is wearing a
lighter knee brace than the bulky device he tried after coming off
the disabled list July 10. ``It just happened. ... I didn't hit it
very high, so the wind didn't knock it down. I have been playing in
Candlestick for a year and three-quarters. I know the winds.''

BLOWERS' BLAST CAN'T STOP A'S LOSING STREAK

   ST. PETERSBURG, FLA. _ Mike Blowers homered Sunday to snap his

day when the A's pushed their losing streak to six games with a 3-1
defeat.

<P>
   Blowers' opposite-field drive in the second was about all the
A's could muster in the offensive department on another sad day for
the club. Former Giant Wilson Alvarez (5-8) held them to three hits
in seven innings, and the A's (46-57) lost their eighth of the past
nine games to fall to a season-worst 11 games under .500.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is a funny game,'' said manager Art Howe, who held a
brief postgame meeting to tell the players to keep their heads up.
``Sometimes you feel inept. Sometimes you feel like the '27
Yankees. You can't pick and choose. You have to take it as it
comes. ... We've got to regroup.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's have lost all six games on this road trip, which wraps
up Monday evening with one more game at ghastly Tropicana Field,
and nothing explains the poor showing more than the sputtering
offense. During those six games, the A's have been outscored 37-18
and are hitting .209 (40-for-191).
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we're in a little rut,'' Rickey Henderson said.
``When you get to putting pressure on yourself, you can get tired.
We're a little tired now. We have to forget the anger. You have to
be more angry against the other team.''
</P>
<P>
   Blowers' struggles have been more than just a symptom of the
team-wide downturn. He was a foundation of the offense when it was
going well before the All-Star break and is one of only four A's
with more than 50 RBIs. But he had 48 going into the All-Star
break, and just three since then.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good going into the break,'' he said. ``I don't
know what happened. Everything went south on me. It's been the most
confusing part of my career. The whole thing has taken me by
surprise. I've never struggled like this in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   If the A's are going to rebound from their miserable hitting,
Blowers will have to get it going. Once Scott Spiezio comes back
from his rehab stint (knee) in a couple weeks, Bip Roberts could
move to third if Blowers is still struggling. Dave Magadan (sore
wrist) ``isn't even on the horizon,'' manager Art Howe said
yesterday, so Blowers will be a key for at least the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a start,'' Blowers said after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Besides Rickey Henderson, Blowers is the only veteran
right-handed hitter that is regularly in the lineup. He knows his
presence is pivotal for the A's, and he has felt the pressure. The
past several nights before Sunday, Blowers said he would wake up in
the night and not be able to go back to sleep.
</P>
<P>
   ``You start to get the feeling like you're letting everybody
down,'' he said. ``I have no problems going to sleep, but it's
almost like I'm napping, because I wake back up and can't sleep
again. Everything goes through your mind. I've been watching a lot
of videotape of myself hitting and all that runs through your mind.
You think about pitchers. You think about at-bats. You can't stop
yourself from thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before the game. Asked afterward if maybe he would
sleep better for a change, thinking about that home run, Blowers
just shook his head and stared off into the distance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said, ``I'll probably be thinking about that double
play I hit into in the sixth. When the team is scuffling like it is
now, it makes every mistake tougher to take.''

   LOS ANGELES _ Hale Irwin, who to members of the media is human
kikuyu, actually did all of us a favor on a hot and stuffy Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   He made sure there wasn't a hot and stuffy Monday.

<P>
   The United States Senior Open Golf Championship of 1998 at the

49ERS' OFFENSIVE LINE SHOWING PROMISE 
BY IRA MILLER
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   STOCKTON, Calif. _It's a sure sign summer is here: There's
serious concern about the state of the 49ers' offensive line. It's
an area the team neglected for years, getting by largely with late
draft choices and free agents, and putting the line together has
become an annual adventure in recent seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But one week into training camp, the reviews are good. Derrick
Deese has adapted at right tackle, Harris Barton is well along
toward a successful comeback, the depth looks decent and coach
Steve Mariucci says his concerns are easing a little.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ought to be as good or better than last year, provided we
stay healthy,'' Mariucci said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Bobb McKittrick, the offensive line coach, judged the first week
of practice as ``a good one,'' saying it went about the way he
hoped. Said McKittrick: ``I didn't want anyone to be just horrible,
lay an egg, and nobody did.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers' line remains a work in progress. Right guard Kevin
Gogan hasn't practiced because of a hamstring problem, although
he's penciled in to begin work Tuesday. Left tackle Jamie Brown has
missed some time because of a groin problem.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, things look more promising than they did the past
two years, when the 49ers were forced to scramble and begin the
season with a starting offensive lineman who had been out of work
just a few days before the opening game. In 1996, they signed Steve
Wallace to play left tackle and in 1997 they brought back Jesse
Sapolu to play center.
</P>
<P>
   For 1998, however, it looks like all the linemen the team might
need already are here.
</P>
<P>
   There are four main reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Deese, a guard moved to left tackle in an in-season emergency
move last year, has had time to settle in at right tackle. This
year, he had the offseason to bulk up for tackle, adding about
seven pounds and also working on his skills at that position.
</P>
<P>
   McKittrick believes the feisty Deese will be the team's most
improved player _ and he didn't play badly last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I'm not a 6-7, 320-pound tackle,'' said Deese,
who's actually 6-3 and 292. ``You know what, I'll go out and fight
for you and do what I can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Barton appears to be showing little effect from the four knee
operations he endured last year, and his return is a huge boost for
the depth of the line. Mariucci said he was amazed at the way
Barton has been scampering around athletically, just as he used to
do. A longtime starting tackle, Barton is now working on the
inside.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Fiore, who has been in the NFL for two years without
getting into a game, has made it back from his own knee surgery a
year ago and shown the coaches enough that he is listed as the top
backup at tackle. And Tim Hanshaw, who was victimized last season
in an ill-fated attempt to make him a tackle, shows signs he might
be able to make it as a guard.
</P>
<P>
   Hanshaw has been filling in for Gogan in practice, although
Mariucci says Barton, who has been working mostly at center, would
be his first backup guard. McKittrick says Hanshaw looks better
than he did in his three previous seasons with the 49ers, which
isn't really saying much. More to the point, McKittrick said, ``He
looks like an NFL football player. He knows what he's doing, and he
does it with intensity. He's a much better pass protector inside
than outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers also are developing three rookie linemen they drafted.
Second-round pick Jeremy Newberry, a guard/center, who underwent
offseason knee surgery, could be healthy by mid-season. Third-round
pick Chris Ruhman, a tackle, clearly needs more work on pass
blocking, especially on the right side; little is expected of him
anytime soon. Mariucci said yesterday that fifth-rounder Phil
Ostrowski was ``coming around pretty good.''
</P>
<P>
   If everything works right _ a big if _ this could actually wind
up being a pretty good area for the 49ers. But Brown, the
first-year starter at left tackle, has to prove he can hold down a
job, and Barton, Fiore and Hanshaw must continue to progress. Among
other things, the depth that would provide would enable the 49ers
to bring their rookie linemen along slowly.
</P>
<P>
   Not since 1991-92 have the 49ers started the same offensive line
two years in a row.

<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators from General Motors and the United
Automobile Workers union held marathon talks until shortly after
midnight on Monday morning to settle strikes at two GM parts
factories here, struggling over a few final details of the
company's future investments in the factories.
</P>
<P>
   Bargainers took a break only to watch the arrival Sunday
afternoon of 18 flat-bed trucks at one of the factories. As more
than 100 striking workers cheered and waved green strike placards,
the trucks brought back parts-making equipment that GM had removed
from an auto body parts factory here over Memorial Day weekend,
triggering the strikes.
</P>
<P>
   Several people involved in the talks said late Sunday night that
a deal was fairly likely on Monday or Tuesday. Talks recessed
shortly after midnight at both struck factories and at three other
factories where the UAW has threatened strikes.
</P>
<P>
   While GM has wanted settlements at the three other factories,
Richard Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said
just after midnight that the union would still prefer to conclude
the strikes here first. He also warned that ``there are still
significant issues that have to be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   The other three factories at which GM wants settlements are an
assembly plant here and parts factories in Indianapolis and Dayton,
Ohio. Workers have also threatened strikes in recent days at a
sport utility vehicle factory in Janesville, Wis., and at the
Saturn factory in Spring Hill, Tenn., but GM has viewed walkouts at
those factories as less likely and did not try to settle them on
Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the issues in the strikes here have already been
settled, UAW officials said, including questions of health and
safety and the minimum number of parts that some workers have to
produce each day. The UAW wants GM to promise that it will install
the latest equipment here, and that it will not sell or close
either factory.
</P>
<P>
   All but two of 29 GM assembly plants in North America have
closed for lack of parts from the struck factories here, and more
than 100 GM parts factories have also shut down partly or entirely
because the assembly plants are closed. GM has temporarily laid off
192,000 workers, braking growth in the entire American economy this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   GM abruptly agreed Saturday evening to return dies used in
making parts, and the UAW agreed to have up to 160 workers cross
picket lines to clean the dies, make any needed repairs and install
them in huge mechanical presses.
</P>
<P>
   Norwood Jewell, chairman at the UAW unit at one of the struck
factories here, said Sunday that the workers would actually run the
presses and produce a few parts to make sure that the dies were
functioning properly, but would return then to the picket lines if
a settlement still had not been reached.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides have been under pressure to settle the strikes. GM
dealerships are running short of popular pickup trucks and sport
utility vehicles, raising the risk that customers might start
shopping elsewhere and never return.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Standard and Poor's warned last week that it might start a
formal review of GM's credit rating, and any reduction in that
credit rating would raise the company's borrowing costs and make it
more expensive for GM to offer auto loans. The duration of the
strikes here has also put in danger GM's schedule for the
introduction of 1999 models, including a new line of highly
profitable, full-sized pickup trucks.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW has been alarmed by a federal lawsuit that GM filed and
by arbitration hearings that ended here on Saturday evening. In the
lawsuit and in arbitration, GM has contended that the strikes here
violate its national agreement with the UAW, and has sought rulings
that would limit the UAW's ability to stage crippling,
factory-level strikes in the future. GM would likely withdraw its
lawsuit and arbitration grievance if a settlement is reached here.
</P>
<P>
   The national agreement allows strikes over assembly line speed
increases, subcontracting and health and safety grievances. The UAW
has raised all of these issues in the strike but its main demand
has been that GM invest in more modern equipment for the factories
here, even though the factories have high costs and low
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   A UAW official who insisted on anonymity acknowledged in an
interview Sunday that some of these same investment issues were now
among the final sticking points, but refused to provide details,
saying, ``I can't say that because we can't strike over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts have been calling for GM to use the strikes
as an excuse to close inefficient factories and stop production of
money-losing car models like the Buick Riviera.
</P>
<P>
   But while GM has threatened publicly to do both, Richard
Shoemaker, the UAW's vice president for GM issues, said at a news
conference on Saturday evening that GM had not mentioned to him any
plans to close factories. The UAW has expressed no objection to the
elimination of some models provided that the factories are
converted to other production instead of being closed.
</P>
<P>
   Each of the flat-bed trucks arriving here carried one to three
stamping dies. The dies resemble gigantic metal molds, a dozen feet
long and weighing almost 10 tons. The dies are used to stamp auto
body parts from galvanized steel sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The first die to return was for pickup truck hoods and had the
nickname ``Bob'' scrawled on the side with yellow chalk. After the
trucks had passed through the factory gates, the workers loudly
sang ``Solidarity Forever,'' the UAW's anthem.
</P>
<P>
   GM removed the dies over Memorial Day weekend for fear of a
strike by workers here angry about the company's decision last
spring to cancel plans to install the latest equipment here. But
the removal of the dies ended up triggering a walkout by the 3,400
workers here on June 5.
</P>
<P>
   Another 5,800 workers at a speedometer and spark plug factory
several miles away then went on strike on June 11, partly to show
support for the auto body parts workers and partly because of
worries that GM would continue to winnow their work force through
attrition while buying more parts from non-union outside suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   GM moved the dies over Memorial Day weekend to a stamping
factory in Mansfield, Ohio, but never used them there. Canadian
auto workers, who will be building the first of the new pickups,
declared that they would refuse to accept any parts from the moved
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials have also said that the dies were damaged
accidentally during the trip to Mansfield, but GM officials have
refused to confirm or deny this.
</P>
<P>
   For all their size and weight, stamping dies are remarkably
fragile, and will produce defective parts unless mounted with great
precision in huge mechanical presses. Striking workers here were
dismayed to see that some of the dies arriving here were stacked on
each other, which can cause damage.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Miller, a 49-year-old pipe fitter who has been working
with dies here for 31 years, said that it could take anywhere from
two days to two weeks to put the dies back in service, depending on
how much damage they have suffered. &QL;

AIR-BASE LAB TEAM TESTED FOR RADIATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BHAVNA MISTRY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EDWARDS AIR FORCE BASE, Calif. _ Air Force officials are testing
base workers for radiation after a small amount of radium
discovered in a recycling truck contaminated a base lab.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force officials don't believe there is any serious health
risk from the material discovered about two weeks ago, they said
Sunday. Nevertheless, two buildings were closed and tests were run
on the four people who handled the material, about one-half inch
wide and an inch long. There also was testing of several others in
the area when the radium was being examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``Urine samples of people who handled the material or entered
either building have been taken to determine if any ingestion
actually occurred,'' said Dennis Shoffner, spokesman for the base
in northern Los Angeles County. Results of the tests have not yet
been returned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Parts of the two buildings remain closed, although other
portions have been decontaminated and reopened. ``People have begun
to reoccupy those areas that have been determined safe,'' Shoffner
said.
</P>
<P>
   Radium, commonly used in cancer treatment, can be fatal to
humans in high concentrations and can lead to bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The source of the radium found at the base is still unknown. It
was discovered when a load of scrap metal that recycler Paul Ogden
brought to a Los Angeles recycling center set off radiation
sensors. Ogden believes he acquired the material when he made a
pickup at the base.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all the years I've handled material, I've never seen an
incident like this,'' said Ogden, a Mojave resident who has
recycling contracts with the Air Force base. ``It seems to be an
isolated thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ogden, in the recycling business for five years, drove the load
back to the base July 14 after the recycling center would not let
it in. He took it to the base, he said, rather than tear apart the
load piece by piece to find what set the sensors off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to do the responsible thing for my safety and the
safety of others,'' Ogden said.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the base, Air Force officials determined that the
radioactive source was the piece of metal in a 6-inch stainless
steel tube. They placed the potentially deadly material into a
pipe, along with brass shavings to keep it from moving. They sealed
the pipe with caps.
</P>
<P>
   It was transported to the base's hazardous material facility and
then taken to the base's bio-environmental safety lab where it was
examined.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an analysis sample was taken from the source, some of the
brass-filing packing material spilled,'' Shoffner said. ``This
material is thought to have rubbed off surface material from the
source tube, thus carrying a small amount of material.''
</P>
<P>
   An Air Force investigation team specializing in radiation
assessment has been on the base since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   It has not been determined if the material in fact originated at
the base, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   `We have no indication that it was ours to begin with,''
Shoffner said. ``It's a complete mystery.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the Air Force has permits to possess and use several
small, sealed sources of radioactive material for X-rays and
calibration of laboratory instruments, officials said the material
from Ogden's load does not appear to be in the same form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nothing that we use here,'' Shoffner said. ``We don't
have any record that we had it or that we used it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Baldenweg of the Radiologic Health Branch at the California
Department of Health Services inspected Ogden's business and found
no evidence that radioactive material had leaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had four people testing to see if there's any
contamination,'' Baldenweg said. ``There was no detection.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldenweg and several Air Force official also visited Ogden's
home.

   MASHANTUCKET PEQUOT RESERVATION, Conn. _ The 10th and final
round, as dramatic and stunningly savage as it was, would have made
a perfect climax to the movie Vinny Pazienza hopes to star in about
his miraculous comeback to the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Idle for more than eight months after losing a 12-round decision
to World Boxing Council International champion Herol Graham Dec. 6
in London, Pazienza made a triumphant return after a four-year
exile from Foxwoods Resort and Casino, where the Providence native
has reigned as one of the more popular draws, by scoring a 10-round
majority decision over tough super middleweight Glenwood ``The Real
Beast'' Brown at Fox Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``What the hell is it with me, making these guys rise to the
occasion?'' said Pazienza (42-7), who recovered from a jarring left
hook in the third that bloodied his nose and dropped him to a knee.
``Geez, he was supposed to be washed up. But he's a nice kid and
I'm kinda glad for him. Sunday was his (31st) birthday and at the
weigh-in, I said, `I like you Glenwood, but if I hurt you, stay in
your stool. Don't make me do it.' Then, during the fight, when he
gave me a head butt and gave a little cut in the eighth round, he
said in the ring, `Sorry, Vinny. I didn't mean that.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I said to myself, `This guy's all right.' So then in the 10th
round, we went at it. It was a great round. I can't wait to see the
replays.''
</P>
<P>
   Pazienza's trainer, Kevin Rooney, implored his fighter to box
Brown, but mindful of the fact that Brown had yet to be knocked
out, Pazienza emerged from his corner in the 10th with other ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just box,'' Rooney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin, I'm going to knock him out,'' Pazienza replied.
</P>
<P>
   Winless in his last four fights, Brown, from Willingboro, N.J.,
made what was his last appearance as a super middleweight his best
by withstanding a savage barrage from Pazienza in the 10th that was
reminiscent of ``Raging Bull.'' Only this time, Brown faced a
Raging Pazmanian Devil, who unloaded 113 punches and landed 66. In
all, Pazienza landed 280 of 596 punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I hit Vinny with that left hook in the third, I thought
it was all over,'' said Brown. ``But he showed what a great
champion he was by coming back. I hit him with some great shots,
too. But he took them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first of two tuneups Pazienza planned before an
anticipated December challenge against Charles Brewer for the
International Boxing Federation super middleweight title. Then,
it'll be off to Hollywood, where Pazienza hopes to star in a film
project based on his life and his comeback from neck and spinal
injuries suffered in a 1991 car accident.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a durable warrior,'' Pazienza said of Brown. ``I hit
hard, and I know I surprised him a couple of times, but man, he
just wouldn't go.''

N.Y. CITY POLICE OFFICER IS CRITICAL AFTER BEING SHOT IN HEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A New York City police officer was fighting for his
life after being shot in the head on Sunday night on Staten Island,
apparently by a 17-year-old parolee who was wanted for questioning
on a new murder charge, the authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   The officer, Gerard Carter, 28, was on a routine patrol of the
West Brighton Houses project when he was shot at 9:25 p.m. in front
of 810 Henderson Avenue, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said at a news
conference at St. Vincent's Hospital on Staten Island. He was
listed in critical condition, and was undergoing brain surgery with
his mother, ex-wife and girlfriend in close quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect, Shatiek Johnson, was paroled in April after serving
one and a half years for a 1996 manslaughter conviction, the police
said. He was arrested earlier this summer on a farebeating charge,
but somehow slipped through the parole system. He was most recently
wanted for questioning in the July 16 shooting death of Eric
Trotman, 20, on Staten Island, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night's incident was the most serious shooting of a New
York City police officer since May, when a police officer was
fatally shot in Brooklyn while trying to arrest a parolee.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that two officers had been shot, allegedly, by two
parolees in the last three months, Giuliani last night railed _
again _ against a parole system that he has long said needs to be
reformed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is another example of the parole system putting the lives
of police officers and other innocent citizens at risk,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Carter was sitting in a marked police van, in uniform and on
duty, when at least one shot pierced the front windshield, Valerie
St. Rose, a police spokeswoman, said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors reported hearing two quick shots that they said
sounded like discharges from a handgun. Then they saw the wounded
officer, face down, slumped over the steering wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as close to a cold-blooded act as I've seen in many
years,'' said First Deputy Police Commissioner Patrick Kelleher,
who joined Giuliani at the hospital on Sunday night. ``That a
police officer in uniform in a marked vehicle be appraoched at
point-blank range and shot is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   The officer's partner, Eric Storch, 29, was not wounded in the
shooting but was traumatized, said police spokesman Officer Dennis
Laffin. He was treated at and released from Bayley Seton Hospital,
said a spokeswoman there.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting occurred in a section of Staten Island that is
dominated by the sprawling West Brighton Houses housing projects.
There is a large courtyard in the middle of the projects, and that,
according to neighbors, was where the officer was shot on Sunday
night.
</P>
<P>
   The police are known to maintain a visible presence in the
projects, mainly to crack down on beer drinking and drug activity,
neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   Last night, Carter was driving on a pathway through the housing
development, with Storch at his side, the police said.
</P>
<P>
   They were seeking to question Johnson, who had missed a day of
community service _ his sentence after the farebeating arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The officer saw one and perhaps three people and slowed the van
to a stop, the police said. At the point, Johnson approached and
fired through windshield, hitting Carter in the temple.
</P>
<P>
   Storch returned the fire with one or two shots, both of which
missed their target.
</P>
<P>
   After the shots rang out, neighborhood children who were riding
bicycles past the van reported hearing Storch saying: ``Jerry,
Jerry, wake up! Stop playing! Yo Jerry, get up, get up!''
</P>
<P>
   The police then responded with breathtaking speed and urgency,
the neighbors said. And within minutes, it seemed, they had
blanketed the entire area with every imaginable police unit wearing
every imaginable uniform wielding every imaginable piece of
equipment, neighbors said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They came from every angel,'' said one woman who declined to
give her name. ``They came from all angles.''
</P>
<P>
   Late on Sunday night, the police were still frantically pursuing
Johnson, describing him as a black male between 5 feet 6 and 5 feet
8, with dreadlocks, wearing shorts and a multi-colored shirt. They
had even established checkpoints at all the Staten Island
crossings.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that they believed that Johnson was still in the
housing projects, and were preparing to conduct an apartment by
apartment search.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani praised Carter, who also has a six-year-old son, for
having a brief but impressive record on the force, saying that the
officer had made 76 arrests in five years, many of them felonies.
</P>
<P>
   The incident was the most serious shooting of a New York City
police officer since May, when an officer, Anthony Mosomillo, 36,
was fatally shot in Brooklyn while trying to arrest a parolee who
had missed a court date on a drug charge.

ANALYSIS: IMF FORMULAS COME WITH A HIGH COST 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Last summer, a little-noticed financial panic
rocked the small nation of Thailand. The International Monetary
Fund stepped in with emergency loans to straighten out what
President Clinton called ``a few small glitches in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   One year, $130 billion and three rescues later, the glitch has
grown into the Asian financial crisis, and the big question is
whether the IMF is curing or killing its patients.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF has ``brought the Indonesian economy to its knees,''
said Jeffrey Sachs, a prominent Harvard University economist.
``It's very hard to make an economy fall by 15 percent in a year.
It takes tremendous, tremendous mismanagement, in this case by the
fund.''
</P>
<P>
   But others, like David Hale, an economic strategist at Zurich
Kemper Investments, insist just as strongly that without the IMF,
``it could always have been worse.''
</P>
<P>
   Worse means not only greater suffering in the crisis countries,
but a global financial contagion that could engulf the developing
world and throttle one of the greatest runs of prosperity Americans
have ever enjoyed. Silicon Valley's high-tech sector is already
suffering a sharp drop in exports to Asia, serving as an early
warning of what could happen to other U.S. manufacturers if the
crisis spreads.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Whether the IMF, a multilateral institution that acts as the
world's lender of last resort, is doing the right thing may be the
highest-stakes question since the world's last financial cataclysm,
the Great Depression.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after the first IMF-led intervention into
Thailand's ``short-term liquidity crisis,'' the prognosis does not
look bright:
</P>
<P>
   -- Investor panic has hit Russia, which is now getting a new
$22.6 billion IMF-led loan. Pakistan's economy has weakened
dangerously, prompting high-level discussion of even greater IMF
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   -- Thailand and South Korea have sunk into severe recessions
despite IMF bailouts, with no recovery in sight. More than 2
million Thais are jobless, and the economy may contract by more
than 6 percent this year. Korean banks posted first-quarter losses
amounting to one-third of their capital.
</P>
<P>
   -- Indonesia's economy is collapsing despite IMF loans. The
rupiah is plummeting, 20 million are out of work and inflation will
hit 100 percent. Indonesians are suffering bigger economic losses
than Americans during the Depression.
</P>
<P>
   -- Japan, the world's second-largest economy, stands on the
brink of a dangerous deflation. Beset by deep banking and fiscal
problems, the economy is now contracting after seven years of
stagnation.
</P>
<P>
   -- China, ever the giant question mark, shows many symptoms of
the sickness that has waylaid its neighbors, including weak banks
and shaky state-directed companies.
</P>
<P>
   -- The IMF itself is running out of money. If another crisis
breaks out, the IMF would find itself in ``grave difficulties,''
said top IMF economist Stanley Fischer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly hard to say by what measure (the IMF rescue
plans) are working out well,'' said Brad Belt, director of
international finance for the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a nonpartisan public policy research
institution in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The Clinton administration is pushing hard for an additional
$18 billion U.S. contribution to the fund. The increase has won
overwhelming Senate approval, but House Majority Leader Dick Armey,
R-Texas, promised that it will be ``dead on takeoff.'' A bitter
fight has delayed the House vote until September.
</P>
<P>
   The holdup over the U.S. contribution hardly troubles the IMF's
critics, who argue that giving more money to the fund is like
dropping kerosene onto a forest fire.
</P>
<P>
   They say the bailouts have rescued foreign bankers who made
risky loans to Asia's once-lucrative emerging markets. That is not
only unfair but dangerous, they contend, because it encourages more
reckless lending.
</P>
<P>
   If creditors know they will get paid even if their borrowers
fail, they start making larger loans for riskier projects,
encouraging dangerous business expansions and sowing the seeds of
another collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Carnegie Mellon University economist Allan Meltzer argues that
the U.S. bailout of Mexico bondholders in 1995 presaged the Asian
meltdown, and the Asian bailouts will induce an even bigger and
more dangerous crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these so-called sophisticated, smart lenders knew the
amount of total debt outstanding'' by Korean conglomerates, Meltzer
said. Banks would never lend to households on such a basis, he
argues, but in Korea, ``they had no incentive to learn about it,
because they know that if the thing goes down, the IMF will bail
them out.''
</P>
<P>
   In Russia, said Sachs, some investors ``have been earning 100
percent per year returns investing in Russian T-bills, and we now,
without asking them to take any hit at all, have rushed in with
public funds to guarantee them a full repayment of all this money.
It's very bad public policy.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF loans are big enough to pay off some bad loans and bail out
banks, but they're too small to break a panic, Sachs argues. ``The
billions of dollars ended up in New York and London, and nothing
was accomplished,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's supporters concede that IMF loans can encourage
careless lending. They agree that it would be better to have more
private debt renegotiations like the agreement among foreign banks
to stretch out Korea's loans.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But the IMF has no authority to force countries _ much less
private creditors _ to do anything until a country asks for help,
supporters say. By that time, as in Korea, the country is on the
brink of default, and the chances of success are minimal.
</P>
<P>
   Defaults by private companies can be healthy because they rein
in reckless business expansions. But defaults by countries are
different. A sovereign default cuts a country off from
international credit markets, indiscriminately strangling not only
sick but healthy companies. It can set an economy back for years at
tremendous human cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do need to give (private) creditors a bigger hit,''
conceded Morris Goldstein, a senior analyst at the Institute for
International Economics. ``But the idea that we can simply do away
with the IMF and we could have done away with this crisis with
practically no money? That's fantasy land.''
</P>
<P>
   IMF supporters say that most investors have taken punishing
losses. ``The fact is that losses in these markets have been really
quite brutal,'' said Hale. ``Anybody who was invested in Russia in
the last year has lost a lot of money. The stock market went down
70 or 80 percent. . . . Do we have to go down 95 percent to make
the point?''
</P>
<P>
   Another wrongheaded IMF remedy, critics say, is its attempts to
halt currency free-falls by jacking up interest rates. All that
does is collapse the economy, hardly a way to bring back investors,
they argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Foreign investors have seen that crushingly high interest
rates bring on bankruptcies and economic contractions and therefore
don't lead to the boost in confidence that the IMF has been
counting on,'' Sachs said.
</P>
<P>
   A quick Indonesia default might have saved a lot of pain by
freezing all debts, critics say. Indonesia will probably default
anyway, Meltzer predicts. ``The economy is in tatters, but the
banks are going to get paid,'' he said. ``That's what they call a
success.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is patently absurd, IMF supporters counter, to blame the
IMF for Asia's financial meltdown. And that, they say, is more like
like blaming the firefighter for an arsonist's work.
</P>
<P>
   The Asian crisis grew from decades of economic mismanagement,
magnified by sweeping changes in the world economy, where billions
of dollars of investor capital can move in and out of overseas
markets with the click of a mouse.
</P>
<P>
   These were economies addled by lax banks, state-fattened
corporations and other hallmarks of Asia's ``crony capitalism.''
When market sentiment changed, collapse came quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, high interest rates slow growth, supporters say, but
the alternative is to let currencies collapse. In countries that
have huge short-term loans denominated in foreign currencies, that
quickly translates into widespread bankruptcies, as even healthy
companies find they can no longer pay their loans and can no longer
even import the raw materials they need. As import prices soar, so
does inflation.
</P>
<P>
   A quick, temporary spike in interest rates is the only way to
stop a disastrous currency slide. Once a currency has stabilized,
interest rates can fall. But the choice _ high interest rates or a
plummeting currency _ is always between the lesser of two evils.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an illusion to imagine that there is some painless way
of restoring confidence and stability once a country has lost its
reserves and is in a crisis,'' said the IMF's Fischer in an article
defending the fund's actions. ``It is also an illusion to imagine
that by keeping interest rates low, East Asian countries could have
avoided the difficult tasks and costs of financial and corporate
restructuring, as the case of Japan illustrates.''
</P>
<P>
   In any event, IMF supporters say, the centerpiece of the fund's
remedy is not high interest rates, but sweeping structural reforms
designed to cleanse a country's banking and corporate sectors.
</P>
<P>
   These take time and lots of money, as Americans know from their
own S&AMP;L bailouts of the 1980s. Korea and Thailand have hardly begun
the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kinds of crises don't end quickly,'' said Goldstein.
``In the past, it usually takes two to three years before economic
growth recovers.''
</P>
<P>
   That the crisis has not ended _ and even shows many signs of
spreading _ hardly proves that IMF remedies have failed, supporters
argue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is that the United States and Europe are
continuing to expand,'' said Albert Fischlow, an international
economist at the Council on Foreign Relations. ``The effects of the
crisis have not engulfed Latin America or other areas of the
developing world, and the prospect for recovery does exist in
Thailand and Korea.''

NEW TV SERIES FOR FALL _ DAVIS/LUNGREN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARLA MARINUCCI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ &LR;   &LR; The California governor's race _ all but
ignored by TV news this spring in favor of trash and flash _ could
become the most visible in the nation under an experimental program
to broadcast weekly prime-time debates statewide this fall.
</P>
<P>
   The project of the Alliance for Better Campaigns, which is
co-chaired nationally by veteran newscaster Walter Cronkite and
former Washington Post reporter Paul Taylor, has won the backing of
four of the state's major network affiliates: San Francisco's KRON,
Sacramento's KCRA, Los Angeles' KCBS and KGTV in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The stations, in a plan agreed to in principle by the
candidates, will allow Democratic Lt. Gov. Gray Davis and
Republican state Attorney General Dan Lungren to face off in a
series of live, five-minute debates, broadcast weekly on evening
newscasts for eight weeks preceding the Nov. 3 election.
</P>
<P>
   The project would mark the first time in memory that regular
airtime has been offered to political candidates _ particularly
during prime-time news shows, Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   The format, while still taking shape, is designed to present
unscripted exchanges, `` `Nightline' or `Crossfire' style,'' he
said. ``You want it to be informative; you also want it to be
engaging.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes as Lungren and Davis prepare to meet
Friday at 6 p.m. in San Diego for the first of what is expected to
be five hourlong gubernatorial debates.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together, the debates could make the 1998 gubernatorial
race the most televised statewide campaign debate series in
California history, political insiders said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anything would compare in the modern era,'' said
Dave Puglia, campaign adviser to Lungren.
</P>
<P>
   The attempt to improve campaign coverage follows widespread
criticism of broadcast journalism's role in reporting the June 2
primary. In Southern California, particularly, many stations
slotted only minimal coverage of political topics in favor of
flashier news and crime stories.
</P>
<P>
   The reporting vacuum resulted in what many analysts called a
``virtual campaign,'' composed almost entirely of television
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you really see is a campaign that promises voters a much
greater level of context and information about the candidates'
character, background, experience and vision,'' said Puglia.
``California's broadcasters are recognizing they do have a public
service responsibility as it relates to political campaigns.
There's a lot of reason to be very encouraged by that.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the benefits to political campaigns of boosting
televised exchanges between the gubernatorial candidates could be
huge in a state where the cost of getting messages to 14.6 million
registered voters is astronomical, said Dan Schnur, the
high-profile GOP consultant who is a co-director of the state
project, along with Democratic consultant Michael Reese.
</P>
<P>
   But broadcasters also see benefits. ``Any opportunity to put the
issues in front of the voters is one that we're happy to take,''
said KRON News Director Dan Rosenheim. ``And the idea of
substantive _ although short _ minidebates that complement a longer
debate is really exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   Schnur said that now that KRON, the NBC affiliate, has joined
with other network affiliates in California's major markets to
broadcast the minidebates live, TV stations in secondary markets
are clamoring to broadcast them on a taped basis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This means that California voters can turn on their TV set on
a particular day, at a particular time, and know they will see
substantive discussion between two candidates,'' Schnur said. ``We
believe there is an audience out there. . . . This is an
opportunity to build (it).'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   There are still some details _ and a few problems _ to be worked
out, campaign managers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a laudable idea . . . and we've obviously been supportive
of the idea to get increased television coverage,'' said Garry
South, campaign adviser to Davis. ``But, in all honesty, I'm not
willing to give a blank check to these stations.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants to see ``ground rules established and also
agreed upon by the two campaigns.''
</P>
<P>
   South said the short time span is another concern. ``Five
minutes is more time than a station spends on politics in any one
newscast _ but it's not a long time if you're discussing a
complicated issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers said they will do everything possible to make those
minutes count and give both campaigns an active role.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public deserves campaigns that unfold on television in
ways that take the conversation beyond attack ads and sound
bites,'' said Taylor, who co-chairs the Alliance for Better
Campaigns under the auspice of the Annenberg Center for
Communication at the University of Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you think of politics as a product, a show that comes
around every couple of years, it is not a very good show,'' said
Taylor. ``So, let's see if we can change the product.
</P>
<P>
   ``After all,'' he said, ``this is merely about (voters')
futures, their water, their health care and their kids.''

   1. PROTECTING THE WORLD'S REFUGEES Millions flee persecution and
war within their borders. The international community should be
ready to act when states fail to protect their own. By Roberta
Cohen and Francis M. Deng. From Foreign Affairs Magazine. 1,500
words.
_______________________________________________________________ 2.
MY BORIS To American eyes, Boris Yeltsin, Russia's volatile
president, seems increasingly unmoored from reality. Michael
Specter, a New York Times correspondent who spent four years in
Moscow, offers an explanation of the warring impulses behind
Yeltsin's bluster. From The New York Times Magazine. 2,500 words.
3. A PLEA NOT TO REAWAKEN THE NUCLEAR ARMS RACE Today it is just as
true that if nuclear war, on any scale, were ever to be unleashed,
it would threaten the very existence of life on earth. It is
particularly important to keep this in mind in the wake of the
nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. What is not being discussed by
the established nuclear powers today is that the process of nuclear
disarmament has been stalled for several years now; it is just
marking time. By Mikhail Gorbachev. 1,000 words. 4. WORLD CRIMINAL
COURT NEEDS BETTER PREPARATION The notion of the ``international
community'' is often invoked nowadays. In recent years, it has
gathered more substance than ever before, with new treaties and
commitments. But it is still a misty idea groping for the
foundations of a global rule of law. By Flora Lewis. 1,000 words.
5. BUILDING THE NEW BERLIN The centre of Berlin today is the
largest construction site in Europe, a high-tech endeavour that is
pharaonic in scale. Berlin's dream is to be the ``Gateway to the
East,'' an affluent, service-oriented capital of Europe's richest
country and a beacon of hope to its neighbours in the East, where
prosperity remains elusive. Yet the early results, where visible,
hint at spectacular failure. By Gary Wolf. Wired magazine. 2,000
words. 6. THE IDEA OF CHANGING 'OIL PIPELINES FOR PEACE' GATHERS
</P>
<P>
   MOMENTUM IN THE CAUCASUS In the heart of Georgia, in the verdant
mountainous province of Sachker, 176 km. west of the capital
Tbilisi, excavators, bulldozers and cranes operated by Indian,
Pakistani and Georgian labourers are busy at work on the Baku-Supsa
oil pipeline. Early next year, the pipeline will carry some of the
oil extracted from the Caspian Sea to the Black Sea terminal at
Supsa. Georgia, which possesses no natural resources and has been
devastated by a civil war, believes its salvation lies in its role
as a gateway through which the wealth of the Caspian Sea can be
channelled westwards. By Marie Jego. Le Monde. (English translation
available.) 1,500 words.

A SURVEY OF ANCIENT MARS Scientists have seen lots of big smooth
rocks on the surface of Mars, remnants of catastrophic flooding in
the distant past. But where did all that water go? New images from
Mars Global Surveyor hint at some answers. By Jeffrey Winters. From
Discover magazine. 1,600 words + photos.
_______________________________________________________________ 8.
FROM NEW SCIENTIST MAGAZINE: A. Splashdown : Look at all those
swirling patterns in a Pollock painting. Richard Taylor asks
whether they're satisfying more than your aesthetic self. B. Washed
Up : A clean beach is a lifeless one, says Fred Pearce, who has
found that seaweed, sewage and woodlice are encouraging sights. C.
Mean Machines : This is a story about big boys and their hot,
explosive toys. In garages and sheds all over the world, they're

ultimate summer is on its way. The Earth will be baked by a searing
heat and the oceans will boil away. It's going to be hotter than
hell. Charles Seife is very grateful that he won't be there. 9. ARE
U.S. TROOPS NEEDED IN JAPAN? Americans see the presence of U.S.
troops in Japan as a gracious favour. It's time for the Americans
to go home, writes Morihiro Hosokawa. From Foreign Affairs
magazine. 1,500 words. 10. MATERIALS : SPECIAL DELIVERY One of the
most effective ways of administering a drug is to pack it up in a
form that can be transported around the body, and to release it
exactly when and where it is needed. A promising new approach seems
to overcome some of the problems encountered. By Helen Phillips.

PEOPLE, PEOPLE! THERE'S MORE TO '50S THAN DRIVE-INS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The American people continue to astonish and perplex me. In
fact, I'm this close to admitting I have no clue what, if anything,
makes them tick. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the latest outrage: To decide what to put on upcoming
commemorative stamps, the U.S. Postal Service asked people to vote
on the most memorable events and people of the 1950s and 1960s.
There were 30 choices for each decade. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the top of the '50s winners list were drive-in movies, the
``I Love Lucy'' TV series and ``The Cat in the Hat'' by Dr. Seuss.
For the '60s, the top finishers were the first moon walk, the first
Super Bowl and the peace symbol. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I'm not saying I don't remember all that stuff. I certainly do.
But you simply can't convince me that drive-in movies were the most
significant achievement of the '50s or that the start of the annual
Super Bowl deserves such prominence in the '60s. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As my 8th grade English teacher, Ruth Wilson, used to say in the
1950s when she was moved to slack-jawed awe by the obtuseness of
her students, ``People, people, people!'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heck, I'd have voted for Ruth Wilson her own prim self before
I'd have voted for ``The Cat in the Hat.'' At least Miss Wilson
knew how to diagram a sentence. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You hardly have to break open the '50s before you find some
simply amazing happenings that I'd love to see on a stamp long
before drive-in movies. For instance, the day I turned five years
old, Jan. 18, 1950, the U.S. Senate repealed the federal tax on
oleomargarine despite pressure from dairy groups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The county in which I lived at the time in northern Illinois
was, it was said, the largest dairy-producing county in the
country. We had cows everywhere. Some of my best friends were
cows. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Don't imagine for a minute that lifting the tax on oleo didn't
create quite a stir. Why, even as I entered Mrs. Dobbs'
kindergarten class that fall my classmates and I were still
carrying on about it. Probably. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just a few days later in 1950, Alger Hiss was found guilty of
perjury. And ever since then our lives have been filled with hot
debate over whether Hiss was really a traitor. I have had Hiss on
my mind for more than 48 years, and would love to see his trial
commemorated on a stamp. Maybe that would allow us now to give him
the nickname I've always thought he should have had _ Boo. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of gross oversights, the Korean War came in 15th among
stamp voters for the 1950s, and because the top 15 vote getters
will be commemorated on stamps, it's a winner. But the Cold War
lost. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   People, people, people: Without the Cold War my grade-school
friends and I would not have learned how to hide under our desks so
we could survive a nuclear strike. I don't know what those tough
little desks were made of, but I was certain that mine would
protect me from enemy A-bombs. I'd buy a whole roll of stamps
showing kids hiding under school desks in bomb drills. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As for the 1960s, I admit the moon walk was a big deal. But I've
always been a little miffed at its timing. It happened the same
week that Ted Kennedy drove his car off the Dike Bridge on
Chappaquiddick Island, meaning Mary Jo Kopechne's death and
Kennedy's labyrinthine denials of responsibility didn't get the
media coverage they deserved. Why can't NASA plan better than
that? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I myself, in the '60s, was celebrating graduation first from
high school and then college, after which I degenerated into
journalism. And after all these years I finally know why: So that
now and then I can hold American citizens up to the ridicule they
deserve. People, people, people. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

<P>
   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, July 26, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeted Monday. .
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH-MURDER-REVIEW _ There are sharp regional differences in
homicide, with the South having by far the highest murder rate,
almost double that of the Northeast, a divergence that has
persisted for as long as records have been kept, starting in the
19th century. By Fox Butterfield. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   JOURNALISTS-REVIEW _ Businesses, feeling the pressure of
stepped-up financial reporting over the last decade, are becoming
bolder about attacking journalists, both publicly and with
lawsuits. And reporters and editors, thrust into the spotlight, are
forced to articulate ethical distinctions that may not be easy to
defend. By Felicity Barringer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-COUPS-REVIEW _ In the 12 months since the Thai baht fell
against the United States dollar and touched off currency
devaluations and a slump in every major East Asian country, at
least one of the region's stubborn old ghosts has been exorcised.
There have been no military coups. By Joseph Kahn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   GM-REVIEW _ A quarter-century of shrinking market share and
periodic financial crises at GM have fed a popular image of the
auto maker as being a shadow of its former self. Yet GM remains the
world's largest company in sales and share of global economic
output, and is immense by any standard. By Keith Bradsher. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-CULTURE-REVIEW _ More and more these days, there is
talk about the cultural chasm between the military and the rest of
society, what most people consider the ``real world.'' Some people
want to narrow that divide, as though it is something new, and bad.
By David Stout. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ADVOCACY-GROUPS-REVIEW _ From both the left and right of the
political spectrum come dark assessments and dire warnings from
advocacy groups about the current racial, moral, financial or
social climate even as the country enjoys peace and prosperity and
is arguably less sexist, less racist, less dangerous, less polluted
and less regulated by government than it has been in decades _ and
perhaps, ever. By Steven A. Holmes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SOCIAL-SECURITY-REVIEW _ For many years, Social Security cards
carried an admonition that they were to be used ``for Social
Security and tax purposes _ not for identification.'' That
assurance rings hollow today. Congress has authorized so many uses
of the nine-digit number, and Americans use it for so many
unauthorized purposes, that it has become the closest thing to a
national identifier. By Robert Pear. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MEDICAL-PRIVACY-REVIEW _ The Clinton administration, following a
1996 congressional mandate, is considering assigning every American
a health-care identification number that could be used to create a
giant electronic data base capable of tracking everyone's medical
records from cradle to grave. Suddenly, the public is up in arms
about medical privacy. By Sheryl Gay Stolberg. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NY-DRUGS-TREATMENT-REVIEW _ Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's
pronouncement last week that New York City should abolish methadone
treatment for heroin addicts by the year 2000 drew fire from many
drug abuse experts. They insisted that methadone is the best tool
they have to help addicts reduce heroin use, stay out of jail and
get back to work. By Denise Grady. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ARTS-ENDOW-REVIEW _ For an agency that spends less than .01
percent of the federal budget, the National Endowment for the Arts
gets a lot of attention from Congress, particularly negative
attacks from conservatives. But last week the House of
Representatives overwhelmingly approved the agency's money for next
year. By Irvin Molotsky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   DUMB-ACCIDENTS-REVIEW (Undated) _ The noble idea of rescue comes
alive in news stories about brave men and women risking life and
limb to snatch desperate adventurers from the jaws of death on
treacherous summits or in raging waters. But the day-to-day reality
of an emergency worker's life often involves victims who, more than
anything, need a little common sense. By Andrea Kannapell.
</P>
<P>
   NIGERIA-REVIEW (Lagos) _ Burying Abiola: One false step betrays
Nigeria's desperation. A first-hand account. By Roger Cohen.
</P>
<P>

(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, July BURYING ABIOLA: ONE FALSE STEP BETRAYS NIGERIA's DESPERATION  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (duplication warning: also sent with `i' code)  
 (bl)  
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ The day, sultry beneath low clouds, had long
been pregnant with violence. Gathered within the high walls of the
mansion, the crowd heaved this way and that, screaming abuse at the
soldiers outside, waiting for the body. In their eyes lay anger and
anguish and a frenzied desperation.
</P>
<P>
   Watching from a terrace in the house, I imagined the spark: a
soldier's shot, a knife drawn, a woman crushed against a wall and
this gathering would give way to killing. Bloodshed was coming as
surely as the day's heat was mounting. But no. Through some
unfathomable chemistry, a path was carved through the throng for
the corpse of Moshood K.O. Abiola, the Nigerian opposition leader
who died this month in detention.
</P>
<P>
   An unspoken language existed then, one inaudible to me. Nigeria,
cobbled together on a whim by a British colonizer in 1914, an
impossible amalgam of Islam, Christianity and other religions, land
of more than 200 ethnic groups and at least three unrelated
languages, was bound to disintegrate one day under the weight of
its contradictions. Or was it, I wondered, if this sense of
inevitable danger could so subside into order?
</P>
<P>
   Abruptly, the body that had carried the long-frustrated
democratic hopes of Africa's most populous nation appeared. Denied
his electoral victory in 1993 by the army, imprisoned in 1994, held
in solitary confinement, the man died in the company of U.S.
officials on the eve of a promised release that America had done
little to hasten.
</P>
<P>
   The body was wrapped in white cloth from head to foot, as Muslim
tradition requires. Abiola's many wives sobbed and wailed; his son,
Kola, and other male members of the family carried the body.
``Stop! Stop!'' somebody screamed, ``They are not ready.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They will never be ready,'' his son shouted. ``We're going
out.''
</P>
<P>
   As the corpse was carried into the yard, the path was swallowed
up by the crowd. I was lifted off my feet by the surge. I glimpsed
smashed chairs, a shattered lamp with blood on it and the face of a
terrified woman. The body disappeared toward its grave under a palm
tree. African chants and Muslim prayer rose in a strange unison.
</P>
<P>
   A young man, dressed all in black, the outfit that day of
Abiola's most devoted followers, took my arm. He said he would push
me to the graveside. It seemed an impossible task. But with the
help of others like him, he guided me there. I saw the feverishly
shoveled red earth falling into the grave. And, at that moment,
with the faces fixed in a rictus of grief, I felt the hand in my
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   I looked around. It was the young man who had helped me who was
now trying to pick my pocket as Abiola was at last buried. He
withdrew his hand. We exchanged glances. Not a word was spoken. In
his face, pain and shame mingled.
</P>
<P>
   I could not get his face out of my mind. Or the smell of that
crowd, a smell of sweat, of labor, of grinding effort in the heat,
of thankless toil. So far from the air-conditioned rooms where
Western diplomats had told me of Abiola's checkered past, his sweet
deals with the army, his odd calls for reparations for the slave
trade and the political problems posed by his insistence that the
``mandate'' of 1993 was still valid.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats are paid, above all, to promote their nations'
interests. We journalists are paid, above all, to record what we
see. A tension between these visions is inevitable. I could not
help feeling that Abiola had become a kind of abstraction to
America and its companies, an irritant when set beside the
importance of Nigerian stability and the outstanding, almost
sulphur-free quality of Nigeria's abundant ``Bonny Light'' crude
oil.
</P>
<P>
   Abiola's road had been a circuitous one. Rising from abject
poverty to become an executive of ITT, he had worked closely with
military governments on several communications projects and been a
member of the conservative National Party of Nigeria in the 1980s.
Insistent, but unconfirmed, reports here suggest he also worked for
the CIA. In the 1990s he veered toward the progressive Social
Democratic Party and put the eradication of poverty at the center
of his populist message.
</P>
<P>
   But what else in calamitous, vibrant, desperate, corrupt and
captivating Nigeria could one be but a populist? In the end, Abiola
brought hope for the millions living in shanties without work, hope
to the youth who tried to pick my pocket.
</P>
<P>
   That, in substantial part, is why his message reached across the
country, over tribal and ethnic barriers, earning this man from the
Yoruba south enormous support in the mainly Hausa and Fulani north.
Nigerians, tired of being robbed by their military leaders,
believed that this rich man would give back to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most basic belief of Abiola was that others should not
have to go through the suffering he endured to get an education,''
his friend, a former finance minister, Onaolapo Soleye, told me.
``We were at Baptist school together and he always sang the hymn:
`And if I be lifted up from the earth, I will draw all men unto
me.'''
</P>
<P>
   I T will never be known what Abiola might have achieved for the
``giant of Africa,'' where perhaps 60 million people now live in
poverty. What is certain is that the man who usurped his place, the
late Gen. Sani Abacha, plundered Nigeria's material and human
resources.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian journalist Osita Nwajah last week called Abacha ``the
most recognizably evil Nigerian ever.'' But America held back from
oil sanctions, because, as one official explained, ``Oil is the
most fungible of commodities and it would have served no purpose.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps. But the rapaciousness of Abacha and the other generals
before him staggers the mind. And where lies the cause of this
readiness to steal by those who, in the words of a young man named
Olu Aki, ``control people but are controlled by nobody?''
</P>
<P>
   I have heard many answers. In this coup-ravaged country, time in
office may be brief, so Nigeria's ``big men'' make their fortunes
quickly. People will think them stupid if they fail to become
``big'' from power.
</P>
<P>
   The one answer I have not heard is that Africa's white rulers
long stole _ gold, minerals, oil, people. Perhaps their example
stuck.
</P>
<P>
   A few days after the funeral, I wandered into the Lagos slum of
Makoko, where perhaps 500,000 people live on a black lagoon that is
also an open sewer. I followed a youth to a home that was always
around the next corner.
</P>
<P>
   As we walked deeper into the slum, the raised wooden planks over
the stinking water became ever narrower and more unstable. The
water loomed, indescribable in its filth, and nausea and vertigo
swept over me. All Makoko seemed to sway in its Conradian horror. I
owed it to this kid to continue; I steadied myself. And I thought
that I understood more then of the desperation of the crowd at the
burial.
</P>
<P>
   I do not know if Abiola would have swept Makoko away and
provided decent housing. I do know that I wish I had not felt the
slithering hand in my pocket of the youth who helped me and needed
my help.

 (Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, July (ATTN: Alaska)  
 I'VE FALLEN AND I'M A REAL JERK  
 (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By ANDREA KANNAPELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The noble idea of rescue comes alive in news stories about brave
men and women risking life and limb to snatch desperate adventurers
from the jaws of death on treacherous summits or in raging waters.
The drama is compelling: Will they make it in time?
</P>
<P>
   But the day-to-day reality of an emergency worker's life often
involves victims who, more than anything, need a Saint Bernard with
a little cask of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Felony stupidity,'' Ken Goodwin, the assistant director of the
National Sheriff's Association, calls it.
</P>
<P>
   Take a recent day in Alaska, one of the more rescue-oriented
states. Because Alaska has vast airspace for military training, it
is home to the para-rescue team of the 210th Squadron of the Air
National Guard. There are only three such teams in the nation.
These troops can jump out of airplanes with scuba gear, mountain
climbing equipment or other paraphernalia to help floundering
victims unreachable by any other means. At a moment's notice, the
210th's team will head off for Mount McKinley or other exotic
locations to fulfill their heroic motto: ``That others may live.''
</P>
<P>
   This month, the team rushed into action in a small jet after the
pilot of a plane flying about 70 miles northwest of Anchorage
reported an SOS stamped out in the snow. The team found the SOS,
spotted its author and dropped him a two-way radio, said Capt. Mike
Haller, a spokesman for the rescuers. ``He said, `Uh, yeah, I need
to be rescued, but I don't want any help from the feds.''' Just
then, the team was diverted to another call and left the man to
ponder his options.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 miles away, a state trooper was watching three 20-ish
tourists traipsing across the mud flats of Turnagain Arm, named for
a navigational necessity discovered by Capt. James Cook, the 18th
century explorer. The tide there retreats, then returns with a
powerful rush. The hapless pedestrians apparently did not know that
the incoming tide turns the mud into a kind of quicksand that can
trap anyone in its path. ``It's a horrible way to die,'' Haller
said. Just a week earlier, a man had drowned there while canoeing
in a rough tide.
</P>
<P>
   So the rescue jet, flying at extremely low altitude to dodge the
heavy planes of the air corridor directly above Turnagain Arm,
dropped a message telling the tourists to stay put. A short time
later, a helicopter swooped in and scooped them up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They really had put a lot of people out, and put a lot of
people at risk,'' Captain Haller said. And they were apparently
delighted, he added. ``I had a local reporter call me later and say
they just didn't get it,'' he said. ``They thought it was really
cool having this air show drop in on them.''
</P>
<P>
   But back to Mr. Anti-Fed. The unit changed crews and returned to
the SOS site with a couple of state troopers aboard. ``Him, they
took to the Alaska Psychiatric Institute,'' Haller said.
``Apparently, he called the troopers back later and said, `I don't
want to be here.' To which, I guess, the answer was, `Tough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for those with poor judgment everywhere, rescuers like
the team at the 210th say they retain their good will. The Mountain
Rescue Association, an all-volunteer network of dozens of such
teams across the nation, resists pressure to charge people _ even
the most thoughtless _ for rescue services.
</P>
<P>
   ``What precedes an accident isn't our concern,'' said Commander
Mike Lapinski, a Coast Guard spokesman, though he acknowledged that
there might be a few people ``that we'd like to bring back here and
take out to the woodshed.''
</P>
<P>
   The commitment remains, even in the aftermath of tragedy. At
Denali National Park, which includes Mount McKinley, a rescuer died
this year, along with the climber he was trying to save. National
Park Service rangers try to keep from adding themselves to the toll
of the dead. ``There's only going to be one victim,'' said Daryl
Miller, the ranger who oversees rescues at Denali.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard lost three crew members last year in one of its
only recorded instances of rescue fatalities. Waves twice rolled
the rescue boat as it headed toward a sailboat whose mast had
broken in a storm. The Coast Guard spends $350 million a year to
answer 50,000 emergency calls, rescuing an average of more than a
dozen people a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on your valuing of human life,'' he said, ``there's
a great return on your investment.''

 THE NEA TRIES A LITTLE SELF-HELP  
 (The Week in Review)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For an agency that spends less than 0.01 percent of
the federal budget, the National Endowment for the Arts gets a lot
of attention from Congress, particularly negative attacks from
conservatives. But last week the House of Representatives
overwhelmingly approved the agency's money for next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the vote reflects that, with the implementation of
last year's reforms, members of the House are feeling more
comfortable with the NEA and its role in reaching out to
communities across the nation,'' said Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio,
who shepherded the spending bill. One reform required grant
applicants to provide precise information on projects.
</P>
<P>
   The House action was a turnabout. Many of the Republicans who
rode to office and helped take control of the House in 1994
campaigned on a promise to abolish the arts agency, charging that
it had given grants for obscene works like a crucifix in a
container of urine and homoerotic photos. The government, critics
said, had no business being in the arts. The Republicans succeeded
in cutting the agency's spending sharply, but not in eliminating
the agency.
</P>
<P>
   By a vote of 253-173, the House approved $98 million, with 58
Republicans crossing over to join 194 Democrats and one
independent. The margin was so surprisingly large that agency
officials, for the first time since cutbacks began, say they are
optimistic about increasing that amount next year. The local
citizens involved in these programs frequently are community
leaders who can get the ear of their members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   There were several reasons for the reversal. By largely cutting
back on huge grants to large institutions, the agency was able to
spread more of its money around. ``Some smaller and mid-size
organizations actually got more money last year,'' said Cherie
Simon, a spokeswoman for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Eugene Symphony in Oregon, for example, had its grant
increased from $10,000 in 1997 to $15,000 this year, while the
Teatro Avante in Florida went from $35,000 to $37,500. Though not
large amounts, the grants are important to small groups, which can
cite them in soliciting local contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Congress mandated the requirement that applicants describe their
arts project in greater detail to reduce the chances of grants
going astray and subsidizing, for instance, a performance artist
best known for smearing herself with chocolate, as it once did.

 MEDICINE LAGS AGAINST ADDICTION

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's pronouncement last week that
New York City should abolish methadone treatment for heroin addicts
by the year 2000 drew fire from many drug-abuse experts. They
insist that methadone is the best tool they have to help addicts
reduce heroin use, stay out of jail and get back to work. In fact,
some said, they wished they had something like it to treat cocaine
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   That's some endorsement for a treatment that simply replaces one
addictive substance with another. Methadone, a morphine-related
drug taken orally to mute an addict's cravings as well as heroin's
effect, doesn't even help everyone who tries the treatment. And
while it helps others to kick heroin, it often doesn't wean them
off drugs completely.
</P>
<P>
   Why, at a time of impressive biomedical progress, is this
30-year-old treatment the best weapon medicine has to offer against
addiction?
</P>
<P>
   The question isn't academic, given the toll that addiction takes
on society. The National Institute on Drug Abuse estimates that
there are 4 million drug addicts in the United States, 2 million to
3 million of whom are hooked on cocaine. Another 800,000 are heroin
addicts. Millions more, though not addicted, use illegal drugs.
</P>
<P>
   According to a recent report by the General Accounting Office,
the government will spend $3.2 billion in 1998 to treat addicts.
Other costs, for prevention, drug-related crime and lost
productivity, total more than $60 billion a year.
</P>
<P>
   But there has been a notable lack of progress in developing new
treatments for addiction, and a big reason is money, acknowledges
Dr. Alan Leshner, director of the institute on drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of it has to do with the fact that the pharmaceutical
industry has not seen the treatment of drug addiction as a viable
market, until recently,'' he said. It can cost $200 million to $400
million to develop a new drug, he said _ the type of outlay that
drug companies worry won't be recovered from a market of addicts,
who are typically poor and dependent on Medicaid, the federal
insurance program, which limits payments. And there is still ``a
terrible stigma around addiction,'' Leshner added.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some companies didn't want to be associated with it,''
he said. ``Many still don't want to get into this business.''
</P>
<P>
   But things have begun to change. In the past decade, Leshner
said, research in neurobiology has identified structures in the
brain that might be targets for anti-addiction drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have come to understand how every major drug of abuse works
in the brain,'' he said. ``We've identified receptors in the brain
and cloned them. We know the circuits in the brain that they
activate and we know some of the common elements that may relate to
the essence of addiction.''
</P>
<P>
   Some small drug companies have become interested, both as a
result of such advances and because, since the early 1990s, the
institute on drug abuse has been collaborating with industry,
spending $100 million a year to help test new drugs to treat
addiction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the next few years you'll see additional medications come
out, not only for heroin, but for cocaine and amphetamine addiction
as well,'' Leshner said. For instance, more than 30 compounds, as
well as a vaccine, are being studied as possible weapons against
cocaine addiction. ``It's a top priority because we have nothing
for overdose or addiction to cocaine,'' Leshner said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Bigelow, a professor in the department of psychiatry
and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins Medical School in
Baltimore, said the antidepressant drug Prozac and related drugs
were also being studied to determine whether they might help
relieve cocaine addiction.
</P>
<P>
   But Bigelow added a note of caution. ``A lot of things have been
studied for cocaine, and nothing has yet been identified that's
clearly effective,'' he said. ``It has been a real frustration.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the research, Bigelow said, has focused on dopamine, a
brain chemical that plays an important role in movement, thought,
emotion and addiction. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter, a molecule
released by one brain cell to signal another. Many drugs of abuse,
including cocaine, amphetamines, opiates, marijuana and nicotine,
act on a dopamine system that runs along the base of the brain.
Activating that system by taking drugs can provoke feelings of
intense pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Bigelow said there was a potential problem with drugs that
target the dopamine system. ``It might be the final common pathway
for all kinds of rewarding things, food and sex and the joys of
music and art,'' he said. ``So it's probably not a pathway we want
to eliminate. We need to find a way to block cocaine and let people
enjoy other rewards.''
</P>
<P>
   And even if the action of cocaine can be blocked so that people
no longer get high from it, that may not take care of the cravings
that former users feel, often for many years even after they have
quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that makes addiction so difficult is that there is a
big learning basis, and we don't have any way of making it go
away,'' Bigelow said. ``People learn to get high by using drugs,
and they never forget the experience. It's a burden that addicts
carry for life.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that's one of the strongest arguments for prevention,
and for avoiding even experimental use,'' he said, ``because you
risk having experiences that you don't forget and that continue to
control and manipulate you in ways you do not want.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The coupons arrived by the handful when Janlori
Goldman was pregnant with her daughter, and she couldn't figure out
how the companies knew she was expecting. There were coupons for
parenting magazines, baby announcements, diapers and children's
book clubs. ``I started to wonder,'' she said. ``Where are they
getting this information? Is the hospital selling it? Is my doctor
making it available?''
</P>
<P>
   She never got an answer, but to Ms. Goldman, the questions were
of more than passing interest. As the founder of the Health Privacy
Project at Georgetown University, her goal is to raise the public's
awareness about the erosion of medical privacy. It has been an
uphill battle. ``Privacy,'' Ms. Goldman said, ``has not always been
a top-line issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Then came the news last week that the Clinton administration,
following a 1996 congressional mandate, is considering assigning
every American a health-care identification number that could be
used to create a giant electronic data base capable of tracking
everyone's medical records from cradle to grave.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the concept of medical privacy was thrust into the
public spotlight, with some members of Congress suggesting that the
1996 provision be repealed. Privacy experts like Ms. Goldman argue
that the ``unique health identifier'' would make an already bad
problem worse, marking the final step in what has been a long march
from privacy to a virtual information free-for-all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to think that medical information was a bunch of
intimacies that you gave to your doctor and your doctor went into a
back room and locked it up,'' said Lawrence Gostin, a Georgetown
University law professor who is chairman of a health privacy task
force convened by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
``That is a world that doesn't exist anymore. Now you have huge,
large-scale data bases in government, managed care organizations,
pharmacies.''
</P>
<P>
   Just how that information is used, and who has access to it, is
anybody's guess. Although about 35 states have enacted laws
intended to protect the privacy of patients, there are no federal
protections.
</P>
<P>
   While insurance companies and hospitals must develop privacy
policies to become accredited, there are no uniform standards, in
part because there is no societal consensus on what should, and
should not, be released without patient consent. In the wake of the
debate on the health care identifier, Republicans included privacy
provisions in health-care legislation passed by the House on Friday
that would actually nullify stronger state protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a legislative mandate or a social policy of what
is fair use,'' said Paul Clayton, director of clinical information
services at New York Presbyterian Hospital. ``So there is nothing
to regulate your pharmacy benefits manager from selling the fact
that you got pregnancy vitamins to the diaper service company.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for instance, CVS Corp., the national chain
of drugstores, acknowledged it had joined with pharmaceutical
manufacturers to help them market new medicines. The manufacturers
paid the chain to comb its prescription drug data banks for
patients with particular ailments; CVS then provided lists to a
direct marketing company that sent out letters promoting the
companies' drugs.
</P>
<P>
   CVS says it never sold information or released confidential
data. But when The Washington Post published an article about the
arrangement in February, the backlash was so swift that, within a
week, the program was abandoned. CVS spokeswoman Joan Kronin said,
``What we learned is that this is a very sensitive area.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive indeed. While patients don't mind sharing their
information for some health-care purposes, surveys find they don't
want it sold _ or used for research without their approval. A 1993
poll by Louis Harris &AMP; Associates, for instance, found that just 18
percent of respondents thought it acceptable for health records to
be used for research without patient consent; 60 percent found it
unacceptable for pharmacists to provide patient data to marketers.
And 96 percent wanted penalties for unauthorized disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the national penchant for privacy is competing with a huge
commercial appetite for patient data. On the Internet, Medical
Marketing Service Inc., an Illinois company, advertises its
``Patient Direct'' data base with more than 20 million American
households whose statistics can be sliced by age, gender, income,
educational status and health condition, from allergies (4,343,400
households) to yeast infections (1,364,800). The company says the
information is culled from voluntary consumer surveys.
</P>
<P>
   But Gostin, the Georgetown law professor, sees a ``gross privacy
violation'' nonetheless. ``It is true that people voluntarily fill
out the questionnaire,'' he said, ``but they couldn't dream of how
it is going to be used.''
</P>
<P>
   As the debate over how to protect privacy unfurls in Congress
and elsewhere, one of Ms. Goldman's aims is to figure out precisely
who is trading on medical information, and how. ``There is a lot we
don't know,'' she said. ``Our health care environment is changing
so rapidly, with the linking of doctors and health plans and drug
companies, the patient is completely left out of the loop.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For many years, Social Security cards carried an
admonition that they were to be used ``for Social Security and tax
purposes _ not for identification.''
</P>
<P>
   That assurance rings hollow today. Congress has authorized so
many uses of the nine-digit number, and Americans use it for so
many unauthorized purposes, that it has just about become a
national identifier.
</P>
<P>
   For the Clinton administration, which is considering assigning
all Americans a health-care identification number, the slow, steady
march of the Social Security number from secrecy to all-purpose
identifier may be a cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security
Act in 1935, it did not mention the use of Social Security numbers,
but it did authorize some type of record-keeping scheme. A year
later, the Treasury Department ordered the issuance of an account
number to each worker covered by Social Security to keep track of
earnings, collect payments and pay old-age benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, there were privacy concerns. ``There was a lot of
labor strife in the 1930s, a lot of employer opposition to unions,
and when Social Security numbers were first issued, there was
concern that they not be used for blacklisting union organizers,''
said Robert M. Ball, a former commissioner of Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   In 1943, an executive order required federal agencies to use
Social Security numbers whenever they set up new record systems to
identify individuals. But in the 1940s and 1950s, the government
made relatively little use of the numbers. That began to change in
1961, when the Civil Service Commission adopted Social Security
numbers as the official identifiers of federal employees. A year
later the IRS began using the numbers to identify taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   But use of the numbers really exploded with the computer
revolution of the 1960's. Federal, state and local governments,
banks, credit bureaus, hospitals and colleges found that the
numbers were handy for keeping track of people in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, Congress, concerned about welfare fraud and illegal
immigration, directed the Social Security Administration to issue
numbers to people who receive or apply for federal benefits, and to
legal aliens when they enter the country.
</P>
<P>
   And Congress has repeatedly authorized new uses of the number,
requiring people to disclose their number to get welfare, Medicaid,
food stamps, government loans and other federal benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, Congress authorized states to use Social Security
numbers in administering ``any tax, general public assistance,
driver's license or motor vehicle registration law.''
</P>
<P>
   Better enforcement of child-support orders was the goal in 1996.
Under that year's welfare law, states were required to record the
Social Security number of anyone seeking a marriage or occupational
license, as well as anyone named in a divorce decree or child
support order.
</P>
<P>
   By 1996, things had come full circle. In setting uniform
standards for driver's licenses, Congress decreed that federal
agencies may not accept licenses as proof of identity unless they
include a Social Security number.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the past few years the federal government and
private researchers have issued a number of reports depicting
dramatic improvement in the quality of life for America's black
population. High school completion rates have reached parity with
those of whites. Birth rates among single black women have hit a
40-year low. Homicide rates have declined to the levels of the
1960s. Poverty rates have dipped below 30 percent of black
households for the first time in the country's history. The home
ownership rate is up. The jobless rate is down.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody tell Julian Bond.
</P>
<P>
   In his recent keynote address at the convention of the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People, Bond, the
group's chairman, sketched a portrait of black America wildly at
odds with the research. ``For those Americans whose skins are black
or brown, their prospects are poorer and the gap is growing
wider,'' he said. ``The poverty rate has gone up while median
family income went down. Poverty for black and Hispanic senior
citizens went up, children who were poor got poorer, the numbers in
poverty doubling, higher here than anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond is not alone. From both the left and right of the political
spectrum come dark assessments and dire warnings from advocacy
groups about the current racial, moral, financial or social climate
even as the country enjoys peace and prosperity and is arguably
less sexist, less racist, less dangerous and less polluted than it
has been in decades _ and perhaps, ever.
</P>
<P>
   The distance between dispassionate analysis and the advocates'
oratory raises the question: How do groups that see their mission
as correcting injustice handle good times?
</P>
<P>
   ``Most advocacy groups exist to deal with problems,'' said
Charles Jones, professor emeritus of political science at the
University of Wisconsin. ``That's what they're designed for. That's
how they raise money. If the problems start to abate, they have a
hell of a time in energizing their folks, in raising money and in
trying to set policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Most advocacy groups _ from Greenpeace to the National Right to
Life Committee _ depend on grass-roots support and are highly
dependent on direct mail campaigns, raising money in bite-sized
morsels from individuals rather than drawing large chunks of
corporate dollars. To get the former, groups need to scare or anger
potential donors. ``There are two kinds of money,'' said Grover
Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, a conservative
anti-tax organization. ``There's sophisticated giving and there's
emotional giving where you get $50 checks from people who say, `Oh
my goodness, aren't things terrible!'''
</P>
<P>
   Many advocacy groups also feel that without their voices the
momentum of improvement might slow. ``We've had five years of
declines in teen birth rates, so we're always alert for signs of
complacency,'' said Sarah Brown, director of the Campaign to End
Teen Pregnancy. ``I haven't seen any signs yet. But just on the off
chance that the idea might flutter through someone's mind, we nail
it right away.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Brown and her counterparts see a sense of urgency even in
boom times. After all, they say, the income and wealth gap between
whites and blacks and Hispanics has not evaporated. Teen-age
pregnancy rates, though falling sharply, are still the highest in
the industrial world. Millions of Americans have no health
insurance. Taxes, especially the Social Security payroll tax,
remain high and, some say, unfair. Given that more than 80,000
complaints pour annually into the Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, no one will persuade civil rights advocates that
discrimination has disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many ways it's the classic argument over whether the glass
is half full or half empty,'' Bond said in an interview. ``For us,
it's half empty and we're determined to fill it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in pointing out problems these days the trick is not to come
off as a kvetch. ``The challenge for the advocacy groups is to
raise alarms without doing so in a way that people just shrug their
shoulders and say, are we living on the same planet?'' said William
Kristol, editor of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the doom-and-gloom philosophy also say that much
of today's good news stems from specific government policies
favored by advocacy groups, which later complain that things aren't
improving fast enough. For these groups to continue to complain is
to risk having their own cherished programs attacked as
ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Easterbrook, whose book, ``A Moment on the Earth: The
Coming Age of Environmental Optimism'' (Viking, 1995), angered many
environmental groups by trumpeting the dramatic improvement in the
world's ecology over the last 25 years, said, ``I think the
greatest argument for progressive government in my generation is
the success of pollution controls.''
</P>
<P>
   The current political climate also adds to the sometimes shrill
rhetoric of advocacy groups. With both political parties capturing
institutions that had long been outside their grasp _ the White
House for Democrats, the Congress for Republicans _ groups have
felt it time to land even bigger fish. ``When your team is winning,
you ratchet up what you want,'' Norquist said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet even as advocacy groups have raised the sights, the
political system they lobby has barely responded. With divided
government, a razor-slim Republican majority in the House and a
generally satisfied electorate, Washington has responded with
tinkering, rather than with the bold actions cried out for by the
advocacy groups. ``If you believe in a liberal or conservative
agenda, you've got to have been disappointed in the past few
years,'' Kristol said.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed though they may be, it is doubtful that advocacy
groups will lower their voices. With the country's
self-satisfaction expected to hold down voter turnout in midterm
elections this fall, the influence of groups that can energize
their core supporters may only grow. No one should expect sweetness
and light any time soon.

25.) 
 AN ARMY AS GOOD AS ITS PEOPLE, AND VICE VERSA 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, July (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ More and more these days, there is talk about the
cultural chasm between the military and the rest of society, what
most people consider the ``real world.'' Some people want to narrow
that divide, as though it is something new, and bad.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago, an assistant Army secretary had to resign
after calling the Marine Corps a bunch of ``extremists'' who faced
the risk of ``total disconnection with society.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Pentagon, having been ridiculed and reviled for treating
adultery in the military as a crime (and, many feel, for punishing
women more harshly than men who stray), is looking for new ways to
handle that ancient transgression _ classifying it as a less
serious crime, say, even regarding it as a personal matter unless
it plays havoc with discipline.
</P>
<P>
   The separation between civilian and military is as old as
democracy itself, based on the fear that a latter-day Praetorian
Guard might assert itself over the people it is supposed to serve.
That demarcation line may be blurred in time of war, when the
military's ranks are filled, after all, by the sons and daughters
of democracy, but it exists nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The government is master and the military is its servant. That
is why President Harry Truman's sacking of Gen. Douglas MacArthur
over the conduct of the Korean War has stood the test of history.
And that is probably why efforts to close the gulf invariably put
pressure on the military to be more like civilian society, not the
other way around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people do not want to have a military that is run on a
set of values that is so divorced from the civilian world that its
members come from that they can no longer relate to each other,''
William Fredericks, chairman of the New York City Bar Association's
committee on military affairs and justice, said recently.
</P>
<P>
   At least most people don't want that kind of military until
there's a war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real danger is not that America and its military will grow
too far apart _ it is that they will grow too close together,'' Dr.
John Hillen, who studies national-security issues for the Council
on Foreign Relations, a research organization, wrote recently in
The Navy Times.
</P>
<P>
   It is one thing, probably a good thing, to have a military force
that looks like the society it protects in terms of skin color,
geographical backgrounds and so on, Hillen said last week. But it
is a bad thing to have a military that shares all that society's
values, said Hillen, who saw combat as an Army captain in the
Persian Gulf war.
</P>
<P>
   Close-cropped hair, marching and saluting, living without
privacy, obeying orders instantly to avoid the wrath of the
sergeant or chief petty officer _ all the things that millions of
soldiers, sailors, marines and airmen have endured across the
decades in peace and war _ are part of what Hillen called ``the sum
total of military culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Is that culture good or bad, a success or a failure? In his
view, the answer is simple, even primitive. ``It depends on whether
a group of scared 18-year-olds run when they're first shot at,'' he
said. ``If they run, the culture has failed.'' Failed, he added, at
the only thing that justifies the military culture's existence.
</P>
<P>
   Another defender of the old-fashioned military culture is Elaine
Donnelly, president of the conservative-oriented Center for
Military Readiness, which supports separating men and women during
basic training and opposes combat roles for women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We shouldn't be running the military like a college campus,''
she said last week. She was scornful of those generals and admirals
who, she said, believe deeply that recent relaxation of traditions
in the military is dead wrong but are afraid to say so.
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, military people have been found to be proudly
disdainful of the very countrymen whom they are sworn to defend. In
his book ``Making the Corps,'' Thomas E. Ricks writes that, having
endured Marine Corps boot camp, newly minted marines find
themselves suddenly contemptuous of the ``soft'' civilian society
they were so recently part of. (It is probably no coincidence that
the Marines Corps is resisting more strongly than the other
services the Pentagon proposal to change policies toward adultery.)
</P>
<P>
   The cultural divide between military and civilian is regarded as
serious enough that it has attracted the attention of politicians,
fewer and fewer of whom have served in the military. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, like President Clinton a non-veteran, has
expressed concern. So have Sens. John McCain, R-Ariz., and Charles
Robb, D-Va., both veterans of Vietnam War combat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With less interaction between the civilian and military
cultures, we're going to have progressively less understanding of
one another,'' Robb said.
</P>
<P>
   One reason there is less interaction, of course, is that
military service has not been an obligation for a quarter-century _
a fact that Hillen laments.
</P>
<P>
   The answer, he said, is not to get rid of the gap but to
recognize it and ``manage it.'' The existence of the gap causes
social friction, he said. Closing it, by making the military and
civilian worlds more alike, could cause a loss on the battlefield.
</P>
<P>
   The cultural divide has existed since the time of the Founding
Fathers. ``The spirit of this country is totally adverse to a large
military force,'' Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1807.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas MacArthur might have been talking to himself (instead of
writing in a journal) when he said in 1927 that ``a warlike spirit,
which alone can create and civilize a state, is absolutely
essential to national defense and to national perpetuity.''
</P>
<P>
   No one was listening in the Jazz Age, when the U.S. military was
being reduced to a skeleton. His florid language notwithstanding,
no one would have laughed 15 years later.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, too, changed his views. ``We must train and classify
the whole of our male citizens and make military instruction a
regular part of collegiate education,'' he wrote in 1813, when the
United States was fighting Britain. ``We can never be safe till
this is done.''
</P>
<P>
   War does change perspectives.

 THE LATEST ASIAN MIRACLE: CHAOS WITHOUT COUPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, July (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   No one is celebrating the first anniversary of Asia's financial
crisis. With most of its economies shrinking, unemployment hitting
new highs and recovery perhaps several years away, who would?
</P>
<P>
   Yet in the 12 months since the Thai baht fell against the U.S.
dollar and touched off currency devaluations and a slump in every
major East Asian country, at least one of the region's stubborn old
ghosts has been exorcised. There have been no military coups.
</P>
<P>
   Thailand has led the way there, too. For the first time since
the country adopted a parliamentary government 66 years ago, its
army has stood by and allowed civilians to handle the economy.
Behind the parapets of the elite 11th Army Command's headquarters
in Bangkok, soldiers are teaching the jobless to knit and to type.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coup d'etat is outdated,'' said Gen. Chetta Thanajaro,
Thailand's commander in chief of the army, in an interview in
Bangkok. ``The more time passes, the more it is obsolete. My
soldiers must stay completely out of politics.''
</P>
<P>
   That attitude appears to be widespread, except for Indonesia,
where the army played a quiet but important role in forcing former
President Suharto from power in May. There have been no ominous
ripples in the Philippines or in South Korea, countries where
military intervention has been common.
</P>
<P>
   The sudden severity of the economic collapse, analysts say, has
befuddled the military leaders as much as it has politicians and
business executives. Even if Thai or Indonesian armies were
predisposed to take power themselves, they might find global
currency traders and democratically elected political leaders
illusive scapegoats. They would also lack a clear-cut agenda after
intervening.
</P>
<P>
   ``A decade ago, many of the region's militaries would likely
have felt that they had the answers, and that might well have
involved them taking over,'' said Harold Crouch, a military expert
at Australia National University. ``But these economic troubles are
complex, global matters that are well beyond them. So they defer to
the technocrats.''
</P>
<P>
   That back-seat role has helped politicians enact unpopular
reforms, including high interest rates that punish borrowers in the
name of monetary stability. Civilian leaders also have slashed
military budgets, canceled new weapons purchases and forced
military-backed companies to sink or swim in the marketplace.
Opposition leaders in both Thailand and South Korea have come to
power recently vowing to sever the cozy ties between government and
business that have formed under military rule.
</P>
<P>
   Many East Asian militaries _ those of Singapore and Malaysia are
notable exceptions _ grew accustomed to aggressive political roles
when fighting colonialism and communism. Those in Thailand,
Indonesia and South Korea, which have been hardest hit during the
latest economic crisis, once invoked martial control over
everything.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1960s South Korea's generals designed an economic model
centered on heavy industry, and it flourished during the 26 years
of army rule that ended in 1987. Indonesia's military retains
political and economic powers that rival those of the civilian
government, and has its hands in big business and trade monopolies.
In Thailand, generals sit on the boards of many large publicly
listed companies, and the military controls a leading bank and
several television and radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   Although communist North Korea is still a threat, most of the
old enemies in Asia have been vanquished, which has forced the
militaries to redefine their roles in a process that the economic
crisis has only accelerated, analysts say. The result is a less
exalted sense of purpose and a grudging acceptance of the
non-political professionalism practiced in American and European
militaries.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army is being treated as a servant instead of the
master,'' said Panitan Wattanayagorn, a military affairs adviser to
Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai. ``We ask them, `Why do you need
money for this or that?' They don't like it, but they are accepting
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Few expected the once coup-happy Thai military to be so at ease.
Almost as soon as Thailand's currency lost its grip against the
dollar last summer, Bangkok filled with rumors of an imminent army
takeover. It seemed almost predestined: The military has ousted
civilian leaders and assumed power 17 times since 1932, most
recently in 1991. Political or economic woes were usually given as
the justification.
</P>
<P>
   The military has not only accepted its diminished role, but also
supported tough austerity measures. Chetta said the army has
already slimmed its ranks by about 10 percent. ``But I could cut up
to 30 percent of active troops,'' he said. ``Even 50 percent if the
government needs me to.'' Similar retrenchment has hit the air
force and the navy.
</P>
<P>
   Army generals have marched through public parks in sneakers and
sport shirts to lead the ``Thai Help Thai'' charity campaign. The
effort has raised several million dollars by collecting gold and
dollars. ``We want to instill the feeling of sacrifice and
responsibility in the Thai people _ let them know that these are
problems they themselves must help solve,'' Chetta said.
</P>
<P>
   The Thai army's willingness to play a supporting role is not
altruism. The disastrous 1991 coup caused a popular uprising in
1992, which troops brutally suppressed. The army has been
struggling to improve its image ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Similar debacles have befallen the South Korean and Filipino
armies. In Seoul, two former army generals and presidents, Chun
Doo-hwan and Roh Tae-woo, were convicted of murder and corruption
charges. Their abuse of power and tolerance of endemic corruption
are widely cited as leading to the current economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   Six coup attempts against former Philippines President Corazon
Aquino so embarrassed the military there that few predict it will
try again soon. The current democratically elected president,
Joseph Estrada, is a former B-movie star who must tackle the
country's growing economic woes without any practical experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost any recent military intervention you can name was a
disaster,'' Crouch said. ``The idea of army leadership has been
discredited.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Thailand's most powerful people do not all wear civvies.
Chetta has gained political clout by forswearing the military
option, and he struts proudly on the public stage. Whether
receiving the finance minister for an economic briefing, or
supporting Thailand's new constitution, the general seems to relish
a role as peacekeeping elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
   And while Chetta brushes off questions about his ambitions, his
denial is short of Shermanesque. ``It is not necessary for me to be
a minister,'' he said, his eyes sparkling and a smile peaking
through his stoic expression. ``I will serve society however I
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Army colleagues say the general covets public office. But it is
a sign of change in Thailand that he seems determined to win it
through the ballot box.

 NEW RULES, NEW CAUTION: TELLING A JOURNALISTIC COUP FROM A CRIME 
</HEADLINE>
  
(Repeating for all needing. Originally filed on Saturday, July (The Week in Review)  
 (bl)  
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time that producers for ``60 Minutes'' broadcast video
footage taken with a hidden camera, they used the herky-jerky idiom
of journalism verite to show Florida pawn shop owners buying
potentially stolen goods. In the kind of on-camera moment of truth
that is the show's signature, correspondent Mike Wallace told a
pawn broker, ``This cop, Jack Gee, told me this morning _ he says
that legalized fencing is what you people do.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a little irony there. It is indeed ethically dubious to
deal in stuff obtained underhandedly. And reporters do it all the
time.
</P>
<P>
   Every day, reporters in Washington pump Kenneth Starr's
prosecutors for information about a secret grand jury's
investigation into the relationship between President Clinton and
Monica Lewinsky. Every day, reporters get information from sources
who violate a confidence or a law by passing it on.
</P>
<P>
   But journalists themselves were rarely charged with violating
laws _ until recently, when The Cincinnati Enquirer, which quoted
executive voice-mail messages in a series on Chiquita Brands
International, found itself apologizing for the articles and paying
Chiquita more than $10 million.
</P>
<P>
   Chiquita charged that a reporter broke into its computerized
voice-mail system _ a violation of state wiretapping laws. The
editors had believed the information came from a corporate insider,
in which case the source, not the newspaper, would usually face the
legal consequences.
</P>
<P>
   For journalists, it is second nature to draw a line between
stealing information (forbidden) and accepting pilfered information
(fine). To paraphrase Wallace, legalized fencing of information is
what news people do.
</P>
<P>
   But such ethical hair-splitting is now facing a serious
challenge. Businesses, feeling the pressure of stepped-up financial
reporting over the last decade, are becoming bolder about attacking
journalists, publicly and with lawsuits. And reporters and editors,
thrust into the spotlight, are forced to articulate ethical
distinctions that can be hard to defend.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters' ethical minuets are carefully choreographed for a
profession that sees its calling as telling uncomfortable,
important truths. They are out of step with a public that is angry
about sensationalism, grand jury leaks and the press' perceived
arrogance. Journalists who take little time to explain why the
tawdrier side of their work may be necessary can pay a price;
lawyers who put the news media's ethics on trial are finding
receptive juries.
</P>
<P>
   When Steve Weinberg, an author and University of Missouri
journalism professor, recently taught a class that mixed journalism
and law students, he found ``the law students were absolutely
flabbergasted and enraged'' at practices like calling an executive
after 6 p.m. to avoid a secretary or filing a Freedom of
Information Act request for government files on an unwilling
subject. It was a revelation, he said, ``to see the disconnect
between our values and those of nonjournalists.''
</P>
<P>
   The disconnect is not complete; there are common links. Breaking
the law is almost universally taboo in the news business. The other
central taboos involve what to publish (it needs to be right) and
when (before anyone else, if possible). But when it comes to how to
report, ``That's one of the glories and the pitfalls of a free
press,'' said Michael Gartner, the editor of The Tribune in Ames,
Iowa, and a former president of NBC News. ``There is no line
imposed on any of us except the line of the law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Questions about the origin and highly classified status of the
Pentagon Papers didn't keep The New York Times and The Washington
Post from publishing them in 1971. In fact, The Times was awarded a
Pulitzer Prize for public service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's our job to gather up as much information as possible and
then make the hard decisions about what to print and not to
print,'' Weinberg said. Methods may seem seedy if the issue is
finding a film star on vacation, but less so if the issue is a
major corporate polluter endangering the health of a community.
</P>
<P>
   Still, as reporters navigate the ethical swamps, collecting
tidbits from detectives or spies, they may forget that swamps give
off a smell. Stolen documents produce public-service journalism.
Now explain that to the public. But stolen documents seldom give
journalists pause.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first question is their authenticity,'' said Lowell
Bergman, senior investigative producer at CBS. ``There are real
questions if the documents violate someone's privacy, or are
important merely because they're titillating,'' he added. ``But you
have a duty to look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Criminal records are another matter. ``It's illegal for me or
you to pay a cop to run a record'' through the National Crime
Information Center's records, said a former journalist who is now a
private investigator, and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
``But if, as a reporter, you have a cop who checks whether
so-and-so had a criminal record and you don't pay him, is that
legal or illegal?''
</P>
<P>
   What about using hidden cameras? ``It's case by case,'' said Don
Hewitt, the creator and executive producer of ``60 Minutes.''
``It's getting to look like a stunt.'' Breaking laws? ``It was
illegal in China for us to go into slave labor camps with a hidden
camera, which we did. It didn't pain me to put that on camera.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of hidden cameras by ABC News in a report on food
handling at a Food Lion supermarket, coupled with the producers'
decision to lie on employment forms, led to a 1996 jury verdict
against the network. An appeal is pending.
</P>
<P>
   ``ABC truly believed that what they did was justified because
bad food could be coming out of there,'' said Jane Kirtley,
executive director of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the
Press. ``But the public didn't see it that way at all.''
</P>
<P>
   With libel hard to prove, lawsuits are likely to focus on
reporters' tactics. A Maine trucking company won a case against NBC
this month when a jury found the producer and correspondent did not
honor assurances that the report would be favorable. And a federal
judge in Ohio must decide a charge of misrepresentation against
Business Week, whose reporter requested data from a credit
information firm, giving his true employer but indicating that he
sought the data for ``employment'' reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the risks of journalistic subterfuge, reporting is not
getting any easier. Information once public is shielded by privacy
laws or just plain privatized. Many state governments are charging
hefty fees for access to motor vehicle and other records that were
once virtually free. The number of confidentiality agreements
involving business deals and legal settlements has grown
exponentially, some lawyers say (though by definition it is
impossible to know).
</P>
<P>
   It was the confidentiality agreement between Jeffrey Wigand and
the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corporation that led CBS lawyers to
insist that ``60 Minutes'' pull back its interview with the former
research chief in 1995. The lawyers said that getting Wigand's
cooperation could be seen as ``tortious interference'' in company
affairs. Fear of contract violation overcame the urge to publish,
until The Wall Street Journal jumped into the fray and CBS
broadcast its report in early 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known Supreme Court case upholding confidentiality
agreements came two decades ago, when the court ruled that Frank
Snepp, a senior CIA staff member in Vietnam, had violated his
agreement with the agency by publishing his book ``Decent
Interval'' without prior review. Since then, ``the universe of
potential bases for suing journalists has expanded,'' said Ms.
Kirtley, of the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.
</P>
<P>
   With the rise of computerized databases, not to mention an
Internet culture that deems all information free, further controls
may be on the way.
</P>
<P>
   In this new climate, Bergman recommends forthrightness, mostly.
``The basic line is to be upfront and be honest,'' he said.
``There's almost no reason to deceive anyone about anything.'' But
he added, ``You don't have to tell someone everything.''

 FORGET MICROSOFT. GM IS STILL THE BIGGEST KID ON THE BLOCK.

<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ To appreciate the size of General Motors,
consider this: If Microsoft were a GM auto parts division, Bill
Gates would be just another GM vice president that nobody has ever
heard of.
</P>
<P>
   A quarter-century of shrinking market share and periodic
financial crises at GM have fed a popular image of the automaker as
a shadow of its former self. Yet GM remains the world's largest
company in sales and share of global economic output, and is
immense by any standard. Growth in the entire U.S. economy has been
slowed substantially by eight-week-old strikes here that have
paralyzed the automaker's North American operations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, before rising gasoline prices and increased imports of
Japanese cars began to take a toll, GM's operations in the United
States accounted for 2.3 percent of the nation's economic output,
according to the Commerce Department. Last year, GM still produced
about 1.5 percent of the nation's goods and services, dwarfing
every other company except Ford, with about 1.2 percent. Microsoft,
by comparison, accounted for about 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GM's North American automotive assembly and marketing division
alone still has roughly the same annual revenues as the worldwide
operations of all American passenger airlines combined.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Microsoft has replaced GM as the titan that
sometimes seems to tower over U.S. industry. Computer software has
replaced the car as the American product that captures the public's
imagination here and around the world. Antitrust regulators now
ignore GM, with its 31 percent share of the American car market,
and have sued Microsoft, challenging its 90 percent share of the
much smaller market for operating software that makes computers
run.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's share price has also soared, seizing the attention
of a public in love with the stock market. GM's stock, on the other
hand, has only recently returned to its price in the mid-1960s _
and has plunged if inflation is included. The combined value of
Microsoft's shares is now nearly six times the value of GM's
shares. Yet GM's 1997 revenue of $178 billion was 15 times greater
than Microsoft's.
</P>
<P>
   The stock market is captivated these days not by a company's
size but by its expected future earnings. Trapped in a fiercely
competitive market and fettered by expensive union contracts and
costly strikes, GM seems less attractive than Microsoft, which
faces little effective competition and little risk of strikes.
</P>
<P>
   But a company's contribution to the economy is not determined by
its share price. A country's economic output is calculated from
total sales to the final users of goods and products. Microsoft's
sales are tiny compared with those of GM because its most popular
programs sell for about $90 apiece, while GM's cars and light
trucks sell for an average of $20,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies have tried to argue that they play a greater role
in the economy than their sales might suggest. Software companies
contend that their products improve the productivity of millions of
Americans. The United Parcel Service claimed during a strike last
year that every day it delivered packages with a value equal to
nearly 6 percent of the nation's daily economic output.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives, living in a state where the auto industry's
preeminence is taken for granted, do not even bother pointing out
that cars and trucks also play a role in moving people and goods
around. Having typically worked all their lives for a company that
has led the world in sales through much of its 90-year history, the
executives simply shrug and smile when other companies brag about
their size.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Murder in the United States has been dropping dramatically for
years, to the lowest level since the modern crime wave began in the
1960s. But this encouraging decline has masked a fundamental fact _
that there is no such thing as an American murder rate.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there are sharp regional differences in homicide, with
the South having by far the highest murder rate, almost double that
of the Northeast, a divergence that has persisted for as long as
records have been kept, starting in the 19th century.
</P>
<P>
   The former slaveholding states of the old Confederacy all rank
in the top 20 states for murder, led by Louisiana, with a rate of
17.5 murders per 100,000 people in 1996. The 10 states with the
lowest homicide rates are in New England and the northern Midwest,
with South Dakota's the lowest at 1.2 murders per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   Experts note, in addition, that much of the disparity in murder
rates between the South and other sections of the country stems
from a difference in the character of Southern homicide. In the
South, many murders are of a personal and traditional nature: a
barroom brawl, a quarrel between acquaintances or a fight between
lovers. Elsewhere, homicides usually begin with another crime, like
a robbery gone bad, and typically involve strangers.
</P>
<P>
   Most important, the experts say, the high Southern murder rate
is a key factor behind America's disproportionately high homicide
rate compared with other democratic, industrialized nations. In
1996, the last year for which data are available, the United States
murder rate was 7.4 per 100,000 people. The next closest country
was Finland, at 3.2 per 100,000 people, with France at 1.1, Japan
at 0.6 and Britain at 0.5.
</P>
<P>
   While the United States has much more murder than comparable
countries, it does not necessarily have much more crime. England
has a higher rate of burglary. France has a higher rate of auto
theft. The Netherlands and Australia have about the same total
crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole American scandalously high homicide rates are
Southern in origin,'' says Roger Lane, a professor of history at
Haverford College and author of ``Murder in America: A History''
(Ohio State University Press, 1997). Until the 1960s, Lane said,
America's big cities actually had murder rates lower than the
national average, since the national rate had been skewed upward by
Southern homicides.
</P>
<P>
   The question of why murder is so prevalent in the South has
fascinated observers as far back as Alexis de Tocqueville, who in
the early 1830s recorded a remark by a young lawyer he encountered
in Alabama. ``There is no one here but carries arms under his
clothes,'' the lawyer said. ``At the slightest quarrel, knife or
pistol comes to hand. These things happen continually; it is a
semi-barbarous state of society.''
</P>
<P>
   A study of 19th century judicial records completed in 1980 by
lawyer Michael Hindus found that from 1800 to 1860 the murder rate
in South Carolina, an overwhelmingly rural, agrarian area, was four
times higher than that of Massachusetts, then the most urban,
industrial state. More than a century later, the difference
persists in almost the same magnitude. In 1996, the murder rate in
South Carolina was 9 per 100,000 people, according to the FBI; in
Massachusetts it was 2.6 per 100,000 people.
</P>
<P>
   High Southern homicide rates challenge a central theory of
criminology, which predicts more murder in densely populated urban
areas where crowding and poverty break down traditional social ties
and values.
</P>
<P>
   Southern homicide was typically rural, and over the years many
theories have been advanced to explain it. Frederick Law Olmsted,
who traveled through the South in the 1850s and wrote about it in
``Journeys and Explorations in the Cotton Kingdom,'' pointed to the
persistence of frontier conditions in the region. Southern
plantation agriculture, characterized by widely scattered
settlements and a lack of roads and schools, left the region a
frontier until after the Civil War, helping to breed lawlessness.
</P>
<P>
   Contemporary historians have suggested other sources of Southern
bellicosity. David Hackett Fischer, a professor of history at
Brandeis University, says a critical factor was the heavy
settlement of the South by immigrants referred to today as
Scotch-Irish _ people from the north of Britain, the lowlands of
Scotland and the north of Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   These settlers, whom Benjamin Franklin described as ``white
savages,'' brought with them a culture based on centuries of
fighting between the kings of England and Scotland over the
borderlands they inhabited. They had a penchant for family feuds, a
love of whiskey and a warrior ethic that demanded vengeance,
Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
   The mother of Andrew Jackson, herself an immigrant from the
north of Ireland, advised her boy: ``Andrew, never tell a lie, nor
take what is not your own, nor sue anybody for slander, assault and
battery. Always settle them cases yourself.'' He did, becoming a
famous pistol dueler.
</P>
<P>
   Behind such toughness was an ethic of ``primal honor,''
according to Bertram Wyatt-Brown, a professor of history at the
University of Florida. Above all, honor meant reputation. ``You
identified yourself on the basis of what others think of you, so
appearances mattered,'' Wyatt-Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Honor was reinforced by slavery. Slavery by its nature dishonors
one group and contrives to give all honor to another. In the South,
race helped turn the distinction between master and slave into an
absolute divide, perpetuating whites' belief that they were people
of honor.
</P>
<P>
   And since slavery could be maintained only by the daily exercise
of brute force, slave owners became very sensitive to the slightest
threat to their superiority, a touchiness that expanded from
plantation fields to all areas of their lives, Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Reconstruction period after the Civil War, in which white
Southerners often resorted to terror or killings to restore their
political control, helped perpetuate the high level of violence in
the South, a problem that reached its apogee in the 1890s with
lynching.
</P>
<P>
   The cult of honor was gradually transmuted into African-American
slave society, scholars now believe, as slaves and their
emancipated descendants found themselves outside the law in the
South, with sheriffs, judges and juries all controlled by whites.
``For blacks in the South, there was no alternative to settling
disputes personally and physically,'' said Lane.
</P>
<P>
   The South in the 20th century has become more like the rest of
the nation, as it has become more urban and industrial. Waves of
whites flocking from the cold North to the Sun Belt states and the
great migration of blacks going the other way also have made the
regions more similar.
</P>
<P>
   But the concern with honor persists, especially in smaller
cities and rural areas, said Richard Nisbett, a professor of
psychology at the University of Michigan. In analyzing homicide
data for whites, Nisbett found there was no difference in murder
rates between white males in the largest cities in the South and
the rest of the country.
</P>
<P>
   But in medium-sized cities, with populations between 50,000 and
200,000, Southern white males commit murder at a rate twice that of
their counterparts in the rest of the nation, he said. In small
cities, with populations from 10,000 to 50,000, the ratio is 3 to 1
and in rural areas it is 4 to 1. The excess murder in the South, he
said, comes from crimes ``where you could plausibly say an insult
had been involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbett devised a psychological test, administered to students
at the University of Michigan, that appears to demonstrate a
Southern sensitivity to insult and disposition to violence. In the
test, a person unexpectedly bumps into a subject as he walks down a
corridor, and calls him a jerk. Out-of-state white male students
from the South, even pre-med students, tend to react with anger and
show measurable increases in levels of testosterone and cortisol,
hormones that indicate stress. White Northern males typically
respond by laughing the incident off and do not show the same
hormonal reactions, Nisbett said.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of historians, traditional Southern influences and
attitudes help explain Louisiana's ranking as the state with by far
the highest homicide rate. Before the Civil War, Louisiana had the
most brutal conditions for slavery, in large part because it was
the one state where sugar cane was grown, and cane production is
particularly harsh work.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Samuel Hyde Jr., a historian at Southeastern
Louisiana University, eastern Louisiana was in a state of near
anarchy for most of the 19th century, a result of its pinewoods
isolation, lack of political authority and vicious guerrilla
fighting during the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde, the author of ``Pistols and Politics,'' (Louisiana State
University Press, 1996), relates how his own great-grandfather,
Samuel Hyde, a sawmill owner and postmaster in rural Tangipahoa
Parish, survived being shot in the back on two different occasions
as a result of a local feud _ only to be fatally ambushed in 1897
while on horseback, hit in the back by 36 buckshot, with another
rifle slug in the back of his head.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde remembers his father and uncles passing on the story to him
when he was 13. His grandfather, the slain man's son, eventually
avenged the killing by shooting the assassins' ringleader. ``I have
felt like I dishonored my family, Hyde said, ``because I am the
only one who never killed anyone.''

   &UR; A CRIME IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Suzanne Berne. Owl/Holt, $11.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-year-old narrator tells of the brutal murder of a young boy
in a Washington suburb and its aftermath, but her story also
captures the history of child-parent relations in the last 25
years, from the adults' casual abandonment of their children to the
next generation's revenge. Last year in the Book Review, Jacqueline
Carey called this a ``remarkable first novel.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NO MERCY: A JOURNEY TO THE HEART OF THE CONGO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Redmond O'Hanlon. Vintage Departures, $14.
</P>
<P>
   This wild account of a nutty expedition in search of a living
dinosaur is mostly told through comical, scientific and
self-probing digressions, but at its core it is about different
ways -- both linear and nonlinear -- of perceiving the world. In
1997 our reviewer, Tim Cahill, called this eccentric travelogue
``half mad and unremittingly brilliant.'' The same publisher has
issued another book that happily wanders off the beaten track,
 &UR; TROPICAL CLASSICAL: ESSAYS FROM SEVERAL DIRECTIONS &LR; , by Pico Iyer
($13), a collection of essays, book reviews and other short
journalistic pieces by an eloquent observer of foreign locales and
surprising culture clashes. ``Iyer is open and curious, both
humorous and thoughtful,'' Elizabeth Hanson wrote here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE JADE PEONY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Wayson Choy. Picador USA, $12.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Vancouver's Chinatown during the late 1930s and early
1940s, this coming-of-age novel focuses on three siblings in an
immigrant family struggling with the burden of old ways and the
need to learn new ones. Last year in these pages, Philip Gambone
admired ``Choy's keen insight into the way children come to terms
with the diversity of everyday life.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PROMISCUITIES: THE SECRET STRUGGLE FOR WOMANHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Naomi Wolf. Fawcett Columbine, $13.95.
</P>
<P>
   The author uses her own experiences as a springboard for
blasting away myths and examining the complicated legacy of the
sexual revolution for young women today. The result is ``a searing
and thoroughly fascinating exploration of the complex wildlife of
female sexuality and desire,'' Courtney Weaver said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE PHYSIOGNOMY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jeffrey Ford. Avon/Eos, $3.99.
</P>
<P>
   This Kafkaesque allegory unfolds in the Well-Built City, where
Physiognomist First Class Cley can read subversive thoughts in the
topography of a man's cranium; the novel follows his painful
journey from committed scientist and zealous torturer to selfless
rebel. ``Ford writes equally well about the scientific cult of
precision and the acceptance of ambiguity,'' Gerald Jonas wrote
here last year. In another science fiction tale by the same
publisher,  &UR; I WHO HAVE NEVER KNOWN MEN &LR; , by Jacqueline Harpman
($3.99), the youngest of 40 women kept under guard in an
underground bunker struggles to figure out what it means to have a
life of her own. Last year our reviewer, Sally Eckhoff, called this
postapocalyptic novel, which was translated from the French by Ros
Schwartz, ``bleak but fascinating.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CORNER: A YEAR IN THE LIFE OF AN INNER-CITY NEIGHBORHOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Simon and Edward Burns. Broadway Books, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The authors camped out almost daily for over a year on a corner
in a West Baltimore ghetto, tracking the lives of drug addicts and
ordinary residents struggling to coexist. Their report, which
explodes many stereotypes of the urban poor, is ``brave,
unblinkered and heartbreaking,'' Sara Mosle wrote here last year.
In another ground-level look at inner-city life,  &UR; OUR AMERICA: LIFE
AND DEATH ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO &LR; , by LeAlan Jones and Lloyd
Newman with David Isay (Washington Square/Pocket Books, $14), two
teen-agers tape their voices and experiences, as well as those of
other housing-project residents. In 1997 our reviewer, Judith
Newman, said this gritty chronicle ``reveals the humanity, humor
and pathos among petty dope dealers, teen-age mothers and even
pre-teen-age killers.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE NATURE OF BLOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Caryl Phillips. Vintage International, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The author, a West Indian raised in England, uses the story of a
young Jewish woman in Nazi Germany to explore the problem of
European tribalism and the terrible price it exacted during the
Holocaust, as well as the historical roots of intolerance. This is
``an extraordinarily perceptive and intelligent novel, and a
haunting one,'' James Shapiro said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; OLD BOOKS, RARE FRIENDS: TWO LITERARY SLEUTHS AND THEIR SHARED
PASSION &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Leona Rostenberg and Madeleine Stern. Main Street/Doubleday,
$11.95.
</P>
<P>
   The engaging authors of this joint memoir describe their
uncommonly harmonious 60-year friendship and a mutual devotion to a
life of the mind as scholars and rare book dealers. ``Their story
is irresistible to anyone in love with books,'' Margot Peters wrote
in the Book Review last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IN THE PALM OF DARKNESS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mayra Montero. Translated from the Spanish by Edith Grossman.
Harper Flamingo, $12.
</P>
<P>
   An American herpetologist and his local guide search for a
nearly extinct species of frog in the mountains of Haiti, a ravaged
land where the magical and occult still flourish. Last year our
reviewer, Zofia Smardz, called this ``a resplendent piece of
writing that brings a mysterious and murderous country throbbingly
to life.''

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Wet heat vs. dry heat: We all lose
 &HT;    (For release July 29, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Someone once asked me what was necessary to qualify to
write about food for a newspaper. The first prerequisite, I said,
was that he or she should have eaten food for at least 18 years.
Everything else could be worked out.
</P>
<P>
   I also feel this way about weather. What qualifies me to write
about it? First prerequisite: I've lived in it a long time. You
don't have to be a climatologist to recognize how you're feeling in
weather.
</P>
<P>
   (Don't you love the TV weather people who tell you _ with
expressive authority _ that if you thought it was hot today you
were right, it was hot today?)
</P>
<P>
   What exasperates me, however, is the constant reference by
people in the American West and Southwest, particularly when they
are speaking with someone from Florida, that at least their heat is
dry.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, I have blindly accepted this regional gloat,
despite the fact that I spent two years of my younger life in El
Paso, Texas _ one of America's great saunas in the summer months _
and should know better and should have spoken out then.
</P>
<P>
   I confess that Florida, particularly South Florida, is woefully
sticky and hot in the summer months, but I still don't know what is
so good about dry heat. In fact, I have, upon recent personal
experience, come to the conclusion that there is not 10 cents worth
of difference between dry heat and wet heat.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two weeks, I have been in sections of central and
northern California where the egg would fry BEFORE it hit the
sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but it was dry heat, the natives would boast.
</P>
<P>
   And likely it was. But what did that have to do with the fact
that at 106 degrees Fahrenheit, the perspiration has soaked through
your trousers, your watchband, down your forehead into your eyes
and the local weatherman is warning anyone who is young or old,
sick or healthy to stay indoors OR YOU MAY DIE!
</P>
<P>
   There was one day, while driving through a town en route to the
Gold Rush foothills northeast of Sacramento, that I stopped at a
service station for a cool drink. My rental car had one of those
unavoidable L.E.D. temperature reports on the dashboard, and it
read 118 degrees!
</P>
<P>
   I failed to detect the value of dry heat, as opposed to humid
heat, inasmuch as I hardly could draw a breath of any kind of air.
</P>
<P>
   All I could do is what I also do in wet-heat South Florida: get
the auto air conditioner going as cold as it can following a brief
period of being scalded on the hot seats of the car once I returned
with the drink.
</P>
<P>
   On the day I drove through Stockton, Calif., the San Francisco
49ers were beginning their first day of football practice _ at 108
degrees. All the time, I was wondering how the folks were back in
Florida, having to endure 93 wet degrees.
</P>
<P>
   The TV weathermen back there tell you its 93 degrees but with
the heat index (humidity) added in, it feels like 103 degrees.
Well, that still ain't 108 degrees!
</P>
<P>
   By the time I reached San Francisco (12 below zero at any time
of day), I was openly challenging anyone who claimed that
California's was a dry heat while Florida's was an intolerable wet
heat.
</P>
<P>
   No more of that dry heat stuff for me! I knew it was a ruse when
I lived in El Paso, felt more of it when I covered a national
political convention in Dallas _ which bathes in 100-degree-plus
temperatures with regularity _ and, now, have the experience of
open blistering in the San Joaquin and Sacramento valleys.
</P>
<P>
   Miami may be muggy but it's not much different than arid
Sacramento when it comes to uncomfortable weather: hot is hot, no
matter how wet or dry it is.

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Repairing racial injustice of wartimes
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this week, President Harry Truman signed an
executive order barring racial inequality in the military.
Integration wouldn't start until two years later, forced by the
need to rush troops to the Korean War, and the last all-black unit
wouldn't be disbanded until 1954. Still, Truman's bold move marked
the beginning of the end for one of the more tormented tales in the
twisted history of American racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans had fought to win, save and expand American
freedom in every of the nation's wars, only to be rewarded after
each, if rewarded at all, with meager rations from that freedom _
and with quick white forgetfulness. Every debt of honor was settled
on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   We were still rescuing those memories last week, and settling
those debts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 black soldiers and sailors fought to save the Union
in the Civil War, but the forgetting began immediately. None
marched in the victory parade down Pennsylvania _ and never mind
their 16 Medals of Honor. A memorial to the black veterans was
unveiled in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   And survivors of the 2,220 black soldiers who volunteered to
leave their support units and fight beside whites in World War II's
Battle of the Bulge finally received the medals last week that the
Pentagon forgot to issue them after the war. Adding injury to
insult, black non-coms had been reduced to privates for the battle
_ no risk, then, they would give orders to whites _ and never had
their ranks restored.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone. Crispus Attucks was one of the five to die in
the Boston Massacre, first blood in the Revolutionary War. Among
the blacks who served in the war was the all-black 1st Rhode Island
Regiment.
</P>
<P>
   Some 350 blacks fought with Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New
Orleans in the War of 1812, and a fourth of the sailors who won the
war's key Battle of Lake Erie were African American. Black units
were crucial to the Spanish-American War victories at San Juan and
Kettle Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The (now) famous Buffalo Soldiers protected American expansion
across the West, and some 400,000 blacks served in World War I,
most memorably the 369th Infantry, the Harlem Hellfighters. (Its
soldiers knocked the Germans out; its band knocked the French out.)
</P>
<P>
   African Americans, relentlessly steered to fetch-and-carry
roles, had to fight to fight in World War II, from infantry and
tank units to the distinguished Tuskegee Airmen. And they came home
to find furloughed German war prisoners welcome where they were
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, the armed forces everywhere were as segregated
as the Jim Crow South, yet African Americans soldiered on _ an
astonishing act of faith, based on precious little encouraging
experience, that their nation would one day vindicate in the
perfection of its justice the sacrifice they were making.
</P>
<P>
   America's black newspapers called World War II the fight for two
V's _ victory in combat abroad and victory for racial justice at
home. The first victory was complete, but although Truman's order
started dramatic changes for the better, those two recent
ceremonies in Washington remind us there is still some mopping up
to do on the second.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Futurists banking on
 &HT;    `coming matriarchy'
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a thousand participants
at a World Future Society conference mulled over forecasts for the
21st century, trying to discern what changes would be coming around
the 2000 bend.
</P>
<P>
   While opinions varied on many issues, the futurists seemed to
have little doubt about this: Women will become the dominant
players in the economy and the home. The futurists referred to
``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost certain outcome of the
``post-divorce'' society.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters were not saying whether these changes would be
good or bad for society, but simply that they would be inevitable
given the changes in education, technology and birth control.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, the traditional family consisted of a husband,
wife and children, with the husband bringing home the primary
paycheck. That financial arrangement made sense in the Industrial
Age when employers paid a premium for strong workers who could fill
jobs in mining and manufacturing. Women, who had little control
over the timing of their pregnancies, were not well-suited to the
dirty, dangerous workplaces of the early and mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure of the traditional family is changing as
women's wages rise. In the Information Age, women and men are able
to perform equally well in most jobs, so pay is equalizing. For

   With employers paying a premium for education, women are finding
more reasons to stay in school. The U.S. Census Bureau recently
reported the proportion of women completing college has topped that
of men, and the lead is widening. Among women ages 25 to 29, just
over 29 percent had completed four years or more of college as of
1997. That compared with only 26.3 percent of men. In 1997, young
women also led men in completing high school, 88.9 percent to 85.8
percent.

<P>
   In the 21st century, these well-educated women will become more
financially secure and less interested in marrying, the futurists
predict. That means the ``typical'' family soon will consist of a
mother and her children, with men taking their place at the
periphery of home life, according to one of the convention's
speakers, David S. Mercer, author of ``Future Revolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   The futurists who called the next hundred years the ``century of
women'' made no predictions about what such changes might mean for
daily life, but it would seem the impact on our notion of home
could be huge.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if the typical family of the future really is the
Murphy Brown model, with a working mom and her child, then maybe
our idea of the perfect home will change, too. Today, the
stereotypical metro Atlanta family gravitates toward a
2,200-square-foot house with a big yard in a leafy suburb. But for
single women, such dream homes can become nightmares of endless
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   If women are going to be picking out houses for themselves,
perhaps they will choose smaller quarters set in a communal
grouping where families can share a common dining room and child
care center.
</P>
<P>
   But what will become of the men who are not firmly tied to
family life? Men who don't marry have higher rates of unemployment
and incarceration. Will crime and social disorder increase if more
men find themselves out of work and living alone?
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest challenges of the next century may be keeping
young men in school long enough to mold them into useful
participants in the economy and family life.

 &HT;    Marilyn Geewax's Business Commentary: Futurists banking on
 &HT;    `coming matriarchy'
 &HT;    By Marilyn Geewax
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a thousand participants
at a World Future Society conference mulled over forecasts for the
21st century, trying to discern what changes would be coming around
the 2000 bend.
</P>
<P>
   While opinions varied on many issues, the futurists seemed to
have little doubt about this: Women will become the dominant
players in the economy and the home. The futurists referred to
``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost certain outcome of the
``post-divorce'' society.
</P>
<P>
   The forecasters were not saying whether these changes would be
good or bad for society, but simply that they would be inevitable
given the changes in education, technology and birth control.
</P>
<P>
   In this century, the traditional family consisted of a husband,
wife and children, with the husband bringing home the primary
paycheck. That financial arrangement made sense in the Industrial
Age when employers paid a premium for strong workers who could fill
jobs in mining and manufacturing. Women, who had little control
over the timing of their pregnancies, were not well-suited to the
dirty, dangerous workplaces of the early and mid-20th century.
</P>
<P>
   But the structure of the traditional family is changing as
women's wages rise. In the Information Age, women and men are able
to perform equally well in most jobs, so pay is equalizing. For
example, being an auto mechanic used to require considerable
strength for lifting heavy parts and using manual tools. But with
each passing year, the role of the mechanic has been changing.
Today, muscles are less important than having the training to
analyze data from computer-controlled diagnostic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   With employers paying a premium for education, women are finding
more reasons to stay in school. The U.S. Census Bureau recently
reported the proportion of women completing college has topped that

 &HT;    ShortTakes: Polling the masters
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not long ago, the movie industry polled itself, declaring
``Citizen Kane'' the best movie of the century. Well, fair enough.
The posthumous honor would have amused Orson Welles, Kane's
presiding genius, who was treated despicably for his trouble by
Hollywood's cash barons.
</P>
<P>
   Now, a new poll. This one of great English-language books. The
Modern Library, which worries for the nation about great books,
asked its board to select the best 100 of the century. The top
book: ``Ulysses,'' by James Joyce. Joyce would have agreed, while
bemused by our impulse to name the top everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses'' is entitled. Joyce and a few others, Virginia Wolff,
Laurence Sterne (of a different century) and Marcel Proust, changed
literature and human thought in much the same way Beethoven changed
music and human thought by composing his Third Symphony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ulysses'' remains one of the least-read of books, recording,
obscurely, the thoughts of a few people on June 16, 1904, in
Dublin. The book was declared obscene, bitterly condemned, and
barely got published. Which proves once again how one generation's
obscenity can be another's masterpiece. Politicians, fearing the
marketplace, love legislating art.
</P>
<P>
   The Modern Library has invited readers to nominate their great
books via its web site. The last time I looked their leader was
``Dune'' by Frank Herbert, closely followed by ``Atlas Shrugged''
by Ayn Rand. I was delighted to see John Kennedy Toole's ``A
Confederacy of Dunces'' hanging in at 99 with 16 votes. A bit of
dignified ballot box stuffing is needed here.

 &HT;    MindSpring is investors' darling
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath. Watching the
soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service provider
MindSpring elicits a similar feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides dial-up Internet access to some
393,000 subscribers, just posted its third profitable quarter
operating in the volatile Internet industry. The stock closed
Friday down 50 cents at $148.50 after hitting a record $157.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring founder and Chairman Charles Brewer cut his vacation
short to appear on CNBC. When asked what was the secret to the
Internet service provider's success, Brewer replied with what is
becoming the MindSpring mantra: Keeping costs down and customers
happy is the key to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   And Brewer seemed to hint in a Wall Street Journal Heard on the
Street column that he wasn't averse to selling the company.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's national media attention has captured the
imaginations of small investors like Atlanta resident Edie
Friedman. Friedman is impressed by the stock's performance and what
friends say about the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love it. They say it's very easy to use. It's going to be
another Microsoft. I have a gut feeling,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, several investment firms warn MindSpring's wild ride is
a short-term phenomenon. But they still believe MindSpring is an
excellent long-term investment for those with the money and the
patience to ride out the company's ups and inevitable downs.
Robinson-Humphrey research associate Jeff John believes MindSpring
has long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, these dial-up providers were all supposed to go
broke because the big boys like AT&AMP;T were supposed to come along
and steal all their customers, and that hasn't been the case,''
John says. But MindSpring, along with America Online and the
aggressive Internet service provider Earthlink are still alive and
kicking. ``MindSpring is one of the highest-quality ISPs out
there,'' John says. ``They've proven that an ISP can be
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink, the one national provider most similar to MindSpring
in size and scope, hasn't seen its stock prices climb to
MindSpring's dizzying heights. Part of the reason could be the 28
percent share telecommunications company Sprint has in the company,
which could be off-putting to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a difference in company strategies. MindSpring has
opted for steady growth and profitability. Marketing is almost
exclusively word of mouth and customer retention rates are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthlink is not a profitable company, and they won't be for
about four years, which is why it's trading at a discount,'' John
points out. Earthlink's plan is to spend as much money as it takes
to acquire subscribers and become the No. 2 provider behind AOL,
which has 12 million subscribers worldwide. Earthlink has 710,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors like service providers because, unlike some other
Internet companies, they use a recurring revenue model. They charge
a monthly fee that allows analysts to make more accurate
projections. ``It takes away some of the uncertainty you have with
some Internet companies right now,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like Amazon.com are hard to put a value on
because it's hard, if not impossible, to predict how many books the
company will sell from quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say MindSpring is a solid company, whose fortunes have
been greatly increased by Wall Street's overall enthusiasm for all
things Internet. ``There are very few (Internet) companies to
invest in, and even fewer that have the profitability to back up
some of those valuations,'' John says.

 &HT;    ConsumerWatch: Customers shying away from `foreign' ATMs
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay to use bank ATM
machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe they're just getting
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Many are shifting to their own banks' machines to avoid being
charged twice for their transactions -- one fee by the bank that
owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their own, and another fee
by their own bank. At the same time, the surcharges continue to
rise, new studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys were seized by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.),
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who said recently he'll
get the Senate to vote this year on legislation to ban banks'
practice of making double charges on ATM transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of ATMs has greatly expanded. There
are now more than 150,000 automated teller machines nationwide, and
there were almost 11 billion ATM transactions last year, according
to the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rise in ATM use, however, has come a jump in the
fees charged by banks to use the ATMs. Use an ATM owned by a bank
other than your bank, and that ``foreign'' bank may charge you as
much as $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the charge can come with a double whammy, a $3 charge
if your bank also charges $1.50, which some do, for processing your
withdrawal from the other bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that customers sometimes are charged twice to
get access to their own money,'' said Robert Pregulman, an Atlanta
spokesman for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a national
consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   That consumer sentiment apparently is reflected in two recent
surveys that indicate some consumers have begun limiting their use
of ``foreign'' bank ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in April of 3,100 consumers by PSI Global, a market
research firm, found heavy ATM users -- those who conduct five or
more transactions each month -- had reduced their use of
``foreign'' ATMs by 22 percent in the last two years. They had
reduced all ATM transactions by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of the heavy users, the shifting away from
`foreign' ATMs and declining transactions, might be an indication
that the market has reached, or nearly reached an optimal price
point,'' said Mimi Rossetti, director of research for Tampa-based
PSI Global.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks don't charge their own customers for using bank-owned
ATMs, so more consumers are using them to save ATM fees. Also,
Rossetti said consumers who use ``foreign'' ATMs are apparently
withdrawing larger amounts of cash to reduce the number of
fee-charged withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``heavy users,'' PSI Global found that all
ATM users in its survey had reduced their use of ``foreign'' ATMs
by 18 percent during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   A March survey by Market Facts Inc., conducted for the ABA,
found nearly two of three consumers said they had changed their ATM
use to avoid paying fees. But the ABA used the survey to justify
charging fees for the ``convenience'' of other banks' ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees enable banks to set up many more ATMs on street
corners, and in airports, grocery stores, malls, convenience stores
and hospitals,'' said Walter A. Dodds Jr., ABA president. ``Why
should institutions give convenience away, for free, to people who
don't bank with them?''

   Take a lesson in summer survival from the folks at the border
</P>
<P>
   By Patrick Beach
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   NUEVO LAREDO, Nuevo Leon _ We came to partake of the unbearable
hotness of being. In this summer of killing, creeping, sapping
heat, we came for border hot.
</P>
<P>
   We came to see how this heat is different from the heat we've
been wilting from in Austin. We came not to escape the heat but to
complain about it in a different place _ and had we known it was
110 degrees, we would have produced an opera of complaint. Such was
our good fortune that we were here when it was, yes, that hot.
</P>
<P>
   You can say our mission was stupid; we chose to think of it as
profound. You can hurl your non-dairy whipped topping pies of
mockery and derision; we will wear them as creamy badges of honor.
</P>
<P>
   At first, before 8 a.m., it was not yet hot on the border. In
the square outside La Posada Hotel , near the bridge in Laredo,
people were waiting for buses. They were comfortable because _ and
here I'm about to introduce a fairly arcane scientific term with
which you're probably not familiar, but bear with me _ heat along
this part of the border is a ``dry heat.'' This means the relative
humidity is much lower than in Austin, where the outside air is so
saturated with water that you can't breathe without scuba gear.
This ``dry heat'' means when you step out from air conditioning
into the world of Nuevo Laredo, your glasses don't fog over like
the airstrip in ``Casablanca.'' Being outside in Austin, by
contrast, is like being a pancake slathered in butter and hot Aunt
Jemima maple syrup.
</P>
<P>
   But because of this ``dry heat,'' people were in a state of
not-hotness. To make matters worse, there was a good breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this is a city of innumerable squares, named for
revolutionaries and politicians and heroic postal officials, where
people would surely congregate to be hot. And so we paid our 35
cents to formally leave the United States and we walked across the
bridge. The south-to-north morning rush was chugging along with
pedestrians and cars full of people not breaking a sweat.
</P>
<P>
   The first square we came to contained no people being hot, just
a bunch of those large wooden shoeshine stands painted the same
unwavering institutional hospital green. We walked past the
duty-frees, the bars and restaurants, none of which contained
people being hot. We walked all the way to His Majesty the Taco,
the restaurant with the grandest name in all the world, but it was
not yet open and it was not yet hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's hot enough yet, Pat,'' Larry Kolvoord, the
photographer who came with me to chronicle the hot, said.
</P>
<P>
   We walked until we got very uncomfortable and we complained, but
no one was interesting in singing along. Hot is what it is here.
The awnings on the shop fronts roll down to about shoulder height,
so the sun isn't in your face. A few people carry umbrellas. One
woman on the street held a small battery-powered fan to the face of
her sleeping child. Hot's not news the way it is news in Dallas or
Austin or Wichita Falls. People move around and hug shade and get
through life and do not complain, as we Austinites do.
</P>
<P>
   Only the tourists complain, and there aren't that many of them
these days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody comes over,'' said Eloy Garcia, who runs a drink stand
in the market area. ``The Saturdays look like Sundays and the
Sundays look like Mondays.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia said his business was down 75 percent to 80 percent
because of the hot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's complaining,'' he said. ``I hear the crying.
``I've been here 14 years and this is the worst year ever.''
</P>
<P>
   And the Tuesdays look like ... well, they looked like plenty of
tables and no waiting, even at the venerable El Dorado Bar. The El
Dorado is better than any Mexican restaurant in Austin because the
waiters all wear natty white jackets and none of them have tongue
studs. The waiters hereare gentlemen who wait with their whole
being, who comport themselves with grace and dignity. The waiters
at the El Dorado Bar are the best waiters in civilization, and they
are reason enough to go there, although it doesn't hurt that the
place has gin fizzes and Cuban cigars.
</P>
<P>
   So we asked our waiter, ``Any people complaining about the
heat?''
</P>
<P>
   And he shook his head and smiled, as if to say, ``If I had heard
any complaints, sir, it would be indiscreet of me to pass them
along.''
</P>
<P>
   For locals, talking about the hot is like Sociology 101:
Introduction to The Obvious.
</P>
<P>
   Everywhere people kept saying things like, ``You think this is
hot? I live in Louisiana or Saudi Arabia or Alaska and that's
hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no breeze in Louisiana blowin' _ unless it's a hot
breeze,'' said Tamara Baxter of Marthaville, La. ``Our barn burned
down. That's how hot it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Next: ``As far as I'm concerned, it's hot as hell from here to
Canada,'' said Russell ``Stubby'' Turnbull, an actual Canadian who
was hot. ``It's bad at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Stubby hauls dairy cattle from Paris, Ontario, to Mexico, and
has for decades, so Stubby knows something about I-35 and hot. He
brought his wife, Joan, and one of his 22 grandchildren along on
this run, and they were all having quite a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the heat,'' said Mrs. Stubby, a k a Joan Turnbull, as
she lit a Benson &AMP; Hedges.
</P>
<P>
   Next: ``Vietnam was much worse,'' said Chuck Krumholtz of San
Marcos. ``The humidity is a lot worse there.''
</P>
<P>
   It's always worse somewhere else, and it wasn't too hot to keep
people from toiling. Vendors were still on the streets, preparing
to relieve tourists of their dollars in exchange for baskets,
Tweety Bird pin(tilde)atas, blankets, chewing gum, cartons of
cigarettes, belts, silver and marionettes. Nor was it too hot to
keep the hustlers from working: ``What you want? Women? Vitamins?''
</P>
<P>
   Relief, actually. Barring that, acceptance. And that's what we
can learn from Nuevo Laredoans: Getting cranky never chilled
anybody out. Larry and I even picked up on the vibe a little bit.
</P>
<P>
   It was 110 degrees, and we couldn't even tell. The opera closed
before it could open.

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: Fortune lists top
firms that promote, pay minorities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Fortune magazine, in its current edition, has an
ambitious new idea, a unique entry in the endless lists of ``best
companies.'' This list contains its version of the 50 best
companies in the nation for African-American, Hispanic and Asian
employees and executives.
</P>
<P>
   That may have a familiar ring. But this list, compiled with the
assistance of the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities,
grades survey participants on such wide-ranging criteria as
percentage of minorities in top-paying jobs and on boards of
directors, and presence of executives in profit-making operations
-- instead of staff jobs like public relations and community
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the survey tries to separate window dressing
from real corporate diversity.
</P>
<P>
   There were some familiar faces on the list. Detroit's Big Three
car companies made it. Bank America, Chase Manhattan and
BellAtlantic made it. Even Shoney's and Denny's made it. Some did
not. Texaco was a no-show. Even Time Warner, owner of Fortune
magazine, did not make it.
</P>
<P>
   And not a single Georgia-based company cracked the top 50. It
was a tough list. Lucent Technologies, based in Murray Hill, N.J.,
but with a huge installation here, finished 16th on the list.
Lucent won special praise for having seven minorities among its 25
highest salaried employees and for its financial support of
organizations that represent minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized until you told me that no Atlanta company was
on the list,'' said Roy S. Johnson, author of the Fortune articles
accompanying the listing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fact of the matter is that this is new,'' he said, ``and some
companies declined to participate because they did not understand
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others wondered if divulging some of the information may be an
invasion of privacy,'' said Johnson, formerly a sports columnist
for the Journal-Constitution during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Companies had to figure out the top 25 people on the payroll in
terms of annual salary and provide numbers on blacks, Hispanics and
Asians in the number. They had to tell where they concentrated
their corporate giving, winning gold stars if they helped minority
communities and financed such items as scholarships for minority
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola did participate in the survey but failed to make the
cut, finishing at 53rd on the list. Kim Price, a spokesman, said
the company was proud of its record in supporting minority
education through its foundation. And it considered its
comprehensive plan to do business with minority vendors to be a
pace-setter in industry.
</P>
<P>
   Coke placed above average in six of nine categories, Price said,
but obviously lagged elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No other prominent Atlanta area company took part in the survey,
according to the magazine. We did not take part in the survey, said
a spokesman for Cox Enterprises, the company that owns the
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fascinating features of the poll was the
presence of Advantica of Spartanburg, S.C., which owns the Denny's
chain of restaurants, as well as Shoney's of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies were involved in splashy publicity over alleged
discrimination earlier in the decade, only to rally to change their
images.
</P>
<P>
   Shoney's, according to Fortune, paid $132.8 million to settle a
class-action discrimination suit in 1992, a suit brought by 20,000
employees and rejected job applicants. Two years later, Denny's
paid $54.4 million to settle two class-action suits brought by
black customers who said they were refused service at certain
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shoney's (13th on the list) boasts 30 percent of its
store managers are minorities, and Denny's (2nd) was praised for
diversity among suppliers and the franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Abramson, chief executive of Denny's parent company
since 1995: ``White men tend to hire white men. ... I am a complete
supporter of affirmative action because I don't believe the playing
field is level. ... To undergo the kind of metamorphosis we have,
you have to take the initiative. It won't happen naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: For companies that are baffled about
ways to achieve diversity in their work forces and in their
executive suites, we now have 50 companies from every walk of life
that seem ready, willing and able to tutor them.
</P>
<P>
   CHART: The top 10 companies most comfortable for
African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians:
</P>
<P>
   1. Pacific Enterprises, a Los Angeles utility.
</P>
<P>
   2. Advantica, Spartanburg, S.C., owner
</P>
<P>
   of Denny's.
</P>
<P>
   3. BankAmerica, San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   4. Fannie Mae, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   5. Marriott International, Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   6. Applied Materials, Santa Clara, Calif., maker of
semiconductors.
</P>
<P>
   7. Edison International, Rosemead, Calif., utility.
</P>
<P>
   8. Computer Associates, Islandia, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   9. Ryder System, Miami.
</P>

 &HT;    Juno tries new tack to entice Net users
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The most coveted Internet users are the ones who don't really
know how to use the Web.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring, Earthlink, WorldNet and other Internet service
providers know the best way to garner new subscribers is to lure
light users away from services like America Online or other
``starter'' services such as the free e-mail services, including
HotMail or Juno, and ``graduate'' them to a full-fledged ISP.
</P>
<P>
   Juno (http://www.juno.com), the popular, advertiser-supported
free e-mail service, realized the day is coming when its 5.5
million users will want to do more on the Net than just send
e-mail. They are, in the words of Juno President Charles Ardai, ``a
group that has taken its first step onto the Internet.'' Rather
than watch them drift off to other ISPs, Juno has decided to try to
become an ISP itself.
</P>
<P>
   Last Monday, the company unveiled two additional levels of
service: Juno Gold and Juno Web. Juno Gold goes beyond the free
e-mail service, adding the ability to send and receive graphic
attachments such as spreadsheets, pictures and other non-text
attachments.
</P>
<P>
   Juno Web will give users Web browsing capabilities using either
Netscape or Internet Explorer browsers. Search engine Lycos
(http://www.lycos.com) will provide the gateway, or portal, for the
Juno Web users. Juno Gold will be priced at $2.95 per month, while
Juno Web will cost $19.95 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Chernins, Juno's executive vice president, said the new Juno
services make the company into a ``full-fledged online service that
will offer choices to our users.'' With more than 5 million Juno
users, the company's ISP venture has the potential to become one of
the nation's largest ISPs, although the company won't say how much
of its user base it expects to convert to the paid services.
</P>
<P>
   Juno has critics
</P>
<P>
   But offering e-mail and Web browsing does not an online service
make, according to Forrester Research analyst Chris Charron. ``To
call Juno the second-largest ISP after America Online is stretching
the definition a little,'' he says. ``Lycos' content may help Juno
provide better value that may result in more paying customers. But
sandwiching e-mail together with portal content doesn't guarantee
success as an online service.''
</P>
<P>
   Charron says there are a lot of ``pieces of the puzzle'' Juno
needs to add to its mix before it can call itself a full-fledged
online service.
</P>
<P>
   However, Charron still says Juno's partnership with Lycos is a
good deal for both parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lycos) may help improve the prospects for people signing up,
but it doesn't automatically make them a portal site,'' Charron
says. ``But if they want to build their e-mail service into
something more, this is a good first start.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Lycos, Charron says, ``Lycos needs traffic, and the deal
with Juno brings them added distribution. It's the opportunity to
put Lycos in front of another 5 million people.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite Juno's big ISP plans, Chernins says Juno will never
abandon its free e-mail model. ``Some people will still only want
to send e-mail at no cost,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``But hopefully, significant numbers of users will graduate to
the other services. We think newbies and users will want choices.
It's not a one-size-fits-all proposition. We think a significant
portion of our user base will subscribe to one or more as our
business evolves.''
</P>
<P>
   Chernins says Juno also plans to offer other products to
subscribers after Juno Gold and Juno Web are well established.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've cultivated 5 million pairs of eyeballs, and if we can
convert a portion of that, we'll have a significant business,''
Chernins says. ``We believe they will be terrific retention tools
as well.''

 &HT;    OneClick a fine shortcut for many repetitive tasks
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OneClick is software that lives up to the Mac ideal. It not only
makes computing easy, it's fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad, considering OneClick is not a game but something
called a utility. It expands what your Mac can do.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind OneClick is simple. It reduces nearly any
repetitive task on your computer to a button click.
</P>
<P>
   That includes changing fonts, copying text and more complicated
chores such as inserting boilerplate text into e-mail. OneClick can
do all this and more.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick works through a motif of buttons and palettes. Every
palette displays a collection of buttons, and each button performs
a task.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick comes with lots of pre-configured palettes and buttons
that are ready to use. You'll find global palettes that include
buttons automating things such as closing windows and emptying the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   And there are application palettes for programs such as
PhotoShop and ClarisWorks. These palettes only appear when you're
using an application.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning. You can make your own palettes
from scratch, selecting everything from the shape of the button to
the background color of the palette.
</P>
<P>
   Creating buttons from scratch is easy, too. OneClick will record
a series of actions, such as copying text, and save them on a
button.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can write your own scripts with OneClick's own
programming language called EasyScript. Matt Neuburg, a reviewer
with Mac newsletter TidBits, said EasyScript ``is spectacularly
well thought out and easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to learn EasyScript or OneClick's record
functions to add new buttons and palettes. Others are creating new
ones all the time and posting them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick has collected and organized them on its Web site at
http://www.westcodesoft
</P>
<P>
   .com. Check the list often, because it's always being updated.
Downloading and adding other palettes to your computer is easy.
</P>
<P>
   While it generally works great, OneClick is not without bugs. I
found it does slow the general speed of your system. In addition,
it messed around with the performance of some programs such as
Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick can also make your screen a cluttered mess, with all
its different palettes. But the company has licked that problem by
letting you easily hide any or all of them.
</P>
<P>
   You can control OneClick through a pull-down button the program
puts in the upper right hand corner of your menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick is a powerful program with many, many features. I've
just scratched the surface here. To learn more about the program
and what others have to say about it, check out reviews in MacWorld
and MacAddict magazines. You'll also find user comments at the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Westcode Software, OneClick sells for about $70.
The best place to buy it is from the company's Web site.

 &HT;    Money Talk: More women preparing for retirement
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Women, nudged by necessity and the ever-hungry
financial services industry, are getting more active and more savvy
about saving for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of all women now put something into savings before
they pay their bills. That's lower than the 36 percent recorded by
men, but survey sponsor Merrill Lynch says the gap is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of women own stocks and bonds, according to
another survey. That's up from 53 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an encouraging statistic, provided by the National Center
for Women and Retirement Research: 94 percent of women believe they
are as capable as men when it comes to understanding money and
investing. On the other hand, women need to pay attention to their
retirement plans. Much more than men do, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Women live longer than men -- six years longer, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics. That means they have more
retirement years to finance.
</P>
<P>
   Women earn less money than men. That makes it no surprise they
save less: 1.5 percent of their income, vs. 3.1 percent for men,
says the Mutual Fund Education Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Women work fewer years and change jobs more frequently. Thus,
they can expect smaller paybacks from Social Security and pension
programs. Indeed, two out of three women have no pension plans at
all, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That all adds up to the need for many women to sharpen their
financial skills. Here are some ways to go about it:
</P>
<P>
   -- Put yourself first. ``It's not selfish to save for
yourself,'' said Ellen O. Keller, a certified financial planner in
Roswell. ``It's a gift to your family and loved ones, because they
won't have to take care of you when you're older. Everyone I know
wants their parents to have a nice life, and they don't want to
have to worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't succumb to fear. You may well need professional
advisers to formulate or just to polish your plans. But most people
can learn how to manage money and to plan for retirement. The
resource list on this page will give you some starting points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to give yourself time,'' said Keller. ``You can
say to yourself, `This is like someone is paying me money to learn
this. Maybe on Sunday afternoon I'm going to spend an hour or two
just reading.' Part of your budgeting is budgeting time to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Be persistent. Mary Ellen Garrett, a financial consultant
with Merrill Lynch in Atlanta, recommends you find experts --
perhaps at commercially sponsored seminars -- and grill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to ask questions,'' she said. ``This is your
business. You need to ask questions until you're comfortable with
the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Take it one step at a time. Keller suggests breaking these
sometimes complicated processes into manageable steps. Getting
debts under control is one step. Saving up an emergency fund is
another. Finding money to invest is yet another.
</P>
<P>
   -- Start saving now. If your employer offers a 401(k), join it.
``You need to contribute as much as you can possibly afford, and
especially you need to contribute enough to take advantage of the
company match,'' said Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   An individual retirement account, especially a Roth IRA, is
another inviting possibility for retirement saving. ``Saving is
really more a function of attitude than income,'' said Garrett.
``Everybody can find someplace to save a few dollars. If you start
saving now, it will be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't be too conservative. ``Women often don't understand how
conservative investments are risky, because of inflation,'' Keller
observed.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other advisers, she recommends putting some portion of
retirement savings into the stock market, even in your senior
years. ``I see women who are 70, and they might live till they're
90,'' she said. ``They have conservative investments, and they're
getting poorer every year.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Know your retirement rights. It's important not just to
understand how your own pension works but how a spouse's plan is
set up. For a good introduction to the topic, check out the
consumer information at the Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration Web site, http://www.dol.gov/dol

 &HT;    Instructional software can help budding virtuosos hone their
musical skills
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music, Plato said, gives flight to the imagination and soul to
the universe. It also can be a balm for the spirit in the midst of
high-speed American life.
</P>
<P>
   But Plato lived in a simpler era, when demands on time were
fewer, and budding lyre virtuosos could spend all day learning the
intricacies and techniques of playing the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you or your child is ready to give piano or guitar
lessons a whirl, but you're worried there aren't enough hours in
the day, don't panic. Help is on the way, courtesy of the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Music instruction has vaulted into the future with software that
teaches basic music theory and technique in a form with which both
children and adult beginners are comfortable. Hundreds of sites on
the World Wide Web also offer help, whether you're interested in
learning about autoharps or zithers.
</P>
<P>
   No software or computerized guidance can replace the subtlety,
experience and ear of a flesh-and-blood teacher, but for many
parents or novices such programs can be a good first step in
finding out whether aptitude or interest justify investing in
formal lessons, which average $15 a half-hour, or instruments,
which can cost several hundred dollars, even for models made for
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instructional software costs between $45 and $99,
but requires a MIDI-capable, 16-bit or better sound card and a MIDI
keyboard. Many titles will run on Windows 3.1, and most have
Macintosh versions. MIDI _ musical instrument digital interface _
is what lets a sound device ``talk'' to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Piano is still the instrument most parents want their children
to learn, says Kenon Renfrow, a music professor at the University
of Miami at Coral Gables. Renfrow, a keyboard specialist, also
serves as a software consultant for the Cincinnati-based Music
Teachers National Association. It's guitar titles, though, that
grab the lion's share of shelf space at many music and computer
stores. The same is true on the Web, where a mind-boggling number
of sites are devoted to the ``ax.''

   ``One of the biggest advantages of using technology in music is
that students can get instant feedback'' on how they're doing,
Renfrow said, and perform at their own pace. Several instructors
said beginner-level software is an excellent reinforcement for
theoretical concepts, and that young students seem to retain them
better.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teachers find this computer assist to be a useful
tool, though all emphasize the need for individualized instruction
to take students to their highest potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a box or computer program you can plug into a
wall and replace a teacher,'' Renfrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Some software packages that retail for less than $200 come with
a 49-key keyboard and all the necessary MIDI cables or connectors.
Two of the most popular are Piano Discovery System from Jump! Music
and the Family Music Center Play Piano from Midisoft.
</P>
<P>
   Piano Discovery System ($169) uses multimedia and games to
present music theory and basic note-reading. Once you've learned a
song, the software takes you to a ``performance hall,'' where you
play the piece with synthesized orchestral accompaniment. The
software then generates a review of your playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Midisoft title ($199) relies less on multimedia and offers
less step-by-step guidance, according to reviewers. After you
finish a section, the software scores you and highlights where you
hit the wrong notes.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice for teaching children the fundamentals is
Harmonic Vision's Music Ace ($49.95), which has garnered an
``outstanding'' rating from Children's Software Revue. There are
Windows and Mac versions available, and you can download a free
demo from the company's Web site (http://www.harmonicvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/). A MIDI keyboard is optional, not required, which makes
the software a good value.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are intent on being the next Andres Segovia or Jimi
Hendrix have a slew of choices, but reviewers have been most
impressed by Seattle-based eMedia's Guitar Method 1, for Windows 95
or Windows 3.1, which offers 60 lessons on the basics. You can use
either acoustic or electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a second level available as students progress
that covers barre chords, music notation and scales, and licks like
hammer-ons, pull-offs and bends. Both titles include visual tuners
and digital metronomes, and retail for $59.95 _ about the price of
three lessons with an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Guitropolis ($49.95) from Alfred Publishing takes the form of an
adventure game, but includes method-only versions of Alfred's
well-regarded Basic Guitar Method and Teach Yourself To Play
Guitar. Both provide solid instruction, reviewers say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another readily available option is G-Vox Guitar ($99.99,
for Windows 95) by G-Vox Entertainment. It includes all the
necessary hardware, as well as a music notation component. The
title comes with a pickup to attach either an electric or acoustic
guitar. A caution here, though: The instrument must have steel
strings, which can be devastating to uncallused fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may have changed, but there is at least one
element of learning music that hasn't changed since Plato's day: If
you want to get to the top, it's practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a string thing
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sites on the World Wide Web that offer music
instruction or guidance on how to obtain information on learning to
play a range of instruments.

 &HT;    Even in hand-held models, Windows has a foothold
 &HT;    By Brit Hume &AMP; T.R. Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows CE is Microsoft's Windows 95 look-alike operating system
for hand-held and palmtop PCs. Rolled out with much ceremony at a
big computer trade show in 1996, Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is
determined to compete in every market where a rival operating
system might gain some traction, as has occurred with the
proprietary systems built into such hand-held devices as 3Com's
highly popular PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Before you drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what ``CE''
stands for, here is what Microsoft itself says about that: ``CE
doesn't represent a single concept, but rather implies a number of
Windows CE design precepts, including `Compact, Connectable,
Compatible and Companion.''' In other words, nothing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows CE, now in version 2.0, is designed to work with
tiny palmtop devices with green monochrome displays, it seems more
in its element in hand-held PCs with color screens and keyboards,
such as the Sharp Mobilon 4600, which is where we tested it. You
turn on the computer, and, presto, there is the Windows CE opening
screen, which looks almost exactly like the Windows 95 desktop,
complete with taskbar, Start button and icons representing the
Recycle Bin, My Handheld PC (like My Computer), Inbox and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you will find icons representing a set of
``pocket'' versions of major Microsoft Office applications,
including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet Explorer. All are
bare-bones versions of their larger cousins, but have surprising
power considering their size. Pocket Word, for example, now
includes a spell checker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Justice Department's attitude toward the inclusion of
Internet Explorer with Windows 95 and Windows 98, one can only
imagine what it would say about the bundling of all these
``pocket'' versions of Windows applications with Windows CE. So
far, though, no sign of any intention to sue. Perhaps that's
because Netscape has not yet developed a version of its Navigator
Web browser for Windows CE, and the Justice Department seems to
regard protecting Netscape's market share as one of its primary
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you do with your Windows CE device, you will
surely want to do two things: connect to your desktop computer to
share information and connect with the Internet to check your
e-mail and browse the Web. Connection to your desktop is relatively
simple via a serial cable. You must load Windows CE
``synchronization'' software from an included CD to your desktop
system. Once that's done, you will be able to exchange files
between the My Documents folders on both computers.
</P>
<P>
   You will also be able to transfer such things as e-mail messages
from the Inbox or Outlook windows of your desktop to and from the
Inbox program on your hand-held. You can also exchange data between
Microsoft's SchedulePlus on your desktop and the Calendar program
on your hand-held. The same for information in your hand-held's
Contacts application and your desktop's Outlook program.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the Web by a dial-up connection is a more complex
matter. You must use the Remote Networking utility in the
Communications folder found in the programs menu. It is similar to
the dial-up networking procedure in Windows 95, but different
enough that it may take you a while to get it right, especially
since there are some arcane commands you may need to enter under a
tab called Dialing Patterns found under the Communications icon in
the Windows CE Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get this right and get your modem to dial and log on to
your network or Internet service provider, you may be sorely
disappointed in the speed of Pocket Internet Explorer. Even with a
33.6k bps modem, pages load at a glacial pace, and you may be
wondering if you are even achieving a 28.8k bps connection, let
alone anything higher. Unfortunately, Windows CE, unlike Windows
95, does not tell you how fast your connection is, so you are left
to wonder. The good news is when you are first dialing in, Windows
CE seems to get you through the log-on process much faster than
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   You are likely to be much happier with your e-mail performance.
Most messages come through quickly, and while Windows CE's Inbox is
not the most full-featured of programs, it is easy to use and does
the job well enough. Given the size of most hand-held keyboards,
you are not likely to be sending many long outgoing messages
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Printing can be a nuisance, since you can only print directly
from Pocket Word or Excel. You must use a serial cable or infrared
connection to your printer. Most printers do not have such a
connection, so you must fall back on transferring your file to your
desktop and printing from there. Ouch.

   NEWSSTAND _ Rundown of what's on the newsstand this week.
(O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   SEASON _ What kind of TV season is just around the corner? One
thing's for sure: of the 37 new shows there's not one ``ER'', not
one ``Friends,'' not one ``Ally McBeal'' _ nothing so far to
indicate there's a single freshman series that'll take viewers by
storm. (Kloer, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

   BOOK-AA _ Alcoholic Anonymous is credited with saving millions
who have drinking problems, but 70 percent of AA members will
relapse within five years. In a new book, ``How Alcoholics
Anonymous Failed Me,'' Marianne Gilliam of Conyers, Ga., asserts
that true recovery from addiction is possible only when the addict
takes control and no longer considers himself or herself a victim.
(O'Briant, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   BOOK-SINGLE _ Single women have been portrayed as wallflowers,
predatory divorcees, man-hating career women, and welfare moms. But
for the most part, they have never been viewed as a collective
force. Marcelle Clements goes a long way toward remedying that
oversight in her new book, ``The Improvised Woman: Single Women
Reinventing Single Life'' (Norton). (Warmbold, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.
</P>
<P>
   RYAN _ An immense debt of gratitude is owed historian Stephen E.
Ambrose, whose work inspired ``Saving Private Ryan.'' He is
credited as the film's consultant although he was consulted only
after the film was shot. But the biggest debt we owe is to the men
and women who fought, bled and died in that global conflict. It is
impossible to overstate the debt that free people of the world owe
them. (Garcia, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

teens, one of the largest national gatherings of young Christians
ever, are in Atlanta this week, part of the National Lutheran Youth
Conference. Henry, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) ETA 8 p.m. ET.

   GOING-SOUTH _ NUEVO LAREDO, Nuevo Leon _ We came to partake of
the unbearable hotness of being. In this summer of killing,
creeping, sapping heat, we came for border hot. We came to see how
this heat is different from the heat we've been wilting from in
Austin. We came not to escape the heat but to complain about it in
a different place _ and had we known it was 110 degrees, we would
have produced an opera of complaint. Such was our good fortune that
we were here when it was, yes, that hot. (Beach, Austin

<P>
   BLACK-PUBLISHING _ Over the past decade, African American
bookstores have flourished and faltered. They've provided a
valuable service to their communities by providing an outlet for
African American writings that were hard to find at mainstream
bookstores, by aiding the fight against illiteracy, by buying books
from small presses and distributors and by giving once-emerging
black authors, such as Naylor and Terry McMillan, a chance by
personally promoting their early books. (Martin, Austin

operation is under way in the wake of summer wildfires.

   CONSUMER-WATCH _ ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay
to use bank ATM machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe
they're just getting smarter. Many are shifting to their own banks'
machines to avoid being charged twice for their transactions -- one
fee by the bank that owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their
own, and another fee by their own bank. At the same time, the
surcharges continue to rise, new studies show. (Tharpe, Atlanta

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a
thousand participants at a World Future Society conference mulled
over forecasts for the 21st century, trying to discern what changes
would be coming around the 2000 bend. While opinions varied on many
issues, the futurists seemed to have little doubt about this: Women
will become the dominant players in the economy and the home. The
futurists referred to ``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost
certain outcome of the ``post-divorce'' society. (Geewax, Atlanta

Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is determined to compete in every

   JUNO _ The most coveted Internet users are the ones who don't
really know how to use the Web. Juno (http://www.juno.com), the
popular, advertiser-supported free e-mail service, realized the day
is coming when its 5.5 million users will want to do more on the
Net than just send e-mail. They are, in the words of Juno President
Charles Ardai, ``a group that has taken its first step onto the
Internet.'' Rather than watch them drift off to other ISPs, Juno
has decided to try to become an ISP itself. (Katz, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MAC-REPORT _ OneClick is software that lives up to the Mac
ideal. It not only makes computing easy, it's fun, too. That's not
bad, considering OneClick is not a game but something called a
utility. It expands what your Mac can do. (Haddad, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MINDSPRING _ It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath.
Watching the soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service
provider MindSpring elicits a similar feeling. MindSpring founder
and Chairman Charles Brewer cut his vacation short to appear on
CNBC. When asked what was the secret to the Internet service
provider's success, Brewer replied with what is becoming the
MindSpring mantra: Keeping costs down and customers happy is the
key to profitability. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   MUSIC-SOFTWARE _ Music instruction has vaulted into the future
with software that teaches basic music theory and technique in a
form with which both children and adult beginners are comfortable.
Hundreds of sites on the World Wide Web also offer help, whether
you're interested in learning about autoharps or zithers.

 &HT;    After the fires, the logging begins
 &HT;    By Jenny Staletovich
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIGER BAY STATE FOREST _ These days the woods echo not with the
song of birds or rustle of wildlife, but the racket of giant saws,
bulldozers and lumberjacks measuring their harvest.
</P>
<P>
   All around central and northern Florida, a massive logging
operation is under way in the wake of summer wildfires.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500,000 acres that burned in the fires that started
Memorial Day weekend and led to the evacuation of about 112,000
residents, half was forest _ some plantations, some state lands and
some private property leased for timber. Now the clock is ticking
to get burned wood cut and to mills before it rots or is ruined by
pesky beetles, further harming the state's $9 billion a year timber
industry.
</P>
<P>
   But beating the clock isn't the only problem.
</P>
<P>
   A glut created by early harvesting during an exceptionally dry
winter and the falling Asian economy means a lot of wood will never
make it to a mill. Some say as many as 2 million cords of wood _ or
well over 5.5 million tons _ will go to waste.
</P>
<P>
   ``This couldn't have happened at a worse time,'' said Leon
Irvin, a silviculturist for the Florida Division of Forestry.
``Nobody really knows (how much will be lost). We've not had an
accurate assessment of the damage,''
</P>
<P>
   For Derrick Miller, a state ranger at Tiger Bay who tends his
forest like it is his own garden, the past months have been
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the forest as my child,'' he said one day this week as
he watched a bulldozer that gathers logs, called a skidder,
lurching through his woods, a wide swath flattened in its wake. Up
to 65 percent of the 43,500-acre forests in Tiger Bay and Lake
George park was burned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an emergency situation and if it will save the rest of
the forest, we have to do it. But it bothers me greatly.'' EARLY
HARVEST ERODES PRICE
</P>
<P>
   Florida is filled with woods. You might not see it from the
highway, but the checkerboard of palmetto prairies that inhabit
rare patches of undeveloped land in the southern half of the state
gives way to vast stretches of thick pine forests north of Orlando.
</P>
<P>
   Logging first arrived in the 1800s, when valuable yellow pine
was shipped worldwide. But eventually heavy cutting left stands
barren, said Charles Maynard, chief of the forest management bureau
for the Florida Division of Forestry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of a cut and get out type situation. Logging
companies would come in and remove the existing timber and get out
without much regard for the forests,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then in the 1920s, realizing it was driving itself toward
extinction, the timber industry banded together to find ways to
nurture forests and establish ground rules for harvests, Maynard
said. In 1927 the state founded its Division of Forestry and hired
foresters to help the industry manage lands, replant woods and
control fires, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, nearly 15 million acres is harvested for timber, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific, which manages 5.8 million acres in North
America to produce $2.5 billion worth of wood, owns 586,000 acres
just in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the fire, a lot of wood is being harvested
prematurely, meaning an excess of pulp wood and a drastic drop in
price.
</P>
<P>
   Miller says his pulp wood, which brought $20 a ton last year, is
being auctioned at just $7 a ton. Lumber is also down by half,
going for only $20 a ton, he said. In addition, mills swamped with
wood are getting pickier about the wood they take and refusing a
lot of pulp wood, said state forester David Creamer.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that wood is slash pine, planted in place of native long
leaf pine on many plantations because it grows quickly. (Trees for
lumber are cut usually at age 30; pulp wood after 20 years.) While
plantations continue to grow slash, state and national foresters
are replanting with fire resistant long leaf. CUTTING WITH CARE
</P>
<P>
   In Ocala National Forest, about 250 acres of burned wood will be
auctioned for harvesting.
</P>
<P>
   This week rangers who normally cut trees only to thin woods so
forests can grow heartier, walked through charred stands marking
plots for logging. In an hour's time, Charlie Caughlin, a district
manager with the U.S. Forest Service, and his crew of three had
marked a stand that took 30 years to grow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yellow pine, seven, 35! Yellow pine, 14, 55!'' ranger Mike
Williams yelled, ticking off measurements of condemned trees, their
diameter and height.
</P>
<P>
   Forest floors usually made impassable by palmetto and oak are a
blanket of soot. Stripped naked, forests reveal what normally is
hidden: gopher tortoise holes, chicken wire wrapped around what was
once a marijuana plant, and piles and piles of trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Swinus Americanus,'' Caughlin says as he points to another
mound of beer cans.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, foresters can still feel heat coming from the ground.
</P>
<P>
   After the foresters measure and mark the trees with nontoxic
paint, they will feed the numbers into a computer program that
determines the volume of wood in a stand and then auction it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a real dilemma for us,'' Caughlin said as he described
how he would cut some trees in a stand but leave others for seeding
or to provide natural habitat for woodpeckers and other wildlife.
``One thing we don't want to do is any more harm to an area.''
HEALING BEGINS
</P>
<P>
   Miles away off State Road 40 in a forest owned by the Hunter's
Ridge subdivision in Ormond Beach, lumberjacks will take less care.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the state and national lands, these stretches are crops
for Georgia Pacific, pure and simple.
</P>
<P>
   In a day, Jack Wilkinson, who works for Mills Wood in Palatka,
says he can load more than 2,200 trees on trucks bound for
Georgia-Pacific's Palatka mill. His cousin Terry, a
fourth-generation lumberjack, will cut 100 trees in a half hour.
</P>
<P>
   When Terry Wilkinson started logging 25 years ago at 14, he used
a chainsaw. His father, who also started logging at 14, used a
hand-held saw and carried a bottle of kerosene to dissolve gooey
turpentine. Hydraulics replaced all that, Wilkinson said.
</P>
<P>
   Today he drives a buncher, a bulldozer outfitted with a giant
saw that makes 1,150 revolutions per second and can cut through a
22-inch thick tree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I got air-conditioning and stereo. That's a long way from
toting a saw,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the weather, rangers and lumberjacks will have
about a month or so to harvest wood for lumber, longer for pulp
wood. Mills are rushing to install irrigation to keep logs wet, and
making it last longer. Gov. Lawton Chiles also lifted weight limits
on some roads so more wood can be carried to mills.
</P>
<P>
   While the woods may be noisy these days, rangers say once the
harvest is over, replanting can begin and nature will quickly heal.
Already signs of life abound. A raccoon scurried through Tiger Bay
one afternoon this week. Just two days earlier, Miller said he and
a logging crew encountered two deer. The trees, fed on a healthy
diet of nutrients left behind by the burned forests, will grow
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told my daddy they're gonna run out,'' of forests,
Terry Wilkinson said. ``He said they never would. Seems to me it
just keeps growing and growing.''

 &HT;    History and 'reel' history
 &HT;    By Arnold Garcia, Jr.
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan'' opened last week following a public
relations campaign obviously planned as meticulously as the
invasion of Europe in 1944. The extensive public relations barrage
included an assertion that Steven Spielberg, the movie's director,
can be credited with reviving interest in World War II.
</P>
<P>
   If the movie has the effect of sparking interest in that
monumental effort, we should all be appropriately grateful. As an
aside, however, I wish that the hype surrounding the movie didn't
rewrite history. The Normandy invasion was the ``last great
invasion of the last great war,'' according to the advertisement
hoopla. That bit of public relations hyperbole overlooks the Iwo
Jima and Okinawa invasions in the Pacific Theater. But then, the
war in the Pacific usually gets short shrift.
</P>
<P>
   An immense debt of gratitude is owed historian Stephen E.
Ambrose, whose work inspired the movie. He is credited as the
film's consultant although he was consulted only after the film was
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest debt we owe is to the men and women who fought,
bled and died in that global conflict. It is impossible to
overstate the debt that free people of the world owe them.
</P>
<P>
   Revisionists claim lamely that the war was a clash of competing
economies for market share. While wars usually have economic
overtones, I doubt those revisionists would relish the thought of
living in a country occupied by Nazi Germany or Imperial Japan.
</P>
<P>
   At D-Day Plus 54 years, the glow of victory and the distance
from it make it easy to forget that the outcome of the war was far
from certain even as late as 1943. The success of Operation
Overlord, the Normandy invasion, was so iffy that Dwight
Eisenhower, supreme commander of the Allied Expeditionary Force,
drafted a statement to be issued in the event that the invasion
troops were repelled.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end the fate of the free world rested with some very
young, very scared troops who maneuvered through the water, past
the obstacles and who overcame intense enemy fire and their own
survival instincts to carry the longest day.
</P>
<P>
   The troops who accomplished that mission were not professional
soldiers, but citizen soldiers. These were people who answered the
call, accomplished the mission and went home.
</P>
<P>
   I have often asked my father, a veteran of the war in the
Pacific, if he had any idea at the time how his service fit into
the grand sweep of history. He replies with shrugged shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   He has never said so, but the question may strike him as rather
silly. After all, a soldier's lot is to follow orders and try to
survive, not reflect on how the experience is going to fit in a
history book.
</P>
<P>
   It has been two and half generations since a WWII-scale
mobilization has been undertaken, and I can't help but wonder how
citizens of the United States in the waning years of this century
would respond to that kind of call. Vietnam made draft-dodging
socially acceptable. The all-volunteer military makes service and
sacrifice somebody else's thing for most middle-class young people.
</P>
<P>
   But as Jimmy Buffet wrote, they can go to movies and see it all
there. But you don't have to go to movies to see it all. Talking to
those who lived through the war and survived it while they are
still here to tell it firsthand is best.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes to remind us of what it took to make the lives
we now enjoy is most welcome, whether it's a Spielberg movie or an
Ambrose book.
</P>
<P>
   But the best source are those people in their 70s who lived
through it. Talk to them, they'll tell you.
</P>
<P>
   Don't forget to thank them.

 &HT;    Fighting drought in North Georgia vineyard a labor of love
 &HT;    By Martha Ezzard
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA- Hurry and get on up here _ we need help with the bucket
brigade,'' pleaded my husband from our Tiger, Ga. farm .
</P>
<P>
   ``Where's our crackerjack fire department?'' I asked, referring
to Tiger's first and only shiny new red fire engine, the
christening of which was occasion for a town barbecue and blessings
by the itinerant Baptist preacher not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my grapes that are buring up,'' he said, with a tone of
disbelief that I didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   We have five acres of wine grapes planted on our north Georgia
farm, and our some of ourvines are beginning to wilt in the
drought. In fact, we're into our fourth week of no rain in Tiger,
though there have been thunderstorms in other parts the county_
lightning and thunder we could see and hear just two or three
maddening miles away.
</P>
<P>
   Last season we fought off a harsh late freeze that turned the
first delicate green buds to brown in early May. (Fortunately, wine
grapes produce a second bud, but frost limits the quantity of the
harvest). This year, though, the grapes are voluptuous , their
tentacles twining in and out of perfectly formed clusters of
grapes_ a match for any Napa Valley scene.
</P>
<P>
   My husband John , who was born in the shadow of Tiger Mountain,
looked up last week-end and swore the leaves on the poplar trees
high up were turning up on the edges, a sure sign of rain , he
declared.
</P>
<P>
   But seven or eight more dry days and nights have passed. It's as
if some devious trickster had spread a giant invisible umbrella
right over Tiger. For it has rained just three miles away in
Clayton, and the hills of Western North Carolina, a little further
north, are fairly drenched . Meanwhile our poor vineyard rain
gauges are nothing more than worthless gadgets. Our woes,though,
aren't nearly as crucial as those of our farmer neighbors whose
corn and beans are shriveling in a manner similar to the farm crops
in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   The European grapes we've cultivated, the Cabernet Francs and
others, are planted deeper and aren't suffering like the Nortons,
our singular American variety. In fact, the French say a dry season
that makes the vines struggle also makes them produce a finer
tasting grape and a superior wine. But the American grapes remind
of moody and undisciplined children , harder to train on the wires
because of their tendency to wind off in directions, as if trying
to choke each other in some schoolyard scuffle. Now, because of
their shallower root system they're beginning to droop, while their
European cousins send roots far down into the earth to grab
whatever moisture they can.
</P>
<P>
   Dry as the poor Norton grapes are, I balked at the idea of
hauling buckets of water up and down the rolling hills of our
vineyard. It seems so primitive, I complained, remembering how we'd
boasted of our state- of- the- art ``Geneva curtain'' trellises
that keep the grapes divided and don't allow them to grow together
in old-style canopy form. The new trellis system lets the grapes
get more sun, and allows the air to move in and out of the vines,
warding off various types of fungus endemic to humid climates. We
have ``open lyre'' trellises for our European grapes which grow
upward instead of flopping down over the wires like the American
grapes want to do.
</P>
<P>
   I 've always said the open trellises look like giant metal arms
lifted skyward in prayer.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they are praying for rain, I muttered to John.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wanna lift or pour,'' was his only reply.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Where is the fat man?
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. It's the right time: a torpid mid-afternoon in
July. It's the right place: an unassuming white frame house on a
quiet corner
</P>
<P>
   in Key West. It's the right weather: sweltering.
</P>
<P>
   Even the man on the barstool next to me is the right man.
</P>
<P>
   But where is the fat man?
</P>
<P>
   I drop my straw bag on the bar and order a G&AMP;T, lime but no ice.
Overhead, a paddle fan clicks through its monotonous rotation. I
kick
</P>
<P>
   off a shoe and let my toes search listlessly for the cool metal
of a footrest. The metal is there but it isn't cool. About the same
</P>
<P>
   temperature as the ocean just down the street I'm thinking -
tepid.
</P>
<P>
   I nod thanks to the bartender, reach for the already dripping
glass, and take a look around. Five people. Two stools to my left,
a gray beard
</P>
<P>
   with sandals, reading the morning paper and sipping something
short and mean looking. Down at the end, a tired, middle-aged
couple. She's
</P>
<P>
   wearing a flowered dress and a flushed face. He looks overspent.
Tourists.
</P>
<P>
   The man seated next to me watches as I watch. He's curious but
silent. Finally, I ask him: ``Have you seen the fat man?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not today,'' he grins, picking up on my derailed train of
thought. ``Too hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed, I swear. ``Damn! He should have been here.'' I'm
thinking to myself, if ever there was a place where the fat man in
the white suit
</P>
<P>
   and Panama hat should have shown up, it is right here on this
stinkin' hot little spit of land where the Gulf of Mexico and the
Atlantic run
</P>
<P>
   together, and where Castro is 80 miles closer than Cocoanut
Grove. As an afterthought I add, ``...even if he didn't bring the
parrot.''
</P>
<P>
   The next barstool smiles. His teeth are straight. No curled lip.
No lisp. I practice my one-eyebrow raise. ``You're not Bogart?''
</P>
<P>
   Regretfully, he shakes his head and counters: ``You're not
Bacall?'' He's quick. I like that.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' I glumly confess, ``but you can call me Betty if you
want to.'' He does.
</P>
<P>
   Another sweep of the bar - still no fat man. He'd stand out in
this crowd. Reaching for my purse, I turn to the man who isn't
Bogart, lower
</P>
<P>
   my voice half-an-octave and, shooting for sultry, purr: ``I'm
leaving, but remember, if you want anything, all you have to do is
whistle.'' He's
</P>
<P>
   still smiling. I carry on. ``You know how to whistle, don't you
Steve? You just put your lips together and blow.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who isn't Steve goes for it but a benign chuckle catches
him off guard and he can't pucker. ``'To Have and Have Not'.
Right?'' I ask
</P>
<P>
   him how he knew.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's this place'' he says making a half-turn to take it all
in. ``It could be Martinique - 1940, and we could've been waiting
here for days
</P>
<P>
   for the fat man to return our passports so we can get out of the
country before it's too late.''
</P>
<P>
   I like the way this story is going and can't resist suggesting:
``If we're stuck here too long, I'll take a job singing at the bar.
It'll pay
</P>
<P>
   the rent and keep us in cracked conch.''
</P>
<P>
   The man who can't whistle, can't lie either and the smallest
hint of a grimace mixes with his smile. He's heard me sing so he
changes the
</P>
<P>
   subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ready for lunch?'' he asks. ``Doesn't look like the fat man is
going to show.'' We wander inside for seafood and gazpacho.
</P>
<P>
   Nostalgia comes in oddly wrapped packages; today, it's an old
house in Key West, on the corner of Caroline and Whitehead. The
brick steps
</P>
<P>
   leading up to Kelly's Caribbean Bar and Grill seduced two old
friends right back into a piece of Florida and a spot in time that
we had known
</P>
<P>
   as kids - a time when magic was still happening.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is not Bogart and the woman who is not Bacall are
old friends - about 48 years worth.
</P>
<P>
   As we move past the bar on our way out, I leave word with the
bartender: ``If you see the fat man, tell him we're looking for
him. We'll be back.''
</P>
<P>
   I never look back.

valuable service to their communities by providing an outlet for
African American writings that were hard to find at mainstream
bookstores, by aiding the fight against illiteracy, by buying books
from small presses and distributors and by giving once-emerging
black authors, such as Naylor and Terry McMillan, a chance by
personally promoting their early books. (Martin, Austin
American-Statesman) MOVED.

   FLORIDA-LOGGING _ TIGER BAY STATE FOREST _ These days the woods
echo not with the song of birds or rustle of wildlife, but the
racket of giant saws, bulldozers and lumberjacks measuring their
harvest. All around central and northern Florida, a massive logging
operation is under way in the wake of summer wildfires.

   CONSUMER-WATCH _ ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay
to use bank ATM machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe
they're just getting smarter. Many are shifting to their own banks'
machines to avoid being charged twice for their transactions -- one
fee by the bank that owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their
own, and another fee by their own bank. At the same time, the
surcharges continue to rise, new studies show. (Tharpe, Atlanta

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a
thousand participants at a World Future Society conference mulled
over forecasts for the 21st century, trying to discern what changes
would be coming around the 2000 bend. While opinions varied on many
issues, the futurists seemed to have little doubt about this: Women
will become the dominant players in the economy and the home. The
futurists referred to ``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost
certain outcome of the ``post-divorce'' society. (Geewax, Atlanta

   PALMTOP-WINDOWS _ Windows CE is Microsoft's Windows 95
look-alike operating system for hand-held and palmtop PCs. Rolled
out with much ceremony at a big computer trade show in 1996,
Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is determined to compete in every
market where a rival operating system might gain some traction, as
has occurred with the proprietary systems built into such hand-held
devices as 3Com's highly popular PalmPilot. (Reid/Hume, Atlanta

   JUNO _ The most coveted Internet users are the ones who don't
really know how to use the Web. Juno (http://www.juno.com), the
popular, advertiser-supported free e-mail service, realized the day
is coming when its 5.5 million users will want to do more on the
Net than just send e-mail. They are, in the words of Juno President
Charles Ardai, ``a group that has taken its first step onto the
Internet.'' Rather than watch them drift off to other ISPs, Juno
has decided to try to become an ISP itself. (Katz, Atlanta

   MAC-REPORT _ OneClick is software that lives up to the Mac
ideal. It not only makes computing easy, it's fun, too. That's not

<P>
   MINDSPRING _ It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath.
Watching the soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service
provider MindSpring elicits a similar feeling. MindSpring founder
and Chairman Charles Brewer cut his vacation short to appear on
CNBC. When asked what was the secret to the Internet service
provider's success, Brewer replied with what is becoming the
MindSpring mantra: Keeping costs down and customers happy is the
key to profitability. (Katz, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) MOVED.

 &HT;    Instructional software can help budding virtuosos hone their
musical skills
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Music, Plato said, gives flight to the imagination and soul to
the universe. It also can be a balm for the spirit in the midst of
high-speed American life.
</P>
<P>
   But Plato lived in a simpler era, when demands on time were
fewer, and budding lyre virtuosos could spend all day learning the
intricacies and techniques of playing the instrument.
</P>
<P>
   If you think you or your child is ready to give piano or guitar
lessons a whirl, but you're worried there aren't enough hours in
the day, don't panic. Help is on the way, courtesy of the
Information Age.
</P>
<P>
   Music instruction has vaulted into the future with software that
teaches basic music theory and technique in a form with which both
children and adult beginners are comfortable. Hundreds of sites on
the World Wide Web also offer help, whether you're interested in
learning about autoharps or zithers.
</P>
<P>
   No software or computerized guidance can replace the subtlety,
experience and ear of a flesh-and-blood teacher, but for many
parents or novices such programs can be a good first step in
finding out whether aptitude or interest justify investing in
formal lessons, which average $15 a half-hour, or instruments,
which can cost several hundred dollars, even for models made for
beginners.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the instructional software costs between $45 and $99,
but requires a MIDI-capable, 16-bit or better sound card and a MIDI
keyboard. Many titles will run on Windows 3.1, and most have
Macintosh versions. MIDI _ musical instrument digital interface _
is what lets a sound device ``talk'' to a computer.
</P>
<P>
   Piano is still the instrument most parents want their children
to learn, says Kenon Renfrow, a music professor at the University
of Miami at Coral Gables. Renfrow, a keyboard specialist, also
serves as a software consultant for the Cincinnati-based Music
Teachers National Association. It's guitar titles, though, that
grab the lion's share of shelf space at many music and computer
stores. The same is true on the Web, where a mind-boggling number
of sites are devoted to the ``ax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the biggest advantages of using technology in music is
that students can get instant feedback'' on how they're doing,
Renfrow said, and perform at their own pace. Several instructors
said beginner-level software is an excellent reinforcement for
theoretical concepts, and that young students seem to retain them
better.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the teachers find this computer assist to be a useful
tool, though all emphasize the need for individualized instruction
to take students to their highest potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen a box or computer program you can plug into a
wall and replace a teacher,'' Renfrow said.
</P>
<P>
   Some software packages that retail for less than $200 come with
a 49-key keyboard and all the necessary MIDI cables or connectors.
Two of the most popular are Piano Discovery System from Jump! Music
and the Family Music Center Play Piano from Midisoft.
</P>
<P>
   Piano Discovery System ($169) uses multimedia and games to
present music theory and basic note-reading. Once you've learned a
song, the software takes you to a ``performance hall,'' where you
play the piece with synthesized orchestral accompaniment. The
software then generates a review of your playing.
</P>
<P>
   The Midisoft title ($199) relies less on multimedia and offers
less step-by-step guidance, according to reviewers. After you
finish a section, the software scores you and highlights where you
hit the wrong notes.
</P>
<P>
   Another choice for teaching children the fundamentals is
Harmonic Vision's Music Ace ($49.95), which has garnered an
``outstanding'' rating from Children's Software Revue. There are
Windows and Mac versions available, and you can download a free
demo from the company's Web site (http://www.harmonicvision
</P>
<P>
   .com/). A MIDI keyboard is optional, not required, which makes
the software a good value.
</P>
<P>
   Those who are intent on being the next Andres Segovia or Jimi
Hendrix have a slew of choices, but reviewers have been most
impressed by Seattle-based eMedia's Guitar Method 1, for Windows 95
or Windows 3.1, which offers 60 lessons on the basics. You can use
either acoustic or electric guitar.
</P>
<P>
   The company has a second level available as students progress
that covers barre chords, music notation and scales, and licks like
hammer-ons, pull-offs and bends. Both titles include visual tuners
and digital metronomes, and retail for $59.95 _ about the price of
three lessons with an instructor.
</P>
<P>
   Guitropolis ($49.95) from Alfred Publishing takes the form of an
adventure game, but includes method-only versions of Alfred's
well-regarded Basic Guitar Method and Teach Yourself To Play
Guitar. Both provide solid instruction, reviewers say.
</P>
<P>
   Yet another readily available option is G-Vox Guitar ($99.99,
for Windows 95) by G-Vox Entertainment. It includes all the
necessary hardware, as well as a music notation component. The
title comes with a pickup to attach either an electric or acoustic
guitar. A caution here, though: The instrument must have steel
strings, which can be devastating to uncallused fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The technology may have changed, but there is at least one
element of learning music that hasn't changed since Plato's day: If
you want to get to the top, it's practice, practice, practice.
</P>
<P>
   It's mostly a string thing
</P>
<P>
   Here are some sites on the World Wide Web that offer music
instruction or guidance on how to obtain information on learning to
play a range of instruments.

 &HT;    Even in hand-held models, Windows has a foothold
 &HT;    By Brit Hume &AMP; T.R. Reid
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Windows CE is Microsoft's Windows 95 look-alike operating system
for hand-held and palmtop PCs. Rolled out with much ceremony at a
big computer trade show in 1996, Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is
determined to compete in every market where a rival operating
system might gain some traction, as has occurred with the
proprietary systems built into such hand-held devices as 3Com's
highly popular PalmPilot.
</P>
<P>
   Before you drive yourself crazy trying to figure out what ``CE''
stands for, here is what Microsoft itself says about that: ``CE
doesn't represent a single concept, but rather implies a number of
Windows CE design precepts, including `Compact, Connectable,
Compatible and Companion.''' In other words, nothing in particular.
</P>
<P>
   While Windows CE, now in version 2.0, is designed to work with
tiny palmtop devices with green monochrome displays, it seems more
in its element in hand-held PCs with color screens and keyboards,
such as the Sharp Mobilon 4600, which is where we tested it. You
turn on the computer, and, presto, there is the Windows CE opening
screen, which looks almost exactly like the Windows 95 desktop,
complete with taskbar, Start button and icons representing the
Recycle Bin, My Handheld PC (like My Computer), Inbox and the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, you will find icons representing a set of
``pocket'' versions of major Microsoft Office applications,
including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Internet Explorer. All are
bare-bones versions of their larger cousins, but have surprising
power considering their size. Pocket Word, for example, now
includes a spell checker.
</P>
<P>
   Given the Justice Department's attitude toward the inclusion of
Internet Explorer with Windows 95 and Windows 98, one can only
imagine what it would say about the bundling of all these
``pocket'' versions of Windows applications with Windows CE. So
far, though, no sign of any intention to sue. Perhaps that's
because Netscape has not yet developed a version of its Navigator
Web browser for Windows CE, and the Justice Department seems to
regard protecting Netscape's market share as one of its primary
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever else you do with your Windows CE device, you will
surely want to do two things: connect to your desktop computer to
share information and connect with the Internet to check your
e-mail and browse the Web. Connection to your desktop is relatively
simple via a serial cable. You must load Windows CE
``synchronization'' software from an included CD to your desktop
system. Once that's done, you will be able to exchange files
between the My Documents folders on both computers.
</P>
<P>
   You will also be able to transfer such things as e-mail messages
from the Inbox or Outlook windows of your desktop to and from the
Inbox program on your hand-held. You can also exchange data between
Microsoft's SchedulePlus on your desktop and the Calendar program
on your hand-held. The same for information in your hand-held's
Contacts application and your desktop's Outlook program.
</P>
<P>
   Reaching the Web by a dial-up connection is a more complex
matter. You must use the Remote Networking utility in the
Communications folder found in the programs menu. It is similar to
the dial-up networking procedure in Windows 95, but different
enough that it may take you a while to get it right, especially
since there are some arcane commands you may need to enter under a
tab called Dialing Patterns found under the Communications icon in
the Windows CE Control Panel.
</P>
<P>
   Once you get this right and get your modem to dial and log on to
your network or Internet service provider, you may be sorely
disappointed in the speed of Pocket Internet Explorer. Even with a
33.6k bps modem, pages load at a glacial pace, and you may be
wondering if you are even achieving a 28.8k bps connection, let
alone anything higher. Unfortunately, Windows CE, unlike Windows
95, does not tell you how fast your connection is, so you are left
to wonder. The good news is when you are first dialing in, Windows
CE seems to get you through the log-on process much faster than
Windows 95.
</P>
<P>
   You are likely to be much happier with your e-mail performance.
Most messages come through quickly, and while Windows CE's Inbox is
not the most full-featured of programs, it is easy to use and does
the job well enough. Given the size of most hand-held keyboards,
you are not likely to be sending many long outgoing messages
anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Printing can be a nuisance, since you can only print directly
from Pocket Word or Excel. You must use a serial cable or infrared
connection to your printer. Most printers do not have such a
connection, so you must fall back on transferring your file to your
desktop and printing from there. Ouch.

 &HT;    ConsumerWatch: Customers shying away from `foreign' ATMs
 &HT;    By Gene Tharpe
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay to use bank ATM
machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe they're just getting
smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Many are shifting to their own banks' machines to avoid being
charged twice for their transactions -- one fee by the bank that
owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their own, and another fee
by their own bank. At the same time, the surcharges continue to
rise, new studies show.
</P>
<P>
   The surveys were seized by Sen. Alfonse D'Amato (R-N.Y.),
chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, who said recently he'll
get the Senate to vote this year on legislation to ban banks'
practice of making double charges on ATM transactions.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the number of ATMs has greatly expanded. There
are now more than 150,000 automated teller machines nationwide, and
there were almost 11 billion ATM transactions last year, according
to the American Bankers Association.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the rise in ATM use, however, has come a jump in the
fees charged by banks to use the ATMs. Use an ATM owned by a bank
other than your bank, and that ``foreign'' bank may charge you as
much as $1.50.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the charge can come with a double whammy, a $3 charge
if your bank also charges $1.50, which some do, for processing your
withdrawal from the other bank's ATM.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's ridiculous that customers sometimes are charged twice to
get access to their own money,'' said Robert Pregulman, an Atlanta
spokesman for the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a national
consumer group.
</P>
<P>
   That consumer sentiment apparently is reflected in two recent
surveys that indicate some consumers have begun limiting their use
of ``foreign'' bank ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   A survey in April of 3,100 consumers by PSI Global, a market
research firm, found heavy ATM users -- those who conduct five or
more transactions each month -- had reduced their use of
``foreign'' ATMs by 22 percent in the last two years. They had
reduced all ATM transactions by 4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The behavior of the heavy users, the shifting away from
`foreign' ATMs and declining transactions, might be an indication
that the market has reached, or nearly reached an optimal price
point,'' said Mimi Rossetti, director of research for Tampa-based
PSI Global.
</P>
<P>
   Most banks don't charge their own customers for using bank-owned
ATMs, so more consumers are using them to save ATM fees. Also,
Rossetti said consumers who use ``foreign'' ATMs are apparently
withdrawing larger amounts of cash to reduce the number of
fee-charged withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the ``heavy users,'' PSI Global found that all
ATM users in its survey had reduced their use of ``foreign'' ATMs
by 18 percent during the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   A March survey by Market Facts Inc., conducted for the ABA,
found nearly two of three consumers said they had changed their ATM
use to avoid paying fees. But the ABA used the survey to justify
charging fees for the ``convenience'' of other banks' ATMs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fees enable banks to set up many more ATMs on street
corners, and in airports, grocery stores, malls, convenience stores
and hospitals,'' said Walter A. Dodds Jr., ABA president. ``Why
should institutions give convenience away, for free, to people who
don't bank with them?''

 &HT;    Ernest Holsendolph's Business Commentary: Fortune lists top
firms that promote, pay minorities
 &HT;    By Ernest Holsendolph
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Fortune magazine, in its current edition, has an
ambitious new idea, a unique entry in the endless lists of ``best
companies.'' This list contains its version of the 50 best
companies in the nation for African-American, Hispanic and Asian
employees and executives.
</P>
<P>
   That may have a familiar ring. But this list, compiled with the
assistance of the New York-based Council on Economic Priorities,
grades survey participants on such wide-ranging criteria as
percentage of minorities in top-paying jobs and on boards of
directors, and presence of executives in profit-making operations
-- instead of staff jobs like public relations and community
affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the survey tries to separate window dressing
from real corporate diversity.
</P>
<P>
   There were some familiar faces on the list. Detroit's Big Three
car companies made it. Bank America, Chase Manhattan and
BellAtlantic made it. Even Shoney's and Denny's made it. Some did
not. Texaco was a no-show. Even Time Warner, owner of Fortune
magazine, did not make it.
</P>
<P>
   And not a single Georgia-based company cracked the top 50. It
was a tough list. Lucent Technologies, based in Murray Hill, N.J.,
but with a huge installation here, finished 16th on the list.
Lucent won special praise for having seven minorities among its 25
highest salaried employees and for its financial support of
organizations that represent minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never realized until you told me that no Atlanta company was
on the list,'' said Roy S. Johnson, author of the Fortune articles
accompanying the listing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fact of the matter is that this is new,'' he said, ``and some
companies declined to participate because they did not understand
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others wondered if divulging some of the information may be an
invasion of privacy,'' said Johnson, formerly a sports columnist
for the Journal-Constitution during the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Companies had to figure out the top 25 people on the payroll in
terms of annual salary and provide numbers on blacks, Hispanics and
Asians in the number. They had to tell where they concentrated
their corporate giving, winning gold stars if they helped minority
communities and financed such items as scholarships for minority
youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola did participate in the survey but failed to make the
cut, finishing at 53rd on the list. Kim Price, a spokesman, said
the company was proud of its record in supporting minority
education through its foundation. And it considered its
comprehensive plan to do business with minority vendors to be a
pace-setter in industry.
</P>
<P>
   Coke placed above average in six of nine categories, Price said,
but obviously lagged elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   No other prominent Atlanta area company took part in the survey,
according to the magazine. We did not take part in the survey, said
a spokesman for Cox Enterprises, the company that owns the
Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   One of the more fascinating features of the poll was the
presence of Advantica of Spartanburg, S.C., which owns the Denny's
chain of restaurants, as well as Shoney's of Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies were involved in splashy publicity over alleged
discrimination earlier in the decade, only to rally to change their
images.
</P>
<P>
   Shoney's, according to Fortune, paid $132.8 million to settle a
class-action discrimination suit in 1992, a suit brought by 20,000
employees and rejected job applicants. Two years later, Denny's
paid $54.4 million to settle two class-action suits brought by
black customers who said they were refused service at certain
restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Shoney's (13th on the list) boasts 30 percent of its
store managers are minorities, and Denny's (2nd) was praised for
diversity among suppliers and the franchises.
</P>
<P>
   Said Jim Abramson, chief executive of Denny's parent company
since 1995: ``White men tend to hire white men. ... I am a complete
supporter of affirmative action because I don't believe the playing
field is level. ... To undergo the kind of metamorphosis we have,
you have to take the initiative. It won't happen naturally.''
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line is this: For companies that are baffled about
ways to achieve diversity in their work forces and in their
executive suites, we now have 50 companies from every walk of life
that seem ready, willing and able to tutor them.

 &HT;    OneClick a fine shortcut for many repetitive tasks
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OneClick is software that lives up to the Mac ideal. It not only
makes computing easy, it's fun, too.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad, considering OneClick is not a game but something
called a utility. It expands what your Mac can do.
</P>
<P>
   The idea behind OneClick is simple. It reduces nearly any
repetitive task on your computer to a button click.
</P>
<P>
   That includes changing fonts, copying text and more complicated
chores such as inserting boilerplate text into e-mail. OneClick can
do all this and more.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick works through a motif of buttons and palettes. Every
palette displays a collection of buttons, and each button performs
a task.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick comes with lots of pre-configured palettes and buttons
that are ready to use. You'll find global palettes that include
buttons automating things such as closing windows and emptying the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   And there are application palettes for programs such as
PhotoShop and ClarisWorks. These palettes only appear when you're
using an application.
</P>
<P>
   But that's just the beginning. You can make your own palettes
from scratch, selecting everything from the shape of the button to
the background color of the palette.
</P>
<P>
   Creating buttons from scratch is easy, too. OneClick will record
a series of actions, such as copying text, and save them on a
button.
</P>
<P>
   Or you can write your own scripts with OneClick's own
programming language called EasyScript. Matt Neuburg, a reviewer
with Mac newsletter TidBits, said EasyScript ``is spectacularly
well thought out and easy to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   But you don't have to learn EasyScript or OneClick's record
functions to add new buttons and palettes. Others are creating new
ones all the time and posting them on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick has collected and organized them on its Web site at
http://www.westcodesoft
</P>
<P>
   .com. Check the list often, because it's always being updated.
Downloading and adding other palettes to your computer is easy.
</P>
<P>
   While it generally works great, OneClick is not without bugs. I
found it does slow the general speed of your system. In addition,
it messed around with the performance of some programs such as
Nisus Writer.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick can also make your screen a cluttered mess, with all
its different palettes. But the company has licked that problem by
letting you easily hide any or all of them.
</P>
<P>
   You can control OneClick through a pull-down button the program
puts in the upper right hand corner of your menu bar.
</P>
<P>
   OneClick is a powerful program with many, many features. I've
just scratched the surface here. To learn more about the program
and what others have to say about it, check out reviews in MacWorld
and MacAddict magazines. You'll also find user comments at the
company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Published by Westcode Software, OneClick sells for about $70.
The best place to buy it is from the company's Web site.

 &HT;    MindSpring is investors' darling
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath. Watching the
soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service provider
MindSpring elicits a similar feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which provides dial-up Internet access to some
393,000 subscribers, just posted its third profitable quarter
operating in the volatile Internet industry. The stock closed
Friday down 50 cents at $148.50 after hitting a record $157.12 1/2.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring founder and Chairman Charles Brewer cut his vacation
short to appear on CNBC. When asked what was the secret to the
Internet service provider's success, Brewer replied with what is
becoming the MindSpring mantra: Keeping costs down and customers
happy is the key to profitability.
</P>
<P>
   And Brewer seemed to hint in a Wall Street Journal Heard on the
Street column that he wasn't averse to selling the company.
</P>
<P>
   MindSpring's national media attention has captured the
imaginations of small investors like Atlanta resident Edie
Friedman. Friedman is impressed by the stock's performance and what
friends say about the service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They love it. They say it's very easy to use. It's going to be
another Microsoft. I have a gut feeling,'' Friedman said.
</P>
<P>
   However, several investment firms warn MindSpring's wild ride is
a short-term phenomenon. But they still believe MindSpring is an
excellent long-term investment for those with the money and the
patience to ride out the company's ups and inevitable downs.
Robinson-Humphrey research associate Jeff John believes MindSpring
has long-term potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``A year ago, these dial-up providers were all supposed to go
broke because the big boys like AT&AMP;T were supposed to come along
and steal all their customers, and that hasn't been the case,''
John says. But MindSpring, along with America Online and the
aggressive Internet service provider Earthlink are still alive and
kicking. ``MindSpring is one of the highest-quality ISPs out
there,'' John says. ``They've proven that an ISP can be
profitable.''
</P>
<P>
   Earthlink, the one national provider most similar to MindSpring
in size and scope, hasn't seen its stock prices climb to
MindSpring's dizzying heights. Part of the reason could be the 28
percent share telecommunications company Sprint has in the company,
which could be off-putting to potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   There's also a difference in company strategies. MindSpring has
opted for steady growth and profitability. Marketing is almost
exclusively word of mouth and customer retention rates are good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earthlink is not a profitable company, and they won't be for
about four years, which is why it's trading at a discount,'' John
points out. Earthlink's plan is to spend as much money as it takes
to acquire subscribers and become the No. 2 provider behind AOL,
which has 12 million subscribers worldwide. Earthlink has 710,000
subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   Investors like service providers because, unlike some other
Internet companies, they use a recurring revenue model. They charge
a monthly fee that allows analysts to make more accurate
projections. ``It takes away some of the uncertainty you have with
some Internet companies right now,'' John says.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies like Amazon.com are hard to put a value on
because it's hard, if not impossible, to predict how many books the
company will sell from quarter to quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say MindSpring is a solid company, whose fortunes have
been greatly increased by Wall Street's overall enthusiasm for all
things Internet. ``There are very few (Internet) companies to
invest in, and even fewer that have the profitability to back up
some of those valuations,'' John says.

 &HT;    Money Talk: More women preparing for retirement
 &HT;    By Hank Ezell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Women, nudged by necessity and the ever-hungry
financial services industry, are getting more active and more savvy
about saving for retirement.
</P>
<P>
   One-fourth of all women now put something into savings before
they pay their bills. That's lower than the 36 percent recorded by
men, but survey sponsor Merrill Lynch says the gap is narrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of women own stocks and bonds, according to
another survey. That's up from 53 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
   Here's an encouraging statistic, provided by the National Center
for Women and Retirement Research: 94 percent of women believe they
are as capable as men when it comes to understanding money and
investing. On the other hand, women need to pay attention to their
retirement plans. Much more than men do, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   Women live longer than men -- six years longer, according to the
National Center for Health Statistics. That means they have more
retirement years to finance.
</P>
<P>
   Women earn less money than men. That makes it no surprise they
save less: 1.5 percent of their income, vs. 3.1 percent for men,
says the Mutual Fund Education Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   Women work fewer years and change jobs more frequently. Thus,
they can expect smaller paybacks from Social Security and pension
programs. Indeed, two out of three women have no pension plans at
all, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
   That all adds up to the need for many women to sharpen their
financial skills. Here are some ways to go about it:
</P>
<P>
   -- Put yourself first. ``It's not selfish to save for
yourself,'' said Ellen O. Keller, a certified financial planner in
Roswell. ``It's a gift to your family and loved ones, because they
won't have to take care of you when you're older. Everyone I know
wants their parents to have a nice life, and they don't want to
have to worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't succumb to fear. You may well need professional
advisers to formulate or just to polish your plans. But most people
can learn how to manage money and to plan for retirement. The
resource list on this page will give you some starting points.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just have to give yourself time,'' said Keller. ``You can
say to yourself, `This is like someone is paying me money to learn
this. Maybe on Sunday afternoon I'm going to spend an hour or two
just reading.' Part of your budgeting is budgeting time to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Be persistent. Mary Ellen Garrett, a financial consultant
with Merrill Lynch in Atlanta, recommends you find experts --
perhaps at commercially sponsored seminars -- and grill them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't be afraid to ask questions,'' she said. ``This is your
business. You need to ask questions until you're comfortable with
the answers.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Take it one step at a time. Keller suggests breaking these
sometimes complicated processes into manageable steps. Getting
debts under control is one step. Saving up an emergency fund is
another. Finding money to invest is yet another.
</P>
<P>
   -- Start saving now. If your employer offers a 401(k), join it.
``You need to contribute as much as you can possibly afford, and
especially you need to contribute enough to take advantage of the
company match,'' said Garrett.
</P>
<P>
   An individual retirement account, especially a Roth IRA, is
another inviting possibility for retirement saving. ``Saving is
really more a function of attitude than income,'' said Garrett.
``Everybody can find someplace to save a few dollars. If you start
saving now, it will be easier.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Don't be too conservative. ``Women often don't understand how
conservative investments are risky, because of inflation,'' Keller
observed.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other advisers, she recommends putting some portion of
retirement savings into the stock market, even in your senior
years. ``I see women who are 70, and they might live till they're
90,'' she said. ``They have conservative investments, and they're
getting poorer every year.''
</P>
<P>
   -- Know your retirement rights. It's important not just to
understand how your own pension works but how a spouse's plan is
set up. For a good introduction to the topic, check out the
consumer information at the Pension and Welfare Benefits
Administration Web site, http://www.dol.gov/dol

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Repairing racial injustice of wartimes
 &HT;    By Tom Teepen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifty years ago this week, President Harry Truman signed an
executive order barring racial inequality in the military.
Integration wouldn't start until two years later, forced by the
need to rush troops to the Korean War, and the last all-black unit
wouldn't be disbanded until 1954. Still, Truman's bold move marked
the beginning of the end for one of the more tormented tales in the
twisted history of American racial injustice.
</P>
<P>
   African Americans had fought to win, save and expand American
freedom in every of the nation's wars, only to be rewarded after
each, if rewarded at all, with meager rations from that freedom _
and with quick white forgetfulness. Every debt of honor was settled
on the cheap.
</P>
<P>
   We were still rescuing those memories last week, and settling
those debts.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200,000 black soldiers and sailors fought to save the Union
in the Civil War, but the forgetting began immediately. None
marched in the victory parade down Pennsylvania _ and never mind
their 16 Medals of Honor. A memorial to the black veterans was
unveiled in Washington last week.
</P>
<P>
   And survivors of the 2,220 black soldiers who volunteered to
leave their support units and fight beside whites in World War II's
Battle of the Bulge finally received the medals last week that the
Pentagon forgot to issue them after the war. Adding injury to
insult, black non-coms had been reduced to privates for the battle
_ no risk, then, they would give orders to whites _ and never had
their ranks restored.
</P>
<P>
   So it has gone. Crispus Attucks was one of the five to die in
the Boston Massacre, first blood in the Revolutionary War. Among
the blacks who served in the war was the all-black 1st Rhode Island
Regiment.
</P>
<P>
   Some 350 blacks fought with Andrew Jackson at the Battle of New
Orleans in the War of 1812, and a fourth of the sailors who won the
war's key Battle of Lake Erie were African American. Black units
were crucial to the Spanish-American War victories at San Juan and
Kettle Hills.
</P>
<P>
   The (now) famous Buffalo Soldiers protected American expansion
across the West, and some 400,000 blacks served in World War I,
most memorably the 369th Infantry, the Harlem Hellfighters. (Its
soldiers knocked the Germans out; its band knocked the French out.)
</P>
<P>
   African Americans, relentlessly steered to fetch-and-carry
roles, had to fight to fight in World War II, from infantry and
tank units to the distinguished Tuskegee Airmen. And they came home
to find furloughed German war prisoners welcome where they were
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   Through all this, the armed forces everywhere were as segregated
as the Jim Crow South, yet African Americans soldiered on _ an
astonishing act of faith, based on precious little encouraging
experience, that their nation would one day vindicate in the
perfection of its justice the sacrifice they were making.
</P>
<P>
   America's black newspapers called World War II the fight for two
V's _ victory in combat abroad and victory for racial justice at
home. The first victory was complete, but although Truman's order
started dramatic changes for the better, those two recent
ceremonies in Washington remind us there is still some mopping up
to do on the second.

   ASTRONOMY-EXCITEMENT (San Francisco) _ The sky will never look

inexplicably expanding faster with time. Future historians might

   TERM-LIMITS (San Francisco) _ These days, the biggest headache
in the state legislature is dealing with the fallout from eight

its face, lawmakers and lobbyists say, with weaker leaders,
perpetually inexperienced legislators and a governor and his vast
bureaucracy seizing more power than ever. By ROBERT SALLADAY.

   YOGI-BERRA (Lutherville, Md.) _ Asked what he would do if he

Brown, who had a stint with the Houston Oilers, came out of exile
to play for the San Diego Chargers last season. The Chargers chose

   OUTDOORS-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ A chilled fog buried the coast

   ROBISON-COLUMN (Austin, Texas) _ Predicting a $3.7 billion state

in their eagerness to cash in on Texas' continued prosperity. By

he was mugged. He was 69 and earning a quarter of a million dollars
a year managing the Albany office of IDS Financial Services. And it

he was replaced by a man in his 30s who would earn less than half
of what he was making. By DAN LYNCH.

<P>
   HEAT-EMPATHY (Albany, N.Y.) _ This past week, too much
conversation was focused on how hot it was. Yet we were just living
through a spell of weather that was perhaps four degrees above the
average. Nothing to get into a sweat about. Maybe our perceived
general discomfort was based on empathy; we thought we endured what
was happening in Texas. By HARRY ROSENFELD.

   TSUNAMI (San Francisco) _ When the killer tsunami of July 13
obliterated thousands of lives in Papua New Guinea, an immediate
question along California's coastline was: Could it happen here? It
already has. More than once. And that's why a warning system is so
important.

   &QL;  WITHOUT OPPONENT, SHUSTER'S CAMPAIGN STILL KICKING
</P>
<P>
   By Paul Kane
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 25 -- While he was busy negotiating the final
pieces of the more than $200 billion highway bill, Rep. Bud
Shuster's campaign to win a 14th term in the House remained in high
gear -- even though he has no announced opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, R-Everett, took in $222,760 in campaign contributions
from April 1 to June 30, a hefty sum for most lawmakers but about
average for the powerful chairman of the House Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He raised more than $83,000, 38 percent of his total, from
construction firms, contractors, road builders, engineers and
transportation companies -- all of which had vested interests in
the highway bill, according to an analysis of reports filed with
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign watchdogs say Shuster's fundraising was not surprising,
and probably not unethical or illegal under federal law. Chairmen
of important committees usually attract large sums of money from
the industries that they oversee, but analysts say Shuster has
raised the practice to an art form that blurs the lines between the
intent and spirit of campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern you see (with incumbent lawmakers),'' said Paul
Hendrie, spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan group in Washington that monitors federal elections.
``But it's also safe to say Congressman Shuster is one of the best
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's office referred questions on his fundraising to his
top campaign aide, Ann Eppard, who did not return calls for comment
on the story. Shuster has said in the past that he has never broken
the law, and that any attacks on his campaign practices, including
a U.S. Attorney's investigation into Eppard, are politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring marked the high point of influence in Shuster's
26 years in the House, as his Transportation Committee concluded
almost 18 months of haggling over the six-year highway bill. Its
impact will be felt in every state, every congressional district
and on every road project across the country in need of federal
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Due to his towering presence in central Pennsylvania and in
Washington, Shuster has only faced nominal opposition in his
reelection bids, if at all. When Democrat Monte Kemmler ran against
him in 1996, he was the first opponent Shuster had seen in a
primary or general election since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Shuster fundraising machine takes a
break.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Shuster raised $776,175, according to the Almanac of
American Politics. In 1996, Shuster raised $1.2 million in winning
74 percent of the vote over Kemmler, who spent $113,000, a sizeable
amount for an unknown challenger.
</P>
<P>
   With token opposition in the May primary and no challenger in
the 1998 general election, Shuster has already raised more money
than he did in the 1996 campaign: $1.29 million in 1997 and the
first six months of this year for a virtually non-existent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In just April, May and June, Shuster took $32,750 worth of
contributions from executives and political action committees of
construction companies, contractors and road builders. Another
$36,691.71 came from trucking, rail, auto and air industry
executives or PACs.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those industries had business before Shuster's
committee, either in the highway bill or in other areas such as
rail mergers. The alcohol and beverage industries, who lobbied
Shuster to kill a provision that would have forced states to adopt
.08 as the minimum blood-alcohol level for drunk drivers, kicked in
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that this mix of large contributions and
legislative activity creates the appearance of conflicts of
interest, at minimum, and is certainly not necessary since Shuster
faces no real political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a culture of influence peddling in Washington, and Bud
Shuster knows how to take advantage of it,'' said Gary Ruskin, head
of the Congressional Accountability Project, a one-man shop begun
by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no need to raise money,'' Hendrie, of the Center for
Responsive Politics, said. ``(The fundraising) is not driven by the
demand. It's driven by the supply -- the money is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling to his critics is how Shuster spends his
campaign funds, since very little is needed to actually run his
election bids. Ruskin has filed an ethics complaint with the House
charging Shuster with using his campaign account to fund a lavish
lifestyle, something that would violate laws prohibiting candidates
from personally benefiting from their fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   For this election cycle, Shuster has already spent $1.18
million, FEC reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses include a $3,000-a-month salary for Eppard, his
former chief of staff who is now a transportation lobbyist but
maintains close ties as Shuster's top fundraiser. A grand jury in
Boston indicted Eppard for influence peddling in the more than $10
billion ``Big Dig'' highway project in that city, and the
investigation is continuing, although Shuster's lawyer claims the
lawmaker is not a target of the probe. +++xT9uq

billion ``Big Dig'' highway project in that city, and the
investigation is continuing, although Shuster's lawyer claims the
lawmaker is not a target of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   But that investigation has clearly come at some expense to
Shuster: his campaign account paid out $102,749 in four payments in
April, May and June to the Pittsburgh law firm of Eckert, Seamans,
Cherin and Mellott.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the legal payments, Shuster still spent nearly
$200,000 from his campaign account in those three months. ``It's
astonishing that he spends this much money,'' Ruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign report is littered with dozens of dinners that he
dubbed ``political meetings'' at the finest restaurants in
Washington, suburban Virginia and across the country, totalling
more than $5,268 in just three months. All paid for by his
fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Shuster's campaign spent $205.29 on fours sets of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I think he could manage to win reelection without (the
flowers),'' Hendrie quipped.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what will happen in the House ethics investigation
of Shuster and the U.S. Attorney's investigation into Eppard, but
it's more than clear that those probes have not slowed Shuster's
fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sit back and wait for the money to come to him,''
Hendrie said. ``Once it's there (in his account), it's burning a
hole in his pocket. He doesn't know how to spend it fast enough.''

THE STARR INVESTIGATION'S CAN OF WORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's long, costly investigation of
President Clinton seems not to have hurt Clinton politically. But
there is growing concern in scholarly circles that it has damaged
the office of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on CNN last week, presidential historian Allan
Lichtman warned that Starr's far-ranging inquiries, along with
court orders sanctioning the scope of his almost limitless charter,
have already wrought a ``huge institutional change in the nature of
the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, Lichtman points out, a precedent
has been set allowing a sitting president to be sued for something
alleged to have happened before he took office. A private citizen
may sue him, and he is obliged to respond. Think of the
opportunities for mischief opened to anyone intent on distracting,
preoccupying or simply discrediting a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A second precedent is the concept that the president may be
investigated, at public expense, over things that do not relate,
even remotely, to his duties as president. The Whitewater episode,
genesis of this whole four-year investigative orgy, involved a
failed private investment in which the Clintons lost money years
before his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Still another disturbing innovation is the apparently accepted
verdict that an independent counsel, once installed, is virtually
unlimited in his prosecutorial authority and in widening the scope
of his inquiry. He can broaden the subject into almost any phase of
the president's life, and the president has practically no claim to
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Now arises the concern that future presidents' physical
protection may be compromised by Starr's insistence on subpoenaing
the Secret Service detail assigned to guard Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, nobody knows if that's a valid worry. Whether future
presidents may tend to distance themselves from their assigned
protectors when discussing private matters could depend on so many
variables, including individual personalities, that I can't even
hazard a guess. Commanding testimony from agents is not illegal,
but is it wise?
</P>
<P>
   It does seem clear that, in these four ways at least, the
presidency has been diminished. That should concern us all,
whatever our personal opinions of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Future presidents will have to live with the legal impediments
and inhibitions imposed upon previously presumed rights, powers and
immunities of that office.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged, highly publicized investigative assault on
Clinton has left other less-obvious and less-measurable scars. One
is an undeniable loss of momentum for all the president's programs
stemming from the obsessive daily news focus on every petty, sordid
detail of the allegations. Other news has been squeezed out, to the
detriment of this chief executive's effort to stimulate public
support sufficient to move Congress to act on his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we agree or disagree with Clinton's policies, we must
ask if such systematic diversions of the public mind are healthy.
Think how easily future presidents may be similarly distracted from
achieving their leadership goals in the most fateful job on earth
if it's fair game now fK &QC; 1%Q% 1

&HT;        WITHOUT OPPONENT, SHUSTER'S CAMPAIGN STILL KICKING
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Paul Kane  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, July 25 -- While he was busy negotiating the final
pieces of the more than $200 billion highway bill, Rep. Bud
Shuster's campaign to win a 14th term in the House remained in high
gear -- even though he has no announced opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Shuster, R-Everett, took in $222,760 in campaign contributions
from April 1 to June 30, a hefty sum for most lawmakers but about
average for the powerful chairman of the House Transportation
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   He raised more than $83,000, 38 percent of his total, from
construction firms, contractors, road builders, engineers and
transportation companies -- all of which had vested interests in
the highway bill, according to an analysis of reports filed with
the Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign watchdogs say Shuster's fundraising was not surprising,
and probably not unethical or illegal under federal law. Chairmen
of important committees usually attract large sums of money from
the industries that they oversee, but analysts say Shuster has
raised the practice to an art form that blurs the lines between the
intent and spirit of campaign laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pattern you see (with incumbent lawmakers),'' said Paul
Hendrie, spokesman for the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan group in Washington that monitors federal elections.
``But it's also safe to say Congressman Shuster is one of the best
at it.''
</P>
<P>
   Shuster's office referred questions on his fundraising to his
top campaign aide, Ann Eppard, who did not return calls for comment
on the story. Shuster has said in the past that he has never broken
the law, and that any attacks on his campaign practices, including
a U.S. Attorney's investigation into Eppard, are politically
motivated.
</P>
<P>
   This past spring marked the high point of influence in Shuster's
26 years in the House, as his Transportation Committee concluded
almost 18 months of haggling over the six-year highway bill. Its
impact will be felt in every state, every congressional district
and on every road project across the country in need of federal
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Due to his towering presence in central Pennsylvania and in
Washington, Shuster has only faced nominal opposition in his
reelection bids, if at all. When Democrat Monte Kemmler ran against
him in 1996, he was the first opponent Shuster had seen in a
primary or general election since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the Shuster fundraising machine takes a
break.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Shuster raised $776,175, according to the Almanac of
American Politics. In 1996, Shuster raised $1.2 million in winning
74 percent of the vote over Kemmler, who spent $113,000, a sizeable
amount for an unknown challenger.
</P>
<P>
   With token opposition in the May primary and no challenger in
the 1998 general election, Shuster has already raised more money
than he did in the 1996 campaign: $1.29 million in 1997 and the
first six months of this year for the virtually non-existent
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In just April, May and June, Shuster took $32,750 worth of
contributions from executives and political action committees of
construction companies, contractors and road builders. Another
$36,691.71 came from trucking, rail, auto and air industry
executives or PACs.
</P>
<P>
   Each of those industries had business before Shuster's
committee, either in the highway bill or in other areas such as
rail mergers. The alcohol and beverage industries, who lobbied
Shuster to kill a provision that would have forced states to adopt
.08 as the minimum blood-alcohol level for drunk drivers, kicked in
$3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Critics contend that this mix of large contributions and
legislative activity creates the appearance of conflicts of
interest, at minimum, and is certainly not necessary since Shuster
faces no real political challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a culture of influence peddling in Washington, and Bud
Shuster knows how to take advantage of it,'' said Gary Ruskin, head
of the Congressional Accountability Project, a one-man shop begun
by Ralph Nader.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has no need to raise money,'' Hendrie, of the Center for
Responsive Politics, said. ``(The fundraising) is not driven by the
demand. It's driven by the supply -- the money is there.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more troubling to his critics is how Shuster spends his
campaign funds, since very little is needed to actually run his
election bids. Ruskin has filed an ethics complaint with the House
charging Shuster with using his campaign account to fund a lavish
lifestyle, something that would violate laws prohibiting candidates
from personally benefiting from their fundraising.
</P>
<P>
   For this election cycle, Shuster has already spent $1.18
million, FEC reports show.
</P>
<P>
   Those expenses include a $3,000-a-month salary for Eppard, his
former chief of staff who is now a transportation lobbyist but
maintains close ties as Shuster's top fundraiser. A grand jury in
Boston indicted Eppard for influence peddling in the more than $10
billion ``Big Dig'' highway project in that city, and the
investigation is continuing, although Shuster's lawyer claims the
lawmaker is not a target of the probe.
</P>
<P>
   But that investigation has clearly come at some expense to
Shuster: his campaign account paid out $102,749 in four payments in
April, May and June to the Pittsburgh law firm of Eckert, Seamans,
Cherin and Mellott.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the legal payments, Shuster still spent nearly
$200,000 from his campaign account in those three months. ``It's
astonishing that he spends this much money,'' Ruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign report is littered with dozens of dinners that he
dubbed ``political meetings'' at the finest restaurants in
Washington, suburban Virginia and across the country, totalling
more than $5,268 in just three months. All paid for by his
fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   On April 16, Shuster's campaign spent $205.29 on fours sets of
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somehow I think he could manage to win reelection without (the
flowers),'' Hendrie quipped.
</P>
<P>
   It's unclear what will happen in the House ethics investigation
of Shuster and the U.S. Attorney's investigation into Eppard, but
it's more than clear that those probes have not slowed Shuster's
fundraising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't sit back and wait for the money to come to him,''
Hendrie said. ``Once it's there (in his account), it's burning a
hole in his pocket. He doesn't know how to spend it fast enough.''

<P>
   John Dugdale lives on one of New York City's prettiest streets,
</P>
<P>
   an avenue lined with lazy trees and hundred-year-old townhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea skyline is visible through the conservatory of his
</P>
<P>
   top-floor apartment, where turn-of-the-century Americana sits
next
</P>
<P>
   to his collection of antique glass and porcelain. It's so
</P>
<P>
   beautiful, it's a pity he can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale is almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him how much sight he has and he makes an eye shape
</P>
<P>
   with his thumb and forefinger, poking through the bottom with
the
</P>
<P>
   tip of his pinky. ``Oh, about that much in one eye,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1993 and 1994 I lost more than three quarters of my
</P>
<P>
   sight; I have a little bit out of the bottom of my left eye, but
</P>
<P>
   it's very blurry,'' Dugdale adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale recently returned from two weeks in Britain, where he
</P>
<P>
   completed almost 100 landscape and interior compositions. The
</P>
<P>
   results will be a show called Nature and Spirit, opening in
</P>
<P>
   London this fall before moving to New York's Wessel and O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Gallery in November.
</P>
<P>
   After also exhibiting this year in Rome and Sydney, Dugdale
</P>
<P>
   reflects that losing his sight propelled him from being
</P>
<P>
   just another commercial photographer for magazines like Vogue
and
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living to an internationally recognized artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tested HIV positive in 1985, but I was always very
</P>
<P>
   healthy,'' says Dugdale. ``I thought it was the end of my
</P>
<P>
   commercial career, but as a way to make my family feel better, I
</P>
<P>
   said: 'Don't worry, I'll be a great, blind, art photographer.'
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised that I said it and so was I, because it was
</P>
<P>
   the first time I verbalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As his sight dwindled, Dugdale came to rely on the help of
</P>
<P>
   assistants to focus his camera and set up shots. For composition
</P>
<P>
   he uses intuition and memory of other artwork, often putting
</P>
<P>
   himself in the pictures so he gets the right pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely have a full, clear visual picture of everything
</P>
<P>
   that I photograph,'' he says. ``That really starts inside my
head,
</P>
<P>
   because eyesight and vision are completely different. I felt
very
</P>
<P>
   happy and safe when I realized my vision was totally intact.
It's
</P>
<P>
   just that my mechanical sight isn't working as well as it used
</P>
<P>
   to,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Able to make out dim outlines of buildings or natural features
</P>
<P>
   in strong daylight, Dugdale relies on touch to establish details
</P>
<P>
   like texture. Once he has felt an object or studied part of it
</P>
<P>
   with a magnifying glass, he explains, he sees it in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell from the light and the objects shape and from the
</P>
<P>
   100 questions that I ask people who are with me what is in front
</P>
<P>
   of me, and then I compose the shot in a very geometric way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Describing things to people, when they're doing the framing
</P>
<P>
   for me, I have to break it down to the utterly simplest kind of
</P>
<P>
   composition, because that's what people understand,'' Dugdale
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really communicate a photographic style or an eye to
</P>
<P>
   people, but what happened was the simplicity of the photographs
</P>
<P>
   turned into their style.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't stopped traveling, but the limitations of blindness
</P>
<P>
   mean much of his work concentrates on immediately available
</P>
<P>
   subjects, such as family, his upstate New York home and
</P>
<P>
   antiques.
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic, almost timeless feel of his art which two
</P>
<P>
   years ago attracted the attention of New York's Metropolitan
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Art. Associate Curator of Photography Malcolm Daniel
was
</P>
<P>
   involved with the decision to acquire a photograph of Dugdale's
</P>
<P>
   house, shot outdoors and inverted through the lens of a
</P>
<P>
   19th Century glass vase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photograph expresses something about photography itself,
</P>
<P>
   and the way that the world that we've created is reflected
through
</P>
<P>
   art,'' says Daniel. ``What particularly appealed to us about
this
</P>
<P>
   was the element of self-referentiality it seemed to be about
</P>
<P>
   photography, and about light and images, and the way the vase
</P>
<P>
   itself acts as a lens to show the wider world that you don't
</P>
<P>
   actually see in the camera itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel denies that Dugdale, as a blind photographer, is a
</P>
<P>
   novelty act. ``It's not like the person who paints with their
toes,
</P>
<P>
   where you say, 'Isn't it remarkable for somebody who doesn't
have
</P>
<P>
   hands to be able to do that just with their feet?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His deteriorating eyesight makes Dugdale more conscious of
</P>
<P>
   trying to capture certain effects of light and shadow which are
</P>
<P>
   essential to his work.
</P>
<P>
   And he's clear on the meaning of that work. ``My pictures are
</P>
<P>
   so accessible. They're about sadness, joy, beauty, death, life.
</P>
<P>
   All perfectly straightforward, unfettered emotions,'' he says,
</P>
<P>
   admitting to having run the gamut of those emotions himself.
</P>
<P>
   As AIDS began eroding his life, he admits, fear gave way to
</P>
<P>
   depression. ``I've had the experience of being lost in my own
front
</P>
<P>
   yard at my house in upstate New York. Most people have some
</P>
<P>
   ambient vision,'' Dugdale says, ``they can pick up shapes in the
</P>
<P>
   dark but as I lost my sight I would be plunged into total
</P>
<P>
   blackness when the sun went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only found the house by throwing pebbles and listening to
</P>
<P>
   where the sound came back from,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Lengthening Shadows Before Nightfall,'' was
</P>
<P>
   published in 1994 and dealt with his feelings as doctors gave
him
</P>
<P>
   less than a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a specific message in the book but there was a
</P>
<P>
   sense of calm and tranquillity, because after struggling with
the
</P>
<P>
   disease, I had to prepare to pass away,'' Dugdale says. ``Every
time
</P>
<P>
   my friends and family came I had to say goodbye to them. At
first
</P>
<P>
   I was hysterical, but then towards the end of it I realized
there
</P>
<P>
   wasn't anything I could do by being insane, so I relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's health improved with new therapies and the book was
</P>
<P>
   a success, drawing attention for his use of techniques and
</P>
<P>
   equipment more at home in a history book than the studio of a
</P>
<P>
   contemporary artist.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive blue of his work is the result of making
</P>
<P>
   cyanotypes, a ferrous-metal developing process pioneered in
1842.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to close out this century with the biggest body of
</P>
<P>
   cyanotypes that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedsides that process, Dugdale uses a 1912 camera in the
</P>
<P>
   field and shoots studio work with a 250-pound, 63-year-old
</P>
<P>
   behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's method has been such a success that his work commands
</P>
<P>
   up to $6,000 a print. As well as being in the permanent
collection
</P>
<P>
   of the Metropolitan, his patrons include Elton John, who
</P>
<P>
   hosted him on his recent visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale used John's estate as a base during his visit. From
</P>
<P>
   there he photographed English landmarks including Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   Printing a self-portrait taken on Britain's south coast, near a
cliff called Beachy Head, Dugdale was struck by his unconscious
choice of
</P>
<P>
   composition, a new theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beachy Head picture is so much about the precipice, and
</P>
<P>
   interestingly I didn't place myself on the edge of it,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing away, looking inland. Without getting too
</P>
<P>
   psycho-interpretive, that's a telling thing. I'm feeling present
</P>
<P>
   here and not on the edge anymore.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Perhaps it's only fitting that one of history's earliest
references to caffeine involves loathing and self-recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chinese legend, Daruma, a Zen Buddhist leader,
dozed off during a nine-year meditation. Upon awakening, he was
filled with disgust. To prevent another nap he cut off his eyelids,
then threw them on the ground. A shrub sprouted, with the beverage
brewed from its leaves warding off sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the tea plant, and its caffeine derivative has
firm roots: about 80 percent of Americans drink a little over two
cups of coffee, or caffeine equivalent, every day.
</P>
<P>
   Equally entrenched is the fear and guilt surrounding caffeine, a
drug. It's not pleasant to know there are people who would knee
their grandmother in the abdomen to get the last cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   And there's endless discouraging research, too. Studies have
linked caffeine to increased risk of heart disease and heart
attack, and as a possible contributor to bladder cancer and birth
defects. The whole thing is scary and depressing, enough to make
anyone give up caffeine - tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Your conscience will have to resolve things about your
grandmother. But as for the rest of it, it seems caffeine consumers
are engaging in unnecessary worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since caffeine is a drug, it would be nice if we could scare
people by saying your head's going to fall off if you ingest the
stuff,'' says Terry Graham, a professor at the University of Guelph
in Ontario, Canada. ``But really there is very, very limited
evidence that caffeine ingestion, unless it's very high, is going
to do much of anything other than create a mild dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a respected scientist whose work with colleague Lawrence
Spriet is regarded as the standard in caffeine research, is also
frank.
</P>
<P>
   Does consumption increase the risk of coronary artery disease?
No, says Graham. Bladder cancer? No. Birth defects? No. Addiction?
Yes, but mild and fairly easily overcome after a short withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say caffeine is glitch free. There is good evidence, says
Graham, that women who drink a lot have a harder time getting
pregnant. And because caffeine increases the amount of calcium lost
in urine, it contributes slightly to osteoporosis. But one study
noted that women who drank four cups of coffee a day could offset
that with a glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The only link of real concern actually has nothing to do with
caffeine. In certain instances coffee can increase blood
cholesterol levels, which could lead to a heart attack. ``If coffee
isn't filtered through paper there are lipids from the coffee that
get into your blood,'' says Graham.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also the voice of reason. Drinking an espresso a few
times a week won't kill you. But if you regularly drink unfiltered
thick coffee, you might reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, most experts agree. With caffeine, as with most
everything else, try moderation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cancer, birth defects, heart disease, they're all scare
tactics,'' says Ellen Coleman, a Riverside, Calif., sports
nutritionist who has examined effects of caffeine on health and
athletic performance. ``A moderate intake of caffeine is fine. And,
depending on the person, that could be the equivalent of up to five
cups of coffee a day.''
</P>
<P>
   That's the problem. Caffeine's effects, good and bad, can vary
tremendously by person, making it difficult to make specific
guidelines. Generally, Coleman advises keeping it to two to three,
8-10 ounce cups of coffee a day.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends this mostly to avoid negative short-term effects
_ nausea, headaches, insomnia, tremors, heart palpitations and the
certainty that, in short order, you will jump out of your skin.
</P>
<P>
   It's these consequences, not long-term health effects, that are
the problem, says Coleman. If you experience these, you're getting
too much caffeine. A lifelong coffee drinker, Coleman recognizes
her limit scientifically: if she drinks more than ten ounces a day,
``I feel horrible.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ignore these signals and continually drink too much
caffeine, Coleman suggests looking elsewhere for solutions. ``If
you're drinking more than three cups of coffee a day, or nine or
ten sodas, maybe you need to look at getting more sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   What about caffeine as a sports performance enhancer? Can it
make you run faster and bike longer?.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my mind that caffeine works, and
sometimes works very powerfully,'' says Graham. ``Many athletes can
improve their performance with caffeine.''
</P>
<P>
   This is news to some, but not others. Fifteen years ago, certain
athletes at the Hawaii Ironman Triathlon were drinking a concoction
of de-fizzed Coke, No Doz and aspirin named ``the Bomb.'' The
International Olympic Committee was sure enough about caffeine's
effects to place it on its banned substances list. And if an
athlete is found with urinary caffeine levels above 12 micrograms
per milliliter, they are punished.
</P>
<P>
   Several critical points. Most of us are not vying for an Olympic
medal. Second, without the aid of a pill, getting busted by the IOC
could be hard - you'd have to consume roughly 24 ounces of coffee,
16 cans of cola, or 8 pounds of chocolate beforehand. And, finally,
most research has been on highly conditioned athletes using fairly
high doses in pill form, more than you'd get in a cup or two of
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts agree a moderate amount of caffeine might help
the ordinary athlete's performance. A long distance cyclist and
triathlete, Coleman finds a cup an hour before exercise has made
some long runs and bikes easier. A marathon runner, Graham has
experimented on himself in the lab, with positive results.
</P>
<P>
   But before you drink up, consider researchers still aren't sure
exactly how caffeine enhances performance. And in a
soon-to-be-published study, Graham and Spriet say they found coffee
somehow appears to inhibit caffeine's performance-boosting effects.
</P>
<P>
   That the precise effects of caffeine are still unresolved is an
enticing dilemma for researcher Graham. But athlete Graham resolved
it long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't touch the stuff.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   John Dugdale lives on one of New York City's prettiest streets,
</P>
<P>
   an avenue lined with lazy trees and hundred-year-old townhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The Chelsea skyline is visible through the conservatory of his
</P>
<P>
   top-floor apartment, where turn-of-the-century Americana sits
next
</P>
<P>
   to his collection of antique glass and porcelain. It's so
</P>
<P>
   beautiful, it's a pity he can't see it.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale is almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   Ask him how much sight he has and he makes an eye shape
</P>
<P>
   with his thumb and forefinger, poking through the bottom with
the
</P>
<P>
   tip of his pinky. ``Oh, about that much in one eye,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between 1993 and 1994 I lost more than three quarters of my
</P>
<P>
   sight; I have a little bit out of the bottom of my left eye, but
</P>
<P>
   it's very blurry,'' Dugdale adds.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale recently returned from two weeks in Britain, where he
</P>
<P>
   completed almost 100 landscape and interior compositions. The
</P>
<P>
   results will be a show called Nature and Spirit, opening in
</P>
<P>
   London this fall before moving to New York's Wessel and O'Connor
</P>
<P>
   Gallery in November.
</P>
<P>
   After also exhibiting this year in Rome and Sydney, Dugdale
</P>
<P>
   reflects that losing his sight propelled him from being
</P>
<P>
   just another commercial photographer for magazines like Vogue
and
</P>
<P>
   Martha Stewart Living to an internationally recognized artist.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tested HIV positive in 1985, but I was always very
</P>
<P>
   healthy,'' says Dugdale. ``I thought it was the end of my
</P>
<P>
   commercial career, but as a way to make my family feel better, I
</P>
<P>
   said: 'Don't worry, I'll be a great, blind, art photographer.'
</P>
<P>
   They were surprised that I said it and so was I, because it was
</P>
<P>
   the first time I verbalized it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As his sight dwindled, Dugdale came to rely on the help of
</P>
<P>
   assistants to focus his camera and set up shots. For composition
</P>
<P>
   he uses intuition and memory of other artwork, often putting
</P>
<P>
   himself in the pictures so he gets the right pose.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely have a full, clear visual picture of everything
</P>
<P>
   that I photograph,'' he says. ``That really starts inside my
head,
</P>
<P>
   because eyesight and vision are completely different. I felt
very
</P>
<P>
   happy and safe when I realized my vision was totally intact.
It's
</P>
<P>
   just that my mechanical sight isn't working as well as it used
</P>
<P>
   to,'' he adds.
</P>
<P>
   Able to make out dim outlines of buildings or natural features
</P>
<P>
   in strong daylight, Dugdale relies on touch to establish details
</P>
<P>
   like texture. Once he has felt an object or studied part of it
</P>
<P>
   with a magnifying glass, he explains, he sees it in his mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell from the light and the objects shape and from the
</P>
<P>
   100 questions that I ask people who are with me what is in front
</P>
<P>
   of me, and then I compose the shot in a very geometric way.
</P>
<P>
   ``Describing things to people, when they're doing the framing
</P>
<P>
   for me, I have to break it down to the utterly simplest kind of
</P>
<P>
   composition, because that's what people understand,'' Dugdale
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't really communicate a photographic style or an eye to
</P>
<P>
   people, but what happened was the simplicity of the photographs
</P>
<P>
   turned into their style.''
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't stopped traveling, but the limitations of blindness
</P>
<P>
   mean much of his work concentrates on immediately available
</P>
<P>
   subjects, such as family, his upstate New York home and
</P>
<P>
   antiques.
</P>
<P>
   It was the classic, almost timeless feel of his art which two
</P>
<P>
   years ago attracted the attention of New York's Metropolitan
</P>
<P>
   Museum of Art. Associate Curator of Photography Malcolm Daniel
was
</P>
<P>
   involved with the decision to acquire a photograph of Dugdale's
</P>
<P>
   house, shot outdoors and inverted through the lens of a
</P>
<P>
   19th Century glass vase.
</P>
<P>
   ``The photograph expresses something about photography itself,
</P>
<P>
   and the way that the world that we've created is reflected
through
</P>
<P>
   art,'' says Daniel. ``What particularly appealed to us about
this
</P>
<P>
   was the element of self-referentiality it seemed to be about
</P>
<P>
   photography, and about light and images, and the way the vase
</P>
<P>
   itself acts as a lens to show the wider world that you don't
</P>
<P>
   actually see in the camera itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Daniel denies that Dugdale, as a blind photographer, is a
</P>
<P>
   novelty act. ``It's not like the person who paints with their
toes,
</P>
<P>
   where you say, 'Isn't it remarkable for somebody who doesn't
have
</P>
<P>
   hands to be able to do that just with their feet?''' he says.
</P>
<P>
   His deteriorating eyesight makes Dugdale more conscious of
</P>
<P>
   trying to capture certain effects of light and shadow which are
</P>
<P>
   essential to his work.
</P>
<P>
   And he's clear on the meaning of that work. ``My pictures are
</P>
<P>
   so accessible. They're about sadness, joy, beauty, death, life.
</P>
<P>
   All perfectly straightforward, unfettered emotions,'' he says,
</P>
<P>
   admitting to having run the gamut of those emotions himself.
</P>
<P>
   As AIDS began eroding his life, he admits, fear gave way to
</P>
<P>
   depression. ``I've had the experience of being lost in my own
front
</P>
<P>
   yard at my house in upstate New York. Most people have some
</P>
<P>
   ambient vision,'' Dugdale says, ``they can pick up shapes in the
</P>
<P>
   dark but as I lost my sight I would be plunged into total
</P>
<P>
   blackness when the sun went down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only found the house by throwing pebbles and listening to
</P>
<P>
   where the sound came back from,'' he notes.
</P>
<P>
   His first book, ``Lengthening Shadows Before Nightfall,'' was
</P>
<P>
   published in 1994 and dealt with his feelings as doctors gave
him
</P>
<P>
   less than a year to live.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a specific message in the book but there was a
</P>
<P>
   sense of calm and tranquillity, because after struggling with
the
</P>
<P>
   disease, I had to prepare to pass away,'' Dugdale says. ``Every
time
</P>
<P>
   my friends and family came I had to say goodbye to them. At
first
</P>
<P>
   I was hysterical, but then towards the end of it I realized
there
</P>
<P>
   wasn't anything I could do by being insane, so I relaxed.''
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's health improved with new therapies and the book was
</P>
<P>
   a success, drawing attention for his use of techniques and
</P>
<P>
   equipment more at home in a history book than the studio of a
</P>
<P>
   contemporary artist.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive blue of his work is the result of making
</P>
<P>
   cyanotypes, a ferrous-metal developing process pioneered in
1842.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to close out this century with the biggest body of
</P>
<P>
   cyanotypes that I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Bedsides that process, Dugdale uses a 1912 camera in the
</P>
<P>
   field and shoots studio work with a 250-pound, 63-year-old
</P>
<P>
   behemoth.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale's method has been such a success that his work commands
</P>
<P>
   up to $6,000 a print. As well as being in the permanent
collection
</P>
<P>
   of the Metropolitan, his patrons include Elton John, who
</P>
<P>
   hosted him on his recent visit to Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Dugdale used John's estate as a base during his visit. From
</P>
<P>
   there he photographed English landmarks including Stonehenge.
</P>
<P>
   Printing a self-portrait taken on Britain's south coast, near a
cliff called Beachy Head, Dugdale was struck by his unconscious
choice of
</P>
<P>
   composition, a new theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Beachy Head picture is so much about the precipice, and
</P>
<P>
   interestingly I didn't place myself on the edge of it,'' he
says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing away, looking inland. Without getting too
</P>
<P>
   psycho-interpretive, that's a telling thing. I'm feeling present
</P>
<P>
   here and not on the edge anymore.''

<P>
   Perhaps it's only fitting that one of history's earliest
references to caffeine involves loathing and self-recrimination.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chinese legend, Daruma, a Zen Buddhist leader,
dozed off during a nine-year meditation. Upon awakening, he was
filled with disgust. To prevent another nap he cut off his eyelids,
then threw them on the ground. A shrub sprouted, with the beverage
brewed from its leaves warding off sleep.
</P>
<P>
   That would be the tea plant, and its caffeine derivative has
firm roots: about 80 percent of Americans drink a little over two
cups of coffee, or caffeine equivalent, every day.
</P>
<P>
   Equally entrenched is the fear and guilt surrounding caffeine, a
drug. It's not pleasant to know there are people who would knee
their grandmother in the abdomen to get the last cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   And there's endless discouraging research, too. Studies have
linked caffeine to increased risk of heart disease and heart
attack, and as a possible contributor to bladder cancer and birth
defects. The whole thing is scary and depressing, enough to make
anyone give up caffeine - tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   Your conscience will have to resolve things about your
grandmother. But as for the rest of it, it seems caffeine consumers
are engaging in unnecessary worry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since caffeine is a drug, it would be nice if we could scare
people by saying your head's going to fall off if you ingest the
stuff,'' says Terry Graham, a professor at the University of Guelph
in Ontario, Canada. ``But really there is very, very limited
evidence that caffeine ingestion, unless it's very high, is going
to do much of anything other than create a mild dependency.''
</P>
<P>
   Graham, a respected scientist whose work with colleague Lawrence
Spriet is regarded as the standard in caffeine research, is also
frank.
</P>
<P>
   Does consumption increase the risk of coronary artery disease?
No, says Graham. Bladder cancer? No. Birth defects? No. Addiction?
Yes, but mild and fairly easily overcome after a short withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   Not to say caffeine is glitch free. There is good evidence, says
Graham, that women who drink a lot have a harder time getting
pregnant. And because caffeine increases the amount of calcium lost
in urine, it contributes slightly to osteoporosis. But one study
noted that women who drank four cups of coffee a day could offset
that with a glass of milk.
</P>
<P>
   The only link of real concern actually has nothing to do with
caffeine. In certain instances coffee can increase blood
cholesterol levels, which could lead to a heart attack. ``If coffee
isn't filtered through paper there are lipids from the coffee that
get into your blood,'' says Graham.
</P>
<P>
   But he's also the voice of reason. Drinking an espresso a few
times a week won't kill you. But if you regularly drink unfiltered
thick coffee, you might reconsider.

8-10 ounce cups of coffee a day.
</P>
<P>
   She recommends this mostly to avoid negative short-term effects

CROWS COLLECT BRIGHT MOMENTS INTO TWO-CD LIVE SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first time Counting Crows left their native Berkeley,
Calif., to go on tour it was the fall of 1993, before the release
of their debut CD, ``August and Everything After.'' They were
driving their own cars, and as they crossed the bridge to San
Francisco they blasted Bruce Springsteen's ``Thunder Road.''
</P>
<P>
   Three years and 6 million copies of ``August'' later, they
headed out again behind CD No. 2, ``Recovering the Satellites,'' in
a big ol' tour bus, 18 months of headlining shows around the world
in front of them.
</P>
<P>
   That's a big jump to make, and just how' big has everything to
do with the music on the band's new two-CD live set, ``Across a
Wire _ Live in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Recorded in August and November 1997 at Chelsea Studios (for
VH1's ``Storytellers'' series) and Hammerstein Ballroom (for MTV's
``Live From the 10 Spot'' series), ``Wire'' is one part
budget-priced gift to the fans, one part a stop-gap measure to
appease those waiting for a new Crows CD and one part a document of
how much the band had changed on the road _ from scuffling
opening-act club gigs to headlining sheds.
</P>
<P>
   Lead singer Adam Duritz is a big fan of bootlegs, and he wanted
to have one of his own band. This is as close as he'll ever come.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's like 250 bootlegs of us available,'' he says. ``We've
always kept in touch with fans on the Internet, so I know the kids
at the shows want a live album. Our fans won't stop bootlegging us
because they have this _ it's just a fun thing. And the shows were
really well-recorded. So we just decided to put it out.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, ``Across a Wire'' is a very good live CD _ in no small
part because it was done on a tour that found the band going beyond
the rather narrow sound of the first CD to embrace both harder rock
and a greater willingness to experiment.
</P>
<P>
   On the ``Satellites'' tour, big hits like ``Mr. Jones'' were
recast as acoustic folk and Duritz became a more expressive live
vocalist and more physical performer. And the band rose to the
occasion of having to simply make a bigger noise to fill the bigger
places they found themselves in.
</P>
<P>
   ``My songs are about yesterday _ how I feel about what happened
to me or what I thought _ and ``Satellites'' was about going on the
road for the first time,'' says Duritz. ``It was a huge change in
my life and traumatic and weird. It's pretty cool in some ways, but
you do give up your life for a big chunk of time _ people you know
go on with their lives and get married and have kids and you're
suspended in this bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was 6, I stood in front of a mirror and pretended to be
the Beatles. Now I'm 33, and I stand in front of 20,000 people and
pretend to be the Beatles _ and I pull it off. It's a weird thing _
going out in front of that many people and going back to a hotel
room alone. But the last tour wasn't as big a deal _ I wasn't as
overwhelmed with the freakishness of it.''
</P>
<P>
   That, finally, is why ``Wire'' is, at times, fascinating _ or
should be to any Crows fan. In a very real sense, we're hearing a
band growing up onstage, finding out about themselves and what they
want to become.
</P>
<P>
   And all this change is drastically affecting the current
recording sessions for the band's third studio CD. The increased
confidence that came with the ``Satellites'' tour led to the band
going into the studio with nothing written, no scraps of ideas or
guitar riffs on tape or anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to have very few preconceptions,'' he says.
``It's very experimental _ you have to follow the muse. It's very
much a work in progress _ we're trying to explore the songs and
what they're about and different songs rather than getting a
groove. This is a dramatically different way of making a record for
us, and I have no idea when it'll be done.''

THE STARR INVESTIGATION'S CAN OF WORMS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM WRIGHT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's long, costly investigation of
President Clinton seems not to have hurt Clinton politically. But
there is growing concern in scholarly circles that it has damaged
the office of the president.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed on CNN last week, presidential historian Allan
Lichtman warned that Starr's far-ranging inquiries, along with
court orders sanctioning the scope of his almost limitless charter,
have already wrought a ``huge institutional change in the nature of
the presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in history, Lichtman points out, a precedent
has been set allowing a sitting president to be sued for something
alleged to have happened before he took office. A private citizen
may sue him, and he is obliged to respond. Think of the
opportunities for mischief opened to anyone intent on distracting,
preoccupying or simply discrediting a chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   A second precedent is the concept that the president may be
investigated, at public expense, over things that do not relate,
even remotely, to his duties as president. The Whitewater episode,
genesis of this whole four-year investigative orgy, involved a
failed private investment in which the Clintons lost money years
before his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Still another disturbing innovation is the apparently accepted
verdict that an independent counsel, once installed, is virtually
unlimited in his prosecutorial authority and in widening the scope
of his inquiry. He can broaden the subject into almost any phase of
the president's life, and the president has practically no claim to
privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Now arises the concern that future presidents' physical
protection may be compromised by Starr's insistence on subpoenaing
the Secret Service detail assigned to guard Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, nobody knows if that's a valid worry. Whether future
presidents may tend to distance themselves from their assigned
protectors when discussing private matters could depend on so many
variables, including individual personalities, that I can't even
hazard a guess. Commanding testimony from agents is not illegal,
but is it wise?
</P>
<P>
   It does seem clear that, in these four ways at least, the
presidency has been diminished. That should concern us all,
whatever our personal opinions of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Future presidents will have to live with the legal impediments
and inhibitions imposed upon previously presumed rights, powers and
immunities of that office.
</P>
<P>
   The prolonged, highly publicized investigative assault on
Clinton has left other less-obvious and less-measurable scars. One
is an undeniable loss of momentum for all the president's programs
stemming from the obsessive daily news focus on every petty, sordid
detail of the allegations. Other news has been squeezed out, to the
detriment of this chief executive's effort to stimulate public
support sufficient to move Congress to act on his initiatives.
</P>
<P>
   Whether we agree or disagree with Clinton's policies, we must
ask if such systematic diversions of the public mind are healthy.
Think how easily future presidents may be similarly distracted from
achieving their leadership goals in the most fateful job on earth
if it's fair game now for political opponents to attack them in
court to gain legislative advantage.
</P>
<P>
   One deeply troubling consideration is the personal toll that a
continuous legal bombardment exacts from the chief executive, the
invisible drain on his mental focus and physical energies. Clinton
is still young, in his mental prime and physically robust. An older
president might not have endured the wear and tear on his central
nervous system that I can assure you happens to even the toughest
of us when one's personal integrity and dignity come under
persistent daily attack.
</P>
<P>
   Think of the unconscionable drain on the president's personal
finances. The Clintons are not wealthy people. They have no private
fortune. But they've had to come up with a reported $5 million to
pay legal bills to answer Starr's inquiries. The spectacle of the
chosen leader of the greatest country on earth held personally
hostage to ever-mounting lawyers' fees to defend himself against
allegations raised by a taxpayer-financed prosecutorial staff is
little short of preposterous.
</P>
<P>
   No other civilized nation would inflict such a burden on its
president. Yet this is the uncomfortable straitjacket that Congress
and the courts have forced on Clinton, with no consideration for
his personal financial solvency.
</P>
<P>
   It's true enough that Clinton has been told that he may raise
money from private donors to help pay for his legal defense, but
several serious questions arise from this. How much time and energy
does this solicitation siphon away from the performance of his
constitutional duties? What unspoken obligations of gratitude does
a president incur to wealthy backers who contribute to his defense
fund? Moreover, what self-respecting human being would want to be
put in that position _ having to beg for handouts to avoid
bankruptcy while proving your innocence?
</P>
<P>
   Special counsels wield enormous power over people. Some have
been known to abuse it. Arkansas seethes with stories of attempted
intimidation by Starr's prosecutors, desperate to find some charge
to hang on Clinton. They've reportedly threatened several innocent,
ordinary people with prosecution unless they'll testify to
conclusions to which they cannot honestly swear. Private citizens,
called before the grand jury, have been put through the wringer,
financially and emotionally, in the indiscriminate drive to find
the president guilty of something.
</P>
<P>
   One result of all this may be that people without independent
wealth will be disqualified, de facto, from seeking the presidency.
When that happens, Americans may wonder someday whatever became of
our long-held notions of democracy.

WATCH OUT FOR THE BUDGET-SURPLUS STAMPEDE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Predicting a $3.7 billion state budget surplus a
few months before an election is kind of like taking a bunch of
kids to a candy store.
</P>
<P>
   You better get out of the way.
</P>
<P>
   Political candidates have been scrambling all over each other in
their eagerness to cash in on Texas' continued prosperity,
promising to spend _ prudently, of course _ the anticipated largess
on numerous worthwhile and/or politically popular needs and
programs.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush wants to boost reading skills, renovate old
courthouses and give franchise tax exemptions to small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Democrat John Sharp and Republican Rick Perry, the rivals for
lieutenant governor, like the tax break idea too. And Bush's
Democratic challenger Garry Mauro wants to give schoolteachers a
$5,000-a-year pay raise and repeal the sales tax on motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   The list of promises goes on and on, aided and abetted by
another windfall, the $1.2 billion that Texas is expected to
receive in first-year payments under its record lawsuit settlement
with the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Dan Morales, who negotiated the tobacco deal,
is urging lawmakers to spend the cigarette money on health care and
anti-smoking programs. But Morales will leave office before the
Legislature convenes in January, and other politicians already are
suggesting other uses for the tobacco funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been poor, and I have been rich. Rich is better,''
singer Sophie Tucker once observed. And any number of state
officials, particularly those who remember the severe budget
crunches Texas endured during the recession of the 1980s, wouldn't
disagree.
</P>
<P>
   In those days, when state government was plagued with potential
deficits rather than blessed with surpluses, it usually was more
fun being a challenger than an incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   Would-be legislators or would-be governors would simply promise
to cut spending or ``scrub'' the budget and vow to oppose higher
taxes because that's what most voters wanted to hear.
</P>
<P>
   Those who were elected, however, often ended up eating their
anti-tax promises.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the only kind of tax talk we hear from the campaign trail
is how some candidates want to cut taxes or _ in the case of Bush _
have already succeeded in trimming them.
</P>
<P>
   Remember last year's boost in the homestead exemption from
school taxes, the highlight for Bush during the 1997 legislative
session? It saved the average homeowner only about $140 a year, but
Bush's spin on it is a bit grander. Speaking collectively for all
the homeowners, he calls it the largest tax cut _ about $1 billion
_ in Texas history.
</P>
<P>
   The budgetary outlook for next year's session is so rosy that
Sharp, who now is the state comptroller and official revenue
estimator, certainly didn't mind projecting the record, $3.7
billion surplus several months early.
</P>
<P>
   A key legislator requested the preliminary estimate, but being
the bearer of good news didn't hurt Sharp's race for lieutenant
governor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest beneficiaries of the state's good economic
times has been Bush, a fact that may sometimes be overlooked when
the governor's popularity and success in office are recounted.
</P>
<P>
   Without slighting Bush's own abilities, he had a much easier
time winning legislative approval of civil justice reforms, changes
in public education and other priorities because he didn't have the
enormous distractions that budgetary problems produced for other
recent governors.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also has avoided the public blame that incumbent leaders
receive, usually unfairly, when the economy turns sour. Instead, he
has benefited from the optimism that a good economy produces.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mark White was forced to call the Legislature into special
session to cut the budget and raise taxes only a few months before
Election Day, after the bottom had fallen out of oil prices in
1986. White didn't win a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The poor economy, among other things, also plagued Gov. Bill
Clements, who unseated White with an anti-tax campaign. Only a few
months later, Clements signed a record, $5.6 billion tax bill, and
his negative ratings with the public remained high the remainder of
his term.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Ann Richards, Clements' successor, also had to contend with
a revenue shortfall and sign a tax bill during her first year in
office.
</P>
<P>
   Bush courted a potential disaster last year when he urged the
Legislature to overhaul state taxes in order to provide deep cuts
in local school property taxes. The Legislature refused, mainly
because there was no financial crisis that required lawmakers to
make difficult political decisions on taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The budgetary stability helped Bush land on his feet. The
Legislature raised the homestead exemption and had enough money to
give school districts $1 billion to replace the revenue they lost
to the higher tax break, and Bush proclaimed victory.

DON'T BE TEMPTED BY INTERNET STOCKS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By PAMELA YIP 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A reader called recently and asked whether I thought Internet
stocks were too hot to buy right now.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a resounding yes.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. I'm a big fan of computers and the Internet.
Both are key tools for me in my job and entertain me in my leisure
time.
</P>
<P>
   But resist the temptation to buy them because many of them look
poised to flame out because they're so overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like them, but they're gasoline,'' said Brian Grove, a
principal at money managers Vaughan, Nelson, Scarborough &AMP;
McCullough in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   People want to get in because they want to grab a winner. But
remember you are buying a piece of a business and ultimately, the
value of a business is based on profits.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, profits are nowhere to be found with most
Internet companies. Still, they're worth far more than many
profitable established companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm evaluating these companies, I wouldn't even know where
to start,'' said Brendan Connaughton, a portfolio manager in the
investment management group at Wells Fargo Bank in Houston.
``You're talking about companies that in some cases have never even
made a profit. How do you evaluate a company on pure potential?''
</P>
<P>
   That gaping hole doesn't seem to bother many investors. Any
stock remotely associated with the Internet has soared to
stratospheric levels.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   The market capitalization of Amazon.com., the pioneer Internet
bookseller, has soared to $6.4 billion, nearly the combined value
of competitors Barnes &AMP; Noble and Borders, both of which earn
profits, which Amazon.com has never done.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet company lost $21.2 million in the second quarter,
although sales more than quadrupled.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks of search-engine companies, which help consumers find
Web sites, have risen so far so fast that investors are in a
fantasy world.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are buying these stocks without any thought as to what
they're doing,'' said Richard J. Fruth, head of Richard J. Fruth &AMP;
Associates in Houston, a money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, Broadcast.com, which provides audio and video
programming over the Internet, became the best-performing initial
public offering in history when it rocketed from an IPO price of 18
to as high as 74 in its debut on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Some Internet stocks are selling at a whopping 30 to more than
100 times sales. That compares to a price that is 1.87 times sales
for Compaq Computer Corp., according to Bloomberg News.
</P>
<P>
   ``These stocks are trading on so many assumptions about what's
going to happen in the future that the first time there's a hiccup
about any of these projections, the upside and the downside can be
dramatic, and they are certainly not for the faint of heart,'' said
R. Scott Bowers, senior vice president of investments at
PaineWebber in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   It's clear that the Internet is here to stay, but the problem
with trying to buy the next CBS is there is no way to tell which
companies have staying power.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has lots of opportunity, but we won't know who
the survivors will be until five or six years from now, and you can
be sure some of the favorites won't be around,'' said Anthony
O'Bryan, market analyst at A.G. Edwards &AMP; Sons in St. Louis, a
brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   A Houston company, which has joined the Internet frenzy, says
it's got what it takes to succeed in the business.
</P>
<P>
   Zapata Corp., whose profits come from harvesting and processing
fish, is bent on becoming one of the world's largest Internet
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a solid financial base and that essentially separates
us from the rest of the Internet companies,'' said Avram Glazer,
president and chief executive officer. ``The majority of purchases
that Zapata has made are profitable Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   If you think you're getting in on the ground floor of a great
thing, think again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's late,'' Fruth said. ``If they were going to buy these
stocks, they needed to buy these stocks two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   If you still intend to invest in Internet stocks, analysts
recommend that you put in no more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most prudent way to invest in these things is you buy a
diversified fund or a mutual fund,'' Grove said.
</P>
<P>
   But remember that what you're running up against is emotion and
greed on Wall Street _ a deadly combination.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people want get out of these things, they want out at any
price and when people want in, they want in at any price,'' Grove
said. ``That's fear and greed at work.''

ORIGINAL AVENGER DECRIES VIOLENCE IN CONTEMPORARY FILMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BRUCE WESTBROOK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAS VEGAS _ The video screens at PlanetHollywood flare and blare
with madness and mayhem. Bruce Willis wastes a bad guy. Sly
Stallone slaughters another. That's entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Then the theme restaurant pauses for a ceremony: Guest of honor
Patrick Macnee receives a black leather jacket and an umbrella, the
latter signifying his role as dapper spy John Steed on television's
``The Avengers.''
</P>
<P>
   The veteran British actor makes a statement _ and he wishes more
filmmakers would do the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Violence is a terrible thing,'' Macnee says. ``I took pride in
`The Avengers' in not carrying a gun. Of course, my umbrella
concealed a blade, but violence wasn't the point.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor is it the point of the big-screen ``The Avengers,'' due in
theaters Aug. 14 _ at least as far as Macnee can tell. Macnee has a
cameo in the movie, and he spent a week on the set with Ralph
Fiennes, who plays his old role.
</P>
<P>
   That cameo is supposed to be a surprise, so Macnee didn't want
to talk about it. But he was eager to discuss the original ``The
Avengers,'' both as a pop-cultural artifact and as a new element on
video's vista.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, A&AMP;E Home Video will release 12 digitally remastered
episodes of ``The Avengers'' in two boxed sets costing $29.95 each.
(Individual tapes cost $12.95.)
</P>
<P>
   Each set will have three tapes, with two episodes per tape.
They'll be in sequence from the start of the fifth season in 1967,
when ``The Avengers'' crossed the pond to debut on ABC.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Macnee was working alongside Diana Rigg, the most
popular of his four female co-stars.
</P>
<P>
   Her character of Emma Peel continues in the film, played by Uma
Thurman. And it's Rigg, not Macnee, who's most prominent on the new
videos' box art.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing smashing mod clothes and crashing into villains with a
martial-arts kick, Rigg starred in 51 episodes during two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Besides those 12 episodes coming to video, a one-hour
retrospective is set for cable's A&AMP;E. Hosted by Macnee, ``The
Avengers: The Journey Back'' will air Aug. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Macnee and Dave Rogers have co-written ``The Avengers and
Me,'' just released by HarperCollins ($22). It's Macnee's memoir of
the show's long history.
</P>
<P>
   In short, what A&AMP;E wrongly bills as a ``cult'' show is a widely
loved and ongoing phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of all these elements is ``really more of a
coincidence'' than evidence of a master plan, Macnee said. ``Two
years ago, I had no idea a movie was even being made.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was aware that illegal copies of ``The Avengers'' videos
were being peddled in the United States, and he helped fight a
battle to stop such sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``These video pirates had the nerve to say our show was in the
public domain,'' Macnee said. ``So we had to go to court to assert
the original copyright.''
</P>
<P>
   He's eager ``for people who weren't even born when it aired to
see our show the way we did it, with enhanced quality and no
minutes cut out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avengers'' hasn't been shown in this country since A&AMP;E ran
the one-hour programs in 1990. But it was a TV staple here in the
'60s and '70s. ``The Avengers'' debuted in Britain in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were before the James Bond craze,'' said Macnee, 76. ``A
lot of people think we were post-Bond. Well, we were pre-Bond.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he appeared in the 1985 Bond film ``A View to a Kill''
_ and co-stars Rigg and Honor Blackman also starred in Bond movies
_ Macnee said he loathes 007.
</P>
<P>
   ``That phrase `license to kill' puts me off completely,'' he
said. ``Those three words are repulsive. I played it the opposite.
I also thought, `If you have women about, why not let them do the
fighting?'''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting females were a big part of ``The Avengers,'' which
championed the '60s women's-liberation movement.
</P>
<P>
   After Blackman and Rigg, Linda Thorson became Macnee's co-star.
The show ended, then returned in 1978 as ``The New Avengers'' for
one season in the United States, with Joanna Lumley (later of
``Absolutely Fabulous'').
</P>
<P>
   Each woman had a different style, but Macnee's Steed stayed the
same: an aristocratic, unflappable fellow with a bowler hat and an
ever-present umbrella.
</P>
<P>
   Rigg's shows are hitting video first, but only from her second
season, which was shot in color. Her first season was in
black-and-white, which isn't as commercially viable.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why I'd love to see them colorized,'' Macnee said.
``Some people would look on that with horror. But we didn't do them
in black-and-white for esoteric reasons. We just couldn't afford
color at the time. As soon as we could, we moved to color.''
</P>
<P>
   The earlier Blackman shows are even more problematical. They
were shot not on film but live on tape, ``and they don't look very
good today,'' Macnee said.
</P>
<P>
   Rigg best matched his own lightheartedness, Macnee said. ``Honor
was much more serious, but Diana had a wonderful devil-may-care
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Avengers'' was ahead of its time in many ways, Macnee
said, but especially in its presentation of women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who else had a woman in such an equal and vigorous role?'' he
asked. ``Do you remember the women in `Bonanza?' I bet you don't.
</P>
<P>
   ```The Avengers' was original. When you had a woman come out in
tight leather clothing, sparking teen-age boys to lust and knocking
men over her shoulder, that was incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Rigg wore miniskirts even before they reached British
boutiques and ``The Avengers'' pioneered plots involving computers,
Macnee knows the show's posture isn't new by today's standards.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he believes the new film will continue it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Ralph quite liked having me on the set because I'm a
fairly benign person, and we became great friends,'' he said. ``To
my astonishment, he's playing Steed exactly the way I did it _ but
a lot better, because he's a hell of a better actor.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, the London-born Macnee lives with his wife, Baba,
and their two dogs in Palm Springs, Calif. (He has two children
from a previous marriage.)
</P>
<P>
   He's far from retired.
</P>
<P>
   Macnee hosts ``Mysteries, Magic and Miracles'' for the Sci-Fi
Channel, and he often performs on recordings of books, notably the
thrillers of Jack Higgins. ``A lot of us aging actors do that,
since we don't have to put our fat bodies on the screen,'' he said
with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier years, Macnee played on such TV series as
``Battlestar Galactica'' and in such films as ``Young Doctors in
Love,'' ``The Howling'' and ``This Is Spinal Tap.''
</P>
<P>
   He recently made a music video for the British rock band Oasis,
whom he found to be ``obnoxious and derivative of the Beatles.
Their talents are reasonable but don't justify their arrogance.''
</P>
<P>
   But he reserves his true wrath for bigger and more sinister
forces, embodied in current films that mindlessly offer violence as
entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Having been through World War II and seeing people blown to
bits, I think what (Steven) Spielberg is doing now (in his gritty
World War II film ''Saving Private Ryan``) is sensationally
right,'' Macnee said. ``I wish we'd had CNN with us at Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now a major movie, `The Avengers,' is coming out with a hero
who doesn't carry a gun. Hopefully it will make some sort of
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   As for his old show gaining new admirers on video, ``there's no
guarantee,'' Macnee said. ``People may feel they've seen it all
before. But it's a damn good show, and it still works.'' &QL;

BREAKFASTS MAKE B&AMP;BS MEMORABLE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By Harry Shattuck 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Upon arriving at a Texas Hill Country
bed-and-breakfast not long ago, I discovered a collection of breads
wrapped in cellophane and placed on a plate next to a handwritten
note.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rest of your breakfast is in the refrigerator ready for
you to warm in the microwave tomorrow morning,'' the missive read.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can top that,'' a friend said when I related this story.
``At a B&AMP;B where I spent the night, the proprietor left two coupons
valid for breakfast at a cafe down the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Am I confused?
</P>
<P>
   I thought the basic concept behind a B&AMP;B's existence involved
two priorities: (1) a bed and (2) breakfast. And we can find a
comfortable bed at Motel 6.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it's the breakfast _ served by a gracious host, of
course _ that gives a good B&AMP;B its distinction. A B&AMP;B without fresh
fruit and juices, crisp bacon and eggs and toast or muffins is akin
to the ``Killer B'' Houston Astros without baseball All-Stars Jeff
Bagwell and Craig Biggio.
</P>
<P>
   I recall fondly Betsy and George Delforge's strawberry French
toast at the Delforge Place in Fredericksburg; Cathy and Mike
Dillon's bananas Foster crepes at the Crystal River Inn in San
Marcos; and Ellenor and Arthur Link's huevos rancheros at the
Columns on Alamo in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   And I know folks who return time after time to savor venison and
pork sausage and grilled English muffins at Janie and John Orr's
Inn Above Onion Creek near Kyle; Dutch baby pancakes and raspberry
smoothies at Frances and Bill Harris' Heart of My Heart Ranch in
Round Top; and brie-and-bacon quiche at Pam and Tommy Traylor's Ant
Street Inn in Brenham.
</P>
<P>
   These hosts and others scattered about Texas have a passion for
creating a gourmet breakfast every day; it's the highlight of any
stay. I dare say they'd cringe at the thought of asking a guest to
nuke day-old food in a microwave.
</P>
<P>
   So would Jonnie Stansbury, owner-operator of Blair House in
Wimberley.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury opened her seven-room B&AMP;B _ a lovely establishment
that doubles as an art gallery _ in 1991 after spending 20 years as
an investment banker in San Francisco. There, as a serious hobby,
she had honed her cooking skills under the tutelage of Ken Wolfe,
the French-and Viennese-trained executive chef at Ernie's, as well
as Julia Child and Kim Hom.
</P>
<P>
   Stansbury's breakfasts are legend among B&AMP;B devotees.
</P>
<P>
   The repast starts with fresh-ground French-roast coffee, carafes
of ice-cold juices and fresh fruit _ a mlange of cherries,
cantaloupe and blueberries at our table.
</P>
<P>
   The morning bread selection may feature a braided almond loaf,
spice muffins with dried cherries, cinnamon rolls, piping-hot
scones or biscuits accompanied by homemade jams.
</P>
<P>
   All that serves as a mere prelude to whatever Stansbury's
imagination dictates as a main course. Delicate omelettes are a
specialty; ours included goat cheese topped with tomatilla or
roasted chipotle salsa. On other days, guests may savor a
vegetable-medley omelette, Virginia ham or perhaps polenta topped
with poached eggs and asparagus, accented by Hollandaise sauce,
with grilled tomatoes on the side.
</P>
<P>
   And at Blair House, breakfast is only part of the culinary
adventure.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving guests are greeted each afternoon with spiced tea,
sodas or sangria. At 7 o'clock, dessert is served _ maybe
chocolate-cherry-coconut poundcake; a caramel or
dried-apricot-and-almond tart; or Chocolate Decadence, a pecan
brownie with coffee ice cream and a warm Belgian chocolate sauce.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think you can escape by wandering into downtown
Wimberley a mile and a half away: Dessert will be placed on the bed
to await your return.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday nights bring a real treat. Although Stansbury says she
has no desire to operate a restaurant full time, Blair House
maintains the required license. And each Saturday _ for a $50
charge _ she presents a five-course gourmet extravaganza for guests
and others (24 diners maximum).
</P>
<P>
   Also popular are Stansbury's cooking schools combined with a
stay at Blair House: She will focus on seafood and vegetables Sept.
27-29 and on French and Italian country cooking Nov. 8-10.
</P>
<P>
   Many other Texas B&AMP;Bs provide both delicious meals and
comfortable accommodations. We'll focus on some of the best from
time to time in the Chronicle's new Preview section, published on
Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   For reservations at Blair House or information on Stansbury's
other food-related endeavors, call 512-847-1111 or access
http://www.blairhouseinn.com on the Internet. Room rates are
$135-$165, including breakfast. A two-night minimum stay on
weekends is required; plan these visits well in advance, too,
because Stansbury says Blair House hasn't had a weekend vacancy in
five years.
</P>
<P>
   Call these numbers to reach other B&AMP;Bs mentioned here:

DIGGING AND DIVIDING FAST-GROWING CRINUMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY HUBER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: Have you an easy way of digging and dividing crinums? I have
a variety of them and love them because they are so carefree. They
seem to get crowded; when is the best time to divide?
</P>
<P>
   How should I treat my mock orange to get blossoms? They spread
freely from the roots and send up long branches but no blooms. Did
I cut it back at the wrong time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Crinums do grow quickly, so when you dig and divide, give the
transplants plenty of room or you'll find them cozy again before
you know it. You can divide in the fall before it gets cold or in
early spring. Plant with the neck above the soil level. Water until
the newly planted bulbs are established.
</P>
<P>
   Mock orange flower buds form on lateral growth produced the
previous year, so keep this in mind when pruning. These flowering
shrubs are pruned after they bloom. After flowering, prune old
wood, either to the ground or back to a promising new shoot. You
can remove about a fifth of the big branches each year. If a branch
refuses to flower, take it out.
</P>
<P>
   Mock orange (Philadelphus spp.) will grow in sun to bright shade
in a fertile, moist but well-draining soil.
</P>
<P>
   Q: One of my angel's trumpets is losing a lot of leaves. The
other one is blooming but is getting a lot of yellow leaves as
well. The new leaves on my geraniums are almost white. What is
going on with them? Our fan palms are losing bottom fronds. Do they
like a lot of water? Some fronds are turning yellow before they
brown.
</P>
<P>
   A: It's difficult to maintain even soil moisture in the horrid
conditions we've had this summer in Texas. While it's normal for
the older angel's trumpets leaves to fall, the leaves on my plant
are yellowing and dropping more than usual. I blame the heat and
lack of an even supply of water. While I try to water daily, it is
so hot and dry the soil moisture does fluctuate. Too little water
causes leaves to yellow and wilt. The edges may brown and dry. But
too much water also causes foliage to yellow and wilt, and the tips
may brown.
</P>
<P>
   Geraniums do not like this weather. They are best off in bright
shade during the summer, or where they receive just a little
morning sun. While you want to water them, don't overwater so that
the soil is mushy. Frequent watering leaches nutrients from the
potting soil, leaving foliage pale. You'll want to replace those
nutrients with a time-release, balanced fertilizer or occasionally
apply a liquid formula. Don't try to encourage tremendous growth
and blooms this time of year. The plants usually revive when fall
arrives. Use of hard water also can cause pale foliage.
</P>
<P>
   It's natural for the lower fronds of your fan palm to yellow,
brown and die. This is an aging process. Simply remove these. Water
your palms twice a week during this critical time. Don't overdo,
it, however. About five minutes with the hose should be adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would appreciate your advice on how to go about preparing
my poinsettia for blooming for Christmas. It is healthy with lots
of green leaves.
</P>
<P>
   A: Let me begin with the guidelines on what to do with a
poinsettia after the holidays:
</P>
<P>
   Maintain your plant as you would most potted plants: Water and
apply a balanced fertilizer.
</P>
<P>
   When the plant has dropped its leaves in spring, repot and prune
the plant back to 6 to 8 inches to achieve a full, rounded canopy.
New growth will appear. Pinch as necessary to maintain a bushy
appearance. Keep the plant outdoors in a sunny or partially sunny
spot during the summer. Water it well while it grows, and fertilize
regularly with a balanced formula.
</P>
<P>
   To trigger the coloring process, begin a light-dark rotation in
October. Bring the plant indoors each afternoon and keep it in a
completely dark spot for 14 to 15 hours. Take it back outside each
morning.
</P>
<P>
   A night temperature of 65 degrees is optimum; much below that
will delay the coloring process. Day temperature is not as
critical, but try to avoid temperatures higher than 85 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I have a problem with St. Augustine in my front yard. There
is a large Arizona ash in the yard, and every winter and early
spring the grass is thick under and around the tree. As the weather
warms, the grass begins to thin. No matter how much I water or
fertilize, it stays this way until the weather cools. I have
noticed other yards with large trees do not have this problem. What
can I do to keep the grass thick during the heat?
</P>
<P>
   A: The grass needs more sunlight to remain thick. The grass
begins to grow while the tree is shedding its leaves or is
leafless, then gradually thins when the foliage is full in spring
and summer. St. Augustine will grow fairly well under large trees
when there is filtered light through a thinned canopy or there is
unobstructed, strong light from the sides. Your tree is benefiting
from all that fertilizer, too.
</P>
<P>
   There's probably not much you can do about light from the sides,
as buildings and other large trees often block such light. But you
could have an arborist carefully thin the canopy to allow more
sunlight to filter through to the lawn.

COUPLE CAN STILL TIE THE KNOT IN STYLE WITHOUT BREAKING THE BANK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 (WITH WEDDING-TIPS)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The high cost of weddings is causing couples to examine their
priorities, do their homework, comparison shop and compromise.
</P>
<P>
   They have to if they're hoping to marry for less than the
average cost in this country, which one source puts at a whopping
$17,634 _ and probably more!
</P>
<P>
   That, according to Modern Bride Research, was the cost of the
average U.S. wedding with 175 guests _ and that was in 1995, the
latest year for which statistics are available.
</P>
<P>
   The figure includes:
</P>
<P>
   _$4,068 for engagement and wedding rings.
</P>
<P>
   _6,503 for a reception.
</P>
<P>
   _And a $776 wedding gown.
</P>
<P>
   Plus basics such as flowers, photography and fees for clergy,
church or synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   The famed champagne maker Moet &AMP; Chandon tracks the cost of
weddings annually using 12 elements, including catering, gown,
flowers, cake, invitations and champagne (of course).
</P>
<P>
   Their survey found it will cost 2.6 percent more to get married
this year than it did in 1997, when the prices jumped a whopping
7.9 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Deduct the rings _ most people don't include them in their
budgets _ allow for inflation, and it puts today's average wedding
in the $15,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   That's a figure that makes some Seattle-area newlyweds and
soon-to-be-wed couples incredulous. They're having great weddings
at a fraction of the price.
</P>
<P>
   Take Lindsay Burch and Samuel Rathert, for example. Their August
wedding for about 125 guests promises to be fun, picturesque and
long on charm. And it will cost about half the so-called national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Burch says fun and comfort were all-important to them when
making wedding plans. ``We want people to come to a party and have
a good time. Miss Manners and Martha Stewart weren't important to
us at all.''
</P>
<P>
   They're being married at her home next to the Eastside
equestrian center, where she trains and teaches. Burch and Rathert
are spending the summer landscaping the grounds. They'll have
dancing, but it will be on the grass instead of a rented or
custom-built dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   Their wedding flowers are growing as you read. Burch bought 40
metal buckets she distributed to friends, asking them to plant them
with flowers and bring them to the wedding.
</P>
<P>
   She found a cotton wedding gown on sale for 50 percent off, and
arranged a trade-out with a photographer friend: Burch boards her
horse in return for wedding photographs.
</P>
<P>
   The couple opted for printed party invitations that were perfect
for the country-casual wedding and picnic. ``Engraved wedding
invitations wouldn't have set the tone,'' Burch says.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Spitzer and Cindy Smith knew they wanted to be married in
a beautiful place, so they spent $1,200 to rent the Daybreak Star
Center at Discovery Park for their June wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer says they seriously shopped around before hiring a
caterer for a pasta and Copper River salmon dinner for 90 guests,
costing $2,700. Then they used their network of friends to put
together the rest of the celebration _ totaling about half the
national average.
</P>
<P>
   A friend's sister baked the cake. The wedding couple brought the
wine and designed their own invitations. A friend arranged the
printing for a fraction of the cost of traditional invitations.
Another friend donated the flower arrangements, balloons and
seating cards as her wedding gift.
</P>
<P>
   Spitzer says they chose a photographer who charged a flat rate
for covering the event, gave them contact prints and a small album,
then turned over all the negatives so they could make prints
whenever they wanted.
</P>
<P>
   A week after her July 11 wedding, newlywed Claudia Montalvo
D'Ambrosia can't even remember how many guests attended when she
married Damon D'Ambrosia at St. Brendan Catholic Church in Bothell.
</P>
<P>
   The bride wore a gown borrowed from her best friend. The garden
reception for about 40 was held at a relative's home. ``We wanted
something simple and beautiful,'' Claudia says.
</P>
<P>
   They got it with two rented canopies, a luncheon buffet of deli
foods, and a cake from Costco. Total cost was in the low four
figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``For us, the religious part of the wedding was more important
than the party,'' Claudia says.

HOW TO KEEP THAT WEDDING COST DOWN  
 (WITH WEDDING-COST) 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSAN PHINNEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's tough to keep a wedding in the low four figures or less,
even a very modest one that includes just the basics of a few close
friends, some flowers, a couple of attendants, apparel (rented or
purchased), marriage license, clergy/-judge fees, and photographs.
</P>
<P>
   And the cost will quickly soar as you increase the number of
guests and attendants, use two sites (a church or synagogue, and a
clubhouse reception, for example), serve a meal and hire a wedding
consultant, photographer and a videographer.
</P>
<P>
   Bridal consultant Karen Cook says food, especially a served,
sit-down meal, can kick a wedding budget over the top in a flash.
``That can double food costs,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Weather is another foe. ``Around here we often need tents. A
tent for 50 people is about $400. One for 300 to 500 people is
about $2,000. Tent a whole back yard and it can cost $6,000.
</P>
<P>
   Photography can be another minefield.``People fall in love with
photographers _ it can be an $800 one or a $3,000 one, and when
they fall in love, that's usually it,'' says Cook. ``But you can
get just as good quality with someone who charges less.''
</P>
<P>
   Cooks, caterers, recent brides and grooms and those planning to
wed this summer offer a wealth of tips for keeping costs down.
Here's what they say:
</P>
<P>
   Establish a budget: Then figure out where you want to spend it.
Lavish food may mean less money for music, or clothes. Refer to the
budget frequently. Be up-front with service providers about what
you want to spend and find those who will work within your budget.
</P>
<P>
   Plan ahead: The more time you have to research, shop and
do-it-yourself, the more you can save. It also means fewer
compromises _ such as having to take whatever's available at the
last minute. Someone planning a summer '99 wedding, for example,
could find a sample gown from this season on sale right now.
</P>
<P>
   The Puget Sound region is notorious for its lack of wedding
sites. Clubs, restaurants with large party rooms, hotels, halls and
other sites (especially those with views) tend to be booked a year
in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Think small: Even an expensive venue _ a private club or hotel,
for example _ can be affordable for a small group. A wedding tea at
the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel is possible for $20 per person (plus
tax and gratuity).
</P>
<P>
   A private ceremony followed by a restaurant dinner for friends
can be another small, but elegant celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Use one site: Having the ceremony and reception in a single
location saves money and energy. The best possible solution is the
home or garden of a friend or relative. (Offer to pay for cleaning,
yard work etc.)
</P>
<P>
   If big homes and gardens don't run in the family, newlywed
Deyette DeJager raves about the Daughters of the American
Revolution house on Capitol Hill in Seattle. The $1,200 rental fee
gives you the whole beautifully furnished facility _ dining room to
ballroom. DeJager says this site includes china, silver,
candlesticks and other necessities for no additional fee.
</P>
<P>
   Always ask what the rental fee includes. Don't assume that the
social hall comes with the church, for example. Some sites don't
include tables or chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Some places require renters to use a specific caterer. Sometimes
this is cost-effective, sometimes not. But find out.
</P>
<P>
   Shop around: Find a gown, a caterer, a photographer that fits
your budget. Comparison shop. Bride-to-be Tina Summers found the
same wedding gown with two prices _ one $300 less than the other.
Guess which one she bought.
</P>
<P>
   Make what you can: Many couples design their own invitations or
have them printed inexpensively.
</P>
<P>
   One bride bought white chocolate hearts as favors and wrapped
each one by hand. She saved about $1 per favor, or $150.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of rentals: One bride found nice looking plastic plates
for one-third the cost of rented china. Rented tents, tables,
chairs, punchbowls and glassware can be very expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Some grooms buy formal wear when rental firms sell off their
stock. It's often cheaper than renting.
</P>
<P>
   Timing is everything: A morning wedding followed by a wedding
breakfast/luncheon, or an early afternoon ceremony with a formal
tea are probably going to cost less than evening nuptuals and
dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Summers got a disc jockey for her Sunday wedding for a fraction
of his Saturday night fee.
</P>
<P>
   Have your heart set on tulips? Marry in the spring. Importing
tulips in December can break a budget.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of flowers: According to one Capitol Hill florist, it's
easy to spend $5,000-$6,000 on wedding flowers.
</P>
<P>
   The alternatives?
</P>
<P>
   Find a home-based florist who does only weddings and special
parties.
</P>
<P>
   Or grow or arrange your own.
</P>
<P>
   Summers is buying potted plants and hanging baskets from a
nursery _ plants that go home and keep growing following the
wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Some large supermarkets (Safeway, for example offer wedding
flowers.
</P>
<P>
   DeJager bought her flowers wholesale, then paid $50 to have them
arranged.
</P>
<P>
   Another bride bought all her flowers from a neighborhood grocer
and invited five friends over the morning of her wedding to wrap
and wire the stems, then make the bouquets and corsages.
</P>
<P>
   Bride-to-be Angela Bostic discovered she could make all the
table centerpieces she needed for $15. The florist wanted $60 each.
</P>
<P>
   Public sites: Seattle-area parks and community centers are so
popular that the parks department has a special wedding
reservations line, 206-233-7068. Fees start at $250, plus a $100
refundable damage deposit. Most parks accommodate about 200 people,
a few can take 400 and and three are suitable for 50 or less.
</P>
<P>
   Caterer Susan Magan recommends senior centers. ``They're often
very nice,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Community centers from Alki to Laurelhurst, Magnolia to Yesler
are also practical options. Alki rents out a room that holds 150
for $27 per hour. If the facility is used after regular hours, a
staff person must also be paid $14 per hour, plus another one-time
$14 charge.
</P>
<P>
   Contact the desired center for information and reservations.
</P>
<P>
   Who pays? Traditionally, the bride's parents gave the wedding
reception, the groom's family the rehearsal dinner. But those lines
are being blurred. Today's weddings are likely to be a group
effort, paid for by the bride and groom and their families.
According to etiquette books, it doesn't matter who pays as long as
all concerned are comfortable with the decision. And all
contributors must be willing to compromise when necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Simplify Your Wedding'' by Allana Baroni (Reader's Digest, 144
pages, $17.95) is loaded with good ideas. Chapters have a colorful
little boxs outlining simple, simpler and simplest solutions to
everything from controlling the guest list to sites.

INUIT HARPOONS SNAG ENVIRONMENTALISTS' IRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By COLIN NICKERSON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANGNIRTUNG, Northwest Territories _ Word of the feat swept
through the widely scattered Inuit communities of Canada's eastern
Arctic with uncanny speed, bringing whoops of jubilation, tears of
joy. Hunters from this Baffin Island settlement, once a reknowned
whaling station, had harpooned a bowhead, completing their first
succesful whale hunt in more than half-a-century.
</P>
<P>
   Simeonie Keenainak, 48, and other Inuits, or Eskimos, in the
boat-borne expedition earlier last week closed on their quarry amid
the frigid swells of Cumberland Sound and plunged their harpoons
into the great marine mammal's glistening flanks with the deadly
precision of their forebears.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are very, very happy, and so proud,'' said Annie
Keenainak, daughter of the hunt leader. ``This is not simply a hunt
but a celebration of our Inuit ways. We are whaling people, and the
whale hunt was central to our society until it was taken from
us.'' &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   But by giving its official blessing to the revived native hunt,
Canada has joined the ranks of renegade nations _ most notably
Norway and Japan _ defying a world ban on whale hunting.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission, the world body responsible
for regulating commercial whaling, earlier this year condemned the
Pangnirtung hunt in a formal resolution and implored Canada to ban
it. The condemnation was echoed by antiwhaling activists and
environmental groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's outlaw whaling,'' said Paul Watson, head of the Sea
Shepherd Society. ``Unfortunately, in native communities, reviving
culture means having to kill something.''
</P>
<P>
   Bowhead whales in the eastern Arctic were hunted nearly to
extinction by commercial hunters, both aboriginal and white, during
the 19th and early 20th centuries. Although there is a healthy
population of some 7,500 bowheads off Alaska, the species has not
rebounded in the waters surrounding Baffin Island, where fewer than
700 survive, according to marine scientists. More than 10,000
bowheads swam in the same region a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is compelling scientific evidence that this is not a
population that can withstand any level of hunting,'' said Rick
Smith, Canadian director for the International Fund for Animal
Welfare, which has its headquarters in Yarmouthport, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The bowhead is internationally classified as an endangered
species. Canada quit the whaling commission in 1982, insisting it
is no longer a whaling nation, and has ignored the body since.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian wildlife officials defend the hunt as ``sustainable,''
noting that under an agreement with the Inuit, a designated Inuit
community may kill only a single whale every other year. They argue
that the survival of a native culture that once centered around the
whale hunt justifies the limited taking.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people have a cultural right to hunt this animal under
closely regulated conditions,'' said Stu Innes, a marine mammal
specialist with Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans.
</P>
<P>
   The Inuit say that the whales belong to them, not the world, and
that neither environmentalists nor the International Whaling
Commission have any business criticizing the hunt. ``It is our
right, part of our culture, to harvest any animal within Nunavut,
regardless of any regulations,'' said Eric Joamie, a leader of the
Pangnirtung Hunters Association.
</P>
<P>
   Nunavut, which means ``Our Land,'' is the name chosen for the
733,000-square-mile region _ inhabited by 25,000 people, mostly
Inuit _ that next April 1 will break from the Northwest Territories
and become a semi-autonomous Inuit homeland.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement leading to the creation of the new
territory, the Inuit won the right to resume hunting for bowheads.
The first such hunt, which occurred in 1996 near the mouth of
Hudson Bay, was a bloody debacle that humiliated the Inuit, who
take pride in their close relationship with creatures of the north,
even those they hunt for food, clothing, and implements.
</P>
<P>
   A team of hunters from Repulse Bay, near the mouth of Hudson
Bay, chased down a bowhead using high-tech sonar gear, then riddled
it with hundreds of shots from high-powered rifles. They finally
succeeded in killing the beast, but the carcass sank, washing
ashore several days later to rot on the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was very ugly,'' Keenainak told the Toronto-based Globe &AMP;
Mail newspaper earlier this month. ``But we learned a lot from that
hunt.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the hunters were armed with an exploding harpoon
fired from a shoulder-mounted gun as well as with heavy-bladed
spears. Accounts reaching Pangnirtung from the hunters' base camp
on Cumberland Sound, where the whale was butchered, asserted that
the kill was clean and swift. It was the first for the once-famous
whaling settlement since the 1940s, when whaling died out because
of a lack of demand for whale products; it was later banned after
the whales were found to be virtually extinct in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Bowhead whales can weigh up to 100 tons and reach lengths of 60
feet. The animal harpooned by the Pangnirtung hunters measured 43
feet.
</P>
<P>
   Inhabitants of this community feasted on the flesh, and portions
of the whale's meat and chewy ``maktak'' _ the blubbery outer
coating, an Arctic delicacy _ were transported by bush plane to
Inuit settlements across the territory. Remnants of the whale will
be used to feed sled dogs or cured into jerky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our ancestors carried out this harvest, and the whale hunt is
a way of making our culture once again whole,'' said hunter Joamie.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, took a dimmer view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not opposed to subsistence hunting by native groups,''
said Smith of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ``But this
particular hunt is very ill-advised. At a time when Canada and the
world should be celebrating the coming of Nunavut, it's very sad to
see the Inuit doing themselves such a disservice.''

B.C.'S OKANAGAN VALLEY TURNS UP HEAT ON RECREATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By GREG JOHNSTON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KELOWNA, B.C. _ To most Americans, Canada is known for
dog-mushing Mounties and puck-slapping ice warriors, not sun and
heat.
</P>
<P>
   It is the ``frozen north,'' after all, and everyone knows that
to find sun you head south.
</P>
<P>
   Got news for you.
</P>
<P>
   There's a huge valley in British Columbia called the Okanagan _
just north of Washington's Okanogan _ where heat rises off
pine-covered hills in summer and an 82-mile crystalline lake
provides a refreshing venue for all manner of recreation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans are not used to traveling north to get warmth,''
says Rod Lampard, lifelong resident of the valley and director of
sales at Lake Okanagan Resort. ``Quite often, they stop off here on
the way to the (Canadian) Rockies and they find this valley and go
`Whoa!'''
</P>
<P>
   The Okanagan is British Columbia's summer playground. It's
centered on glacier-carved Lake Okanagan and is anchored in the
middle by Kelowna _ a happening city of 120,000 _ in the north by
Vernon and in the south by Penticton.
</P>
<P>
   You will need sunscreen; during a three-day visit earlier this
month, temperatures soared past 30 degrees _ Celsius, that is _
equivalent to the upper 80s and 90s on the Fahrenheit scale.
</P>
<P>
   Eight hundred feet at its deepest, Lake Okanagan is the alleged
home to an oversize and elusive serpent known as Ogopogo. The joke
in Kelowna is that it is most frequently seen by patrons leaving
the bars at 2 a.m. The lake is also a superior setting for water
skiing, wakeboarding and pleasure boating, from jet-craft rippin'
to houseboat loungin'.
</P>
<P>
   The Okanagan Valley is on the northern end of the vast, semiarid
region of the Northwest that stretches along the east slope of the
Cascade Range from Central Oregon through Washington, and includes
such hot spots as Bend and Chelan.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that sets the Okanagan apart _ other than uniquely
Canadian coins such as the ``loony'' and ``twoony'' and accents
that range from Irishlike lilts and brogues to snowboarder hip _ is
the dizzying variety of activities available.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for a place that had swimming, golfing,
horseback riding and fishing,'' said Lauren Hartke of Auburn, who
vacationed with family members in the Kelowna area in early July.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went to Chelan two years ago, but we couldn't get into the
condo there this year, and they didn't have horseback riding. This
is beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   For decades the area has been known as one of North America's
top fishing regions. Lake Okanagan produces trout that can reach 20
pounds, and dozens of the famed ``Kamloops Lakes'' just to the west
offer superior fishing for a particularly renowned strain of
rainbow.
</P>
<P>
   In the hills and mountains on either side of the lake, hiking
and mountain bicycling are huge. Centers for these activities
include the historic Myra Canyon section of the old Kettle Valley
Railway, now a recreational path with 18 trestles and two tunnels
intact, and Okanagan Mountain and Cathedral provincial parks _ two
of 39 provincial parks in the Okanagan District.
</P>
<P>
   This is cattle country, and more than two dozen ranches offer
horseback riding in the surrounding hills and mountains. Kayakers
and canoeists have dozens of lakes to choose from, including
deep-blue Kalamalka Lake north of Kelowna. There also is excellent
rockhounding and bird-watching.
</P>
<P>
   The valley has long been known as Canada's ``fruit basket,'' and
in recent years the number of wineries has grown to 24, supporting
a blossoming ``agri-tourism'' industry. The valley also boasts
about 20 golf courses, three of championship caliber: Gallagher's
Canyon, Predator Ridge and The Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   In winter, two major ski areas operate in the mountains just to
the east: Big White and Silver Star.
</P>
<P>
   ``The valley is a four-season playground,'' says Jacob Astin, a
pilot for Air-Hart Aviation in Kelowna and a skier/snowboarder
who's partial to Silver Star. ``You can ski, golf and water ski on
the same day.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the main draw of the Okanagan is the giant lake and the
water sports it provides, hikers will find plenty of intriguing
opportunities. Backpackers head to 80,000-acre Cathedral Provincial
Park in the South Okanagan _ a rugged, forested wilderness of
alpine lakes, cliffs and canyons such as ``The Big Cleft'' _ or
26,000-acre Mount Okanagan Provincial Park just south of Kelowna.
</P>
<P>
   Okanagan Mountain is an arid expanse of spruce- and fir-covered
hills with about 20 miles of undeveloped shoreline on Lake
Okanagan. The area has two prime destinations: Wild Horse Canyon, a
lush and narrow rock defile popular among mountain bikers and
hikers, and a lovely cove called Commando Bay, where backpackers
set up camp above sandy beaches, with ancient pictographs on rock
walls nearby.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a fabulous place,'' says Linda Jones-Evans, an avid
hiker and owner of Outdoor Adventure Gear in Kelowna. ``It is a
very hot environment, and people make the beach a destination. It
is very unique because it represents the typical Okanagan
wilderness'' before the arrival of Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   With six primitive campgrounds, the bays and coves along the
park's shoreline are also prime anchorages for houseboaters.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the most popular path in the valley, however, is the
Kettle Valley Railway. Abandoned as a rail route in 1959, it winds
through the mountains above the valley at the 4,000-foot level for
hundreds of miles. The most dramatic stretch of ``the KVR,'' as
locals call it, is the stupendous 5.27-mile Myra Canyon, about a
half-hour drive from Kelowna.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that the 18 trestles and two tunnels are a
big draw,'' says Cam Baker, the goateed owner of Okanagan Mountain
Bike Tours, which leads trips there. ``When people get out on the
ridge, they are pretty blown away by the scenery.''
</P>
<P>
   The trestles, most of them wooden and one 780 feet long and
hundreds of feet high, remain a marvel of engineering, with views
from some reaching out over Kelowna and the lake valley below.
</P>
<P>
   It's a mellow ride, with decking and railing on the trestles
protecting cyclists and walkers from precipitous plunges, and the
railway bed is flat. However, at the western end of the canyon,
there is a rugged 3-mile ``single track'' called the Crawford Trail
that descends through forest and provides challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can be dangerous and try to kill yourself there,'' says
Baker, ``or just take a slow, easy, scenic ride on the railway.''
</P>
<P>
   Hard-core bikers have plenty of other spots in which to ride.
Ask any bike shop in Vernon, Kelowna or Penticton about places like
Crawford Estates, McDougall Rim, Campbell Mountain or Silver Star,
and they'll point your wheels toward some bumpy runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Okanagan is kind of a quiet mountain-biking mecca,'' says
pilot Astin, also an avid rider. ``The Okanagan has some really
amazing riding.''

<P>
   &UR;  &LR; It has happened before. It will happen again. And, when it
happens, it's the most devastating kind of natural disaster _ by a
long shot _ that human beings face.
</P>
<P>
   While the summer's blockbuster movies, ``Armageddon'' and ``Deep
Impact,'' explore the possibility that earth could be struck from
above with little warning, it is now becoming clear that this could
be far from just a theoretical risk. Our ancestors may have seen
similar (though less extreme) cataclysms firsthand.
</P>
<P>
   New geological finds in Australia, for example, show that about
200 years ago large stretches of coastline were devastated by
tsunamis that towered hundreds of feet high and roared at least 20
miles inland; the aborigines still relate vivid accounts of the
event, which some geologists say was almost certainly caused by an
impact in the ocean _ just like the one depicted in ``Deep
Impact.''
</P>
<P>
   And some scientists now argue that historical events ranging
from the fall of Rome to the collapse of Babylon and Egypt's Old
Kingdom may also have been brought about _ or helped along _ by the
crash of comet fragments that could have triggered earthquakes and
climatic shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1980, the idea that earth had suffered any significant
effects from impacts after life began was not taken seriously by
most scientists. But in that year, physicist Luis Alvarez and
others published a paper showing that the extinction of the
dinosaurs 65 million years ago was caused by a huge cosmic impact.
The idea, at first greeted with skepticism, is now widely accepted.
Now, scientists are beginning to consider smaller but much more
recent impacts.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers have begun to learn just how commonplace devastating
impacts have been in the history of the solar system, and now
scientists across a wide range of disciplines have begun to comb
through historical, archeological, geological, climatological, and
even mythological rec-ords from around the world in search of clues
about past bombardment of our planet. And they're striking pay
dirt.
</P>
<P>
   While proof is scarce, circumstantial evidence suggests that our
planet has suffered a long and terrifying history of cosmic
pummeling.
</P>
<P>
   That history, some researchers now think, is deeply ingrained in
our psyches and in our folk wisdom. It's no accident, they say,
that the very word for the worst kind of occurrences _ disaster _
means ``bad star.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that such claims are easily accepted. On the contrary, most
scientists remain deeply skeptical of any attempt to mine ancient
mythol-o-gies or oral histories for evidence of cosmic events. For
many astronomers, such efforts evoke too vividly the claims of
writers such as Immanuel Velikovsky, who insisted he had found
evidence from such ancient sources for a series of cataclysmic _
and scientifically impossible _ cosmic encounters during human
history.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the researchers who have been searching for
evidence of real cosmic impacts during the last few thousand years
face a daunting task.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Schultz, a geologist at Brown University who has been
studying a large-impact crater in Argentina that is about 5,000
years old, said in an interview that the first person to make a
convincing link between a particular impact event and specific
historical, archeological, or mythological accounts will have to do
so very convincingly to pass muster with scientific colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first tie has to be so well tied, so irrefutable'' that
cause-and-effect ``has really got to get nailed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schultz says he may be close to making such a connection with
the Argentine crater, called Rio Cuarto, by pinning down its date
with enough precision that it can be tied to specific accounts
passed down by the local people. But because he hopes to publish
his evidence soon in a major scientific journal, he would not
reveal the details of the links he found.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers know that impacts much smaller than the dinosaur
killer 65 million years ago happen much more frequently, and that
some of these must have happened within historic times. For
example, the explosion of a comet fragment above the Siberian
region of Tunguska in 1908 produced effects that could be seen,
heard, or felt for thousands of miles. If that object had hit in a
different place, it could have flattened a major city. If it had
struck the ocean, it might have devastated hundreds of miles of
coastline.

   BRUSSELS, Belgium _ Imagine Claude Monet standing before his
easel in a garden.
</P>
<P>
   Paintbrush in one hand, palette in the other, Monet dabs paint
onto canvas in the serene sunlight, re-creating in quick
brushstrokes the flowers of the garden, two women under a parasol
and a table laden with the midday meal.
</P>
<P>
   Now picture Meriwether Lewis poised at the Continental Divide,
the first of his countrymen to look beyond the Rocky Mountains into
an uncharted wilderness. With little more than his wits and the
rifle slung on his shoulder, he descends into a new world to find
either death or glory.
</P>
<P>
   Monet and Lewis are archetypes of their respective lands.
Despite a shared modern world of cellular telephones and stock
reports, Hollywood movies and traffic jams, Europeans and Americans
continue to approach life with distinctly different priorities.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe, stability, tradition and egalitarianism are prime
values. In America, innovation, risk-taking and unfettered
individuality are most highly prized.
</P>
<P>
   The American admonition to ``just do it'' is an alien idea in
consensus-crazed Europe, and the Jeffersonian maxim that ``the
government which governs best governs least'' does not apply on a
continent that looks to gigantic bureaucracies to provide a secure
society for all.
</P>
<P>
   Just one stark distinction between one side of the Atlantic and
the other: While American firms such as The Boeing Co. and
Microsoft Corp. stay competitive by getting many more than 40 hours
a week of work from most hard-charging employees, government
inspectors in France are conducting raids and fining companies
where middle managers exceed the weekly 39-hour work limit (soon to
be lowered to 35).
</P>
<P>
   Yet, a further look at the artist and adventurer will reveal
deeper themes that, in these concluding months of the 20th century,
are drawing Europe and the United States together in a common
interest that transcends differences, a shared destiny that could
allow the trans-Atlantic partners to dominate the globe for a
century to come.
</P>
<P>
   First, look more closely at Monet, the European. The moment in
which we have glimpsed him is a real day in 1870, and the artist is
not in a French garden but a London park. He has fled to England
while a Prussian army lays siege to Paris. Soon, the city will be
seized by revolutionaries on a doomed and bloody march toward a
more just society.
</P>
<P>
   The war and revolt from which Monet escaped were just two deadly
events in a long succession of intra-European bloodlettings that
would reach horrific proportions in the first and second world
wars. The civilized core of Europe that Monet represents would
finally assert itself only after that last war with a dreamy plan
for unity and permanent peace, a plan that today is taking
corporeal form, step by plodding step, in the evolving European
Union.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as five years ago, many doubted the plan would work.
A big scheme was in the works to create one currency for the
members of what was then called the European Community, and there
were three big reasons why it could never happen.
</P>
<P>
   First, the economic gaps between rich countries and poor were
too great. The Germans would never give up their strong deutsche
marks for a weak European currency dragged down by the likes of
Ireland, Greece and Spain.
</P>
<P>
   Second, Europeans, coddled by an extensive and expensive welfare
state, would never allow politicians to cut benefits in order to
lower national debts and budget deficits, even though a viable
common currency would depend on tight fiscal policies.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Europeans were just too nationalistic. They would never
give over such a significant piece of sovereignty to a committee of
international bankers.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, on Jan. 1, 1999, the euro _ one common currency for 11
members of the EU _ will become a reality. Within a few years, even
in reluctant countries such as Britain and Denmark, the euro is
almost certainly going to take the place of pounds and kroners.
</P>
<P>
   The ommon currency will be a huge step toward a more united
Europe. It will create an economic bloc equal in size to the U.S.
economy, and a trading bloc bigger than America. In time, the euro
may well rival the dollar as the dominant world currency.
</P>
<P>
   How did this impossibility become possible? Mostly, it was a
matter of luck, stubborn will and a recognition of economic
realities.
</P>
<P>
   The worldwide economic boom of the past few years helped turn
backward nations, such as Ireland, into thriving centers of
economic activity. At the same time, the enormous cost of
unification with East Germany slowed the German economy, the result
being that most EU members now find themselves on a roughly similar
economic level.
</P>
<P>
   The dismal failure of the Marxist states of Eastern Europe and
the booming success of tight fiscal policies in the United States
pretty well resolved the economic debates between left and right.
Socialist leaders all over Europe became acolytes of Alan Greenspan
and market economics.
</P>
<P>
   This conversion created a unanimous view that national
governments had to slash budgets and reduce debts, a task suddenly
made easier by the robust world economy. With more money to work
with, the cuts and trimming turned out to be less painful.
</P>
<P>
   To the extent it was painful, national politicians placed blame
for the strict budgetary policies on those nasty EU bureaucrats in
Brussels, and escaped retribution themselves. This blame-shifting
has heightened resentment against Brussels among a majority of
Europeans, and there is currently a bit of a political backlash
against the EU in Germany, France and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But in the long run, it doesn't much matter. The key reality is
that the criteria for becoming part of the common currency regime
have been met by most EU members. The increased economic activity
the euro will create should make everyone feel more sanguine about
the EU, while the deepened ties of commerce will strengthen the web
of unity throughout the continent.
</P>
<P>
   As for national sovereignty, everyone came to realize that
economic independence was already seriously limited. As one EU
economist observes, ``The French central bank has 15 minutes of
freedom: from the time the German Bundesbank makes a proposal to
the time the French realize they must go along with it.''
</P>
<P>
   At least with a pan-European central bank, every country will be
able to put in its two cents (or two pence or two centimes) worth
before the Germans decide.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the persistent political will to make it all
happen. This will is born of a deep fear that, if the union of
European nations fails to thrive and expand until all of Europe,
from Portugal to the Ukraine is tied together by bonds of commerce
and law and democratic institutions, the horrific conflicts of the
past could too easily return.
</P>
<P>
   In the history of the world, there's never been a political
creature quite like the European Union. Observing the organization
at close quarters here in Brussels, one can easily agree with an
American official who describes the EU as ``a massive, throbbing
bureaucracy that runs on meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   The EU has no real head _ its presidency revolves from one
member state to another every six months _ and its parliament thus
far lacks much real power. Its consensual decision-making
procedures were designed for the original group of six nations, not
for 15. Unless major changes are made, the whole structure will
simply creak to a halt once another dozen countries join up.
</P>
<P>
   But, unlikely as it looks now, those changes will somehow be
willed to happen, and in 100 years the EU will have a very
different design. No one can say quite what it will be like, but as
Europeans like to point out, it took two centuries and a civil war
to make the United States what it is today.
</P>
<P>
   So now let's consider again the American archetype, Meriwether
Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was not merely a solitary explorer, but the commanding
officer of a government-funded expedition sent not only to secure
the claim of the United States over a vast new territory purchased
from France, but to enter disputed lands beyond the Rockies and
find a trade route to the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewis and Clark expedition was a giant step toward the
eventual extension of American economic and military power around
the globe. Lewis broke a path that led to superpower.
</P>
<P>
   Europeans should be forever grateful that Thomas Jefferson
designed and promoted this mission to claim a continent. Without
the patronage of a superpower, without the economic engine of
American enterprise that rebuilt Europe after World War II and the
protection of American military muscle throughout the Cold War,
Europe may never have escaped the ashes of its conflicts and
revolutions.
</P>
<P>
   Some argue that with Europe prosperous, largely peaceful and
increasingly more unified, the United States no longer has a
purpose in Europe, and that Europeans and Americans will inevitably
go their separate ways.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the opposite may be true. The lands of Monet and Lewis
have convergent interests that should bind them more closely than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   The genocidal disintegration of Yugoslavia is convincing proof
that the old evils of European nationalism are not deeply buried,
and there is widespread agreement that the faster all of Europe can
be bound together, the better the chance for lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
   The EU, of course, provides one track for European integration.
But there is another complimentary track in which Americans have a
pivotal role: NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Many countries in Eastern Europe are so economically backward
that it will be years before they can meet the requirements for
membership in the EU. In the meantime, ways must be found to keep
them heading toward fuller democracy and freer markets, and away
from ethnic conflict and dictatorship.
</P>
<P>
   Whether as full NATO members or participants in the more
amorphous Partnership for Peace, it is current U.S. policy to bring
into NATO's orbit all the former vassal states of the Soviet Union.
This is a very controversial policy, as evidenced by the recent
Senate debate over admission of Poland, Hungary and the Czech
Republic into NATO.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of this policy raise fears of offending Russia _ though
Russia has already been given a place at the table at NATO
headquarters in Brussels. They insist American arms manufacturers
will be the prime beneficiaries of NATO enlargement, and ask if
Americans are really ready to send their sons and daughters to die
defending, say, Slovenians or Bulgarians.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of the policy insist NATO expansion is necessary to
fulfill past promises made to captive nations and to keep the lid
on European squabbles so there will be no more vast cemeteries on
European soil filled with the bodies of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides make serious points, but both ultimately are
projecting NATO's past role into the future. NATO's future,
however, will be very different from what most Americans realize.
</P>
<P>
   In the years ahead, NATO will be much less a tool for defending
territory in Europe than a vehicle for defending European and
American interests around the globe. Controlling arms
proliferation, protecting energy resources, projecting power
against anti-democratic forces in Africa and Asia _ these will be
NATO missions in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, NATO has been and continues to be a good deal for
Europeans. They get to keep their defense budgets low while they
enjoy the protection of the U.S. military shield.
</P>
<P>
   For Americans, though, it is crucial to understand what the
United States gets in return. NATO binds Europe to the United
States and provides a European forum where American influence can
be used to its maximum. Other than the French (who would like to
lead themselves), Europeans are generally quite happy to have
Americans lead NATO (they certainly don't want the French bossing
them around).
</P>
<P>
   Besides, what's the alternative? Would Americans be better off
with a more and more economically powerful Europe divorced from the
United States? Should the United States withdraw and leave a vacuum
in world power to be filled by an authoritarian China? Would it be
better to go it alone when confronting reactionary religious
zealots in the Middle East? Is it wise to leave an unpredictable
Russian state without a link to NATO and no incentive to move
closer to a democratic social model?
</P>
<P>
   No, there is no good alternative to a deeper alliance between
Europe and America.
</P>
<P>
   Already, trade and investment between the United States and
Europe add up to $1.5 trillion a year, and unlike trade with Asia,
it is trade that is in balance. One of every 12 American industrial
jobs is based on European trade. All of this will only grow as the
euro breaks down internal barriers in European markets.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, there are risks. Working with the ponderous and rigid
EU bureaucracy will often be infuriating. Of even greater concern,
the rise of the euro will mean the United States will no longer be
able to act alone when it comes to monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   But that's all the more reason to deepen cooperation with the
EU. The dollar will still be king, but it will have to share the
throne with a euro queen.
</P>
<P>
   For the Europeans, the risks may be greater. After years of
whining about American pop culture undermining European arts,
cuisine and languages, they now have more serious worries that, in
the freer market the euro will bring, Europeans will lag far behind
Americans in electronic commerce, agriculture, biotech products and
service industries.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the risks of engagement, the risks of drifting apart
are far, far greater. There will be many perils in the century to
come _ international crime, environmental emergencies, religious
fanaticism, ethnic conflict, nuclear terrorism. For democratic,
humane civilization to prevail, there must be a strong force to
meet those challenges.
</P>
<P>
   An American analyst at the U.S. mission to the EU states the
case clearly: ``When the EU and the U.S. work together, there
aren't many forces in the world that can block us. We are providing
a force for the improvement of mankind.''
</P>
<P>
   Which other powers can do it? Which others are willing to lead?
None but the lands of Monet and Lewis, with all their differences,
united in common cause to defend the shared values of the West.

IS THEIR BOND BUY A BOMB? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Enclosed is a broker's statement involving municipal bonds we
purchased in May at the advice of our tax adviser, who stated we
should have some of our money in bonds that are not subject to
federal income tax. We have never purchased bonds before, so we
have no experience. We were shocked and surprised when we received
the statement and learned the value of our bonds was less than the
purchase price. The broker ``explained,'' but we were not
satisfied. Have we already lost $421.78 on our investment?
</P>
<P>
   J.Y., Lancaster, Wis. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, whatever else happened, your broker and/or tax adviser
did a poor job at explaining your investment to you. To my
thinking, making sure that a customer understands the securities
that he or she is buying is a critical part of the job, and it
wasn't dome here. But as long as you plan on holding these bonds
until their maturity in the year 2021, you have nothing to worry
about. Not only are the bonds insured, which means that the insurer
will make good on the indebtedness even if the issuer, a children's
hospital, can't.
</P>
<P>
   Have you 'lost' $421? No _ but you would have lost that amount _
plus the amount of your broker's commission _ had you sold the
bonds on the statement date. What that $421 is an unrealized loss.
How can bonds decline in value by about 2.8 percent in only two
months? Although the municipal bond markets are generally
considered a fairly sleepy corner of the financial arena, the fact
is that short-term swings in the bond market can be quite
significant. Bonds not only lose value when interest rates rise,
but even when people just worry that interest rates might be headed
north. Conversely, when interest rates fall, or when it seems
likely that they will, bond portfolios show principal gains.
Moreover, the longer the duration of the bonds _ and with more than
20 years until maturity, these are long-term bonds _ the greater
this volatility will be.
</P>
<P>
   Should all of this, including the unrealized loss of $421,
concern you? Well, I presume your tax adviser suggested this
purchase as a long-term holding, something that will provide you a
consistent, tax-exempt, return of 5.125 percent until maturity. As
I said before, if you hold the bonds until maturity (or until
they're called) your principal will be repaid in full.
</P>
<P>
   But as you've seen, bonds can make horrible short-term holdings,
and they're a poor investment for a person who might need to cash
out of the position to meet some financial emergency. If this
happens, and if you have the bad luck to have to sell at a time
when interest rates are significantly higher than when the bonds
were issued, you would face a substantial loss.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all that, I think that as you gain more experience as a
bond holder you'll begin to understand that the thing to do is
ignore current market value, prizing instead the tax- exempt
interest checks that will come in twice a year. Usually with bonds,
market activity represents a lot of choppy weather, but ultimately
they seem to go nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. I am 48 years old and have been self-employed for the past 20
years. Instead of depositing money in a retirement fund, I used any
extra money to pay off a valuable piece of property that I used in
my business. In the near future I will sell this property, and my
CPA tells me I will net $500,000 after taxes. It would take $20,000
to pay off the mortgage on our home, which is the only thing we
own, and we intend to add on to the house at a cost of $30,000.
Should we pay off the house and pay cash for the remodeling, or
refinance and use invest all the money for retirement? I would like
to retire as soon as possible, and based on our current living
standard $30,000 a year would be enough for us to live comfortably
if the house were paid off. I am currently employed and can
continue to work as long as it necessary to assure an adequate
future income stream. How should I invest the money? For this
calculation, let's assume $450,000 will be available to invest.
</P>
<P>
   C.V., Vidor, Texas &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. From your last sentence, I assume you're pretty much decided
to retire the mortgage and pay cash for the remodeling, and I
agree. A paid-up home brings a very solid element of financial
security, and I wish more people looked forward to mortgage-burning
parties, rather than anxiously scanning the real estate market,
hoping to become eligible for an even larger homeowner's equity
line of credit.
</P>
<P>
   I think I'm following your thinking about retirement. You
calculate, I'll bet, that you would need only a 6.66 percent return
on the remaining $400,000 to generate that $30,000 income stream.
That is correct, but especially when you're thinking of retiring
before age 50, you have to think beyond a retirement income stream
and a paid-off home. You have to consider very seriously that
dreaded word 'inflation,' and the earlier you retire, the more
intensely you should think about it. If inflation runs at 3
percent, in a decade that $30,000 would have the buying power of
$22,322 of today's money; at 4 percent inflation, the buying power
would sink to $20,266.
</P>
<P>
   A rough rule of thumb I sometimes use is that a person retiring
early should have enough money saved so that only two thirds of it
will generate the desired income stream, with the final third,
invested more aggressively, is left to grow as a buffer against
future inflation. By this thinking, you would need to have $675,000
amassed to retire comfortably. You might achieve this by just
waiting, or speed up the process with additional savings. If you
were to simply invest the $450,000 and let the account grow until
it hits the target level _ in about 5.5 years if you achieved a
portfolio average 7.5 percent total returns (and paid the taxes
resulting from those gains from other funds.) If you were to add
$1,000 a month to the account and achieved the same growth rate,
you would reach the target in a little more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   As for investments, what I usually suggest as a portfolio to
generate an income stream is 50 percent in a good GNMA fund, and 25
percent each in a short-term bond fund and a high-yield bond fund.
At current rates, you could expect such a portfolio to deliver an
overall yield of about 6.5 percent. Excellent funds in these
categories are offered my most fund families _ I generally cite
Vanguard and Fidelity because both have good funds in these
categories with low expense ratios. So my suggestion is that you
put $300,000 of that $450,000 in such a portfolio. The final
$150,000 should eventually go into a solid and somewhat
conservative stock fund in the growth and income category _
something such as Fidelity fund or Vanguard Index Value fund. If
you are cautious about the markets in general, you might substitute
balanced funds, such as Fidelity Puritan and Vanguard Balanced
Index. This would lower your long-term returns, but would also give
you less volatility. However you go, I would use 36-month dollar
cost averaging to make the stock fund investments, which means
initially putting $4,500 into the target fund and the balance in a
money market fund. If you then had an additional $4,500 transferred
into the stock fund each month, you would be fully invested in the
36th month, presuming 5 percent returns from the money fund. This
technique would limit your returns if the bull market in stocks
continues to run apace, but offers you some protection if a market
correction hits.
</P>
<P>
   Finally , if you're going to be adding to the accounts, I would
allocate the additions to the overall portfolio so that the
proportions remain two thirds in the income portfolio and one third
in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. As a widow reaching 65 in November, I'm concerned that my
asset allocation is too heavy in stocks. I have $281,000 in stocks
and stock funds and $237,000 in fixed-income holdings, including
money markets. My financial planner advises more and more stocks.
</P>
<P>
   E.D., Arlington, Vt. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, I can't agree. I tally that you now have a little more
than 54 percent in stocks, which seems a lot to me, especially at
what I view as the petering-out phase of a bull market. Among the
holdings you detail is $50,000 of IRA money in a stock fund. This
is money which can be moved with no immediate tax consequence, so I
would simply transfer it to the fixed-income side, probably adding
to the position in Vanguard's GNMA or Total Bond Index. If there
are other stock investments you can liquidate without heavy tax
consequences, I think I'd go a bit further as well, seeking a
target portfolio with no more than $207,000, or roughly 40 percent,
in stocks.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``The Gingerbread Man''  &LR; _ Director Robert
Altman's improvisational style and writer John Grisham's plotting
would seem to make for a solid marriage. Not so. This rambling
mystery starring Kenneth Branagh _ not to be confused with the J.P.
Donleavy book _ goes nowhere, slowly.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``The Peacekeeper''  &LR; _ No, not the one with George Clooney _
that's ``Peacemaker.'' Dolph Lundgren stars here, as the one guy
who can save the world from nuclear anni-hilation. The erstwhile
action star is getting a little old for all this stuff, falling
behind Stallone and Van Damme in the macho standings. Only Roy
Scheider and Montel Williams in supporting roles save this disaster
film from, well, disaster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Dead Heart''  &LR; _ Brian Brown, in one of his finest
performances, portrays an Australian lawman caught in a cultural
crossfire. Complex and challenging, which makes it different from
so many other films released this year. Perhaps the beginning of
another Australian renaissance.

 UNDATED: ... miles of coastline.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Events of that size, astronomers estimate, happen on average
about once every 100 or 200 years. A few dozen such impacts should
have taken place within human history, they say, and might have
been so destructive and astonishing that accounts of the cataclysm
would have been passed down through the generations and their
imprints left in the ground. The Australian tsunamis may be just
such a case.
</P>
<P>
   Such imprints don't necessarily include a crater, the most
recognizable sign of an impact. The Tunguska blast left none,
having exploded about 20 miles above the ground. But sediments left
by -tsunamis, traces of massive earthquakes or of unusually thick
layers of dust kicked up by the impact, may have left their
telltale traces around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Bryant, a geologist at Wollongong University in Australia,
has found evidence of massive tsunamis all around Australia _ even
on opposite coasts, regions that face different oceans and could
not have seen the effects of the same tsunamis. He is convinced
that no other known cause _ no undersea earthquake or landslide _
that could have occurred in that region would have been sufficient
to produce the towering waves that the geological deposits reveal.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence shows the waves reached heights of at least 200
feet, and carried large boulders at least 20 miles inland. They
apparently took place a little more than 200 years ago _ just
before European settlers first arrived on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it must have been an impact slightly bigger'' than
the Tunguska blast, Bryant said.
</P>
<P>
   And to account for the nearly simultaneous waves on both coasts,
he said, the likeliest candidate seems to be a comet that had split
into two or more pieces that struck in rapid succession _ like the
fragments of Comet Shoemaker Levy 9 that hit Jupiter in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Remarkably, the local aborigines tell tales that describe such
an event in great detail, Bryant said. Most people had assumed that
the stories of a great white wave crashing from the sky and
destroying their civilization were allegories referring to the
arrival of white Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   But now that it's clear that there really were waves so high
that, especially when they came crashing over a high hill, they
would have appeared to come from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier events that may have been caused by comet impacts are
even harder to determine, but many scientists are working hard to
establish facts. W. Bruce Masse, an archeologist with the US Air
Force and the University of Hawaii, says he has accumulated
evidence tying a major impact in 2807 BC with a series of dramatic
tsunamis and effects on climate in South America. He hopes to
publish the details of this connection later this year in a
scientific journal.
</P>
<P>
   And several archeologists, including Benny Peiser of Liverpool
John Moore University in England, Harvey Weiss of Yale University,
and Marie-Agnes Courty of the French Center for Scientific
Research, are working hard to develop evidence that the widespread,
sudden collapse of Bronze Age civilizations around the world in
about 2345 BC may have been the result of a series of comet
impacts, which caused a sudden cooling of the climate, as well as
tsunamis and earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, they say, civilizations that seemed to be in full
flower, including the Egyptian Old Kingdom, the Akkadian empire in
Mesopotamia, and the Hongshan culture in China, all declined
suddenly and without any trace of external cause such as a military
attack.
</P>
<P>
   That, too, according to a few astronomers, could have been the
result of multiple impacts from fragments of a comet that
disintegrated from coming too close to a planet or the sun. Victor
Clube of Oxford University and Bill Napier of the Armagh
Observatory in Northern Ireland have written extensively about
their theory that a giant comet _ perhaps 60 miles across _ broke
apart thousands of years ago, and that the earth periodically
intersects streams of its debris _ including chunks large enough to
strike with devastating effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly worth looking'' for evidence of impacts in
historic times, said David Morrison, head of space research at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Ames Research
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, author of a NASA study on the danger of impacts, adds
that ``I'd be surprised'' if such evidence is found, because the
actual rate of impacts is much lower than suggested by astronomers
like Clube and Napier.
</P>
<P>
   But if they are right, he said, the evidence should be easy to
find: If the earth does intersect streams of debris that include
objects large enough to produce Tunguska-like blasts, then those
objects would be found by proposed searches for objects that might
strike earth, such as the Spaceguard survey recommended by his
study. The answer should be clear within a few years if such a
study gets funded, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, a growing number of scientists are convinced
that looking at the records left by our ancestors _ both the
physical evidence of archeological remains, as well as historical
and mythological accounts _ could reveal important details about
the cosmic impacts the human race has had to deal with, and may
even provide clues to the degree of our future risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most mythology actually encodes celestial events,'' Masse
said. Though such research ``is just in its infancy,'' he said, it
is important to explore those sources, as well as the hard data of
geology and climatic rec-ords.
</P>
<P>
   Doing so will help determine whether, as he believes, ``cosmic
impacts have been a major force in both cultural and biological
evolution.''

MOWLAM'S OPTIMISM ON PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- ``We are not going back,'' declares Tony Blair's
point person on Northern Ireland. And, as ever, Marjorie (call me
``Mo'') Mowlam maintains her trademark optimism _ not the cockeyed
kind but the clear-eyed variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragile,'' she says, ``is too pessimistic'' a term to describe
the status of peaceful reform efforts in the wake of a historic,
multiparty agreement, an overwhelmingly approved referendum, a
tense Protestant marching season, and a horrific triple-murder of
three children.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to remember that from the beginning _ within days of
Blair's landslide election in Britain in the spring of last year _
Mowlam has been a consistently reliable indicator of the future,
usually in the face of widespread negativism and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   She said jump-starting peace talks with a sense of urgency and
deadlines would produce multiparty negotiations, and it did. Down
the stretch this spring, she insisted agreement would come and that
it would win widespread voter approval, and she was right. She has
insisted that there is a formative new center committed to making
reconciliation work and to combatting political and terrorist
extremism. One should think than twice before betting against her.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast last week on a visit here to brief the Clinton
administration and congressional leaders and rally American
supporters after a rough patch of post-referendum road, Mowlam
identified the hyper-violent fringes of the Northern Irish scene as
the source of her greatest concern.
</P>
<P>
   This month's barbaric murder of three Catholic boys in a
firebomb attack on their home by apparently apprehended Protestant
killers, she said, was all the more barbaric because of its obvious
evil intent. This was no simple bombing; the attack was
specifically designed to trap the occupants inside. Similarly, she
noted what appears to have been the punishment killing of a young
Catholic man by terrorists last week. It was no execution, Mowlam
said; it was a torture murder. The victim was shot in both legs and
dumped in an elevator that was then disabled so he would bleed to
death.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the signatures of what are usually called the
paramilitaries of the Catholic and Protestant sides, but of
splinter groups desperate to torpedo the reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she said, there is not even a hint that larger,
established organizations on either side have even winked at the
murders for sectarian advantage. Indeed, all the evidence is to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the best evidence, in Mowlam's view as well as the public's,
is this: In the aftermath of the grisly murders of the three boys,
all but a handful of the Protestants taking part in the one ugly
confrontation with authorities during the marching season, when
Orange Order members insist on triumphalist parades through
Catholic neighborhoods, simply melted away into the night.
</P>
<P>
   A major piece of Mowlam's agenda here was to help keep support
from taking root among US supporters of the Irish Republican Army
for the splinter groups trying to torpedo the political settlement
via fraudulent appeals to nationalist sentiment. The US view is
that little of that is occurring, and that no serious money is
being raised to support terrorism, but official vigilance is high
and needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   So also is official US support for the peace process. While
Mowlam was on her way here, President Clinton's plans to visit in
September were announced, on the heels of a successful,
post-referendum mission by Commerce Secretary Bill Daley.
</P>
<P>
   And to maintain continuity in a difficult time of
institution-building, Clinton has asked one of the key architects
of the settlement, US Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, to stay on at
least through his own trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that violence always gets the most
attention, but Mowlam's plea for perspective (10 bomb plots foiled
just this month; thousands of marching season gatherings that
occurred without incident) is far from myopic.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that a peaceful reconciliation process now has
political authority in Northern Ireland (70 percent of the seats in
the new assembly are occupied by Good Friday agreement supporters).
And splinter group terrorism is strengthening the determination of
the freshly empowered majority to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   When Mo Mowlam says, ``We are not going back,'' she is not
whistling past the graveyard. She is reporting.

BOARD STRUGGLES TO DEFINE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Massachusetts board that regulates doctors may
change the legal definition of what constitutes the practice of
medicine, as insurance companies and technology prompt more
patients to reach out to doctors and nurses across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, doctors are forced to call insurance workers in
another state for approval to treat patients. Insurers encourage
patients to phone ``tele-nurses'' when they have medical questions,
hiring firms like one in Colorado that employs 500 nurses. And on
the Internet, a growing number of companies offer medical diagnoses
and drug prescriptions to patients worldwide, with no in-person
checkup by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say some of these practices save patients millions of
dollars. But regulators are trying to claim more powers of
supervision, saying health workers in one state may be practicing
medicine without a license when they make decisions involving
patients in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a decision is made in Colorado about you in Massachusetts
and you die, we have no recourse to do anything,'' said Alexander
F. Fleming, executive director of the Massachusetts Board of
Registration in Medicine, which licenses doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colorado medical board could do something ... but your
body, the medical records, are all in Massachusetts,'' Fleming
said. ``It's tough for the Colorado board to even care about it,
but also tough for them to investigate it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts boards that regulate doctors and nurses are
both grappling with new licensing rules to deal with evolving
insurance practices and technologies. The most dramatic change is
contemplated by the board governing physician licensing, because it
could set up a confrontation with the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under a preliminary proposal, the doctors' board would rule that
any insurance company decision to deny care, or to deny payment for
care, to a Massachusetts patient must be made by a physician
licensed in Massachusetts, Fleming said. In essence, turning down a
patient's request for treatment or reimbursement would become an
act of practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Massachusetts health insurers say they use
physicians to make coverage decisions, so they already comply with
the proposed rule. But it is nevertheless likely to draw opposition
from the insurance industry. Nationwide, insurance companies often
use nurses and laymen to decide whether a specific treatment is
covered by a person's health policy, and they are adamant that
those decisions do not amount to practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be an attempt by physicians to eviscerate
managed care,'' said Richard Coorsh of the Health Industry
Association of America, a trade group. ``There are many cases where
you don't need a doctor making these decisions, and doing so has
cost implications that would be passed on to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry unsuccessfully fought a similar law in
Mississippi this year, saying it would raise premiums by 5 percent
and push employers to drop coverage for 13,400 residents. The Texas
medical board adopted a similar rule in 1996, and laws are pending
before several state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the Massachusetts Legislature has already empowered
the medical board to enact the rule after public hearings, though
it could be vetoed by the secretary of consumer affairs or the
secretary of administration and finance. The board's thinking is
still evolving, he said, and there is no timetable for public
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing who may practice medicine, and where they must be
licensed, state regulators are reacting to a variety of
developments:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Managed health care increasingly forces doctors to seek
approval before offering treatment or referring a patient to a
specialist, often by calling insurance offices far from the
patient's home.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)A growing number of Internet sites allow people to buy
drugs and receive diagnoses by computer. For $9.95, Dr. Thomas E.
Brandeisky offers a ``virtual consultation'' based on a client's
e-mail account of his or her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, called Cyberdocs.com, offers ``virtual
housecalls'' for $50 by Salem Hospital physicians Kerry Archer and
Steven Kohler. To avoid licensing problems with other states,
patients must certify that they are in Massachusetts or outside of
the United States, according to information posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)New technology has allowed more ``tele-medicine,'' in
which physicians in one state obtain information by phone lines
about patients elsewhere, often at the time the patient is being
examined.
</P>
<P>
   This has forced regulators to grapple with the spectrum of
services that can be offered to patients from a distance, and to
begin thinking about what licenses should be required to offer
which services.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)More health plans are using ``tele-nurses,'' or nurses who
work the phones to answer routine medical questions, to make sure
patients are following treatment plans or refer patients to
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Tele-nursing has become a big business. As many as 100 million
people could have access to tele-nursing service in the next few
years, up from 35 million today, said Theresa Bonanno, executive
director of the state Board of Registration in Nursing. And that
has raised licensing questions for nursing regulators.
</P>
<P>
   One Colorado company, Access Health Inc., employs 500 nurses who
will field 4.5 million calls this year from all 50 states. Many of
the calls come from people whose health plans have hired Access
Health to answer basic medical questions, such as how to treat a
rash or whether a baby's fever should prompt a trip to the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   By guiding the right services to patients at the right time,
Access Health says, insurers and patients can save money. But some
critics have asked whether a nurse in Colorado can properly treat a
person with emergency symptoms in Rhode Island, or whether that
nurse can tell that a patient's rash is likely to be caused by a
regional illness like Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   And others say that all ``tele-nurses'' should be licensed in
each state where patients are located.
</P>
<P>
   The Access Health nurses are licensed in the state from which
they answer the phones: Colorado, California, Illinois, and
Arizona. Julie Brooks, the company's general counsel, says Access
Health complies with all state licensing laws.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Council of State Boards of Nursing maintains
that under current laws ``tele-nurses'' must be licensed in the
state where the patient is located. ``If you are giving care to a
patient in Massachusetts, you are practicing in Massachusetts,''
said Susan Woodward, spokeswoman for the council.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that a significant amount of improper nursing is
likely taking place today. ``Is this is an urgent matter right now?
I can't answer that,'' said Bonanno of the Massachusetts nursing
board. ``But there is a level of concern that will grow as this
practice continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the boards that regulate doctors, state nursing boards
are trying to work out a uniform set of rules that would allow
nurses to practice nationwide. Under a proposed interstate compact,
a nursing license would become something like a driver's license,
honored by all states and recognized as invalid by all states if
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member Massachusetts nursing board supports the
interstate license, but it wants to study the idea more before
asking the legislature to approve it, Bonanno said.
</P>
<P>
   In their extreme, new state licensing rules could prevent a
Boston resident from consulting with a doctor at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, said Dr. Barry
Wolcott, chief medical officer and co-founder of Access Health.
``State licensing statutes were set up to protect citizens from
quackery,'' he said, ``not to prevent them from choosing access to
high-quality services from outside the state.''

WHAT CAUSES GOOSEBUMPS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. Why do we get goosebumps?
</P>
<P>
   M.R., Concord
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Long before Polartec and Thinsulate, our forebears were fur
bearers. That's how they stayed warm. When a sudden burst of cold
demanded extra insulation, tiny muscles in each hair follicle,
called piloerectors, would contract, making each hair stand up.
That fluffed up the fur, which trapped more air in the spaces
between the hairs, increasing the insulating effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Evolution has been working on humans like a slow-motion Nair
treatment and we no longer rely on fur for warmth. But so far,
evolution has left our piloreceptor muscles along. So when you feel
a chill and get goosebumps, you're experiencing the same body
response your predecessors did tens of thousands of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But what about `emotional' goosebumps, as in, ``Every time I
hear that song I get goosebumps''? That's left over from our
ancient kin too. Back in furrier times, pre-humans faced with a
threat responded with an instantaneous flood of hormones that raced
through the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary
actions like breathing and digestion, and triggered the ``Fight or
Flight'' response.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the ``Fight'' reaction was to look as threatening as
possible. The piloerector muscles puffed up the fur to make the
animal look bigger and more formidable. Lots of animals still do
this, including cats, dogs, and bears.
</P>
<P>
   Our emotional responses, whether sad or happy, excited or angry,
trigger the release of hormones that stimulate the autonomic
nervous system, sometimes bringing on ``emotional'' goosebumps,
depending on the hormones released.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; So if a friend cautions ``Don't get your hackles up'' (hackles
are the hairs on the back of an animal's neck), tell him you're
just experiencing an autonomic piloerector response, and there's
nothing you can do about it.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. What makes helium change the tone of your voice?
</P>
<P>
   (Unidentified) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. ``The speed of sound is faster in that particular gas because
it's less dense,'' says Kenneth Stevens, an MIT electrical
engineering professor who studies speech formation.
</P>
<P>
   Helium is one-seventh as dense as air. As it passes your vocal
cords, they create vibrations, pretty much the way they do when
regular air goes past them. Not much changes at this point. But up
in the rest of the vocal tract, including your throat, mouth,
cheeks, tongue, teeth, and lips, the sound waves bounce around
faster through the thinner medium of the helium. Not only does the
sound move faster, but the waves themselves are smaller. We
perceive the shorter, faster-moving sound waves as higher
resonance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like those cute little _ what are they ... squirrels, in that
cartoon?'' says Stevens. Actually, Chip and Dale are chipmunks, but
we get the point.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, breathing in too much pure helium can change your
voice in a much more profound way. It can silence it altogether, as
you pass out from asphyxiation. Helium displaces oxygen. After more
than a few deep breaths of it in a row, the only sound you'll be
making is your oxygen-starved, unconscious body hitting the floor.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The lighter-than-air helium will float up out of your lungs on
its own, and you'll probably recover. But Stevens warns that unless
you can be sure you're breathing a helium-oxygen mixture, you're
taking a big risk trying to sound like a couple of cartoon
chipmunks.

CRACKING THE DOLPHIN CODE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. CHANDLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONOLULU _ The two dolphins wait attentively at the edge of
their 45-foot tank, their eyes riveted on the trainer standing
before them. He suddenly makes two wide sweeping motions with his
hands, and the dolphins immediately plunge below the surface and
swim away.
</P>
<P>
   There is a pause of a few seconds; are they pondering _ or even
discussing _ the task that has been set for them? Nobody knows. But
seconds later, they erupt from the water simultaneously, performing
a complex side-by-side leap in perfect synchronization.
</P>
<P>
   They have done what they were instructed to do: Perform some new
stunt _ not one that is part of their regular repertoire _ and do
it in tandem. Score one for the dolphins.
</P>
<P>
   In response to a half-dozen similar requests on a recent
afternoon, the dolphins came up with new things to do _ and did
them in perfectly-choreographed unison _ every time but once. That
one time they seemed to swim around in confusion; had they
forgotten the assignment, had they been unable to come up with an
idea _ or had they perhaps done something underwater that the human
observers could not discern?
</P>
<P>
   This coordinated creative activity is perhaps the most
startling, and enigmatic, result yet from 29 years of research that
psychologist Louis Herman of the University of Hawaii and his
associates have been carrying out at the Kewalo Basin Marine Mammal
Laboratory, next to a public beach in the bustling center of
Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   How do the dolphins synchronize their performance so perfectly
when they are doing a trick they've never done before? Are they
using some kind of language of their own to discuss and agree on
what to do, or is one simply following the lead of the other _
instantaneously and with remarkable precision? Human observers
don't see any sign that one dolphin is lagging behind the other, as
would be expected if it is a case of follow-the-leader.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Remarkable accomplishments are nothing new for the four
dolphins here and the researchers who work with them, along with
dozens of paying volunteers sent by Earthwatch, an organization
based in Watertown, Mass. Herman has already proved that the
dolphins are capable of understanding and mastering the key
concepts of language: That symbols can represent specific objects,
actions, or relationships; and that the order in which those
symbols are presented is crucial to the meaning of a sentence.
</P>
<P>
   His dolphins have no trouble responding correctly to commands
such as ``put the Frisbee on the left into the basket on the
right,'' even when there are Frisbees and baskets on both sides.
(``Usually she's much better than I am on left and right,'' Herman
says of Akeakamai, whose name means ``lover of wisdom'' in
Hawaiian.)
</P>
<P>
   They can even improvise responses to impossible commands: Told
to take a ball to a hoop when there was no hoop in the tank, one
dolphin took &UR;  &LR; the ball to a lever it had been trained to press to
signal ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the dolphins' abilities parallel those of
chimpanzees, gorillas, and parrots in experiments on animal
communication _ although &UR;  &LR; Herman has focused entirely on monitoring
dolphins' comprehension of artificial languages presented by
humans, not on getting them to produce language. This, he says,
makes it easier to ensure that rigorous standards of objectivity
are met, because monitoring objectively claims that an animal is
generating words and sentences can be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Herman's experiments have also included careful precautions to
avoid inadvertently transmiting cues from the researchers to the
animals, or overinterpreting the animals' responses _ problems that
have caused acrimonious debates in many other experiments.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when giving hand signals to the dolphins, the
trainer wears goggles, so the dolphins cannot pick up clues from an
inadvertent glance. And there is always a ``blind'' observer _ who
records what the dolphins do but can not see what commands they
were given.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins have learned dozens of ``words'' _ either as
gestures or sounds _ just as apes and parrots have done, and have
learned rules of syntax that govern how the words are strung
together in sentences up to five words long.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard for some people to accept that animals could have
this unique quality of language comprehension,'' Herman said.
``It's a resistance based on species chauvinism.''
</P>
<P>
   But the experiments make it clear that the dolphins do grasp the
fundamental rules of the grammar Herman has created for them _ in
some cases, different rules for different dolphins. For example,
Phoenix has been taught a syntax in which the object is placed
first, then the subject, then the action (``hoop ball toss'' would
mean ``toss the ball through the hoop''). Akeakamai was taught an
opposite syntax for the same meaning _ subject, object, action
(``ball hoop toss'').
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate that the dolphins indeed understand the
grammatical rules, the experimenters sometimes throw in
incorrectly-structured sentences. The dolphin rejects those
sentences. ``She just sits there and stares at you. She doesn't
attempt to do the ungrammatical,'' Herman said.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins ``are certainly the intellectual peers of chimps,''
he said. ``Most of the things chimps have done, dolphins can do,
and vice versa.'' But the dolphins have also mastered tasks that no
other animals have managed.
</P>
<P>
   For example, parrots and apes will react to a television image
with curiosity, but don't respond to commands or questions from a
TV image of their human trainer. But when Akeakamai, who had
learned a language based on gestures, was shown an image of a
signing trainer on a tiny black-and-white screen, she carried out
his commands correctly 12 out of 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   To test the limits of the dolphin's ability to respond to the
televised image, the human's body was blacked out, leaving just the
arms. She still responded correctly, and continued to do so when
the arms were obscured, leaving just hands.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers then went one step further, replacing the hands
with white discs _ disembodied shapes making gestures on the
screen. The accuracy level went down a little, but she still got it
right most of the time _ performing better than all but the most
experienced human trainers did on the same test.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins are also able to respond correctly when a human points
at something, a signal no other animal has been able to understand.
</P>
<P>
   When a chimp sees a human pointing, it focuses on the finger
itself, as do other animals. The concept of directing attention
away from the hand making the gesture appears to be too complex for
them to grasp _ even though chimps have hands that could point.
Dolphins, however, though they have no arms or hands, seem able to
figure out the symbolic gesture easily. Rather than focusing on at
the pointing hand, they look in the direction indicated.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lab's most exciting work is probably in the
``tandem'' behavior _ the tests in which two dolphins perform
first-time maneuvers together, perfectly synchronized. That hints
at an ability to communicate directly with one another in some
``language'' of their own _ whether through sounds, or motions, or
some other way _ but it does not prove it, and Herman insists on
getting rigorous scientific proof. ``There is no evidence that they
have anything approaching a language in the natural environment,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Dolphins do, however, live in a very rich auditory environment,
including streams of clicks they emit to track their surroundings
by echolocation, as well as unique ``signature'' whistles that each
dolphin emits, apparently as a way of keeping track of individuals
within the group.
</P>
<P>
   But figuring out how they carry out tandem stunts may be
difficult, because underwater sounds are complicated by multiple
echoes from the tank walls, and it is hard to know which animal
produced what sound. Further, the cloudiness of the water makes it
hard to videotape underwater behavior more than a few feet away.
Herman plans to intall more sophisticated underwater sound and
video recording systems in an attempt to determine what goes on
when the dolphins are preparing to make their tandem leaps, spins
or tail flips. ``We can probably answer it better in a year or
so,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins, it seems, are as eager as he to get on with it.
</P>
<P>
   Some researchers have to contend with animals that often won't
cooperate at all; they either refuse to join in or they sometimes
give apparently deliberate wrong answers. People who work with
chimps have to concentrate on young animals, because adults are
often dangerous to work with. (``Most chimp researchers have parts
of fingers missing,'' Herman said.)
</P>
<P>
   Not so with his dolphins. They work two shifts a day, two to
three hours each. When a long session is about to end, he says,
``they sometimes resist having us take the apparatus out of the
water.''
</P>
<P>
   The dolphins are rewarded with a fish for correct responses. As
a signal that a session is nearly over, the trainer will hold up
the last three fish, and then the last two. When a dolphin is given
the last fish, ``usually they give it back, as a way of prolonging
the contact.'' Apparently, Herman said, ``they love to do the
work.''

A BERKSHIRES STATE OF MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW BRELIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Berkshire Mountain vistas are breathtaking, the air cool and
sweet, the restaurants excellent, the recreation seemingly
unlimited, and the cultural events unrivaled.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Boston goes on vacation _ or gets away for a weekend _
we don't take the easily passable Massachusetts Turnpike and head
west. Instead, we travel a frequently congested Route 3 to
backed-up bridges leading to Cape Cod, or motor up Interstate 93,
to the bottleneck just over the New Hampshire border.
</P>
<P>
   The Berkshires are in our state, but it is our neighbors the New
Yorkers who most enjoy them.
</P>
<P>
   Of the tourists who stay in the Berkshires for more than one
day, only 10 to 15 percent come from Greater Boston while more than
60 percent come from the New York area, says William R. Wilson Jr.,
executive director of the Berkshire Visitors Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   And when owners of second homes invade on weekends _ there are
more than 10,000 second-homes in Berkshire County _ once again, the
New Yorkers overwhelm the Bostonians.
</P>
<P>
   Take George Packer, a Cambridge writer who co-owns a place in
Monterey with a couple from ... New York. ``I assume everyone is
doing what I'm doing, but now that you ask, I honestly know nobody
from Boston who comes out on weekends. Nobody at all,'' Packer
says.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that last summer a total of 25,230 passenger cars and
motorcycles traveled the Mass. Pike from the Newton toll plaza to
Exit 2 in Lee, the first of two Berkshire exits. Another 27,584
cars traveled from the Route 128 entrance to Lee last summer.
</P>
<P>
   During the same three months, an average of 65,005 cars went
over the Sagamore Bridge each day, and 53,469 went over the Bourne
Bridge each day. While not all those cars were going to or from
Boston, if even 2 percent were, they still dwarf the Berkshire
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems so crazy _ I have nothing but good things to say
about going to the Berkshires,'' Packer says. ``I have gone out on
rush hour on Friday, and, after Framingham, it is fine. And I have
come back Sunday evening and it is never that bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So why do Bostonians shun the Berkshires? It may have something
to do with how the place reminds some of Manhattan in the
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do see a lot of New Yorkers, which makes one a little
resentful, like `What are they doing here?''' says Packer. ``I once
saw a bumper sticker in Egremont on a car with New York plates that
said `Keep Egremont Small and Beautiful.' Well, the arrogant
outsiders are all from New York.''
</P>
<P>
   State Representative Christopher Hodgkins, a Democrat from Lee,
says the weekenders from New York ``can be very obnoxious. We don't
go downtown on a weekend, we leave it for tourists _ and we don't
say `tourists,' we say `New Yorkers,' because that is where they
are all from. They think we are hillbillies, but that's OK; we'll
take their money.''
</P>
<P>
   At Guido's Marketplace, an upscale grocery store in Pittsfield
and Great Barrington, some of the younger staff have a code name
for loud, demanding customers: two-one-twos. (The area code for
Manhattan is ... )
</P>
<P>
   But there are millions of pleasant, sedate New Yorkers, and some
of them summer in the Berkshires. So Boston's avoidance of the
Berkshires must involve more than our complicated feelings about
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Berkshire County is bounded by mountains on the east and west,
which means that the area was settled from the south. Around the
time of the Revolutionary War, Massachusetts claimed the area as
its own and auctioned off the land to raise revenue. ``They were
just making money off of it, and maybe Bostonians never felt
inclined to come back afterwards,'' says Bernie Drew, a local
writer and historian.
</P>
<P>
   The Hudson and Housatonic rivers run north to south, and the
area's development, for the most part, mirrors that. While the
first railroad line and the first summer ``cottage'' owner came
from Boston, it was New York that quickly surpassed Boston in
sinking roots.
</P>
<P>
   Drew believes Bostonians seeking a cooler climate in the summer
logically headed north, or went to the seashore, rather than
heading out west.
</P>
<P>
   And if the mountains once stood as impediments, clearly they no
longer do.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be some sort of psychological barrier because it
surely isn't physical,'' says Susan Eisley, executive director of
the Berkshire County Historical Society at Arrowhead Museum, once a
home of Herman Melville. ``I mean, Hannibal crossed the Alps with
elephants. It would seem like Bostonians could get to the
Berkshires if they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   So, maybe it's a matter of tradition. According to Drew, summer
tourism in the Berkshires dates to the 1860s, and if Bostonians
weren't going then, why should they go now? New England is
populated with traditionalists; if Grandpa and Grandma went to New
Hampshire for vacation, then that is where we will go.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Masiero, a co-owner of Guido's Marketplace, grew up on the
North Shore and says people who live in Greater Boston simply have
a poor sense of geography. ``The mentality of distance is warped.
It is only 150 miles out here, but it was like Worcester was the
breaking point, and anything beyond Springfield, well, you might as
well be in Ohio or something.''
</P>
<P>
   Boston's tendency to dismiss the western part of the state as
unimportant is well-established. In matters of politics, the
Berkshires have long felt like a forgotten country cousin.
</P>
<P>
   Yet one would think that the Berkshires' sheer loveliness and
many recreational opportunities would lure people _ especially in
contrast to the tourist-choked Cape. But Boston steadfastly refuses
to look westward, despite a strong push by the Berkshire Visitors
Bureau. The bureau, in conjunction with the Turnpike Authority, is
stepping up marketing in Boston, but the numbers _ while up a bit _
still disappoint Wilson, the bureau's director.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Stevens, who works in Boston but grew up in Williamstown,
says most people in Boston don't know where his hometown is, even
though it is also home to Williams College and the Berkshires' best
art museum. ``They ask you what it's like down in Virginia. I'm not
making this up. And you say `No. That is Williamsburg.' They were
printing T-shirts in Williamstown for a while that said `I'm not
from Virginia.'''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens says the Berkshires are greatly influenced by Albany,
N.Y., radio and television stations. That, coupled with the cold
shoulder from Boston, makes residents feel like the Bay State's
orphans. ``I was in the sixth grade before I realized Mario Cuomo
was not my governor and Dukakis was,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bostonians who do make it to the Berkshires discover that
culture not only survives there, it thrives. The summer home of the
Boston Symphony Orchestra is at Tanglewood, but more New Yorkers
than Bostonians go there. Maybe Bostonians get their fill in the
winter, but Wilson says that's a mistake. ``I would contend that
there is a big difference between sitting in an auditorium and
sitting out on the lawn overlooking the Stockbridge Bowl while
listening to music.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Bostonians know we exist, but they just don't know what
we have,'' says Wilson, sounding very much like the booster he is.
``There are more than 40 world-class cultural organizations
operating in the area. The Clark Art Institute in Williamstown has
over 30 Renoirs. The Rockwell Museum in Stockbridge has the largest
collection of original Rockwells in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, some 75,000 people visited the Hancock Shaker
Village, a 1,200-acre farm with 20 restored Shaker buildings,
including a round stone barn. About 5,000 of those visitors were
from Boston. About 16,000 were from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   Olympia Brescia, of Ego Trips Unlimited, a Boston tour operator,
says that is not surprising.
</P>
<P>
   ``When foreign tourists hit Logan, they know more about our
culture than we do,'' Brescia says, adding that she took two Thomas
Cook travel agency executives to the Berkshires earlier this month.
As a result, they will promote the region heavily back home in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bostonians just won't go there. If they want a lake and
mountains, they'll go to Winnipesaukee. Or they'll go to the Cape.
Really, the Berkshires are more of a cultural vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph L. Carini, president of Wheeler &AMP; Taylor Realty Co. in
Great Barrington, believes people want a vacation to be a little
exotic. Crossing a state line feeds that desire. Says Carini, ``It
works for the New Yorkers who come here.''

IN THE UK, BABY DEATHS WITHOUT WORLDWIDE COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On Tuesday, a nanny named Louise was charged with
killing a baby in her care in England.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the nanny's surname is Sullivan, not Woodward, and
she's Australian, not English. But the murder charge lodged against
Louise Sullivan, just one day after an English nanny was convicted
of murder for shaking a 5-month-old baby to death, has unsettled
Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Some Britons thought Louise Woodward was framed for the murder
of Matthew Eappen, and many more were at least sympathetic to her,
seeing her as the victim of overzealous American prosecutors who
charged her with murder instead of manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   But the confluence of two similar cases on English soil &UR;  &LR; has led
to finger pointing and soul-searching about the dangers &UR;  &LR; of leaving
children with caregivers who effectively are strangers. In response
to the two most recent cases, the British government said it was
considering adopting a national register for child-care providers
and regulating the industry on a par with schools.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases here have given weight to warnings from Britain's
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children that
shaken baby syndrome is on the rise. They have also shown that the
system for monitoring child-care providers is open to abuse.
</P>
<P>
   However, the cases have not led to the type of sensational news
coverage that marked much of the Woodward case, mainly because
British law prevents such coverage before or during a trial.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Helen Stacey, 41, was sentenced to life in prison
after a jury found she had shaken to death Joseph Mackin just four
days after she began baby-sitting him at her Norfolk home. Stacey
had registered with the local social services office that monitors
child-care providers.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, Sullivan, 26, was charged with causing the head
injuries that killed 6-month-old Caroline Jongen at the baby's home
in north London in April.
</P>
<P>
   Sky News, Rupert Murdoch's satellite TV station, which
exhaustively covered the Woodward case, was more restrained in its
reports on the two recent cases. The tabloids that were jingoistic
in their assumption of Woodward's innocence appear much more openly
pro-prosecution in these two British cases.
</P>
<P>
   After Woodward was convicted, many in the British media
protested her innocence. After Stacey's conviction and life
sentence, however, all media outlets have made much of her alleged
past as a prostitute and unfit mother. Her past, however, was
unknown to the jury and played no role in deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Woodward's trial in Cambridge, Mass., which was
televised, cameras are barred from British courts. British law also
bars publicity beyond rudimentary facts about a case either before
or during a trial. Even if reporters obtain evidence that might
come out at trial, they can be charged with contempt for publishing
or broadcasting it.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Greenslade, media critic for The Guardian, a liberal daily,
was disturbed by what he saw as xenophobia in much of the British
coverage of the Woodward case. But even he says the marked
difference between the coverage of the Woodward case and that of
the two recent cases is rooted more in law than jingoism.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Greenslade said he is troubled by the disparate coverage
of and reaction to the convictions of Woodward and Stacey, as well
as by the sympathetic coverage of the recent release of two British
nurses who were convicted of killing a colleague in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are in danger in Britain of believing that no one
can get a fair trial anywhere but in Britain,'' said Greenslade.
``I would remind the British public that there have been many
miscarriages of justice here, with scores of Irish people serving
up to 15 years in prison for IRA activity they had nothing to do
with. And it's not just the Irish who have been on the receiving
end.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenslade said that while many British journalists were
convinced that Woodward's treatment in the Massachusetts court
system constituted a miscarriage of justice, no one in the news
media has suggested that Stacey may have just ``snapped'' in a
moment of frustration and have been guilty of manslaughter, as some
of Woodward's supporters have contended.
</P>
<P>
   The case British prosecutors presented against Stacey was
similar to that made by Middlesex County prosecutors against
Woodward. They said doctors determined that Joseph Mackin died from
violent shaking, and that only the nanny or the child's parents
could have inflicted the injuries. As did Woodward, Stacey
maintained she never harmed the baby.
</P>
<P>
   Only the Portia Trust, a small, left-wing group that supports
female defendants, has voiced support for Stacey, saying the
evidence against her did not support a verdict ``beyond a
reasonable doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Edward Fitzgerald, a London defense lawyer who is active in
civil liberties cases, said he detects a hint of jingoism in the
differences in the coverage and reaction to the two recent cases as
compared to Woodward's, though he believes laws barring
extrajudicial publicity explain most of the discrepancy.
</P>
<P>
   ``To be fair to the English system, it's more about possible
contempt than jingoism,'' said Fitzgerald. ``Once proceedings get
started here, the press can't say much. Abroad they don't have to
restrain themselves, as they didn't in the Woodward case. But
English girls abroad are a special phenomenon. It is a striking
feature about this country. The idea of a young oppressed English
girl abroad excites sympathy in the press. When a `nasty'
Australian comes into this country and does essentially the same
thing, she will not get the same sympathy.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald shares Greenslade's concern about the character
assassination of Stacey that followed her conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually the police leak after someone is convicted,'' said
Fitzgerald. ``That's why you get a burst of nasty stuff after a
trial. But it's almost always only from the prosecution.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenslade said that the stories that followed Stacey's
conviction, contending she was a former prostitute, had been
treated for depression, and had had her children taken away from
her for neglect, may be true, but that it is impossible to judge
because the information is not attributed to traceable sources.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a tradition of double-sourcing, or naming
sources,'' Greenslade said. ``These pieces that appear immediately
after trial are known as backgrounders, because they have been
written before and are heavily biased.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of this information is often untrue, but after someone
is convicted no one goes back to check it. As much as we prevent
the press from publishing prejudicial material before and during a
trial, it all changes after a conviction. You're a person without a
reputation, not in a position to sue for libel, even if the
information is not true.''
</P>
<P>
   If many Britons saw the Woodward case as one of aberrant
behavior, the two other cases have led many, including the
government, to think again.
</P>
<P>
   The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children
says a recent survey it commissioned found that about 200 British
babies are killed or seriously injured annually by being shaken,
and that the number is growing.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the Stacey case, the British government said it
was considering a new national register for child-care providers.
The Times of London sneered at the government's ``knee jerking in
sympathy with a dreadfully bereaved couple,'' and accused Prime
Minister Tony Blair of cynically proposing ``a nationalisation of
nannydom.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the Mackins' tragedy became headline news the
government was disinclined to proceed with plans for a national
register,'' The Times noted in an editorial.
</P>
<P>
   More sobering for Britons is the realization that the current
system for checking the backgrounds of baby sitters and nannies
depends largely on the honesty of those who register with local
councils. About 100,000 registered child care providers look after
some 350,000 children.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who sentenced Stacey to life imprisonment called for a
``searching inquiry'' into the current system.
</P>
<P>
   David Wright, the director of social services in Norfolk, said
the system failed Joseph Mackin because Stacey lied on an
application form. Had she answered truthfully about prior criminal
convictions and her own personal history, it would have raised
serious concerns. Wright added there was little authorities could
do to prevent someone from lying.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Corrine and Anthony Mackin said they want the
system improved.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not want Joseph to have died in vain,'' they said.

WHOSE IMPROPRIETIES ARE WORSE THAN STARR'S? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When US District Judge Norma Holloway Johnson ordered a hearing
last week into whether Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's
office leaked grand jury information to the media, she provided
hope for those who believe that Starr has simply gone too far.
</P>
<P>
   The order was a departure from Judge Johnson's previous rulings.
Until last week she had handed Starr significant victories _
including her ruling allowing him to question Secret Service
members who had guarded President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing on possible grand jury leaks will, in the end,
probably prove even more significant than the news reports Friday
suggesting that one Secret Service agent has testified that he and
a top aide to Clinton saw the president and former intern Monica
Lewinsky alone in a room off the Oval Office. (There was no
suggestion they were engaged in any improper behavior.)
</P>
<P>
   Unless a bombshell comes from the questioning of Secret Service
agents, the hearing on Starr's alleged leaks could be far more
damaging to the independent prosecutor than Secret Service
testimony might be to Clinton and Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and its supporters cheered Johnson's
order. Starr's supporters were stunned. Meanwhile, lawyers on both
sides of the issue noted how serious this could be for Starr if the
hearing determines that his office fed grand jury information to
the media.
</P>
<P>
   After all, violating the rule against disclosing grand jury
information ``is not just a bad idea; it's a crime,'' Howard Pearl,
a former federal prosecutor and now a Chicago lawyer, reminded
people.
</P>
<P>
   By some accounts, the fact that Johnson ordered the rare hearing
indicates that she already has knowledge suggesting improprieties
by Starr's office. If so, it does not bode well for him or his
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Johnson's order, as some former and current members of
the legal profession point out, comes from Starr's own remarks in
the new media magazine Brill's Content. In an interview, Starr said
he and a former deputy had talked to reporters about the case.
There is nothing improper about his office having contacts with the
media, he said.
</P>
<P>
   After his quotes circulated in Washington, Starr blasted the
magazine and its editor, saying the quotes and his ``abstract
discussion of the law'' were taken out of context. But his retort
could not erase the reaction to the article, including Johnson's
order.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson determines from the hearing that grand jury leaks did
indeed come from Starr's office, Starr will have to show Johnson
why his office should not be held in contempt of court.
</P>
<P>
   If he fails to convince Johnson, the contempt ruling would stand
_ and that, in turn, could provide grounds for Attorney General
Janet Reno to fire Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Starr could also be disciplined for his conduct. At the very
least, a contempt ruling would undermine his assertion that he is
running a fair and objective investigation of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, since this hearing involves the grand jury,
Johnson's ruling on Starr itself is secret. Even Johnson's order of
the hearing was supposed to be secret. But as Starr, Clinton, the
news media, and various participants in the investigation
acknowledge, leaks _ not secrecy _ have been the cornerstone thus
far in these proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing may also help Clinton in the court of public opinion
_ as well as give his lawyers a means to find out as much as they
can about the Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, aware of how such a hearing could damage both him and his
investigation, has asked a federal appeals court to stop, or at
least limit, the amount of information that can be provided to
lawyers for Clinton and Lewinsky. But even with such limitations,
it's likely that Clinton's and Lewinsky's lawyers will still obtain
more information about the investigation than Starr would like.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's own legal troubles with Johnson do not stop him from
pursuing possible criminal charges against Clinton. Starr and his
aides are still determined to prove whether Clinton had sex with
Lewinsky and then asked her to lie about it to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that Starr is trying to get a US president on a lie
about his sex life has made the public more outraged over Starr's
prosecutorial conduct than over Clinton's alleged behavior. Polls
show that Starr has a low favorability rating with most Americans.
The nation's populace would not want to see a president impeached
on such a charge.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, a majority would like to see this investigation come to
an end. Before Johnson's order for a hearing, Starr and his team
were reportedly working to wrap up their investigation of Clinton
and present their case to Congress. But if Congress does not want
to deal with the case before the November elections, it may be
another few months more before Starr's findings are presented. And
when they are, Congress could be bogged down for a long time as its
members debate how, or how fast, to proceed.
</P>
<P>
   But if Johnson finds that Starr should be held in contempt of
court, that ruling could derail the investigation, giving relief to
a public tired of Starr and his partisan probe.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the hearing produces no contempt charge, Johnson's
ruling at least gave the nation hope. And where there is hope,
there is always the chance that justice will prevail, and Starr
ultimately will fail.

IT'S A TOP-DOLLAR RACE FOR GOVERNOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOT LEHIGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's an agenda to make Lyndon Johnson smile.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly a decade of me-too moderation from Democrats, the
party's top gubernatorial candidates are busy promising to pump
hundreds of millions of dollars into issues straight from the
progressive playbook.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Scott Harshbarger announces a plan to provide
health coverage to 200,000 uninsured Massachusetts residents. Then
rival Patricia McGovern, the former state Senate Ways and Means
chairwoman, tops him with a proposal to extend care to 385,000
people currently without coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger calls for devoting $100 million to repairing the
state's schools. A month later, McGovern proposes leveraging that
$100 million into a $1.2 billion fund for school repairs _ and
putting another $34 million into education. Harshbarger counters
with a scheme to spend an additional $163 million a year to hire
4,000 new teachers and meet other school needs.
</P>
<P>
   He unveils a proposal to put $25 million more into adult
education, only to have her offer a $152 million plan to establish
a comprehensive skills-training system.
</P>
<P>
   McGovern puts forward a $50 million plan for child care _ and
Harshbarger comes out for spending $120 million more for the same
purpose.
</P>
<P>
   And so it goes. Week by week, month by month, position paper by
press conference, Harshbarger, the Democratic front-runner in the
race to unseat Acting Governor Paul Cellucci, and McGovern, his
chief rival, have engaged in a war _ albeit an extremely civil one
_ of issues one-upmanship.
</P>
<P>
   Their competing proposals make one thing clear: On matters from
health care to education to worker training to child care, the
Democrats are ready and eager to spend. Indeed, not since the heady
days of the so-called Massachusetts miracle, when the only question
seemed to be how to divide the spoils, have Democrats proved so
ready to put state money where their passions are.
</P>
<P>
   The state's $900 million budget surplus only encouraged that
impulse. Espying that expanding pot of gold, Harshbarger recently
proposed a $200 million trust fund to supplement municipal budgets,
while McGovern called for devoting more dollars to early childhood
education and kindergarten.
</P>
<P>
   Former ambassador and US Representative Brian Donnelly, running
as a low-visibility moderate, even got into the act with the
highest offer in the surplus spending contest: a $500 million
Children's Trust Fund to pay for a wide variety of programs.
</P>
<P>
   Nor are the candidates alone in their desire to boost budgets.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are clearly open to new spending, too. After years of
fiscal discipline, legislative leaders agreed Monday to a $19.55
billion fiscal 1999 budget, up $1.3 billion, or 6.6 percent, over
last year's budget.
</P>
<P>
   According to spokesman Dwight Robson, Harshbarger's various
proposals would add about $300 million in new spending in his first
budget. Barbara Roop, issues director in the McGovern campaign,
says her plans would increase the budget base by about $200 million
a year.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns stress that those sums are only small percentage
increases _ 1.5 percent for Harshbarger, one percent for McGovern _
of a $19.55 billion budget. Two caveats, however, are important.
That spending is just for new proposals, and doesn't included the
regular yearly adjustments in the budgetary base. And campaigns, of
course, are a time for low-balling costs, while high-balling
results; thus both those estimates should be viewed as spending
floors rather than ceilings.
</P>
<P>
   Undergirding all the rival plans is a similar commitment to an
active, energetic, expansionist government eager to tackle new
challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that we should do more to reduce class size, attract
the best and brightest into teaching, help communities build new
schools, make classrooms safe, and expand access to affordable,
high-quality child care and health care,'' Harshbarger said.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats' willingness to spend certainly marks a distinct
change from the last two elections. If Campaign '98 is shaping up
as a time of wine and roses, back then the Democrats were offering
regimens of bread and water.
</P>
<P>
   John Silber, then the president of Boston University, became the
party's 1990 nominee by riding a backlash against the party's
overspending liberal establishment, offering the state a dose of
the fiscal and social castor oil that had purged BU's excesses and
brought the ailing institution back to health.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Mark Roosevelt made a
quick transition from progressive to neo-liberal, coming out in
support of a family cap for welfare recipients, workfare, term
limits, and the death penalty _ and only a modest agenda for new
spending.
</P>
<P>
   Those campaigns, of course, took place in starkly different
contexts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, the state's economy was mid-meltdown, its budget, after
two massive tax increases, still hemorrhaging red ink. In 1994, the
ledger was once again in balance, but there was no huge surplus to
make the closing of the books the fiscal equivalent of Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   It is, of course, today's overflowing fisc that makes it easy
for candidates to argue that new spending is affordable, the more
so since some of it would be a one-time bonus from this year's
surplus, while other proposals rely on nonrevenue sources. (Both
McGovern and Harshbarger, for example, hope to have the federal
Medicaid program pick up much of the expense for extending health
care for the uninsured.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Republican candidates are already raising warning
flags.
</P>
<P>
   ``Left to their own devices, liberal Democrats will spend every
dollar that is on the table,'' warns state Treasurer Joseph D.
Malone, a Republican hopeful who has made his promise to hold
spending to the inflation rate the centerpiece of his campaign for
the nomination. ``That's why we need a fiscal conservative in the
governor's office,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   So what does all this mean for the fall campaign? That it's
likely to shape up as a Montesquieuean battle of hope vs. fear, one
that pits the appeal of progressive ideas against the lingering
dread of a fiscal crisis like the one the state suffered through
from 1989 to 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the Cellucci campaign, strategists argue that the
Democrats' ambitious plans will scupper their own hopes. They see
the late 1980s, when a Democratic Legislature expanded the budget
at a pace that proved unsustainable when the economy turned sour,
as a stark cautionary tale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be easy to make the point about why two-party
government is important because of all these new spending
proposals,'' argues campaign manager Rob Gray. ``If you have a
Democratic governor who is not fiscally conservative, then the
Legislature has carte blanche to spend whatever they want _ and the
taxpayers will foot the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger denies he would let his party slip back into a
reckless tax-and-spend mode. ``My plan is fiscally responsible ...
and will help move working families forward,'' he declares.
</P>
<P>
   Says McGovern, of her own ideas: ``This is a minimal budget
increase invested in programs that will, in the long run, generate
new revenues and reduce state spending for social services, public
safety, and health care.''
</P>
<P>
   With a big tax cut signed, sealed, and delivered, and boom times
overshadowing distant memories of the last fiscal crisis, others
are dubious the big-spending label will stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares about big spenders when there is enough money
around,'' contends political analyst Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow
at the University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute. ``Paul
Cellucci isn't going to get anybody upset about the fear of
Democrats spending a budget surplus.''
</P>
<P>
   Be that as it may, fiscal experts say that, given this year's
budget, voters and elected officials alike would do well to keep a
weather eye on the horizon. Although next year's 6.6 percent
spending increase remains well below the 10.6 percent average rate
of growth in the six fiscal years (1984 through 1989) leading up
and into the last budget crisis, it is almost 2 percent higher than
the 4.7 percent average increase between 1991 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Cam Huff, senior research associate at the Massachusetts
Taxpayers Foundation, a business-financed fiscal watchdog
organization, says revenues are more than adequate to pay for this
year's spending increase _ but not to sustain a similar spending
pace in future years.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to understand that that kind of increase cannot be
sustained over the longer term,'' Huff said. ``We just don't see
the tax revenue that can keep up with that kind of increase.''

TAKING A THOREAU LOOK AT THE CAPE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A map is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KENNEY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In October 1849, well after whatever passed for a tourist season
in those days, Henry David Thoreau set out from Boston to tramp the
outer beaches of Cape Cod.
</P>
<P>
   Thoreau was propelled by the same thing that has brought
millions since his time to the Cape _ the wish, as he put it, ``to
get a better view than I had yet of the ocean.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Mulloney had seen plenty of the ocean as a vacationer
and a Hyannis-based television reporter, so it was simply cabin
fever and ``the need to get a life'' that prompted him to retrace
Thoreau's tramp through 1990s eyes, in a late-summer ramble that he
records in ``Traces of Thoreau,'' published last month by
Northeastern University Press.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloney was stuck in Boston ``between jobs,'' he said. One
night, he pulled an old, unread copy of Thoreau's Cape Cod journals
from his bookcase _ and sat down to thumb through it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a downtime in my life,'' said Mulloney, 45, over lunch
across from the State House, where he now works as an aide to State
Senator Lois Pines. He had been laid off from his job as a reporter
for WCVX, a Cape Cod television station _ and had been
``pink-slipped'' from a Cape romance _ and to make matters worse,
was fretting over whether he would be admitted to the Kennedy
School of Government.
</P>
<P>
   That night, Mulloney found himself ``intrigued by the strong,
original voice that spoke to me'' from the pages of Thoreau's
``Cape Cod.'' When Mulloney had finished reading it, the idea of
retracing Thoreau's footsteps seemed a matter of ``destiny'' rather
than merely a way of filling a between-jobs gap.
</P>
<P>
   If Thoreau did not see why he ``might not make a book on Cape
Cod,'' Mulloney thought, then ``I didn't see why I might not make a
book on Cape Cod, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The book was a half-dozen years in the making, as Mulloney did
get into the Kennedy School and then had to wait for a sabbatical
from the State House. Other books have more or less trod the same
territory _ notably, Henry Beston's ``The Outermost House'' and
John Hay's ``The Great Beach'' _ but Mulloney said nobody had done
the Cape quite Thoreau's way, setting off from Boston by public
transportation _ railroad in Thoreau's case, a Plymouth &AMP; Brockton
bus in Mulloney's.
</P>
<P>
   Mulloney thought at first that he would keep to Thoreau's pace
of 8 to 10 miles a day. But ``when you want to stop and explore it
takes a bit longer,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like Thoreau at the end of the day,'' he said, ``I'd be
looking for a good meal and a little conversation,'' which would
involve heading inland from the beach by late afternoon to find any
lodging &UR;  &LR; with a vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   But, Mulloney said, he did try to keep to ``the Thoreauvian
spirit'' and ``opt for spontaneity when it came to `inland'
encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course the Cape in the 1990s is not the same place Thoreau
saw a century-and-a-half before: no Christmas Tree Shops, no
miniature golf courses, no fast-food clam shacks.
</P>
<P>
   But there were elements of contemporary culture that Mulloney
thought would not be completely alien to ``H.T.'' _ as Mulloney
began thinking of him familiarly. ``I would have directed H.T.'s
attention to the surfers offshore waiting patiently for something
to ride,'' he writes, remembering that Thoreau thought that `the
duck does not take to the water with surer instincts than the Cape
Cod boy (and now add the Cape Cod girl), and what are our young
surfers but the most resourceful and inventive ducks, taking to
water in the accustomed Cape Cod manner?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; And the Great Beach, the 30-odd Atlantic-facing miles of
unbroken sand from Orleans to Provincetown, was still as
awe-inspiring as Thoreau had found it _ although Mulloney notes
with interest that Thoreau would be surprised to find it now
protected by the federal government ``with whom he was often at
odds.''
</P>

   Mulloney is back and forth to the Cape this summer for
book-signings and readings. Of his weekends, he said, ``it's one
day for the book and one day for Lois's campaign'' for attorney
general. Beyond that, ``I think I've been bitten by the
travel-writing bug,'' Mulloney said. ``But maybe someplace further
afield than the cape.''

 ! poor, !! fair, !!! good, !!!! excellent  
 
 !!! ``Brother''  An exhilaratingly edgy import that captures the
violence and brutality of the new Russia while seeming a blood
brother to the American gangster movies of the '30s. Sergei
Bodurov, who has yet to shed the last residues of baby fat and
pimples, bids to become the first international star of the new
Russian cinema as a demobilized soldier. Arriving in St. Petersburg
to buy rock CDs, meet women, and hook up with his hitman brother,
he finds he's a much more lethally efficient killer than the
latter. (Unrated)
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !! 1/2 &LR;   &UR; ``Disturbing Behavior''  &LR; Better-than-average
teen-screamer, with more intentional laughs than blood and gore.
Brainwashed ``Stepford'' teens listen to Wayne Newton, hang out at
the local yogurt shop, stay true to their school, and murder anyone
who gets in their way. (R) (Renee Graham)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; ! 1/2 ``Mafia''  &LR; A few of the sight gags and one-liners in this
effort from the ``Airplane!'' and ``Naked Gun'' gang work. But
mostly this overextended and ponderous ``Godfather'' parody is more
desperate than funny. The only consistently watchable thing in it
are Christina Applegate's goofy riffs on the Diane Keaton character
in Francis Ford Coppola's original. It can't be said that the late
Lloyd Bridges went out on top in his Brando parody here. How could
he have, given that Brando himself, among others, long ago
exhausted the potential for parody here? (PG-13)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! ``Pi &LR; '' &UR;  &LR; Here's the kind of sci-fi movie you wish ``The
 &UR;  &LR; X-Files'' had been. Hot-wired to weirdness and an edgy downtown
style, Darren Aronofsky's shoestring debut pulls us into its
claustrophobic story about a numbers freak who has patched together
a few homemade computers in his slummy walk-up and believes he has
penetrated the numerical pattern underlying everything in the
universe, from God to the stock market. Which of course attracts
the spiritually and materially greedy. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!!! ``Saving Private Ryan'' &LR;  The war movie to end all war movies.
Slamming us down with a bunch of grunts on deadly Omaha Beach on
D-Day, Steven Spielberg's masterpiece plunges us into the
moment-to-moment horror and chaos and heroism of war with a
completeness and immediacy that no previous film has. A Ranger
detachment led by Tom Hanks improvises its way behind the lines to
yank Matt Damon's last survivor among four brothers from the
carnage and get him home. It does what no Hollywood movie has done
before, namely convince us that war is no movie. (R)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; !!! 1/2 ``The Thief''  &LR; Pavel Chukrai elegantly and eloquently
revisits postwar Stalinist Russia in this story of a swaggering con
man and thief who dresses as an army veteran and wears a tattoo of
Stalin. Stealing hearts as well as the contents of communal
apartments, he finds life more complicated than he planned when he
hooks up with a young war widow and her 6-year-old son as cover.
Not that the film yields to sentimentality any more than to
allegory. It's unflinching about the brutality in which it deals
and tells its story powerfully and in classic Russian style. (R)

MOWLAM'S OPTIMISM ON PEACE IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- ``We are not going back,'' declares Tony Blair's
point person on Northern Ireland. And, as ever, Marjorie (call me
``Mo'') Mowlam maintains her trademark optimism _ not the cockeyed
kind but the clear-eyed variety.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fragile,'' she says, ``is too pessimistic'' a term to describe
the status of peaceful reform efforts in the wake of a historic,
multiparty agreement, an overwhelmingly approved referendum, a
tense Protestant marching season, and a horrific triple-murder of
three children.
</P>
<P>
   It helps to remember that from the beginning _ within days of
Blair's landslide election in Britain in the spring of last year _
Mowlam has been a consistently reliable indicator of the future,
usually in the face of widespread negativism and intransigence.
</P>
<P>
   She said jump-starting peace talks with a sense of urgency and
deadlines would produce multiparty negotiations, and it did. Down
the stretch this spring, she insisted agreement would come and that
it would win widespread voter approval, and she was right. She has
insisted that there is a formative new center committed to making
reconciliation work and to combatting political and terrorist
extremism. One should think than twice before betting against her.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast last week on a visit here to brief the Clinton
administration and congressional leaders and rally American
supporters after a rough patch of post-referendum road, Mowlam
identified the hyper-violent fringes of the Northern Irish scene as
the source of her greatest concern.
</P>
<P>
   This month's barbaric murder of three Catholic boys in a
firebomb attack on their home by apparently apprehended Protestant
killers, she said, was all the more barbaric because of its obvious
evil intent. This was no simple bombing; the attack was
specifically designed to trap the occupants inside. Similarly, she
noted what appears to have been the punishment killing of a young
Catholic man by terrorists last week. It was no execution, Mowlam
said; it was a torture murder. The victim was shot in both legs and
dumped in an elevator that was then disabled so he would bleed to
death.
</P>
<P>
   These are not the signatures of what are usually called the
paramilitaries of the Catholic and Protestant sides, but of
splinter groups desperate to torpedo the reconciliation process.
</P>
<P>
   So far, she said, there is not even a hint that larger,
established organizations on either side have even winked at the
murders for sectarian advantage. Indeed, all the evidence is to the
contrary.
</P>
<P>
   And the best evidence, in Mowlam's view as well as the public's,
is this: In the aftermath of the grisly murders of the three boys,
all but a handful of the Protestants taking part in the one ugly
confrontation with authorities during the marching season, when
Orange Order members insist on triumphalist parades through
Catholic neighborhoods, simply melted away into the night.
</P>
<P>
   A major piece of Mowlam's agenda here was to help keep support
from taking root among US supporters of the Irish Republican Army
for the splinter groups trying to torpedo the political settlement
via fraudulent appeals to nationalist sentiment. The US view is
that little of that is occurring, and that no serious money is
being raised to support terrorism, but official vigilance is high
and needs to be.
</P>
<P>
   So also is official US support for the peace process. While
Mowlam was on her way here, President Clinton's plans to visit in
September were announced, on the heels of a successful,
post-referendum mission by Commerce Secretary Bill Daley.
</P>
<P>
   And to maintain continuity in a difficult time of
institution-building, Clinton has asked one of the key architects
of the settlement, US Ambassador Jean Kennedy Smith, to stay on at
least through his own trip.
</P>
<P>
   It is understandable that violence always gets the most
attention, but Mowlam's plea for perspective (10 bomb plots foiled
just this month; thousands of marching season gatherings that
occurred without incident) is far from myopic.
</P>
<P>
   The fact remains that a peaceful reconciliation process now has
political authority in Northern Ireland (70 percent of the seats in
the new assembly are occupied by Good Friday agreement supporters).
And splinter group terrorism is strengthening the determination of
the freshly empowered majority to prevail.
</P>
<P>
   When Mo Mowlam says, ``We are not going back,'' she is not
whistling past the graveyard. She is reporting.

BOARD STRUGGLES TO DEFINE MEDICAL PRACTITIONERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON ZITNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Massachusetts board that regulates doctors may
change the legal definition of what constitutes the practice of
medicine, as insurance companies and technology prompt more
patients to reach out to doctors and nurses across state lines.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, doctors are forced to call insurance workers in
another state for approval to treat patients. Insurers encourage
patients to phone ``tele-nurses'' when they have medical questions,
hiring firms like one in Colorado that employs 500 nurses. And on
the Internet, a growing number of companies offer medical diagnoses
and drug prescriptions to patients worldwide, with no in-person
checkup by a physician.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers say some of these practices save patients millions of
dollars. But regulators are trying to claim more powers of
supervision, saying health workers in one state may be practicing
medicine without a license when they make decisions involving
patients in any other state.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a decision is made in Colorado about you in Massachusetts
and you die, we have no recourse to do anything,'' said Alexander
F. Fleming, executive director of the Massachusetts Board of
Registration in Medicine, which licenses doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colorado medical board could do something ... but your
body, the medical records, are all in Massachusetts,'' Fleming
said. ``It's tough for the Colorado board to even care about it,
but also tough for them to investigate it properly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Massachusetts boards that regulate doctors and nurses are
both grappling with new licensing rules to deal with evolving
insurance practices and technologies. The most dramatic change is
contemplated by the board governing physician licensing, because it
could set up a confrontation with the insurance industry.
</P>
<P>
   Under a preliminary proposal, the doctors' board would rule that
any insurance company decision to deny care, or to deny payment for
care, to a Massachusetts patient must be made by a physician
licensed in Massachusetts, Fleming said. In essence, turning down a
patient's request for treatment or reimbursement would become an
act of practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The largest Massachusetts health insurers say they use
physicians to make coverage decisions, so they already comply with
the proposed rule. But it is nevertheless likely to draw opposition
from the insurance industry. Nationwide, insurance companies often
use nurses and laymen to decide whether a specific treatment is
covered by a person's health policy, and they are adamant that
those decisions do not amount to practicing medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This appears to be an attempt by physicians to eviscerate
managed care,'' said Richard Coorsh of the Health Industry
Association of America, a trade group. ``There are many cases where
you don't need a doctor making these decisions, and doing so has
cost implications that would be passed on to patients.''
</P>
<P>
   The insurance industry unsuccessfully fought a similar law in
Mississippi this year, saying it would raise premiums by 5 percent
and push employers to drop coverage for 13,400 residents. The Texas
medical board adopted a similar rule in 1996, and laws are pending
before several state legislatures.
</P>
<P>
   Fleming said the Massachusetts Legislature has already empowered
the medical board to enact the rule after public hearings, though
it could be vetoed by the secretary of consumer affairs or the
secretary of administration and finance. The board's thinking is
still evolving, he said, and there is no timetable for public
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   In reviewing who may practice medicine, and where they must be
licensed, state regulators are reacting to a variety of
developments:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Managed health care increasingly forces doctors to seek
approval before offering treatment or referring a patient to a
specialist, often by calling insurance offices far from the
patient's home.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)A growing number of Internet sites allow people to buy
drugs and receive diagnoses by computer. For $9.95, Dr. Thomas E.
Brandeisky offers a ``virtual consultation'' based on a client's
e-mail account of his or her symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, called Cyberdocs.com, offers ``virtual
housecalls'' for $50 by Salem Hospital physicians Kerry Archer and
Steven Kohler. To avoid licensing problems with other states,
patients must certify that they are in Massachusetts or outside of
the United States, according to information posted on the site.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)New technology has allowed more ``tele-medicine,'' in
which physicians in one state obtain information by phone lines
about patients elsewhere, often at the time the patient is being
examined.
</P>
<P>
   This has forced regulators to grapple with the spectrum of
services that can be offered to patients from a distance, and to
begin thinking about what licenses should be required to offer
which services.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)More health plans are using ``tele-nurses,'' or nurses who
work the phones to answer routine medical questions, to make sure
patients are following treatment plans or refer patients to
specialists.
</P>
<P>
   Tele-nursing has become a big business. As many as 100 million
people could have access to tele-nursing service in the next few
years, up from 35 million today, said Theresa Bonanno, executive
director of the state Board of Registration in Nursing. And that
has raised licensing questions for nursing regulators.
</P>
<P>
   One Colorado company, Access Health Inc., employs 500 nurses who
will field 4.5 million calls this year from all 50 states. Many of
the calls come from people whose health plans have hired Access
Health to answer basic medical questions, such as how to treat a
rash or whether a baby's fever should prompt a trip to the
emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   By guiding the right services to patients at the right time,
Access Health says, insurers and patients can save money. But some
critics have asked whether a nurse in Colorado can properly treat a
person with emergency symptoms in Rhode Island, or whether that
nurse can tell that a patient's rash is likely to be caused by a
regional illness like Lyme disease.
</P>
<P>
   And others say that all ``tele-nurses'' should be licensed in
each state where patients are located.
</P>
<P>
   The Access Health nurses are licensed in the state from which
they answer the phones: Colorado, California, Illinois, and
Arizona. Julie Brooks, the company's general counsel, says Access
Health complies with all state licensing laws.
</P>
<P>
   But the National Council of State Boards of Nursing maintains
that under current laws ``tele-nurses'' must be licensed in the
state where the patient is located. ``If you are giving care to a
patient in Massachusetts, you are practicing in Massachusetts,''
said Susan Woodward, spokeswoman for the council.
</P>
<P>
   This suggests that a significant amount of improper nursing is
likely taking place today. ``Is this is an urgent matter right now?
I can't answer that,'' said Bonanno of the Massachusetts nursing
board. ``But there is a level of concern that will grow as this
practice continues to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the boards that regulate doctors, state nursing boards
are trying to work out a uniform set of rules that would allow
nurses to practice nationwide. Under a proposed interstate compact,
a nursing license would become something like a driver's license,
honored by all states and recognized as invalid by all states if
revoked.
</P>
<P>
   The 13-member Massachusetts nursing board supports the
interstate license, but it wants to study the idea more before
asking the legislature to approve it, Bonanno said.
</P>
<P>
   In their extreme, new state licensing rules could prevent a
Boston resident from consulting with a doctor at the
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in New Hampshire, said Dr. Barry
Wolcott, chief medical officer and co-founder of Access Health.
``State licensing statutes were set up to protect citizens from
quackery,'' he said, ``not to prevent them from choosing access to
high-quality services from outside the state.''

JAMES TAYLOR HAS TANGLEWOOD ON HIS MIND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PITTSFIELD, Mass. _ James Taylor made an offer no one wanted to
refuse.
</P>
<P>
   The popular American balladeer has been part of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra's extended family since Caroline Smedvig, the
orchestra's director of public relations and marketing, became his
significant other. Taylor was visiting Tanglewood recently and
thought it might be interesting for everyone, including himself, to
have an informal fireside chat with the fellows of the Tanglewood
Music Center, the BSO's summer institute for advanced musical
training. Because he is fully aware of recent allegations that the
TMC has headed full steam ahead down the track of blatant
commercialism, Taylor made it clear that since he had invited
himself, he was also willing to uninvite himself if his presence
would cause problems or offend sensibilities. TMC director Ellen
Highstein asked a number of students if they would mind meeting
with Taylor, and they looked at her as if she were crazy.
</P>
<P>
   So the chat took place in a rehearsal room earlier this month at
Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, where the TMC is lodged. Four or
five dozen TMC fellows showed up, and so did Seiji Ozawa and Andre
Previn. Joel Smirnoff, first violinist of the Juilliard Quartet,
served as interlocutor and MC, and he proved he was not a tourist
in Taylor's world. He did a better job than Barbara Walters would
have.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor levered his Lincoln-esque frame into an armchair and
spoke with great candor and self-deprecating humor about his
career, his musical training and interests, and his experience of
the creative process; in answering questions, he asked a few of his
own. There are many differences between Taylor's musical road and
the ones taken by Tanglewood fellows, but the number of
intersections was striking, and intersections don't have to lead to
collisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm flattered that so many of you showed up,'' Taylor said.
``I'm not sure what I have to offer, except that I have spent my
life in music, the way you have, and I am dedicated to it, the way
you are.'' With that by way of introduction, Taylor said, ``The
sooner we can get to questions and answers, the better off we'll
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Smirnoff started off by asking Taylor how his musical life
began. ``Music was always there to listen to in our house,'' Taylor
said, ``and my parents encouraged all of us to pursue our interest
in it. I played the cello for three years, and although I never
lifted off on that instrument, I think I got something out of it. I
got a guitar for Christmas when I was 12 years old, and right away
I started to get returns from my investment in it. It called me
back to experiment on it the way the cello never did. I kept
pulling the instrument out of its case. My brother Livingston and I
learned music together, and it was one big knot of folk music,
testosterone, and angst. I played a little bit for my pals, and met
more pals through the instrument, and we all taught each other
different things just as soon as we figured them out ourselves. I
started playing professionally when I was 15, but I was in my mid
20s before I developed a sense that music could be a career rather
than a hobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every musician has encountered parental opposition. ``My
parents may have felt concerns, and I'm sure that my father, who
was a doctor, was disappointed when I chose music over science, but
an occasional disapproving glance was as far as it went; he never
uttered a disparaging word, even when I dropped out of high school
and got into trouble. By the time I was 18 I had fallen in with a
bad element, and it's a miracle that I'm still here. My life took
me into some dangerous places, but my parents let me fly away
anyway. It makes my blood run cold when I think of my own kids
doing the same things.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about what kind of music he loved, what kind of musician
he wanted to be, Taylor said, ``After my lackluster years as a
cellist, I thought I wanted to be a folk musician, or a modern
version of a folk musician. It was the time of the Great Folk
Scare. My family had rec-ords of people like the Weavers, Pete
Seeger, and Jean Redpath, and I liked listening to Merle Travis,
Doc Watson, and Lightin' Hopkins. I would copy licks off their
records _ I wasn't aware that I was doing anything all that
difficult, although sometimes later I felt like I was on a
treadmill with the speed set too high. I read Sing Out magazine;
the folk movement was utopian, and felt like family _ more,
sometimes, than home or the campus. This was a wave that passed
through America; it repudiated the available culture and
consciously tried to make a political and social statement.''
</P>
<P>
   A singer wanted to know how Taylor has kept his voice fresh and
sounding pretty much the same throughout a career of three decades.
``That's because I have a vocal maintenance program,'' Taylor said.
``I have trained my voice, and I don't sing until I have warmed up.
I have found various warm-up exercises that work for me. The voice
is a muscle, and it has to be developed the way you develop any
other muscle.''
</P>
<P>
   One TMC fellow wanted to know how Taylor came to write his most
famous song, ``Fire and Rain.'' Taylor began by expressing a
profound reluctance to talk about songwriting. ``Songs are a better
form of communication than prose, or conversational dialogues; they
offer emotional shortcuts into other people's hearts, and I think
it diminishes the process to talk about it. Talking about music is
a very good way to shoot yourself in the foot.''
</P>
<P>
   But as Taylor spoke, he became more and more forthcoming. ``I
improvise on the guitar, and work on the things I am working on.
Then out of the vernacular stored in my brain and fingers,
something comes out; it presents itself _ it may be a series of
chord changes, or a groove I like. This in turn may suggest a
melody that can happen in that harmonic context. Things are also
suggested by the emotional context or the cadence of the words;
language can also be in conflict with the music. That's how it all
starts. But finishing a song is a very different process from
starting one. They start off of their own accord, but then you have
to nail them down.''
</P>
<P>
   Turning specifically to ``Fire and Rain,'' Taylor remembered how
in 1968 he was recording an album with the Beatles in London when
he learned of the suicide of a sweetheart. ``This was the start of
three months of a very difficult time for me. I wrote the first
verse when I heard the news, and the rest came when I checked into
the Austen-Riggs Center (a private psychiatric hospital) here in
Stockbridge; it was part of a period of reconstruction. My songs
are very personal, autobiographical statements, which may be why I
admire the composers of Tin Pan Alley so much _ I envy the
journeyman craftsmanship that makes it possible to write anything
they need to, although it must be tough sometimes. My songs are
intimate, interior stuff, sticky and juicy.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor went on to express his surprise and gratitude that he's
been allowed to make a career. ``Somehow I've been able to make a
living out of self-expression; it's a unique situation, not having
to pay more attention to the marketplace than I do. The marketplace
can be a very punishing place for artists, and I've written some
songs about that. (He sings a bit of `Hey, Mister, That's Me Up on
the Jukebox.') Artists have to be protected, and Tanglewood does
that, but they also have to find a place in the world. That's a
very thin line to walk. And it's always been there. Record
companies and contracts and tours and promoters are relatively new
inventions, but musicians have always had to please sources of
power _ and it's always been a drag. As performers, too, we have to
be attuned to what other people think of us, which is a dicey
thing. How evolved is it to be thinking all the time about what
other people think of you? On the other hand, thinking only about
yourself _ there's something very masturbatory about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Smirnoff wanted to know what Taylor's youthful goals were _ how
much was he interested in music and how much in success. Taylor
laughed, ``I just wanted to meet girls ... sex and death are the
only two motivations there are!''
</P>
<P>
   Continuing, Taylor apologized for the need he felt to get
cosmic. ``Music is soul food; that's the reason why we do it. A
lion has his tooth and his claw; we have consciousness, and because
we have that we're not alone. That's why we need God _ a dog
doesn't. The spiritual connection offered by my music helps us give
isolation the slip; it offers us relief. It is the truest language
there is. It follows the physical laws of the universe _ it speaks
to trees, and it speaks to your cat. That's why I hate to see
Michael Jackson selling Pepsi, or a John Lennon song selling
Lincoln-Mercury; it's a shame and a betrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa and Previn chimed in on an extended discussion about
improvisation that arose from Taylor's questions and observations
about the differences between classical music and his own work.
``There is a narrowness at both ends of the scale, I think,''
Taylor said. ``I can't sit down and play a guitar piece by reading
it off the paper; I don't read music and I have a block or a phobia
about it. And while I don't know a lot about classical music, I
think all the stuff a classical musician has to learn can take you
away from personal expression. The job, I guess, is to incorporate
everything you learn into your personal expression, and that's the
same for both of us. A player like Edgar Meyer has the benefit of
both worlds _ rigorous training and the ability to improvise.''
</P>
<P>
   Taylor said that although improvisation is important in his
writing, it doesn't play that big a role in his performances. In
response to a question about how he keeps his repertory fresh,
Taylor said, ``What continues to be compelling is the act of
performing. I like to perform in front of an audience which becomes
a shared experience and therefore unique, even if it is a
repetitive thing. I don't vary from performance to performance, at
least not very much.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa spoke of making the ``Marsalis on Music'' videos at
Tanglewood a few years ago. ``I was amazed _ I learned there are
rules in jazz, and ways to rehearse.'' Previn thinks that
improvisation and classical performance belong in different worlds.
``I don't like to improvise cadenzas in Mozart concertos, for
example; it's as if you were saying, `Move over, Wolfgang, I'm on.'
I can't do that. In improvisation, you really shouldn't be
comparing yourself to anything but yourself. In classical music, 99
percent belongs to the composer; in jazz, 99 percent belongs to the
performer. Attempts to mix the two up wind up leaving everybody
unhappy; each approach is equally valid, but one at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for a final word of advice, Taylor said, ``Stay out of
small Italian sports cars, avoid a major drug habit, and keep your
overhead down. Don't marry and have children until you are ready
for that. Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, but no more. And
always remember the path back to the well. This is not investment
banking; it's music.''

TODAY'S `HEAT WAVE' PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE OLD DAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By HARRY ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The past week, too much conversation was focused
on how hot it was. The heat was the icebreaker for strangers riding
an elevator, and likely the opener of even discussions among
acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it was brutally hot in certain areas of the country,
but these were distant from us here. When the record books were
consulted, it turned out that no recent hot-day records were broken
or equalled. We were just living through a spell of weather that
was perhaps 4 degrees above the average. Nothing to get into a
sweat about.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe our perceived general discomfort was based on empathy; we
thought we endured what was happening in Texas. It also provided us
with the opportunity to make daily talk about the weather a
year-round activity. Usually, and with good reason, we tend to talk
a great deal about it during our all-too-long winters. Perhaps it
was a special benefit to keep that sort of chatter up in the weeks
of July.
</P>
<P>
   I can take this sort of heat in stride because even all these
years later, when the subject of summer heat comes up, I can still
feel _ as if I were there now _ what it was like in New York City
during the dog days. These were the years before air-conditioning
became a ubiquitous household appliance.
</P>
<P>
   In those times, if you were looking for respite, you had to take
yourself off to what was called an air-cooled environment, which
was to be found in selected movie houses. They used the phrase to
attract customers at a time when sitting in a crowded theater
otherwise might not be a top priority for many people.
</P>
<P>
   Few office buildings then were air-conditioned or air-cooled, or
in any other way equipped to handle what summer brought. As a
consequence, long sleeves were rolled up, ties pulled way down and
collars unbuttoned. Large amounts of soda were consumed in a
self-defeating effort to bring down the internal temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Paperwork on desks stuck to constantly damp forearms and many
daily tasks, usually easily accomplished, became a special chore.
By the time the work shift ended, you were outwardly rumpled beyond
the possibility of repair. Inwardly, you were exhausted, totally
drained of energy and desire. And that's before you descended into
the non-air-conditioned subway for the trip home. What a unique and
memorable experience it was, day after day, to be crammed together
with a multitude of by-now fragrant folks for what seemed the
longest ride home.
</P>
<P>
   Now that was hot, and uncomfortable and bearable only because
there was no other option available.
</P>
<P>
   Remembering the bad old days without the means to routinely keep
cool makes today's hot spells seem slight by comparison. Besides
which, considering our long winters, the feelings of heat should be
stored up the way a camel takes in water, for use later on when it
will really be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Summer gives us leave to enjoy other pleasures that we tend to
deny ourselves during cooler seasons of the year, when strictures
of propriety flourish. Dress becomes more casual during summer, and
is tolerated in the business offices as it would not be at other
times.
</P>
<P>
   Summertime permits adults to return to the days of their
childhood, and vacationing is nothing so much as legitimizing
grownups to disport themselves in the barest essential minimum of
clothing. Walking shorts and t-shirts are to be seen everywhere,
and many feet get to go sockless from the time of arising in the
morning to the moment of retiring at night.
</P>
<P>
   In the other seasons of the year, class distinctions become
immediately evident from the suits and dresses worn. But nothing
levels the layers of a society becoming ever more stratified as the
appearance of rich man or poor man in jean shorts, moccasins and
t-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, there is much good in summer, and we would do well not
to exaggerate minor inconveniences, but to revel in it while the
reveling is good. There is only one thing wrong with summer: it's
about a month or two too short.

ROCK'S NEW RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The message is clear. Radio and MTV, the twin towers of music
promotion, can no longer be relied on to break new bands into the
mainstream. Many acts have tried, but most have failed to dent
radio's restrictive formats and MTV's increased focus on non-music
programming. A band has a better chance of waiting for Godot than
of hearing its single played on a major radio station or seeing its
video on MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Check these eye-opening statistics: More than 28,000 records are
released each year, of which only 8 percent actually make money,
says Larry Solters, a spokesman for Capitol Records. With those
odds, it's no wonder that artists and labels are forging new
strategies to get music across to a public already satiated with
entertainment options.
</P>
<P>
   Consider:
</P>
<P>
   _New media darling Natalie Imbruglia, who has sold 2 million
copies of her debut disc, ``Left of the Middle,'' burst on the
scene this year by performing on ``Saturday Night Live'' before she
had a record out. That was a first _ and by the time radio got on
board, she was already well on her way.
</P>
<P>
   _The Minneapolis band Semisonic has a bassist, John Munson, who
is an expert fly-fisher. His label, MCA, has used that to pitch
Men's Journal, Hooked on the Outdoors, and other nature magazines
to do stories on him and the band. It's not the cover of Rolling
Stone, but it's still helpful exposure.
</P>
<P>
   _Rapper Master P is a new star on Priority Records, which has
aided his career by running high-impact ads on the alterna-hip
cable TV show ``South Park.''
</P>
<P>
   _Boston band Guster, following a path forged by industry
iconoclasts R.E.M., regularly plays college gigs to build a fan
base. The band also has an incentive program, via the Internet, of
giving fans free tickets to its shows if they sell Guster
merchandise and CDs. There are 800 of these ``Guster reps'' around
the country; each gets five to 10 CDs to sell to friends. ``It's a
way of getting your music to kids who can't always find it in the
stores,'' says Guster manager Dalton Sim.
</P>
<P>
   _New R&AMP;B group Melky Sedeck, featuring the brother and sister of
Wyclef Jean from the Fugees, is being pitched to fashion magazines
Vanity Fair, Cosmo, and Elle before its record comes out. Neither
artist is a fashion model, but they're ``gorgeous and have a strong
fashion sense,'' a label rep says of this trend to plant stories in
such magazines.
</P>
<P>
   All of which fits today's accent on alternative marketing.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't just put a record out and have it become successful.
You have to look for your audience,'' says Cathy Halgas,
spokeswoman for rockers Letters to Cleo and singer-songwriter David
Poe. The latter's modus operandi is booking many in-store
performances (at the Borders Books &AMP; Tapes chain, for one) in hopes
of compensating for meager airplay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any angle we can use is definitely better than nothing,'' says
Lori Berk, an executive with MCA Records.
</P>
<P>
   Today's artists and record labels _ tired of getting nixed by
radio and MTV _ are wising up. They're reaching consumers by such
diverse tactics as handing out sampler albums at skateboard events,
building up on-line services (and giving review copies of albums to
Internet writers, not just mainstream press critics), and
soliciting slots on soundtrack albums (which have helped break acts
ranging from Lisa Loeb to the currently hot Black Eyed Peas).
</P>
<P>
   Other tactics include seeking time on network talk shows (Jay
Leno, David Letterman, Conan O'Brien, and Magic Johnson are pitched
constantly), soliciting appearances on non-MTV cable outlets (the
Disney Channel has helped break teen bluesman Jonny Lang, country
phenom LeAnn Rimes, and new teen sensations 'N Sync), and booking
``residency'' tours for acts that play weekly in various regional
clubs, giving fans and media more chances to see them. This last
method is how Jewel built her audience. She gained more marketing
clout by playing at high schools wherever she went.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just can't count on radio anymore,'' says Guster's Sim.
His group recently signed with Sire Records and has been touring
with Widespread Panic and G Love &AMP; Special Sauce _ two other acts
that have had scant airplay, but have won audiences through
word-of-mouth, grass-roots efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure glad that we're successful already,'' says Adam
Duritz, singer with the Counting Crows. ``I wouldn't want to be a
young band right now. It's really hard for new bands to break
through. Modern rock stations are like the new Top 40 stations.
There's a real repetition of the same songs there. It's harder for
new bands to get a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to break new acts, because we're so
song-driven,'' admits Steve Strick, music director of Boston rock
giant WBCN-FM (104.1). ``No matter what format you're talking
about, a band has to have a song that will break through. It's not
like years ago when (radio) would nurture a band.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio airplay is still the promised land, but many bands, not
content with waiting for their shot, are even adopting alternative
strategies to impress radio programmers. Matchbox 20, for instance,
which has sold 7 million copies of its debut album, ``Yourself and
Someone Else,'' used to show up in radio station lobbies (whether
or not it had been invited) to pass out pizzas and perform acoustic
sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted them to remember us. We did it for two months,''
says Matchbox 20 singer Rob Thomas. ``It gave them faces to go with
the band, so Matchbox 20 wasn't just a CD that came across their
desks. It was, `Hey, I remember those guys. They brought us
pizza.''' It may sound a bit tacky, but Thomas is convinced that it
worked.
</P>
<P>
   One thing for certain: Today's marketing plans start early. Look
at Flight 16, a British hard-rock band whose self-titled CD doesn't
come out until Aug. 25 but who played a series of free, set-up
shows last month in the States. The band's label, Sony 550, chose
what it felt were the four hardest-rocking American cities (Boston,
Chicago, Dallas, and Los Angeles) to showcase the band.
</P>
<P>
   For the Boston date, the company enlisted the aid of the
Planetary Group, an alternative-marketing agency run by Adam Lewis.
He and his staff asked Ticketmaster to print up 1,000 tickets (at a
cost of $50, or a nickel per ticket) to Flight 16's show at the
Aerosmith-owned Mama Kin club. The tickets were then distributed
free to ``impact areas where the hipsters and college kids hang
out,'' says Lewis, referring to Tower Records, Newbury Comics, the
Allston Beat, and Urban Outfitters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized that with a baby band, there wasn't going to be a
huge draw,'' Lewis says. ``But we also knew there's a definite
value of having a hard ticket in your hand, as opposed to just
saying that you're on the guest list. We gave away 1,000 of the
tickets and 10 percent of the people showed up, which is pretty
good, I think. The emphasis is on getting people in front of the
band, not on making money. If we develop the band now, hopefully
the payoff will be later.''
</P>
<P>
   Flight 16 delivered a scorching set, filled with sniping guitar
solos and a ``Beatles meets Zeppelin'' sound, as singer Dave Sears
put it. The set was also seen by numerous music critics and by
WBCN's Strick. ``That was a pretty effective band,'' says Strick.
``I haven't heard the record yet, but I'll definitely check it
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's marketing scenario places a heavy emphasis on playing
ability _ a refreshing change from past years, when bands spent
small fortunes to make videos that MTV would often ignore anyway.
Many experts now advise bands to perform as often as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get a local following and if you start to draw 500 people a
night, the A&AMP;R folks (artist &AMP; repertoire, meaning talent scouts)
will come swarming,'' says Greg Glover, an A&AMP;R rep for Slash/London
Records. That's what happened to the band Harvey Danger, which
Glover signed out of Seattle. The group was making local waves with
the amusing, tongue-in-cheek song ``Flagpole Sitta'' (sample verse:
``I'm not sick, but I'm not well''). First aired on Seattle station
KNPD, it eventually became a recent No. 2 hit on the modern rock
chart nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally, the key to breaking an act into the upper reaches of
stardom is to have a multidimensional approach. ``You have to have
the press at the same time that you have radio and MTV,'' says
Elaine Schock, a vice president at RCA Records, which has broken
Imbruglia and is enjoying fast-rising success with 'N Sync and Eve
6. ``You need to see the group on TV, you need to hear it, you need
to read about it, and then you'll buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, that's easier said than done in today's convoluted
music market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, people want to get out there and make a return on
their investment quickly, but it can take time,'' says Tom Carolan,
who does A&AMP;R for Sony 550 and previously signed the Stone Temple
Pilots to Atlantic Records. ``You don't want to get too tricky. You
want to try to let a band grow organically and naturally. You don't
want them to rush out and play a bigger stage than is natural for
them. I'd rather see a packed 500-seat club than a half-empty
1,000-seat club.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always a certain amount of hype involved in this
business, but the key word is `patience.'''

VICTIM OF DOWNSIZING FINDS A NEW BULLY: THE IRS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary

   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Truman Crabbe recalls vividly when he was mugged.
</P>
<P>
   He was 69 years old. He was earning a quarter of a million
dollars a year managing the Albany office of IDS Financial
Services. And it was a year after American Express bought the
company.
</P>
<P>
   That was when Truman Crabbe was replaced by a man in his 30s who
would earn less than half of what Truman Crabbe was making. And, at
about the same time, other IDS divisional managers around the
country got similar bad news.
</P>
<P>
   They were all older guys. They all made big bucks. And they all
were part of a wave of corporate bloodletting that made Wall Street
cheer and grown men weep all across the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a 15-year period, corporate America erased about 45 million
jobs in cutbacks designed to drive up stock prices. By the time
Truman Crabbe was let go, it was no longer blue-collar workers
being thrown overboard. By then, layoffs were hitting mostly
higher-paid, college-educated workers who'd figured _ mistakenly _
that their tenure, loyalty and performance had earned them some
measure of job security. Some of these people just retired. They
went quietly. Truman Crabbe and 31 other IDS division managers
across the country were not among them. They sued for age
discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   They won, too. The company coughed up $35 million in a
settlement. After legal fees, Truman Crabbe ended up with about
$500,000 in wage replacement and tort damages. A tort is a legal
term for a wrongdoing that causes damage, a violation of somebody's
rights. Truman Crabbe fully expected to pay taxes on the money the
company gave him for wage replacement. He would have paid taxes on
that money if he'd stayed with the company. But he didn't expect to
have to pay taxes on money awarded him for his legal fees or
because he'd been done wrong.
</P>
<P>
   After all, he wouldn't have had to pay taxes on legal fees or
damages if some drunk had run him down on with a car.
</P>
<P>
   He was left with only a bit more than a year's salary. The
government took the rest. It just didn't seem right to him. So he
left his home in the Albany suburb of Clifton Park and went to see
his congressman, Gerald B.H. Solomon, a man famously sympathetic to
corporate interests over his 10 terms in the House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
   And Jerry Solomon agreed with him that this just wasn't right.
</P>
<P>
   The result was House Bill 2792. Except for wage replacement
dollars, it would exempt such damage awards from taxation. It also
would permit the damaged employee to spread the amount of the award
over the period of time between the date of the damage and the date
of the award.
</P>
<P>
   Normally, since Solomon is chairman of the powerful House Rules
Committee, a bill like this would have an excellent chance of
passage. But Solomon recently announced that this will be his last
term in Congress. He's now a lame duck. And his bill remains
bottled up in the Ways and Means Committee, chaired by Rep. Bill
Archer, R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Archer doesn't like this bill, and Solomon can't shake it free.
</P>
<P>
   So, HR 2792 dies when Congress recesses next month. And, unless
some other powerful member of Congress picks it up next session,
Truman Crabbe is out of luck.
</P>
<P>
   Every year, about two million Americans are affected by violent
crime. About 3 million people, a full 50 percent more, are fired _
many because they're too old and make too much money. They're
mugged by their employers as surely as any crime victim.
</P>
<P>
   And, because Bill Archer won't let this bill out of committee,
the ones who fight back are mugged again by the IRS.
</P>

CHARISMATIC KIASMA ENTERS FINLAND IN NEW-MUSEUM DERBY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINE TEMIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HELSINKI _ A proper opera house used to be the prerequisite for
any European city laying claim to cultural consciousness. Now it's
a proper museum for modern and/or contemporary art. Bilbao and
Barcelona, the two leading cities of northern Spain, are duking it
out with major new museums that are also major tourist attractions,
Bilbao's by the American architect Frank Gehry, Barcelona's by
American Richard Meier. Stockholm's crowning achievement as this
year's Cultural Capital of Europe was the opening of its Moderna
Museet, designed by a Spaniard, Rafael Moneo. London's celebration
of the millennium will be capped by the inauguration of the vast
Tate Gallery of Modern Art, housed in the former Bankside Power
Station, which is being redesigned by Swiss architect Jacques
Herzog. And you could barely squeeze another new museum into
Switzerland or Germany, so crowded is the field.
</P>
<P>
   Now Finland enters the fray with Kiasma, a contemporary art
museum as captivating as its name, from the Greek word for
``crossover.'' The struggle for freedom of this nation so long
dominated by its aggressive neighbors, Sweden and Russia, has
helped define Kiasma. Many contemporary museums find the end of
World War II a logical starting point for their collections. Kiasma
starts with 1960 because, chief curator Maaretta Jaukkuri explains,
Finland was so crippled by the war, its spirit and treasury so
depleted, that the country ``turned inward, to heal the wounds.''
</P>
<P>
   It's now turned eagerly outward. Like the new museums in Bilbao,
Barcelona, Stockholm, and London, Helsinki's has been designed by a
foreigner _ the New York-based architect Stephen Holl, chosen from
an astonishing 516 applicants. Since Finland's greatest
contribution to world culture, along with the music of Sibelius, is
arguably its 20th-century architecture by the likes of Alvar Aalto
and Eliel Saarinen, its selection of a foreigner to design the new
$40 million museum is even more significant than similar choices in
Bilbao and Stockholm. The museum's site, at one of Helsinki's
busiest intersections, couldn't have stressed that significance
more. A couple of minutes' walk from Kiasma are two canonical
buildings: Aalto's majestic, marble-clad Finlandia Hall, now under
scaffolding as it undergoes major repairs; and Saarinen's mighty
railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   In this distinguished company, Kiasma holds its own with a
murmur rather than a scream. Holl's delicately balanced play of
curves and grids greets its surroundings graciously. The back of
Kiasma bulges toward Toolo Bay like a sail filled with wind. (Or
like the soaring roof of another great waterside culture temple,
the Sydney Opera House.) The side of the building facing Finlandia
Hall looks like a giant cornucopia sheared off at the end, its
glass walls allowing a view of all five floors of the interior.
</P>
<P>
   One other thing about the site. Between Kiasma and the street is
the equestrian statue of Marshal Mannerheim, Finnish war hero and
later Finnish president. Holl suggested it be moved to accommodate
the museum. ``He didn't know Finnish history,'' Jaukkuri says. ``It
was unfortunate that he said that.'' You don't mess with
Mannerheim, not in Finland, Holl found. So ultimately he didn't. In
its final form, his building becomes a fine backdrop for the
statue, which is reflected in the sleek glass walls, the rectangle
of the sculpture's base echoed in the rectangles of the building's
grid. And one window originally slated to have milk glass is clear
instead, to give museumgoers inside the building a good view of the
hero on horseback.
</P>
<P>
   Holl learned something of Finnish history the hard way, and
Finns seem appreciative if not quite ready to free him completely
of the arrogant-architect stereotype. My guide says that when Holl
came for the May opening of the museum, ``he tried to be modest.''
</P>
<P>
   On my first visit to Helsinki, in 1993, a Finnish acquaintance
pointed to a downtown restaurant and proudly announced that this
was the only place in the world where Salman Rushdie could eat in
public. The moral of the story is that Helsinki is safe.
</P>
<P>
   Kiasma is hardly safe architecture _ but it's seductive rather
than shocking. Its designer was until recently one of those
visionaries whose drawings ended up on gallery walls but whose
buildings didn't get built. That's been changing, with commissions
from Japan to Amsterdam. The only Holl building I'd seen previously
is his Chapel of St. Ignatius at Seattle University, a series of
fluid, intersecting volumes and meandering paths that suggest the
road to God is neither straight nor easy, but might be beautiful.
Walls curve. Chandeliers are made of liquid-looking glass.
Handrails unfurl like ribbons. The walls of one chapel are coated
with beeswax, with prayers on snippets of gold leaf embedded in the
wax; in the center of the space a madrona tree lifts its branches
heavenward.
</P>
<P>
   Kiasma, too, has ribbony door handles and wall sconces composed
of two arcs that cradle a bulb. It, too, has a chapel-like quality,
and traffic patterns that meander. The ramps and stairs do not
follow a linear path; nor, of course, does contemporary art. From
the ground floor, devoted to amenities including bookshop and cafe,
a curving ramp beckons upward into white spaces with diffuse white
light pouring in from above, a celestial effect interrupted by an
interior window with a view of Italian artist Maurizio Nannucci's
blue neon words, ``more than meets the eye.'' (The Nannucci is in
English. Labels at Kiasma are in English as well as Finnish and
Swedish, the country's two official tongues: Hence the joke ``Finns
are silent in two languages.'')
</P>
<P>
   While Holl's Seattle chapel is architecture and sculpture in
one, his brief in Helsinki was to make spaces that could
accommodate other people's art. ``I wanted a neutral, very Zen
simplicity to allow the art pieces to be in the foreground,'' he
says. That art goes far beyond painting and sculpture. ``We
emphasize new media,'' says Jaukkuri. ``We collect many works that
exist only on the Internet or CD-ROM.'' ``Media stations''
sprinkled through the museum allow visitors to explore and
experience contemporary art. Several spaces are devoted to video,
their curving walls and jutting dormers adding shape to video's
flatness. Kiasma is possibly the most forward-thinking,
technologically-minded of the new crop of contemporary museums. Its
very name signifies the intersection of art and technology.
</P>
<P>
   Kiasma was officially born in 1990, an offshoot of the Finnish
National Gallery, housed in temporary quarters until Holl's
building opened. Its collection of 4,000 works includes the usual
international suspects _ Serra, Salle, Lichtenstein _ but its
mandate is to collect in what Jaukkuri calls ``concentric circles _
Finnish artists first, then those from the Baltic States and
Russia, then the other Scandinavian countries, then further
afield.'' This policy results in delightful ``finds'' like
``Babylon,'' an installation by two Danish artists, Christian Skeel
and Morten Skriver, who have filled ceramic jars with strong scents
_ camphor, cedarwood, ambergris, and dozens more, making a quiz to
see what your nose knows.
</P>
<P>
   As for the native art, it makes up a major show called ``This
Side of the Ocean,'' which is, Jaukkuri says, ``about Finnishness _
the cliches and the myths. Finnish art is traditionally very well
made _ a characteristic that can be a weakness. It can be too neat,
too nice.'' Fanni Niemi-Junkola, one of the 11 artists in the show,
goes against that grain in her short film, ``Giants,'' a battle
between two women who kick and push in an effort to throw each
other into the sea. They're not nice at all. Pekka Nevalainen's
installation ``Nature Document (Six Spruces)'' includes a half
dozen bedraggled, shedding conifers that look like a Christmas tree
sale on Dec. 26. Marianna Uutinen's ``MacKesa'' includes a swath of
Marimekko fabric, in one of the firm's signature squiggle designs.
Esko Mannikko's panoramic photographs show a Finnish countryside
ridden with litter. Sirpa Alalaakkola's portraits depict immigrants
whose faces are Asian, African, Hispanic _ anything but the
blue-eyed blond that says ``Finnish'' to most outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   While Kiasma hasn't had the blitz of publicity that other new
museums have enjoyed _ Meier's Getty Museum and Gehry's Bilbao
topping the list _ it has had a highly positive reception. In her
book ``Towards A New Museum,'' an opinionated and often highly
critical analysis of the subject, architectural historian Victoria
Newhouse lavishes praise on Holl's aims and achievements. ``From
the moment one enters the museum's white concrete-walled reception
atrium,'' she writes, ``the mystery of its receding curve and
diffused skylight arouses a sense of excitement and anticipation.''
There's box-office evidence that Finns and other folks agree. In
its first month, Helsinki's new museum drew 100,000 visitors.
Kiasma has charisma.

GARY BROWN OVERCOMES WEIGHT, GAME WOES TO PLAY WITH THE GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SINGELAIS  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Feeling sorry for himself, Gary Brown wasted the
autumn of 1996, secluded inside a town house he rented in his
hometown of Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployed running back wiled away the time by watching
television and eating _ especially his mother's specialty, macaroni
and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just kind of sat around and didn't do anything,'' said
Brown, now playing for the New York Giants. ``It wasn't a good
situation then.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few months of this sedentary lifestyle, Brown ballooned
to 260 pounds, 42 pounds heavier than when he first entered the
National Football League.
</P>
<P>
   It looked like the end of Brown's career, which had included a
1,000-yard season with the Houston Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   But Brown's mother, Dorreen, repeatedly implored him to return
to football, and Brown had an epiphany while sitting in front of
the television in January 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day I was watching the AFC playoffs, and I realized that I
wanted to play again,'' Brown said. ``I decided to dedicate myself
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Shedding 30 pounds, Brown came out of exile to play for the San
Diego Chargers last season. The Chargers chose not to re-sign him
this season, so Brown joined the Giants.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, starting over with his third team, is trying to show the
Giants he is still a productive runner at age 29.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I just have to go out and prove it again,'' he said. ``I'm
not really happy (just) to be in the league. That's no big deal.
The big deal is going out and proving again that I'm a quality
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown is carrying a much more manageable 230 pounds on his
5-foot-11 frame. Despite his history, Giants coach Jim Fassel said
he doesn't monitor Brown's weight any more closely than any other
player.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's overweight, he gets fined,'' Fassel said. ``Right now,
he's fine. And he will be. He's worked at it, and I don't see
weight being a problem with him right now. And he'll probably trim
out a little bit as we continue to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he likes Brown's extra effort, the ability to turn a
likely three-yard gain into four or five yards.
</P>
<P>
   Watching Brown run isn't pretty, but he keeps his shoulder pads
low and his legs are constantly churning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I have a style,'' he said. ``I just go out and
run as hard as I possibly can. Because my pad level is so low and
because of my build, I always tend to go forward and I use that to
my advantage. In the fourth quarter, guys are getting tired and
starting to tackle high, so I run through a lot of arm tackles.''
</P>
<P>
   He was one of the NFL's biggest surprises in 1993, when he ran
for 1,002 yards for the Oilers despite starting only eight games.
His 5.1 average per carry led his conference.
</P>
<P>
   He never reached that level again. His 1994 season was cut short
by a thigh injury and he was benched for six games in 1995. He was
cut in Houston's training camp in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was injuries and maybe a little bit of my
immaturity, being able to handle the type of pressure and success
that comes with a 1,000-yard season,'' Brown said. ``I didn't know
that after that (1,000 yards), they'd expect me do to it every
season.''

</P>
<P>
   As Brown ate himself out of football in 1996, his mother tried
to give him a verbal kick in the pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just told him I knew that he loved football, and I knew he
wasn't ready to give it up,'' Dorreen Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Brown committed himself to physical fitness. He
worked out at the local YMCA and ran at a football field in his old
neighborhood in Williamsport.
</P>
<P>
   It was no small feat to burn off 30 pounds after five months of
inactivity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I was going to die,'' he said. ``But I figured that
I put myself in that position, so now I was going to get myself out
of it. That was my whole motivation.''
</P>
<P>
   He signed a one-year contract with San Diego, and nearly gained
1,000 yards, but a groin injury in the season finale against Denver
left him stuck at 945 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his comeback, Brown was unemployed again this off-season
when the Chargers decided to bring back running back Natrone Means.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants were happy to sign Brown to a one-year contract, a
move that sealed the departure of franchise rushing leader Rodney
Hampton.
</P>
<P>
   Brown said his primary motivation isn't the money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just going out and playing is my thing,'' he said. ``It's not
the glitz and the shoe endorsements and all that stuff. Everybody
wants that, but I'm in it for the respect of my peers.''

   SAN FRANCISCO _ A chilled fog buried the coast again this past
week, and it hid a fire that hasn't burned so hot in 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Out on the beaches, fishermen are again casting out to the sea,
their dawn images nothing more than silhouettes against the ocean
backdrop. Many are in groups, others are alone. It looks something
like men against the sea, classic and beautiful, but the reality on
the beach is that the striped bass have roared in, and the
prospects for thrill, one-on-one, have rarely been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe, there are bass everywhere,'' said Keith
Fraser, who founded the United Anglers of California based on a
proposed resurrection of the fishery.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're at the old spots, like 30 years ago, in the (San
Francisco) Bay, everywhere ...,'' Fraser said. ``And there lots of
them, not just a few, but just bass everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Klinger of Pacifica, something of a sea wolf, said the fish
are biting often even when there are no ``bird conventions,'' that
is, circling, diving birds indicating that a school of fish has
trapped baitfish against the back of the surf wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even when there's no birds, you see guys out on the beach, and
they're getting them,'' Klinger said. ``Some guys even just use
bait, cast it out, and then spend the day, enjoying themselves.
Others are working at it, casting all day, and fish are being
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Jonah Li of Hi's Tackle who first noticed last Christmas
that something might have suddenly turned for the better for the
bass. Over the Christmas and New Year's holidays, Li discovered
that striped bass were holding along Baker Beach and Crissy Field
near the entrance of San Francisco Bay, the first time that as
been documented in winter.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was just a start, striped bass started being caught
in larger numbers in March and April at Ocean Beach on the San
Francisco coast, and then in early June, a huge throng roared out
of nowhere and into the Bay and coast, from Marin on through San
Francisco to Pacifica, some 20 miles of fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``El Nino cost my business a fortune, especially with all the
bad weather and no trips,'' said Craig Stone at Emeryville
Sportfishing. ``But now for the first time in years, we're seeing
all these stripers, really, it's unbelievable, the real thing, just
fish everywhere, especially hard to believe how many, and it's
turning this summer into something special, something a lot of
people will never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   After the drought of 1991, the striped bass population crashed
to all-time lows, with year-after-year of the lowest spawning
success in the Delta this century. Stone, like many, believes that
the migration habits of the fish have changed due to so much water
being diverted into the Delta, where 80,000 gallons of water is
taken per second and sent to points south.
</P>
<P>
   But this spring, the Delta pumps were shut down for more than
two months, both for repairs for the California Aqueduct and also
because farmers in the San Joaquin Valley needed no extra water
after El Nino did its thing. For the first time in 15 years, water
flowed from mountains to Delta to Bay unimpeded, just as nature had
done.
</P>
<P>
   Just as suddenly, the striped bass are acting like they did in
the 1960s, before the Delta pumps started cranking, as well as back
in the early 1980s, when the pumps were also shut to repair the
400-mile Aqueduct.
</P>
<P>
   With the bass back on the beach, it provides a chance for a
special experience, to see if you can catch a big bass. It is the
kind of experience that has rare appeal because everything is up to
you, there is complete freedom, it's cheap yet a challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Like religion, there are many paths but one truth. As Klinger
mentioned, some will just use bait, blood worms, pile worms,
anchovies, even cut fillets of sardine, cast it out at a favorite
hole, and even bring a lawn chair, waiting for a bite. Others take
different approach, reading their tide books, fishing the two hours
after the top of the tide, making long-distance casts with metal
jigs and spoons such as the 3 1/2-ounce Krocadile, chrome with the
lime-green stripe, or Hopkins, Kastmasters or Miki jigs.
</P>
<P>
   Others go the extra mile. Some daredevils will venture out on
the rocky points, then cast huge floating wood plugs called Pencil
Poppers, where strikes from 20-pound bass can come right on the
surface, sometimes within 10 feet. This can be dangerous, where a
rogue wave can sweep an unsuspecting angler right into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Party boats from San Francisco, Berkeley and Emeryville, all
with live anchovies for bait, are also making daily trips to the
beach, and the scores have been mind-boggling, with 2-fish limits
of striped bass often caught so fast that the boats have time to
also fish for halibut, rockfish and sometimes even salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Huck Finn out of Emeryville, for instance, reported 84
striped bass (limits) to 21 pounds, plus a bonus of 20 halibut to
22 pounds for 42 people.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of excited anglers scrambling along the beach could
make for a mural with poetic qualities. But the results are as
concrete as the roads you drive on _ the bass are back on the
beach.

   LUTHERVILLE, Md. _ Asked what he would do if he found a million
dollars, Lawrence Peter Berra answered: ``If the guy was poor, I
would give it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Berra was a distinguished catcher for the New York Yankees
(1946-1963), most valuable player in the American League in 1951,
1954 and 1955, and he managed the team to the pennant in 1964. But
he is best known today as the inspiration for the name of cartoon
character Yogi Bear _ and for word foulups that were sometimes real
and (perhaps) sometimes contrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is 90 percent mental,'' he said. ``The other half is
physical.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Are you a fatalist?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I never collected postage stamps.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickey Mantle's switch-hitting? ``Mantle was naturally
amphibious.''
</P>
<P>
   Berra wasn't alone as a baseball personality with a talent for
hilarious misstatements.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Ozark, who managed the Phillies from 1973 to 1979,
exclaimed during a losing streak: ``I know we're having troubles,
but that's nothing new. Even Napoleon had his Watergate.''
</P>
<P>
   Team morale? ``Morality is not a problem here.''
</P>
<P>
   About an infielder: ``His limitations are limitless.''
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Coleman, the former Yankee infielder who became a
broadcaster, described a long drive: ``There's a fly ball deep to
center field ... Winfield is going back, back _ he hits his head
against the wall. It's rolling toward second base.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Colemanisms: ``He salides into second with a stand-up
double.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Young Frank Pastore may have just pitched the biggest victory
of 1979, maybe the biggest victory of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Gaylord Perry and McCovey should know each other like a book.
They've been ex-teammates for years now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If Pete Rose brings the Reds in, they ought to bronze him and
put him in cement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Royster has gone six-for-seven against Shirley this year ...
and there's a single that makes him five-for-eight.''
</P>
<P>
   Back to Yogi Berra: Had he seen ``Doctor Zhivago''?
</P>
<P>
   ``No, I feel fine.''
</P>
<P>
   To a waitress who asked if he wanted French fries: ``OK but no
potatoes, I'm on a diet.''
</P>
<P>
   To another who queried whether he wanted his pizza cut into four
pieces or eight: ``Better make it four _ I don't think I can eat
eight.''

NOVEL IS A MODERN IRISH EPIC OF DISPLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE WHEREABOUTS OF ENEAS MCNULTY 
By Sebastian Barry.  
Viking. 308 pp. $23.95. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Virgil's ``Aeneid'' gave us in epic detail the horrors of
war, it also rendered the infinite longings of a man set loose on a
life of exile _ the loneliness and despair that so often attend a
course set by constellations. The Irish playwright Sebastian Barry
has taken those archetypal plagues of the human condition and
visited them upon a more modern hero, less celebrated and more
pacific than the first Aeneas, but equally unmoored. With its heart
in Ireland and its net flung far across the seas of geography and
time, ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty'' is a novel of
displacement _ its only anchor the confident voice that delivers
it, full of grace and the promises of hard-won wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Born in County Sligo, in the first year of the 20th century,
Eneas McNulty is the eldest son of a tailor and a seamstress; his
father is a dreamer and musician, his mother a sad-eyed woman whose
illegitimate birth has made her the subject of town gossip
throughout her life. The father, Tom, keeps gardens,
heart-stoppingly gorgeous, and these Elysian Fields present an
immediate pastoral counterpart to the mental asylum where he and
his wife first met, working ``over needles and thread'' to sew
clothes for the inmates. The life of the McNulty family, captured
in lyrical spareness in the first few pages, is prototypical:
hard-working, long-suffering, shaped by the dictates and cruelties
of politics and religion in their homeland. Even Eneas's ignorance
of these themes is part of the point: He is a child watching his
father play the piccolo and his mother dance, he is a boy stealing
fruit from the orchard with his beloved friend, Jonno. The
innocence will be his gift and his undoing. In the same way he
fails to understand the rumors that follow his mum on their
shopping trips, he is unaware of the sometimes villainous
intricacies of town politics _ the factions of rebellion and
nationalism, the arrival of the brutal Black and Tans _ as he grows
up. He will not be immune.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty'' is the story of an innocent
man's fate _ the collision of good intention with the thunderstorms
of the gods _ but it is Sebastian Barry's iridescent prose that
coalesces this narrative, that gives it a lush sensibility at least
as defining as the plot itself. In the beginning of the novel, this
richness is almost off-putting. Eneas's story feels overtly mythic
from its opening pages, with its fecund metaphors of paradise and
hell, its hovering edifices of church and state. The accompanying
fear is that Eneas himself will be eclipsed, his character undone
by the riptides of classical gravity, or by the quieter waves of
Barry's inimitable style. And even though Eneas is almost always
depicted from the outside in _ through external, distanced
description rather than dialogue or inner consciousness _ his
lifelong flight (and his reaction to it) will eventually be what
determines him. The story that emerges through Barry's lens is so
cohesive, so gracefully rendered, that his words have the stony
allure of the Irish poets and the lyrical pull of an epic
storyteller.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say it will appeal to the more plot-demanding.
Reaching for the archetypal heartbreak of a banished soul, the tale
of Eneas's estrangement from his homeland is necessarily anecdotal
and even picaresque; what triumphs, finally, is the inner compass
of the man himself _ guided by the guileless decency that got him
into such trouble to begin with. Having joined the British Merchant
Navy as a boy, Eneas returns to a post-World War I Ireland in the
midst of its own rebellion. With the innocence of other ``lost men,
ordinary fellas from the back farms of Ireland, fools and flotsam
and youngsters without an ounce of sense or understanding,'' he
joins the Royal Irish Constabulary. Which will soon enough be
connected to their murderous defenders, the Auxiliaries, or Tans,
who will casually kill any backroads hero looking to free Ireland.
Jonno, the roughhousing boy who gave Eneas half the joy of his
childhood, is on the other side, the patriots murmuring the name of
Michael Collins in secret meetings. When Eneas finds himself
witness to the murder of a good-hearted, old-school policeman, he
resigns his post and disavows the violence of both sides _ refusing
to help Jonno and the rebels assassinate a key member of the Tans.
</P>
<P>
   This pacifist stubbornness effectively blacklists Eneas for
life. The death warrant on his head _ he's basically scapegoated as
a traitor _ is reissued over the decades, every time he returns to
Sligo to see his family or renegotiate his fate. So begins a life
of exile: ``alone, hated, but human on the ravelling road.''
Working on a herring boat off the coast of Scotland, he sees a ship
full of Jews being returned to Germany after every port they
approached had turned them away. ``For what is the world without
rescue,'' thinks Eneas, ``but a wasteland and a worthless peril?''
And then he is headed to France, his uniform bearing the stripes of
a sergeant major, part of the King's army trying to save the fields
of France from Hitler.
</P>
<P>
   On a beach that will go down in history as Dunkirk, he loses his
footing and almost his mind. Fear has driven Eneas for years; he
has learned to live with the taste of it, has slept in its shadows
all over the world. He is a man not so much diminished by fear as
defined by it, and his courage lies in his ability to coexist with
such terror, rather than overcome it. The reappearance of a
friendly stranger on the road _ he's a version of Aeneas's faithful
Achates _ will give tether to his life, will make the years and the
loneliness bearable, both for him and for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Whereabouts of Eneas McNulty'' is a beautiful story,
though its beauty creeps over you stealthily at first, like morning
fog. And certainly it's an idiosyncratic novel, with its prose as
rich as those Elysian gardens of Old Tom McNulty, its time lines as
sketchy and seemingly random as history itself. Its legacy is the
portrait of a wounded and yet untainted hero, his heart broken
irreparably but his pockets full of stars.

BASEBALL FAMILY HONORS A GREAT SHORTSTOP, BELATEDLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The speech was short. Short and bittersweet.
Short and bittersweet, with so many things left unsaid,
unexplained, undone.
</P>
<P>
   The later in the day it got, the more suffocatingly sad the
words that National League President Leonard Coleman spoke into the
microphone became. Coleman could offer no personal touches, and
certainly no personal remembrances, about the first player inducted
Sunday afternoon into the baseball Hall of Fame Class of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody had to stand up on behalf of George Stacey Davis, who,
before a flying Dutchman named Honus Wagner came along, was the
standard-bearer for shortstops. By default, that somebody was
Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``As evidenced by the fact that I'm accepting this award for
him, no family member could be located,'' Coleman said. ``So in a
way, baseball was _ and is _ George Davis' family. And as George
sits resting with the Father, he will hopefully feel a great sense
of pride that his family has granted him the highest distinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorgeous George Davis last played in a major league game 89
seasons ago. Davis escaped the textile mills of Cohoes, N.Y., made
it to the big leagues, made it to the World Series, made it through
20 seasons, made it big.
</P>
<P>
   And for what?
</P>
<P>
   Davis had been in a psychiatric hospital for two years _
sentenced to a slow, surreal syphilis death when baseball opened a
shrine to its best and brightest. Ty Cobb was in the inaugural Hall
of Fame Class of 1936. Babe Ruth. Walter Johnson. Wagner. Christy
Mathewson, who didn't live long enough to see the day he'd be
remembered for as long as bases are 90 feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   When Mathewson failed to revolutionize pitching the moment he
arrived in the majors, the owner of the New York Giants wanted him
to try the outfield. The Giants' manager, who happened to be the
star shortstop, would have no part of such a scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Mathewson became beloved as ``The Big Six.'' Life gave Davis the
Deep Six, not even giving him the courtesy of a decent burial.
Davis has been in a pine box _ and without a headstone _ since
1940. He left behind no children, no one who loved him enough to
pass on his memory to descendants of future generations.
</P>
<P>
   There was no mistaking the pride in the voice of Wilber Rogan as
he accepted a Hall of Fame plaque on behalf of his father.
``Bullet'' Joe Rogan won 113 games and batted .343 in the Negro
Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally,'' Wilber Rogan said, ``people ask me two questions
when they ask about my dad: where did he get the name ``Bullet''
from, and who was faster, him or Satchel Paige? My answer is, `I
don't know.' But I do know that when Satchel was on the mound, he
needed a designated hitter. When my dad was on the mound, he batted
in the cleanup spot.''
</P>
<P>
   The late Larry MacPhail made the Hall of Fame after an
innovative career as an executive with the Brooklyn Dodgers and New
York Yankees _ he brought night games to the major leagues. On
Sunday, Lee MacPhail Jr. culminated a 45-year baseball career by
joining his father in the Hall of Fame. Larry and Lee are the first
father-and-son team enshrined in Cooperstown. Lee's son Andy is
president of the Chicago Cubs. Lee's grandson, Lee, is scouting
director for the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father was brilliant,'' said Lee MacPhail, who was the
American League president from 1974 to 1983. ``He was colorful. He
was creative. He was dynamic. He was innovative. I could go on for
some time. I was none of those things.''
</P>
<P>
   What Lee MacPhail is now is one of 59 living Hall of Famers.
Considering how membership in the Hall of Fame is up to 237, that
makes him one of the truly lucky few. Larry Doby knows. Doby is 63.
He was the first African American to play in the American League,
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Doby helped the Cleveland Indians win a World
Series. Those were the days when a picture of Doby and a white
pitcher, Steve Gromek, locked in a triumphant embrace was
considered a significant sociological development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I've got, everything my family has got, we got it
from baseball,'' Doby said. If somebody had told me 51, 52 years
ago that I would be standing here being honored by the Hall of
Fame, I wouldn't have believed it. But thank God I've lived long
enough. I sure do appreciate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Don Sutton got into the Hall of Fame the fifth year he was
eligible. It took voters that long to appreciate a body of work
that included 324 victories and nary a missed start in 23 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've wanted this for over 40 years,'' Sutton said. ``So why am
I standing here shaking like a leaf? I think part of it is because
I'm standing in front of some of the people who were the greatest
artists in a wonderful business that I've ever seen before.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if you don't feel an aura that's almost spiritual when you
walk through the Hall of Fame and when you stand with these people,
then check tomorrow's obituary: You're in it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Sutton eloquently thanked an array of people who made a
difference in his life, his 20-month-old daughter obliviously
fingered a small box of Cheerios. Jacqueline Sutton was born 16
weeks early. Doctors gave her a one in 100 chance of surviving. She
spent 12 weeks in intensive care. She has had two eye operations
and a double-hernia surgery. She taught her father that there is
more to life than baseball and its wonders.
</P>
<P>
   ``With apologies to Lou Gehrig,'' Sutton said, ``I'm the
luckiest man on the face of the Earth. I have everything in life
that I've ever wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   George Davis ended up with nothing but a plaque and belated
recognition. He left so many things unsaid, unexplained, undone.

BASS ARE BACK ON THE BEACH

   Like religion, there are many paths but one truth. As Klinger
mentioned, some will just use bait, blood worms, pile worms,
anchovies, even cut fillets of sardine, cast it out at a favorite
hole, and even bring a lawn chair, waiting for a bite. Others take
different approach, reading their tide books, fishing the two hours
after the top of the tide, making long-distance casts with metal
jigs and spoons such as the 3 1/2-ounce Krocadile, chrome with the
lime-green stripe, or Hopkins, Kastmasters or Miki jigs.
</P>
<P>
   Others go the extra mile. Some daredevils will venture out on
the rocky points, then cast huge floating wood plugs called Pencil
Poppers, where strikes from 20-pound bass can come right on the
surface, sometimes within 10 feet. This can be dangerous, where a
rogue wave can sweep an unsuspecting angler right into the sea.
</P>
<P>
   Party boats from San Francisco, Berkeley and Emeryville, all
with live anchovies for bait, are also making daily trips to the
beach, and the scores have been mind-boggling, with 2-fish limits
of striped bass often caught so fast that the boats have time to
also fish for halibut, rockfish and sometimes even salmon.
</P>
<P>
   The Huck Finn out of Emeryville, for instance, reported 84
striped bass (limits) to 21 pounds, plus a bonus of 20 halibut to
22 pounds for 42 people.
</P>
<P>
   The scene of excited anglers scrambling along the beach could
make for a mural with poetic qualities. But the results are as
concrete as the roads you drive on _ the bass are back on the
beach.

 DeBARTOLO IS KEY TO NEW STADIUM COMPLEX FOR 49ERS  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CHUCK FINNIE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Eddie DeBartolo, the part owner of the San
Francisco 49ers who personally financed a campaign for a new
stadium, is now the major obstacle to the deal going forward, two
sources close to the team's parent company said.
</P>
<P>
   The reversal of roles for DeBartolo _ from stadium-project
patron to deal breaker _ comes because he holds a written agreement
giving him 10 percent ownership of the proposed $525 million
stadium and shopping mall project, the two sources said.
</P>
<P>
   And DeBartolo is holding the mall developer involved in the
project, the Mills Corp., to the written agreement signed last year
giving him a separate share of the development, the two sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   With DeBartolo taking 10 percent of the earnings, the sources
said, the stadium and mall wouldn't be worth the investment for the
49ers' parent company, the Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. or the Mills
Corp. of Arlington, Va.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the stadium deal crashes, it will be because he refused to
release Mills,'' said one of the sources. Both sources spoke on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo and his sister, Denise DeBartolo York, own DeBartolo
Corp., which based in Youngstown, Ohio. If DeBartolo agrees to
dissolve his 1997 agreement with Mills, he would still stand to
gain financially from the project, because it would be a joint
development of the DeBartolo Corp. and Mills.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, however, DeBartolo has refused to give up the
ownership stake after putting up most of the $2.4 million spent on
last year's successful campaign to convince voters to approve using
municipal bonds for the construction of the new complex.
</P>
<P>
   Financial disclosures from the June 1997 election show $2
million in loans to the stadium campaign from trust accounts held
in the name of DeBartolo's three daughters _ Lisa, Tiffanie and
Nicole.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo didn't return a telephone message seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   A message left for Laurence Siegel, Mills' chief executive
officer, also was not returned.
</P>
<P>
   Doubts have dogged the project planned for Candlestick Point
since June 3, 1997, when city voters narrowly approved $100 million
in city bonds for the $325 million stadium and land-use changes for
a $200 million mall, called Candlestick Mills, to be built next
door.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1997, DeBartolo stepped down as chairman of the
49ers and as a director of the DeBartolo Corp. when he became a
target of a federal investigation into alleged influence-peddling
in a Louisiana riverboat casino venture. DeBartolo has not been
indicted in connection with the case.
</P>
<P>
   In January, DeBartolo's sister, who is chairwoman of the
DeBartolo Corp., issued a two-page statement that appeared to
further darken the stadium and mall project's viability.
</P>
<P>
   The statement cited new estimates for the project suggesting
costs had ballooned by $200 million, and the company directors had
voted to slow down ``and could not proceed ... until those issues
were resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   In February, financial information the Mills Corp. reported to
the Securities and Exchange Commission showed sales tax revenue
collected by the city from Candlestick Mills would fall far short
of what would be needed to cover the annual debt service on city
bonds for the project.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials say the project is alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``We ... remain committed to trying to make this thing work so
that in 2003 we are not only hosting the Super Bowl (at the new
stadium), but playing in it,'' said Larry Thrailkill, who became
interim president of the 49ers last week after Carmen Policy
resigned.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL;

</P>
<P>
   National Football League Commissioner Paul Tagliabue promised
San Francisco it would host the league's championship game in 2003,
and be in a regular rotation for future games, as an inducement to
voters to approve the new stadium.
</P>
<P>
   As a first step toward obtaining approval for the project, the
DeBartolo Corp. has said it would have an environmental impact
report on the stadium and mall completed by September. Meeting that
deadline is imperative if the stadium is to be built in time for
the 2003 Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   But to put the financing package together, DeBartolo must give
up his separate 10 percent ownership stake, one of the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't, the source said, Mills could balk at going
forward for reasons other than having to share earnings with
DeBartolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gets back to the issue of a public corporation,'' said the
source, citing the investigation in Louisiana and the possibility
Mills shareholders might blanch at a joint venture with him. As a
publicly held company, the source said, ``you have to go into
things that are squeaky clean.''

   SCI-BEETLES (Undated) _ Despite a longstanding fascination with
beetles, biologists have been able to do little more than speculate
about how the 330,000 known species have come to dominate the
living world. Now a study in the latest issue of Science says that
the secret to the diversity of beetles lies in what they eat. Those
groups of beetles that long ago evolved to eat flowering plants
spun off thousands of species, many more than those beetles that
continued to eat more primitive and less diverse plants. By
feasting on flowering plants _ which widely diversified _ the
beetles were apparently able themselves to produce many species. By
Carol Kaesuk Yoon. (1375 words)

   With color graphic.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-WOMEN-AGGRESSION (Undated) _ Researchers are discovering
that, in contrast to the usual stereotypes, aggression among girls
and women may sometimes mirror or even exaggerate those seen in
boys and men. In dozens of studies of physical hostility in
heterosexual relationships, a psychologist at the University of
Central Lancashire in Great Britain has found that although women
sustain more serious and visible injuries than men during domestic
disputes, they are overall no less likely than men to resort to
physical aggression during an argument with a sexual partner. By
Abigail Zuger.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTE-MINSKY (Undated) _ Dr. Marvin Minsky, 71, a
rumpled-looking man who wears shirts mended together with masking
tape, is professor of computer science at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology and one of the world's leading theorists of
artificial intelligence. In the late 1950s, Minsky and a
collaborator founded a research program that would evolve into the
MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. A conversation with Minsky.

   SCI-INTERSEX-SURGERY (Undated) _ In spite of all the medical
advances, unusual anatomies _ specifically those born with
ambiguous sexual organs _ generally cannot be fixed in any
significant way without significant risk, and that risk, when
medically unnecessary, should be approved by the person at risk. By
Alice Dreger. (1600 words)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-GRANDPARENTS-STRESS (Undated) _ For many grandparents,
joyful dates with the grandchildren have been replaced by the
responsibility of full-time child care. And that is taking its
toll. They are suffering from problems like depression, anxiety,
high blood pressure, alcoholism and strokes that doctors link in
part to the stress of being parents all over again, this time under
far more difficult circumstances than the first time around. By
Susan Gilbert. (1350 words)

</P>
<P>
   SCI-HUMAN-FOSSILS (Undated) _ An analysis of African fossils,
including a few new specimens, has revealed a puzzling anatomical
difference between two major species of the early human family, one
from southern and the other from eastern Africa. The discoverers of
the difference suggest that the evolution of the human body thus
was more complicated than previously understood, possibly requiring
some rearrangement of branches on the family tree. By John Noble
Wilford.

<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ Are cheap PCs a good deal? Or
are they last year's technologies, at the brink of obsolescence
even as they come out of the box? It depends on a number of
factors, of course. The cheapest machines, those that are now
flirting with a $500 sticker price, are generally built around
end-of-the-line chips and bare minimum configurations. But some of
the $1,000 models today are surprisingly robust, certainly for the
common applications of word processing and Internet cruising. By

BERKELEY CHURCH WANTS CITY TO UNLOAD ITS STOCKS IN GUNMAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VENISE WAGNER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Members of a Roman Catholic Church
congregation here are urging the city of Berkeley to divest its
holdings in companies that manufacture firearms or ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day we see the headlines,'' said Paula Hollowell-Dhar, a
member of the Newman Hall Holy Spirit parish. ``We've seen too much
violence, and our leaders, Congress, haven't done an effective job
of limiting the flow of weapons in our society.''
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign organized by the church's Social Justice
Committee, Hollowell-Dhar is gathering names for a petition asking
the Berkeley City Council to research its investments and divest
from companies dealing in guns or ammo.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200 church members signed the petition Sunday during a
meeting immediately following Mass. Hollowell-Dhar and Frank
Lucido, a board member of the Physicians for Social Responsibility,
gave a presentation at the meeting on gun violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to do something more effective to halt the flow of
weapons in our society,'' Hollowell-Dhar said. ``Gun manufacturers
have resisted measures to have more quality control. In our
society, prescription drugs, even children's pajamas, are
regulated. Weapons are not in any way regulated. We feel that
Congress is too beholden to the National Rifle Association.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Michael McGarry, pastor at Newman Parish, said it was
only coincidental that the petition drive followed the incident at
the U.S. Capitol Friday in which two guards tried to stop a gunman
from entering the building. The U.S. Capitol police officers were
shot dead and the gunman and a tourist were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began more as an educational effort, McGarry said,
to raise awareness of social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Social Justice Committee focuses on clear weapons,
gun violence and welfare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are quite surprised how eagerly and positively people have
responded,'' McGarry said, adding that the church may now take the
campaign to another level and encourage other churches and
religious centers to join in.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley Mayor Shirley Dean said she would support the church's
proposal.

BURMESE MILITARY'S DIRTY MISSION? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS BERNSTEIN AND LESLIE KEAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the decade since they seized power and renamed the country
Myanmar, Burma's military rulers have become increasingly dependent
on the use of forced labor and torture to maintain that power,
build the country's infrastructure, and carry out its war against
stubborn resistance by ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Now, evidence is increasing that the Burmese army is using
another tool of war against minority populations: rape.
</P>
<P>
   The use of rape as a weapon in ethnic conflict is not uncommon;
it's been documented in Bosnia, Rwanda, and, most recently,
Indonesia. But such occurrences in Burma on a vast scale have
received little attention, in part because the rapes have been
perpetrated in inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
   The US State Department reported this year that Burmese troops
``continued to impress women for military porterage duties, and
there were many reports of rape of ethnic minority women by
soldiers.'' According to the United Nations Special Rapporteur on
Myanmar (Burma), government troops have been abducting ``increasing
numbers of women, including young girls and the elderly'' and
subjecting them to rape and other abuses. The Burmese Women's Union
alleges that ``women have been raped in an organized and systematic
way'' by the army.
</P>
<P>
   A civil lawsuit filed on behalf of Burmese citizens in a US
federal court in 1996 targeted the Burmese military junta and two
oil companies -- Unocal Corp., then based in Los Angeles, and Total
of France -- for abuses allegedly committed during construction of
a natural gas pipeline in Burma, charging that ``girls and women
have been raped in the presence of family members.''
</P>
<P>
   The court, which ruled last year that Unocal and Total could be
held liable for rapes committed by their military partner, will
hear the case next year; the junta was dropped as a defendent
because the court said it had no jurisdiction over a foreign
government.
</P>
<P>
   The UN Commission on Human Rights says women most likely to be
raped are refugees, internally displaced women, and women belonging
to ethnic minorities or the political opposition. Rapes by the
military typically occur during raids on villages; when women are
abducted for forced labor; during encounters with victims of forced
relocations in the jungle; and in coerced marriages.
</P>
<P>
   Rape is systematically being used by Burma's military as part of
a policy of ethnic cleansing, according to interviews with human
rights workers and exiled pro-democracy officials. Bolstering those
contentions is a new report by EarthRights International, a legal
rights group based in Washington and Thailand, that accuses Burma's
military of ``the savage domination of women outside the scope of
acceptable wartime conduct.''
</P>
<P>
   The report also says that ``the violent sexual abuse of ethnic
Burmese women at the hands of the military occurs in epidemic
proportions.''
</P>
<P>
   Activists are urging the UN Special Rapporteur on Violence
against Women to investigate the claims of systematic rape.
</P>
<P>
   Thaung Tun, deputy chief of mission at the Burmese embassy in
Washington, denies there is anything to investigate. ``It is hardly
possible for rape to occur in Myanmar on a policy basis. Maybe on
an individual basis. But if it happens, there are laws in place,
and people would be punished.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of Burma's soldiers are teenagers, often abducted by the
army.
</P>
<P>
   According to EarthRights, they are given little food, forbidden
contact with their families, and forced to beat each other for
punishment. Abused physically and humiliated every day, the young
recruits are then set loose among the ethnic minorities they have
been indoctrinated to believe are ``the people's enemy'' and
``internal destructionists.''
</P>
<P>
   Many ethnic leaders and pro-democracy activists claim that the
violence against women is directly related to the military's goal
of wiping out all ethnic resistance, even if it means genocide
against a particular minority.
</P>
<P>
   One widely circulated document -- whose origin remains
unverified -- appears to lend credence to the claims that rape is a
conscious tool of war in Burma. Marked ``top secret'' and dated
only a few weeks after the military takeover in 1988, the document
is addressed to ``All Great Ruling Burmans'' and outlines a policy
of ``blood mixing'' and ``Burmanization'' of ethnic minorities -- a
reference to the process by which Burmans, who now represent
two-thirds of Burma's population, could become more dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The document says ``the easiest way to implement these ideas is
to occupy (marry or impregnate) women who are not Burman,'' for
which it offers a financial reward. ``We must deviously attack
those who are not Burman in economic as well as social ways,'' the
document states.
</P>
<P>
   In Burma, children are considered to bear the ethnicity of the
father only.
</P>
<P>
   Burmese opposition leader Sein Win -- an elected member of the
Burmese parliament who now heads the country's government in exile
-- believes the document originated in the defense ministry's
department of psychological warfare. ``Regardless of the source or
intent of this document, it accurately represents an ethnic
cleansing policy of the Burmese military,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt that the widespread rapes by troops are
fueled by the policies expressed in this document.''

   U Bo Hla Tint, a minister of the government in exile, says he
was present in Burma when officials in Karen state heard the text
of the document during routine monitoring of radio communications
between two Burmese military commanders. Ka Hsaw Wa, a veteran
Karen human rights investigator who organizes fact-finding missions
for Human Rights Watch, says he encountered the ``Burmanization''
document in the Shan, Karen, and Karenni areas, where his sources
retrieved it from Burman soldiers and outposts.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is impossible to gather precise statistics about the
incidence of rape as a tool of the Burmese military --
geographical, military, and cultural barriers make that impossible,
say human rights workers -- anecdotal evidence continues to mount.
</P>
<P>
   In April, Amnesty International reported that a 30-year-old
mother, Nang Ing, was raped by three soldiers who accused her of
giving rice to the insurgents. After the assault, they poured
boiling water over her. She died three days later.
</P>
<P>
   In another village, a woman named Naing Mai was raped over five
days by military personnel. She was then burned to death, according
to the account that local farmers, who watched from hiding places,
later gave Amnesty International.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report last month from the Shan Human Rights
Foundation, Aye Nang, another young mother of three, was raped by
troops on March 5 in the village of Wan Pek. She was then stabbed
four times in the chest and buried in a shallow grave, uncovered by
villagers three days later.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Green, staff lawyer with the New York-based Center for
Constitutional Rights, is convinced that the Burmese military is
guilty of crimes against humanity as defined by the UN war-crimes
tribunal in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
   The tribunal, set up for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, has
declared rape a war crime.
</P>
<P>
   ``The facts presented in (the EarthRights report) indicate that
these acts of violence against women are both widespread and
systematic, that there is a pattern of rape, and that civilians are
targeted for political reasons or because they are part of a
certain ethnic group,'' says Green, who is a cocounsel in the
lawsuit against Unocal and Total.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a growing acceptance that rape is not just a form of
humiliating treatment but is an extreme form of violence and should
be regarded as torture.''

 SHOULD CHURCHES `CHANGE' HOMOSEXUALS, OR MAKE THEM WHOLE?

Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative CONNIE

 By DIANA BUTLER BASS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    In recent weeks, newspaper ads across the country have featured
gay men and lesbian women proclaiming, ``You can change. I'm living
proof.''
 &HT;    The advertisements, sponsored by a variety of conservative
Christian organizations, appeared in the wake of remarks made by
football star Reggie White and Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.). Both men
-- themselves conservative Christians -- called homosexuality a sin
in terms offensive to many Americans.
 &HT;    The ads liken homosexuality to a sickness -- if not a sin -- and
highlight the religious right's leading issue in the upcoming
elections: moral ``degeneracy'' as evidenced by gay rights.
 &HT;    Can homosexuals change? The political debate -- fuelled by moral
and religious convictions -- regarding homosexuality centers on the
question whether the disposition issues from nature or nurture.
 &HT;    If gay men and lesbian women can change, then homosexuality must
be an environmental condition (usually one involving moral choice)
and can be cured. If they can not, then homosexuality might very
well be biologically inherited -- like skin color or gender -- and
demands legal protection against discrimination.
 &HT;    The religious right insists homosexuality is a product of
environment; the pro-gay and lesbian lobby insists it is
biological. One says it is inherently sinful; the other says it is
no more sinful than being African American or female.
 &HT;    Attempting to control the political damage caused by Lott's
remarks, Republican Party chairperson Jim Nicholson commented, ``I
don't know that we fully understand very much about the sources of
homosexuality or if there is a way to alter that. I've talked to
people in both the scientific and theological communities, and they
don't seem to be very clear about it.''
 &HT;    Not just politicians and theologians, Jim. Most Americans seem
confused whether homosexuality is a sexual preference or sexual
orientation.
 &HT;    Over the years, I've known a few people who changed. Often, they
engaged in homosexual behavior out of curiosity or as a result of a
particular situation such as abuse by a member of the opposite sex.
Through therapy or religious conversion, they became straight and
went on to live successfully as heterosexual mates and parents. For
these people, Christian healing ministries -- such as Exodus
International -- work.
 &HT;    But I've known many more people who could not change although
they struggled for years to do so. One friend spent countless hours
trying to be ``talked out'' of his desires by his Christian
classmates and a Baptist pastor; another repeatedly committed
himself to celibacy; another wrestled with his call to ministry;
yet another shot himself during his freshman year at college.
 &HT;    They would have changed if they could have. Anxious and afraid,
none ``wanted'' to be gay and each availed himself to treatment
options offered through churches. However, the treatments sickened
their spirits by increasing guilt, self-doubt, or self-hatred. Only
through accepting themselves as homosexuals did these men finally
find healing. It was not a matter of choice, it was a matter of
being.
 &HT;    I do not know the latest scientific research on sexuality.
Common sense and personal observation, however, point to the
logical conclusion that there is no single source for sexual
orientation. Sexuality is an intimately complex matter and sources
of sexual identity and expressions are multiple -- emerging from
both experience and biology. Sexuality is not simply a moral choice
or genetic predisposition. This is about human love and longing. It
is not the purview of politicians; this is the realm of poets.
 &HT;    So, where should our churches and synagogues stand in relation
to human sexuality? Religion should not be in the business of
making people straight; religion should make people whole.
 &HT;    Faith communities should mend sexual brokenness in whatever form
it takes. The heterosexual community is riddled with abuse,
pornography, addiction and promiscuity. From the White House to
Madison Avenue, our culture is mired in sexual sickness promoted --
in large part -- by greedy, ratings-hungry heterosexuals.
 &HT;    My homosexual neighbors living a faithful family life do not
worry me. The contempt displayed for the beauty and intimacy of
sexuality in the movies, television, and advertising does.
Homosexuals do not need to change. America does.
 &HT;    In the midst of this sickness, churches must promote sexual
wholeness. Wholeness means that homosexuals must be who God made
them to be; heterosexuals must be who God made them to be.
Wholeness means expressing our sexual selves with maturity,
integrity, compassion, mutuality, and commitment. Gay, straight, or
in-between, we all can and should strive for God's wholeness in our
lives and relationships.
 &HT;    Curing our sex-sick culture is not a political crusade -- nor a
call for Victorian prudery. Rather, it is the work of people
seeking wholeness in the context of faith and modelling a better
way to be human for the sake of our children.

KIDS, AND PARENTS, CAN READ THESE WACKY TALES FOR FUN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JANE P. MARSHALL 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Too hot for a lemonade stand. Too late to get swimsuit skinny.
Too impatient to read ``Ulysses,'' last week named the best
English-language book of the century.
</P>
<P>
   How about a good story?
</P>
<P>
   Even better, a silly story for the whole family. Read it aloud.
Laugh together. Talk about the pictures. But don't think too much.
It's too hot.
</P>
<P>
   These good-time picture books are some of the most fun stories
of summer:
</P>
<P>
   Put two talents like Audrey Wood and Mark Teague together and
the results are better than anything Disney ever dreamed of ``Sweet
Dream Pie'' (Blue Sky, $15.95) is crazy.
</P>
<P>
   Ma and Pa Brindle have a secret. It's Ma's pie. Eat some and
dream. It's the pie that is sweet, not the dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Pa wants pie. Ma says, ``Last time I made that pie you ate too
much.'' She agrees to get the special pan and bowl out of the attic
and make pie. ``But if things get out of hand, don't blame me.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, things get out of hand. The huge pie affects the
whole neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Wood's stories always twist and turn in fanciful ways. Teague's
art is as bold and sweet as Ma's pie. Together they can fill a
summer evening with giggles.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Yucka Drucka Droni'' (Scholastic, $15.95) is a tongue
twister of a story that must be read aloud to be appreciated. If no
one is around, read it aloud to yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Even the book-jacket note on the creators of the book is silly:
``In search of exotic places, Vladimir Radunsky, the great-grandson
of Humpty-Dumpty, and his wife and constant traveling companion,
Eugenia (the famous ventriloquist), found themselves in Brooklyn,
New York.''
</P>
<P>
   The story _ if it can be called a story _ is about brothers
Yucka, Yucka-Drucka and Yucka-Drucka-Droni. They meet three sisters
and get married. That is the entire plot.
</P>
<P>
   The art is a creative marvel and establishes the outrageous
context for the brothers and their tale. It's all more fun than a
swimming hole near the hayfield.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rod Clement wrote and drew ``Grandpa's Teeth'' (HarperCollins,
$14.95), a mystery that doesn't threaten Joan Lowery Nixon or P.D.
James but does offer a rollicking good time and no red herrings.
</P>
<P>
   Grandpa discovers his teeth have been stolen. A detective
investigates, a TV show called ``Unsolved Crimes'' calls, and all
the townsfolk grin (so their own teeth will show and prove their
innocence).
</P>
<P>
   No robber is found, but the townspeople get so tired of smiling
that they pitch in to buy new teeth.
</P>
<P>
   Clement's drawings are as wacky as his story.
</P>
<P>
   Is the culprit ever found? Well, kinda. And that's all I'm
saying.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The Old Woman and the Wave`` (DK Ink, $15.95), written and
illustrated by Shelley Jackson, is a whimsical story with a very
serious message. An old woman has lived in her cottage her whole
life. Hovering over the house is a wave.
</P>
<P>
   The wave loves her, but the old woman fears the wave. The wave
offers fish; the old woman throws them back. The wave offers her
beautiful colors; the old woman scoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The story is an existential metaphor. At last, the old woman
ventures to the top of the wave. The experience opens her eyes and
liberates her from her fears. The wave is not an end but a
beginning. It is not a danger but an opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lesson, the story entertains and enthralls. Jackson
also tells the story through her art _ collages created from paint
and bits of maps, words and musical notes, all calculated to give
clues to the story and move it along.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Zelda and Ivy'' (Candlewick, $15.99), fox sisters, are a
worthy match for George and Martha, hippo friends. The book is
three short stories involving Zelda, the bossy older sister, and
Ivy, the more vulnerable little sister. They take turns being the
wise sister.
</P>
<P>
   Siblings will recognize their bond, both mischievous and loving.
Author and illustrator Laura McGee Kvasnosky knows about sisters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tina loved chocolate more than anything in the world.'' What a
beginning for a picture book. Maybe the kids can relate to the
topic. Probably the adult reading the story to the kids can.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``Chocolatina'' (BridgeWater, $15.95), by Erik Kraft, is
Tina's nickname. The bad guy in this story is Mrs. Ferdman, the
health teacher, who insists on teaching the kids about good food by
using the phrase ``you are what you eat.''
</P>
<P>
   Chocolatina thinks this isn't a bad idea. One morning she
awakens to find she is chocolate. The antics are fun, the story
silly and the moral _ yes, there is a bit of one _ not
heavy-handed.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Brunkus' illustrations are lively and full of character.
Pass the fudge.
</P>

SCIENCE, LUCK COMBINE FOR WHAT MAY BE AN AIDS DRUG
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANDREW CAFFREY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a typically hot, muggy day in September 1987 when Arnold
Arboretum botanist John Burley slogged through the swampy forest of
the Malaysian state of Sarawak in northern Borneo, seeking nature's
medicines for killer diseases.
</P>
<P>
   On assignment for the National Cancer Institute, Burley's team
was randomly cutting specimens, and at first he almost passed by an
ordinary-looking tree, recognizing it was from a family of plants
that had been extensively collected. ``I almost didn't collect
it,'' Burley recalled recently. ``I thought it was unlikely to be
of interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the fates that guide the hands of science.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But for Burley's chance cutting, researchers might never have
stumbled upon a substance that could become an important weapon
against AIDS. The 2 pounds of twigs, leaves, bark, and branches
that Burley collected from Calophyllum lanigerum contain the
substance calanolide A, which in the test tube has proved 100
percent effective in killing the mutant HIV viruses that develop a
resistance to the current pharmaceutical wonders known as triple
drug cocktails. Whether calanolide A's AIDS-fighting properties can
work in humans, of course, remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   The first round of laboratory trials _ in which the drug's
toxicity to humans is determined _ has just been successfully
completed. Sometime in the next few weeks, the pharmaceutical firm
MediChem Research Inc., in a joint venture with the Sarawak
government, will begin trials of calanolide A with HIV-infected
patients. If, as company officials believe, the initial results are
positive, then MediChem will test calanolide A in the popular drug
cocktails that have extended the lives of HIV-infected patients.
</P>
<P>
   The story of the discovery of calanolide A and Calophyllum
lanigerum, and of another, closely related tree that seems to be
producing an equally successful drug, is one of scientific
sleuthing and serendipity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole system is almost a game of chance,'' says Dr. Gordon
Cragg, who oversees the tropical plant initiative for the National
Cancer Institute's Natural Products branch. ``And you win some, and
you lose some.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
_____ &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although it might seem natural now, the idea to systematically
mine Mother Nature for new drugs was hardly a widely accepted
practice in the 1980s. In fact, the National Cancer Institute had
all but given up a once-ambitious initiative to scour the globe
looking for natural sources of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   But under the leadership of Drs. Michael Boyd and Cragg, the
institute revived the pursuit, and since 1986 has spent about $7
million trooping through tropical forests and collecting more than
50,000 samples. Separate initiatives by the institute are combing
through other environments, such as the marine world, looking for
natural pharmaceuticals.
</P>
<P>
   With so little known about the chemical promise of so many
plants and animals, researchers purposefully try to make their
collections as random as possible so as not to exclude plants that
seem unexceptional at first blush.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wandering around in a huge haystack equivalent, looking
for a needle,'' Burley explains, ``but not even knowing if there is
a needle to be found.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Harvesting cuttings from tropical rain forests requires a
meticulous two-step process: first, botanists collect about 2
pounds of bark, branches, leaves, stems, petals; then they take a
separate, larger cutting, a ``voucher specimen,'' preferably when
it has fruit or flowers, for mounting on a 12- by 17-inch sheet.
Both samples are then labeled in great detail, and cross-referenced
to each other.
</P>
<P>
   During this expedition, Burley estimates, he collected more than
500 samples of some 300 plant species. The bulk samples were
shipped back to the institute's lab for testing; the voucher
specimens, to the Harvard University Herbaria.
</P>
<P>
   By the standards of the rain forest, the version of Calophyllum
lanigerum that Burley almost didn't cut was a runt: a mere 25 feet,
and skinny to boot.
</P>
<P>
   But luck really was with Burley that day: The tree normally
grows in dry, rocky, elevated terrain, but Burley chanced upon one
in a swamp _ a fact that complicated matters later, when scientists
were in desperate search for more of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   After Burley bagged and labeled the requisite cuttings,
lanigerum was shipped off with dozens of other species to
Frederick, Md., where institute researchers stored the whole lot in
walk-in freezers until they could be tested.
</P>
<P>
   When researchers tested the lanigerum for its anti-cancer
properties, the results were discouraging. There were none. Then,
three years after the lanigerum was collected, researchers screened
the lanigerum extract for its AIDS-fighting potential.
</P>
<P>
   The results were positive and encouraging.
</P>
<P>
   With some determination, they telephoned the principal
investigator of the Southeast Asia expedition, Djaja Dole Soejarta,
a biologist at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and suggested
his team obtain more samples of this ``interesting'' compound.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Burley was busy with a new project in Indonesia, so Soejarta
engaged another botanist, who teamed up with the same Dyak
tribesmen who assisted Burley three years earlier, and they led him
to the location of the lanigerum.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The tree was gone. Instead, the team found themselves looking
at a stump where the tree once stood _ suggesting that a local
villager had cut it down for firewood. But no bother. Soejarta's
botanist saw other trees nearby that resembled lanigerum, made the
logical assumption they would have the same chemical compounds and
pharmaceutical potential as their cousin, and shipped off the
cuttings to the institute for what he thought would be easy
confirmation. The result was negative.
</P>
<P>
   ``That certainly put my back against the wall,'' Soejarta
recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Eeager to be in on the Next Big Thing in AIDS research, but also
driven by a sense of responsibility because he was in charge of the
expedition, Soejarta contacted Harvard biologist and Arnold
Arboretum curator Peter Stevens. Stevens is not only the world's
foremost expert on the Calophyllum tree, he is the world's only
expert. Soejarta asked Stevens to take a look at the original
cutting taken by Burley to see if they had correctly identified it.
Stevens scrutinized the distinct leaf of the lanigerum.
</P>
<P>
   There is no mistaking the tiny, finely-grained clusters of veins
that shoot off from the stem ``like grooving on an old record,''
Stevens said. Not only did he know which tree it was, but he even
knew where to find another: in downtown Singapore, in the city's
botanical gardens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I treated it rather prosaically,'' Stevens says of the
identification that had researchers on edge from Maryland to
Malaysia. ``If I hadn't spent 10 years on the group, it would have
been hell on everyone. There wouldn't be anyone else who would
know. So it's lucky I exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Soejarta himself traveled to Sarawak in March 1992,
saw the by-now rotting stump, and searched the forests in vain for
another lanigerum. Along the way, he too kept spotting other
Calophyllum species, and, refusing to go home empty-handed, began
to systematically sample those trees, too, again on the assumption
that they probably contained the same compound that so successfully
fought the AIDS virus.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; This time, Soejarta's hunch was right. Of the samples of six
different Calophyllum trees he sent back to the National Cancer
Institute, one, a variety called teysmannii, also scored the same
success in the AIDS screen as its cousin. Researchers labeled the
extract from the second tree calanolide B. MediChem, the drug
company, is just beginning trials in healthy humans to test its
toxicity.
</P>
<P>
   There are important differences between calanolide A and B that
help form one of the morals of this story, at least for the
botanists involved in the project.
</P>
<P>
   Though calanolide A appears to be the more powerful of the two
compounds, its potency when culled from lanigerum tree to lanigerum
tree is also much more erratic, making it difficult to harvest
large quantities of it from its natural source. MediChem has
perfected a synthetic reproduction of calanolide A, which means the
company doesn't need the trees anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Teysmannii, on the other hand, consistently produces calanolide
B from tree to tree, and in large quantities, making the trees a
valuable resource.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the potential medical breakthroughs, the
botanists see another benefit of their discovery: the possibility
that the trees' potential will convince governments such as
Malaysia's to stop logging their fast-disappearing rain forests.
The state of Sarawak, for example, will receive royalties and
income from the sales of calanolide A and the farming of teysmannii
trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today it happens to be AIDS and Calophyllum, but tomorrow it
could be something else, and we have to learn how to manage a
tropical rain forest sustainably,'' says the Arboretum's John
Burley. ``Use it, rather than lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the initial cutting of Calophyllum _ which is Latin
for beautiful leaf _ is on exhibit at the Hunnewell Building of the
Arboretum, as its scientists await word on the success of one of of
their more unusual endeavors into nature's drugstore.

   TWELFTH-NIGHT-SETS (New York) _ The setting for ``Twelfth
Night'' is an Oriental fantasy of the mind. As far as the eye can
see, there is a road winding through water. At the front of the
Vivian Beaumont stage, actors are lolling sybaritically, surrounded
by burning candles and incense. Nearby is a pool for swimming and
dunking. Later in the play there will be a rainstorm. In Bob
Crowley's enchanting scenic design for Nicholas Hytner's
production, water is the central motif _ more than 10,000 gallons

   TOP-NOVELS (Undated) _ With all due respect to Arthur
Schlesinger Jr., A.S. Byatt, William Styron and the others who,
acting at the behest of the Modern Library, produced a list of the
100 greatest English-language novels of the century, the truth is
that the entire endeavor is so drenched in subjectivity as to be
close to silly. Still, the purpose of the exercise was to provoke
discussion, always a good thing. So, while the conversation swirls,
here's another question that emerged from a recent conversation
duly provoked by the Modern Library list. How many of the books on
it would still be there if the selections had included works of the
19th century as well? My own quick answer to that question is ``not
that many.'' By Richard Bernstein.

   SCI-BEETLES (Undated) _ Despite a longstanding fascination with
beetles, biologists have been able to do little more than speculate
about how the 330,000 known species have come to dominate the
living world. Now a study in the latest issue of Science says that
the secret to the diversity of beetles lies in what they eat. Those
groups of beetles that long ago evolved to eat flowering plants
spun off thousands of species, many more than those beetles that
continued to eat more primitive and less diverse plants. By
feasting on flowering plants _ which widely diversified _ the
beetles were apparently able themselves to produce many species. By

NEW FOSSILS POINT BACKWARD ON HUMAN EVOLUTIONARY TRAIL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   An analysis of African fossils, including a few new specimens,
has revealed a puzzling anatomical difference between two major
species of the early human family, one from southern and the other
from eastern Africa. The discoverers of the difference suggest that
the evolution of the human body thus was more complicated than
previously understood, possibly requiring some rearrangement of
branches on the family tree.
</P>
<P>
   Writing in the current issue of the Journal of Human Evolution,
two paleoanthropologists, Dr. Henry McHenry and Dr. Lee Berger,
reported finding that Australopithecus africanus, which lived in
southern Africa, had more archaic, apelike arms and legs than the
earlier A. afarensis. That species, which lived between 3.9 and 3
million years ago in East Africa (mostly the nations of Tanzania,
Kenya and Ethiopia today) and is best known from the skeleton
popularly called Lucy, had more humanlike limbs. Both were capable
of upright walking.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what would be expected from progressive
evolution,'' the scientists said of their findings. McHenry is a
paleoanthropologist at the University of California at Davis, and
Berger is at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The australopithecines included several species of hominids
transitional between apes and humans. Since the Lucy discovery in
the early 1970s, most specialists in human origins have come to
accept the afarensis as the likely ancestral species in the lineage
leading to the human genus, Homo, about 2.5 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   For Lucy and her kind to evolve into descendants with more
apelike limbs, the scientists said, evolution would have to go
backward, which rarely happens. One possible explanation for such
an evolutionary reversal, they said, might have been to adapt to a
more arboreal environment.
</P>
<P>
   In a popular account of the findings in the August issue of
National Geographic magazine, Berger said it was more likely that
africanus did not descend from afarensis but that the two species
evolved separately. They were apparently ``sister species that
share a missing-link ancestor.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus, only one of them could have been a direct ancestor of
humans, Berger said, and africanus seemed more likely to have been
that ancestor. It had developed a larger brain and somewhat more
humanlike face and teeth than afarensis. Although the fossil
evidence is scrappy, the first members of the Homo genus, Homo
habilis, appeared to have had long arms and short legs, not unlike
africanus.
</P>
<P>
   McHenry agreed that africanus appeared to be ``close to the
ancestor of Homo.'' Throwing down the gauntlet before
paleontologists working in East Africa, Berger said, ``That
reinforces my own conviction that Homo emerged from africanus in
southern Africa and migrated north.''
</P>
<P>
   If africanus turned out to be on the main trunk of the family
tree, then afarensis would be relegated to a dead-end branch,
Berger said, culminating in A. boisei, which died out about a
million years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The analysis was based on a comparison of more than 100 fossil
bones from a limestone quarry at Sterkfontein, South Africa, and
arid badlands at Hadar, Ethiopia, where Lucy was excavated. The
bones included the skeletons of Lucy herself and a male africanus.
McHenry's main contribution was the development of a new technique
of inferring body weight and the length and diameter of limb bones
from an analysis of a tiny fragment of a joint.
</P>
<P>
   Like several other paleoanthropologists, Dr. Eric Delson of the
American Museum of Natural History in New York said he found the
research ``a very intriguing piece of work and thought-provoking,''
but cautioned that it was too early to be redrawing the family
tree. He said the fossil record for H. habilis was too scant to tie
it to the A. africanus lineage.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bernard Wood, a paleoanthropologist at George Washington
University, said the analysis of joints in determining limb sizes
was ``quite ingenious, but the results are not earth-shattering.''
He was not surprised, for instance, that the findings did not
appear to fit neatly into a pattern of progressive and linear
relationships in evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is that nature would have carried out many
experiments,'' Dr. Wood said, referring to patterns of parallel
evolution in which different lineages could arrive at different
stages of development at different times. ``We are still only
scratching the surface of the complexity of human origins,'' he
said, adding that it was unlikely the ancestor-descendant
relationships would ever be reconstructed.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having grandchildren is supposed to be a storybook experience:
snapshots of laughter and hugs, the license to indulge the little
ones with gifts and extra helpings of dessert before returning them
to Mom and Dad.
</P>
<P>
   But for growing numbers of grandparents, joyful dates with the
grandchildren have been replaced by the responsibility of full-time
child care. And doctors and other health care professionals are
just now beginning to see that the demands are taking a toll on
many grandparents' health.
</P>
<P>
   It is not just that grandparents are exhausted from chasing
after 2-year-olds and juggling after-school activities. They are
suffering from problems like depression, anxiety, high blood
pressure, alcoholism and strokes that doctors link in part to the
stress of being parents all over again, this time under far more
difficult circumstances than the first time around.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, dreams of the golden years aren't so golden,'' said
Dr. Ronald Adelman, director of the Irving Wright Center on Aging
at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
   The newly recognized problem of stress-related illnesses in
grandparent care provider was the subject of an article in June in
Internal Medicine News, a newspaper for doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am amazed at the need,'' said Susan Silverstein, a social
worker in Great Neck, N.Y., who counsels grandparents and the
grandchildren they are raising. ``A huge percentage of the
grandparents describe feelings of depression and problems with
eating and sleeping. Most attribute those problems to stress, but
whether they are purely due to stress or to a combination of stress
and physiological problems is difficult to ascertain.''
</P>
<P>
   Grandparents have always helped rear their grandchildren. But it
is when they are bringing up their grandchildren full time that
they are most likely to develop stress-related illnesses, Adelman
and others say. About 4 million children in this country live in
households headed by a grandparent, a 41 percent increase since
1992, according to the Census Bureau. Research by the American
Association of Retired Persons attributes this rise mainly to high
rates of substance abuse by parents; child abuse, neglect or
abandonment and divorce.
</P>
<P>
   These social problems leave their mark on children in the form
of depression, grief, learning disabilities and other special
needs, which add to the grandparents' financial and emotional
strain. Last fall, social workers at Mount Sinai Medical Center in
New York conducted a survey of the health of elementary school
children in East Harlem who were struggling academically and their
grandparent care providers. The survey found that 39 percent of the
children suffered from depression, 36 percent had a disorder that
involved excessive opposition to and defiance of authority, and 25
percent had developmental problems. Over half of the grandparents
had stress-related illnesses, such as high blood pressure and
depression.
</P>
<P>
   Though they may be more common among the poor, such problems are
by no means isolated to impoverished areas. They are prevalent
among the middle-class and upper-middle-class grandparents who seek
help from Grandparents Reaching Out, a support and advocacy group
for those caring for children that is based in Patchogue, N.Y.,
says Mildred Horn, the founder.
</P>
<P>
   A 68-year-old Long Island woman sobbed as she discussed the
trouble she and her husband have had raising their 17-year-old
grandson off and on since he was 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``My doctor says I'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown,'' said
the woman, who requested anonymity. ``My grandson's mother and
father were in the Marines, and his mother used drugs and took off
with another Marine when he was 2. My son took care of him for a
while, but he couldn't do it, so we took him to our house.''
</P>
<P>
   Her grandson had been caught stealing and was in danger of
failing at school, she said, attributing the problems to the
physiological effects of the mother's drug abuse during pregnancy
and the emotional fallout of her abandonment. ``We've had him to
psychiatrists,'' she said. ``My doctor wants me to go to a
psychiatrist, but I can't, moneywise.''
</P>
<P>
   It is common for grandparent care providers to neglect their own
health when, like the Long Island woman, they are living on fixed
incomes, said Margaret Hollidge, director of the Grandparents
Information Center, a national resource service based in
Washington. The center was established in 1993 by the AARP in
response to hundreds of calls and letters from grandparents
desperate for information and emotional support on raising
grandchildren, Ms. Hollidge said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandparents will often minimize their own health problems,
especially when it comes down to money,'' she said. ``Sometimes the
situation is, either I go to the dentist or my grandchild does.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when money is not an overriding factor, many grandparents
deny or play down their own symptoms for legal reasons, Ms. Horn
said. Grandparents who are seeking custody of a grandchild because
the parents are drug addicts often fear that if they admit to
health problems they will be denied custody.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, some grandparents are so driven to survive
until their grandchildren are grown that they take better care of
themselves than they did before becoming care providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They take on their health problems with a new desire to get
well,'' Ms. Silverstein said.
</P>
<P>
   As a means to this end, some grandparents said they would like
more help from their doctors in controlling stress. When Mildred
Horn suffered two minor strokes last year, she said, her internist
never discussed the possible connection with her home life and the
difficulty of supporting the two grandchildren she has been rearing
ever since her daughter was killed in a car accident 13 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But, according to Adelman, some doctors are starting to notice
grandparent care providers as a group with special health risks.
``This is a new phenomenon, and geriatricians and internists are
just becoming aware of it,'' he said. ``We need to ask our patients
more questions about their home situations.''
</P>
<P>
   The biggest source of help for grandparents rearing
grandchildren has come from the virtual explosion in support groups
in recent years. Margaret Hollidge of the AARP. Grandparents
Information Center estimated that there were 600 such groups around
the country, up from virtually none five years ago. She said that
these groups provide grandparents with a wide range of information,
including updates on discipline techniques (``What do you mean they
don't spank anymore?'' she said, was a typical question from many
grandparents) and legal aspects of custody and guardianship, as
well as a place to vent their feelings.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Silverstein, the Great Neck social worker, runs separate
support groups for grandparents and grandchildren on Long Island
through Grandparents Reaching Out. She said that the main issues
that grandparents raise were their feelings of guilt at not having
the energy or the knowledge to give their grandchildren all that
their friends have.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel a tremendous amount of incompetence,'' she said.
``They can't help their grandkids with their homework because they
don't understand computers or the type of education the kids are
getting today. Along with that, a lot of grandparents struggle with
a sense of isolation.''
</P>
<P>
   But most of the grandparents Ms. Silverstein sees are able to
overcome these obstacles because they are determined to do a good
job bringing up their grandchildren.
</P>
<P>
   She said the support groups help grandparent tap their inner
strengths. ``They say they feel better, stronger,'' she said. ``I
see a lot of grandparents coping effectively.''

THE SMART SET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Summertime, and the movies make you queasy.
</P>
<P>
   They're too loud, have too many explosions, the stars are paid
too much to not really act.
</P>
<P>
   But one of this summer's high-powered entries attempts to
deliver the seasonal thrills through drama and character instead of
overwhelming firepower. ``The Negotiator'' certainly has an ample
share of grenade blasts and SWAT team assaults. But this
Chicago-set police thriller is actually more gripping when its fine
ensemble of stage-trained actors _ Samuel L. Jackson, Kevin Spacey,
Ron Rifkin, David Morse, the late J.T. Walsh _ is shooting lines
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson plays Danny Roman, a talented but risk-prone hostage
negotiator for the Chicago police department. When he's framed for
his partner's murder, probably by colleagues in his own precinct,
he takes the complicit internal affairs inspector Niebaum (Walsh)
and several others captive in a high-rise office.
</P>
<P>
   Turning tables right and left, Roman fires his expertise at
defusing such situations back at besieging law enforcers. The only
person he'll talk seriously to is Chris Sabian (Spacey), a
negotiator from another precinct who's as deliberate as Roman is
impatient. Their exchanges _ often just two guys talking
face-to-face, or over cell phones _ are as tense and intriguing as
any glass-shattering assaults.
</P>
<P>
   ``The movie balances (action and acting), but what we're trying
to sell is the story,'' says David Hoberman, producer of the $40
million movie. ``And what captured me from the very beginning was
the story, about a hostage negotiator framed and becoming a hostage
taker. The intrigue in this movie comes from the story of an
innocent man pushed up against the wall and how he's going to
react.
</P>
<P>
   ``The story inherently has action in it. But this is also a film
that plays up to the audience, not down to the audience. I think
that's going to be a very refreshing turn for moviegoing
audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No, we're not going to sink $60 million into opening this
picture,'' laughingly says director F. Gary Gray, a former news
cameraman and award-winning music-video director whose feature
credits include the modestly budgeted hits ``Friday'' and ``Set It
Off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not one of those huge kind of action things, and we don't
want to give the audience the wrong impression. There are no
McDonald's cups with Kevin and Sam on them, they're not eating
gorditas at Taco Bell. That doesn't represent this type of film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew there were going to be bigger films out here that have
an amazing amount of action and effects and things like that. I had
to match the level of intensity created in films that are of that
size with a film that essentially boils down to two guys talking in
a room.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, but he got the right guys to do it. Spacey, who won a Best
Supporting Actor Oscar for his portrayal of the deceptively
unreliable narrator Verbal Kint in ``The Usual Suspects,'' and
Jackson, who's made an art out of dexterous trash-talking in ``Pulp
Fiction,'' ``Die Hard With a Vengeance,'' ``Jackie Brown'' and
numerous others, are arguably the strongest dramatic actors in film
today.Jackson recalls that he and Spacey were itching to work
together more extensively after sharing one major scene in the John
Grisham legal drama ``A Time to Kill.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That scene in the courtroom was a pretty magical and fun
moment for both of us, and we hoped to find something else,''
Jackson recalls. ``When `Negotiator' came up, we both read it and
ran into each other at a party the night before the Academy Awards
the year Kevin won. He said, `I'll do it if you do it,' and I said,
`I'll do it if you do it`.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with Spacey was as good as Jackson had hoped it would
be.
</P>
<P>
   ``We connect in a very real kind of way,'' Jackson says. ``Kevin
knows the rules of theatrical performance, which means that when
it's time to do what he does, he does it and I give him the
attention and the right body languages he needs. And when it's time
for you to do that, Kevin does all the right things to make that
work for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plus, he's an ensemble player. It's not just about, `Look at
me, look at me, look at me.' The fact that we both understand the
rules of engagement, in that way, we were able to find a common
ground. And he's a smart actor. When things didn't work for both of
us, we were strong enough to say that and find ways to make things
work.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, even for the most articulate of players, acting
begins with the word ``act.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This film, luckily, has a great story structure, and when I
read it, I didn't see all of the action stuff inside of it,''
Jackson reveals. ``I just saw these two guys interacting in a
really interesting way. Then, as we started to do it, all this
other stuff came up and it turned into a lucky marriage of these
two elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I liked about Danny Roman was the fact that he did use
words for a very long time, but he would make decisions about when
to stop talking and take action,'' Jackson adds, smiling slyly.
``He's very much like me, in that I know all the rules to most of
the things that I do, but sometimes those rules get in the way and
you have to find a way to circumvent them.''
</P>
<P>
   With much of his performance-directing experience having been
with the likes of rappers-turned-actors Ice Cube and Queen Latifah,
Gray prepared for working with ``Negotiator's'' demanding
perfectionists by actually attending acting classes. Still, if he
was intimidated going in, he soon became impressed with his cast's
collaborative professionalism.
</P>
<P>
   Which is not the same as saying he wasn't constantly challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``J.T. Walsh came in saying, `Hey, I'm a troublemaker. But if
there's ever a time I'm talking too much, just tell me to shut up.'
'' Gray says of the actor who died in February of a heart attack
and who was nominated for an Emmy last week for his work on TNT's
``Hope'' telepic. ``Sometimes Spacey would come to the table with
written pages of ideas, but he'd say, `This is what I think, but
you're the boss. If you disagree with some of my suggestions, I'm
just following your lead.' But I think they all wanted to be in a
smart film, especially having reputations as smart actors. No one
wanted to walk away regretting what they'd done.'' &QL;

FRIENDS HELP BOB La CATTIVA RECOVER 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JENIFER HANRAHAN 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; It's hard on a man, taking the bus when he used
to drive a red Trans Am.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes he goes down to the garage where it sits, eases in,
grips the wheel and revs the engine. In the cool darkness, the
rumble comforts him.
</P>
<P>
   He's tempted to take it out for a spin. Instead, he backs it up
a few feet, then pulls forward. He does this again and again.
</P>
<P>
   It's been hard on Bob La Cattiva, 40, since he fell off his
bicycle and hit his head against the pavement. He shattered his
skull, damaging the labyrinth of soft folds and whorls of his
brain.
</P>
<P>
   When he woke up two weeks later, he couldn't move his right
side.
</P>
<P>
   When he tried to speak, no one understood what he was trying to
say.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the thoughts were clear in his mind, he kept
repeating a single, meaningless phrase: ``A and I. You and I ...
goddammit.''
</P>
<P>
   He yelled it over and over again.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard on a man when his words come out mixed up and garbled
or not at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``It. Was. An. Accident,'' La Cattiva says, while sitting in
front of his computer, where he plays a simulated driving game,
complete with a gas pedal and steering wheel. ``I have no idea ....
what the hell happened. Riding on. OK. 7 in the morning. 8.
Whatever. OK. 7 or 7:30. I am riding this way here to go to work.
Riding along and hit me on the rear-end wheel. Hit my head.''
</P>
<P>
   The video car crashes. He guides it back onto the track and
keeps going.
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva has always loved speed. He used to pump the pedals of
his $3,000, handmade Italian racing bike as fast as he could,
logging 100,000 miles on Los Angeles streets.
</P>
<P>
   The police report says he slipped on gravel on his way from his
apartment in Studio City to work at Autoparts Unlimited in Van
Nuys.
</P>
<P>
   Paramedics found him the morning of April 30, 1996, lying
unconscious and bleeding on Oxnard Street with his feet still in
the toe clips, just a few blocks from his destination.
</P>
<P>
   A head injury happens every 10 seconds in the United States.
About half a million require hospitalization, and 70,000 to 90,000
result in long-term or permanent disability, according to the
National Institutes of Health.
</P>
<P>
   Half are caused by motor-vehicle accidents, 21 percent by falls,
12 percent by assaults and 10 percent by sports or recreational
activities. Many of the latter can be prevented by wearing a
helmet.
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva didn't have a helmet on the morning he fell.
</P>
<P>
   He can't remember what happened the day he fell, but he feels
sure it was no mere wipeout. He's certain he got clipped by a car,
but no witness came forward who saw him go down.
</P>
<P>
   Mario Vazquez, La Cattiva's co-worker, drove past the scene of
the accident on his way to work. When La Cattiva didn't show up,
Vazquez relayed his fears to the other guys that the man on the
gurney might be their friend.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard on a man's friends when one of their own gets hurt.
</P>
<P>
   They sat hunched, rubbing their temples in the waiting room of
North Hollywood Medical Center while La Cattiva underwent emergency
surgery to reduce the swelling in his brain and remove the shards
of skull that pierced the soft tissue.
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva's buddies aren't the kind of guys who cry. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   Not even when doctors said they could finally see him, with all
those tubes sticking out of his veins and a hole in his neck, his
head enlarged, his eyes swollen shut and his face bruised.
</P>
<P>
   But they are the kind of men who help without being asked,
because it never occurred to them to do anything but.
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Jauregui, 29, and Matt Trait, 29, and a few other guys
held a vigil at his bedside, taking turns to make sure someone was
always there, in case he woke up.
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui collected several thousand dollars from dozens of
Autoparts Unlimited employees to pay La Cattiva's bills and rent so
if he ever came home, he'd have a home to come to.
</P>
<P>
   They hung his photos of race cars by his bed.
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, La Cattiva spent weekends at auto races,
soaking up the smell of gasoline and grease, snapping photos of the
powerful machines, steely-eyed drivers and beauties in short shorts
and bikini tops who hung around near the pits.
</P>
<P>
   He captured speed, those thundering Indy cars zooming past, with
the rapid-fire click of a shutter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It. Is. My. Love,'' La Cattiva says.
</P>
<P>
   It had taken him a long time to find his passion.
</P>
<P>
   His mother died of breast cancer when he was 10. When his father
remarried, La Cattiva rebelled.
</P>
<P>
   He smoked Marlboro Reds. Came to California from Long Island in
'81 and got kicked out of airplane mechanic school for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   He went back to New York, then tried California a second time.
He made his father, Anthony, proud when he called to say he had
found an apartment and a job at an auto parts store.
</P>
<P>
   At Autoparts Unlimited, he worked his way up from clerk to
coordinator of purchasing and inventory. He was doing pretty well.
</P>
<P>
   Then a friend lent him her camera, and a dream developed along
with those first images.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a professional photographer.
</P>
<P>
   He shot photos for the Los Angeles Valley College newspaper and
won numerous awards for his feature and sports shots, including a
1992-93 Photographer of the Year prize for overall excellence. He
had several racing photos published in magazines and advertising
brochures.
</P>
<P>
   He had ``La Cattiva Photos'' business cards printed that he
never got to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nods `yes' to all questions. Unable to follow simple commands.
Patient (has) severely impaired comprehension and expression,'' his
medical charts said.
</P>
<P>
   He spent six weeks in the hospital, then went to a residential
care facility in Goleta, where for safety he was monitored even in
the shower.
</P>
<P>
   He hated it there. He wanted to go home.
</P>
<P>
   But first he had to prove that he could handle ``full body
dressing, grooming &AMP; hygiene, bathing &AMP; toileting.''
</P>
<P>
   Two months later, Jauregui came to get him. Driving to the
facility, he wondered if Bob was still Bob. It didn't take him long
to find out.
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva had always been stubborn, even surly at times. That's
what the guys liked about him. He was tough, unafraid. He'd shout
at rude motorists from his bike.
</P>
<P>
   Jauregui drove La Cattiva's Trans Am to a car wash. When he
turned the windshield wipers on, La Cattiva got furious, worrying
he would scratch the glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``A and I! You and I ... goddammit!'' he shouted.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, at a Taco Bell, the menu usually on the counter in
front of the register was missing. La Cattiva used those menus to
order by pointing at pictures of food.
</P>
<P>
   ``A and I! You and I ... goddammit!'' he shouted, as the counter
guy's eyes widened.
</P>
<P>
   A line formed behind them. La Cattiva wouldn't budge. He used
gestures, a few words like ``yes'' and ``no,'' until the fast-food
worker guessed the order correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Another time, the driver of a bus for the disabled upset him by
mocking his speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``He. Was. Making. Fun. Of. Me.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the driver stop and let him out on the street. Jauregui
came to pick him up.
</P>
<P>
   My name is Bob La Cattiva.
</P>
<P>
   I have a head injury.
</P>
<P>
   I cannot speak, but I can understand you.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard on La Cattiva, having to carry those survival
phrases on cards everywhere he went.
</P>
<P>
   He also took his camera everywhere he went so he could exercise
his fingers by focusing the lens, loading the film, hitting the
shutter, taking shots of faces and flowers and fire hydrants.
</P>
<P>
   If he was going to shoot race cars whizzing by at 200 mph, he
needed his right hand.
</P>
<P>
   Several times a week, he saw a speech therapist, a physical
therapist and n occupational therapist.
</P>
<P>
   He did tongue exercises: sticking it in and out, moving it from
left to right.
</P>
<P>
   He did lip exercises: puckering, smiling, kissing, opening his
mouth wide and closing it tightly.
</P>
<P>
   Then he learned to say the ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   He learned to make a grocery list by cutting out pictures of
food from coupons. He played a tape-recorded message into the phone
receiver when he needed to request a pickup from the bus for the
disabled.
</P>
<P>
   When La Cattiva started working with Tarzana speech pathologist
Lauri Aud, he was terribly frustrated, she said. The more
frustrated he became, the more times he said ``A and I,''
interspersed with the occasional simple word, like ``car.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Aud told him she was a fan of car racing, and ``his eyes
lit up,'' she said. They practiced sounds using racing terms.
``Michael Andretti.'' ``Grand Prix.'' ``Laguna Seca.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He just took off,'' Aud said.
</P>
<P>
   His occupational therapist, Raj Narula from Head Injury
Rehabilitation Services in Marina del Rey, saw another key element
to La Cattiva's recovery. He needed to get back to work.
</P>
<P>
   He couldn't use the phone or computer anymore, but he could help
keep track of inventory.
</P>
<P>
   His first day back, they greeted him with handshakes and slaps
on the back, even a few awkward man-to-man hugs.
</P>
<P>
   When someone gets sick or hurt, it's usually women who are the
care-givers. But with La Cattiva, it's been men.
</P>
<P>
   The owner of Autoparts Unlimited, John Christie Jr., takes La
Cattiva to doctor's appointments, fills out insurance forms and
wrangles over coverage.
</P>
<P>
   When La Cattiva has a seizure, which happens every few weeks,
the guys from work grab him and lie him down on his side, put a
shirt under his head and hold him while his body convulses.
</P>
<P>
   During the last one, he fell and hit his head before they caught
him. Blood trickled from the scar left by surgery in October to
cover the hole in his skull with a plate.
</P>
<P>
   Cesar Salazar put his face close to La Cattiva's and prayed into
his ear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senor Jesus, este es tu hijo. Y yo vengo ante ti, Senor Jesus,
pidiendo misericordia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lord Jesus, this is your son. I come before you, Lord Jesus,
begging for mercy.''
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva woke up and thought he heard God.
</P>
<P>
   ``No man,'' they told him, relieved. ``That was just Cesar.''
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva's brain will never fully heal, said Dr. David Hovda,
director of brain injury research at University of California, Los
Angeles. The most dramatic progress usually happens within the
first six months and, more slowly, for up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   La Cattiva remains convinced his memories and his speech are
returning.
</P>
<P>
   He went to the Long Beach Grand Prix last year with Jauregui and
shot some of his best work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Way. Down. The. Line ... Step. By. Step ... I'm. Back,'' he
says, giving the thumbs up sign.
</P>
<P>
   He hardly ever says the ``A and I'' refrain anymore. What was he
talking about? Probably nothing, doctors say. A common though
little understood result of head injuries is the automatic
repetition of a word or phrase and often a profanity.
</P>
<P>
   But La Cattiva's friends think his brain was trying to help him
remember who he was before the accident. La Cattiva used to get
film processed at A &AMP; I Color Laboratories in Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   If doctors can control his seizures by tinkering with his
medication, he may one day be able to drive again.
</P>
<P>
   ``When. No. More. Medicine. I. Am. Free,'' he says.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   FORTUNA, Costa Rica _ Ignorance is bliss.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly when you're being kneaded by a strong-fingered
woman in the middle of paradise.
</P>
<P>
   Just a month earlier, the masseuses _ and 400 of their neighbors
and clients _ were evacuated when the volcano El Arenal began
spewing burning ash, rocks and gases during a major eruption.
</P>
<P>
   Costa Rica's most active volcano belched lethally for nearly
seven hours in early May, setting off 23 avalanches and sending
tourists and residents scurrying from one of the country's most
popular tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
   The slides stopped less than a mile from the massage tables at
Tabacon Resort, a complex featuring a series of lushly landscaped
hot pools, two bars and a restaurant. It was the most intense
volcanic episodes for the area in the past five years, and the
area's residents remained on alert for several days.
</P>
<P>
   Dormant since about A.D. 1500, Arenal Volcano rumbled back to
life on July 29, 1968. Seventy-eight people died, more than 40,000
cattle were killed and two villages were lost in several huge
explosions.
</P>
<P>
   Since then Arenal has become one of Central America's greatest
tourist draws. Its almost daily eruptions lure tourists to tiny
hotels and towns scattered around the 5,373-foot mountain's base.
Many daytrippers make the drive from San Jose, which is about 80
steep-and-looping miles southeast.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Fortuna and the nearby Arenal Volcano National Park,
which opened in 1995, are rewarded with an exotic experience. The
relentless rumbling of the volcano, the calls of strange birds and
the guttural language of howler monkeys offer a fascinating
symphony.
</P>
<P>
   Hiking around the skirt of the volcano is a favorite activity.
Rangers at the national park can offer suggestions for day hikes
and often lead evening tours that include dramatic views of the
lava flow. While there are boastful tales of reaching the volcano's
rim, it would be foolhardy to attempt this, as Arenal's eruptions
are lethal, frequent and unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   Several guide companies in the area offer horseback tours into
the forested park, which gets nearly 200 inches of rain each year.
Another popular activity is whitewater rafting.
</P>
<P>
   But with its frequent eruptions, Arenal is king of the hill for
tourists.
</P>
<P>
   Most days, thick white clouds surround the tip of Arenal's
perfect cone. You'll hear a grumble and then see puffs of black
smoke push through the clouds.
</P>
<P>
   At night, you may be rewarded with clear skies, and then Arenal
becomes a feast for the eyes. Looking like liquid lightening bolts,
rivers of glowing lava inch their way down the mountain.
Mesmerized, you watch until the clouds dramatically draw the
curtain on Arenal again.
</P>
<P>
   For just a couple of bucks, you can bathe in volcano-warmed
pools located throughout the area.
</P>
<P>
   For a few dollars more, you can go deluxe at the Tabacon Resort
and its sister property, the recently opened 42-room Tabacon Lodge.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge's rooms have patios and balconies that put the volcano
centerstage. Days here are relaxing and peaceful.
</P>
<P>
   At the resort, you can splash around a large hot pool with
swim-up bar, sit under a misty waterfall, or share a romantic
moment in a secluded pond. Masseuses will rub your cares away and
then paint your face with thick coats of warm mud. Complete the
pampering with a manicure or pedicure. (But don't expect high tech,
and don't look too closely at the manicurist's tools.)
</P>
<P>
   The hot pools, fed by the volcano-heated Tabacon River, can vary
from 80 degrees to about 102 degrees. Chilly pools of water are
available, too. Best of all, the resort is open late into the
evening, providing the opportunity for a romantic, moonlit dip.
</P>
<P>
   The lodge's large rooms are cheerfully decorated and are
equipped with color televisions broadcasting CNN and other
English-language channels. The baths feature oversized showers and
generous vanities.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel doesn't officially open until later this year, but
word is out and the lodge was very full in early July. The hot
springs resort was built 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some believe the resort and lodge are too close to Arenal.
Volcano expert Jorge Barquero told the Tico Times, a local
English-language paper, last month that the resort should never
have been built.
</P>
<P>
   ``The volcano has repeatedly shown us that it is the one that
rules in that area, and it seems foolish to ignore it.''
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that if Arenal were to have eruptions
similar to ones it had in 1968 and 1975, hot lava could reach the
resort in just three minutes.
</P>
<P>
   If that's too close for comfort, there are many lodges and
hotels that provide more distant but no less dramatic views of the
volcano. One inviting place to consider is Hotel La Garza, near the
small village of Platanar.
</P>
<P>
   This working dairy and cattle ranch also encompasses a primary
rain forest. Cooled by ceiling fans and large screened windows and
featuring distressingly thin walls, the bungalows look across the
Platanar River to Arenal.
</P>
<P>
   Guests can watch the cows be milked, explore the ranch on
walking trails or simply lounge in the hotel's pretty pool. The
hotel also can arrange balloon rides, cave tours and birding boat
rides that take in the Cano Negro National Wildlife Refuge.
</P>
<P>
   One of the favorite outings at La Garza is a horseback ride
through the rain forest. To reach the forest, riders must cross
through the ranch's many agricultural fields where crops such as
sugar cane grow taller than the horses.
</P>
<P>
   You end your days at La Garza on a hammock on the balcony of
your bungalow, watching Arenal's flows glow safely and peacefully
in the distance.

CHARLES SEEKS TO MAKE PARKER BOWLES ACCEPTABLE TO BRITISH PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   News Analysis  
 By BERNARD D. KAPLAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Prince Charles has embarked on an active campaign to
bring his longtime friend, Camilla Parker Bowles, into the British
royal circle as the first step toward marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year after Princess Diana's death in a car crash, it
has been disclosed that Parker Bowles will host a gala party in
honor of Charles's 50th birthday Nov. 14 and that his and Diana's
sons, Princes William and Harry, will come as ``honored guests.''
This will be the first royal occasion at which the once-detested
``other woman'' will have played a role.
</P>
<P>
   Charles, the controversial heir to Britain's throne, received
favorable publicity last month after arranging a meeting for the
first time between Parker Bowles and 16-year-old William. The two
were said to have spent a ``cordial'' hour together with Charles
present, and the meeting was disclosed only after it was deemed
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
   Enmity toward her by Diana's sons would obviously be an enormous
personal and political obstacle to marriage. Charles's strategy is
to demonstrate to his future subjects that the boys don't oppose
Parker Bowles and don't blame her for their parents' divorce,
according to some royal watchers.
</P>
<P>
   They say Charles and his advisers are confident that she is
gradually becoming more acceptable to the British public as his
future spouse, although probably never as queen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is testing the waters for an eventual morganatic marriage
such as has occurred in many royal families but never before in the
British royal family,'' according to Tony Ridley, author of several
books on European royalty.
</P>
<P>
   In a morganatic marriage, the wife of a crowned head is not
recognized as having royal rank and any offspring of the couple are
not regarded as eligible to succeed to the throne. In any case, it
is unlikely that Camilla, who is 52, would have children by
Charles.
</P>
<P>
   The prince has been working hard since Diana's death last Aug.
31 to repair his battered image by showing himself more in public
and by working earnestly at charity and environmental projects. The
highly publicized storm surrounding his marriage turned Diana into
a national heroine, despite admitted adultery on both sides, and
even seemed for a while to imperil the monarchy's survival.
</P>
<P>
   Popular demands that he step aside in favor of William when
Queen Elizabeth II dies have now subsided. But Ridley said that
Charles ``feels strongly that regularizing his relationship with
Camilla is important for the ongoing stability of the throne.''
</P>
<P>
   Ridley added: ``He believes that in a few years' time, as
memories of Diana grow less vivid, he and Camilla will be able to
marry without causing serious offense to popular sensibilities.''

   Music, art and drama can pay huge intellectual dividends in
terms of a child's mental development, Blumenthal writes. Studies
have shown, for example, that students who study music do better on
their SATs and score higher on spatial IQ tests. Blumenthal offers
tips on how parents can boost their children's learning powers

   Parents of children with late-summer or fall birthdays often
find themselves faced with a difficult decision _ whether to let

   Math, reading and geography lessons can delight rather than
defeat youngsters, says Orr, a software reviewer for Children's
Software Revue. She gives a rundown of some of the best educational
programs and reference software on the market, programs that are so
much fun that kids won't even realize how much they're learning.

   More and more businesses are adopting policies that recognize
the problems parents have balancing work and family. But now these
family-friendly policies are igniting a backlash from childless
employees who feel resentful about what they perceive as more
favorable treatment of working parents. Harris looks at the
validity of these objections and suggests ways that employers can
treat both groups equitably. (slugged:

   High-fat diets and sedentary lifestyles are leading an
increasing number of children to tip the scales at far beyond their
ideal weight. Hours of playing videogames or watching television
instead of partaking in more physical activities are taking their
toll, Downey says. So is the decline of the family dinner hour.
Downey offers advice to parents on how to help children take off
those extra pounds. (slugged:

<P>
   Janice Ruell started worrying about when to send her third
child, Rosemary, to kindergarten even before the baby was born.
</P>
<P>
   Her first and second children had both arrived several weeks
later than expected, so when she went into labor in late August,
only a couple of days after her due date, Janice sat up on the
delivery table and shouted, ``She made the cutoff!''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later Rosemary's late-summer birthday did, in fact,
mean that she could begin kindergarten just as she turned 5, making
her one of the youngest kids in the class.
</P>
<P>
   Janice's older children had spring birthdays, and she couldn't
help but focus on the developmental differences between Rosemary
and her other children.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first two kids seemed further along in their intellectual
development when kindergarten came up,'' Janice recalls.
``Rosemary's sister wanted to go to kindergarten so badly that we
had to mark off each week on a calendar from her April birthday to
the first day of school, the following September. I was expecting
to see that same burning desire from Rosemary, but I've noticed
that she often has trouble thinking about the unknown.''
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult for most parents to determine with absolute
certainty their children's readiness for kindergarten. Kids
approaching their fifth birthday can take large developmental
strides and acquire a good deal of self-confidence between spring
registration time and the first day of school at the end of the
summer. And the fact that parents get so much advice on the issue
can sometimes make the decision even more overwhelming.
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is contradictory at best: ``It helps to
be the oldest in the class,'' ``You can get ahead if you start
younger,'' ``Keep young boys out a year,'' ``Children should be
able to tie their shoes, write their names and count up to 10.''
</P>
<P>
   How is a concerned parent to sort out the most important factors
in making the decision?
</P>
<P>
   The three kids described below had parents who reached different
conclusions about the timing of early schooling. Though the
decisions differed, they each led to a successful kindergarten
experience.
 &UR; ROSEMARY'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's parents ultimately decided to send her to
kindergarten despite the fact that she was likely to be one of the
youngest kids in the class. Her father, Steve, didn't doubt
Rosemary's readiness for one second.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was so enthusiastic about learning,'' he says. ``I thought
we should take advantage of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosemary's mother eventually agreed and was happy about the
decision, which was also influenced by friends' experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost embarrassing,'' Janice admits, ``but there's a
certain social pressure on parents as well as children. Rosemary's
neighborhood friend has the same birthday, and her mother never
considered keeping her out of kindergarten for a year. Rosemary
would have been upset if her friend went to kindergarten and she
didn't. And I felt that Rosemary was as ready as her friend was.''
</P>
<P>
   Janice also talked to Rosemary's teachers at Chelmsford
Children's School, a private day-care and preschool program in
Chelmsford, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all felt Rosemary was ready for kindergarten,'' says Dianne
Sadowski, Rosemary's preschool teacher. ``She had no difficulty
separating from her mother and father and showed a fair amount of
self-confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   The teachers in Rosemary's preschool reassured her mother that
such social skills as communicating thoughts, listening, following
instructions, sharing and making transitions from one activity to
another are more important than mastery of the alphabet in helping
children to absorb what kindergarten has to offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rosemary started out the school year on the quiet side,'' her
Harrington Elementary School kindergarten teacher, Dora Bungard,
says. ``She was absorbing things, but she wasn't ready to volunteer
and share her knowledge. Then she went through this magical
transition that often happens in late winter, and now she is really
a class leader.''
</P>
<P>
   As a child learns classroom routines and develops a trusting
relationship with the teacher, she demonstrates increasing
confidence in her ability to master tasks in kindergarten. At the
same time, a child's large and small motor skills, attention span
and listening skills continue to develop.
</P>
<P>
   In Rosemary's case, the ``magical transition'' included an
increase in self-confidence and progress in her ability to handle
pencil and paper and perform other small motor tasks.
 &UR; NICHOLAS' STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Is separation anxiety a reason to wait? Camille Lema, a mother
of two from Durham, Conn., opted to wait a year before sending her
son, Nicholas, who has a late-December birthday, to kindergarten.
Nicholas' parents made the decision mostly because he'd insisted
that his mother stay with him for a large part of the day during
his entire first year of preschool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Academically, he knew a lot, and he played well with others,
but he just didn't appear ready to move on,'' Camille says.
</P>
<P>
   The ability to separate confidently from parents is something
that develops over time at a child's own pace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Children who have the hardest time in kindergarten are the
ones with big separation anxiety,'' says Diane Kischell, director
of the Wesleyan University day-care and preschool in Middletown,
Conn. ``If they worry all day long, then they are not going to be
connected with the school process.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas' difficulties with separation indicated that the
demands of kindergarten, the school bus and a new setting would be
more than he could handle. At the end of his first preschool year,
he was still challenged by the experience.
</P>
<P>
   His parents' hunch that he wasn't ready for kindergarten was
shared by his preschool teacher, Kathy Meyering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nicholas underwent a metamorphosis during his second year of
preschool,'' she recalls. ``He began to jump into the day and he
became very comfortable with his classmates, at times even taking a
leadership role in dramatic play.''
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas developed the ability to separate from his parents in
his own time. The way they supported him gave him the security and
confidence he needed to successfully negotiate kindergarten at
Brewster Elementary School a year later, at 5 years, 9 months. When
the first day of school finally rolled around, Nicholas was excited
to start.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a kind, sensitive boy,'' says Ann Rau, Nicholas'
kindergarten teacher. ``He came to our class with some strong
preacademic skills, but he never outgrew kindergarten by being a
little older.''
 &UR; ERIC'S STORY &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a mid-October birthday, Eric Wenz narrowly missed the Ohio
kindergarten cutoff date of Sept. 30. In the Kenston school
district, where the Wenz family lives, parents of children born
between Oct. 1 and Dec. 31 can apply for early kindergarten
entrance. Admission is based on a written application, a visit to
the child's preschool by elementary-school staff, an interview and
a series of standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   While most potential kindergartners are not required to go
through such an extensive entrance process, many school districts,
like Eric's, hold regular kindergarten screenings in early spring,
at which parents and children meet kindergarten teachers, speech
and language specialists, school nurses and other school personnel
who can help sort out various questions about readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric showed some abilities that seemed far beyond his age, and
yet he's still a little boy,'' Eric's mother, Margie, says. ``His
emotional maturity was the biggest unknown for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The evaluation process for early admission was lengthy but
helpful, Margie says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric took it all in stride,'' she recalls. ``We could see him
becoming more and more confident, and by the time of his testing, I
knew he was ready. Now we have to get used to the idea of our last
child going off to school!''
 &UR; THE BOTTOM LINE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When to send a child to kindergarten can seem a momentous
decision to parents, who hope their child will feel secure,
confident and open to the learning experience. While many parents
may worry, the fact is that most healthy, age-eligible children
will thrive in a good kindergarten setting.
</P>
<P>
   ``A child who has been talked to, who has been questioned and
who has been given answers to questions, a child who has been read
to and who has learned to share and play with other children and to
take turns is more successful right from the beginning,'' says
Carol Aikenhead, past president of the Kindergarten Association of
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   Five-year-old Rosemary knows the feeling of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like kindergarten, and I learn a lot of stuff,'' she says
enthusiastically. ``All of my new friends are here, and my teacher
smiles. When it is a kindergarten day, I feel happy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mark Schubart was dean of New York's famed Juilliard School
of Music, he was visited in his office one day by a distraught
mother pulling along her little boy.
</P>
<P>
   What could she do about him? she asked. Here the boy was,
already 4 years old, and his piano repertoire consisted of only 34
pieces!
</P>
<P>
   Schubart, now chairman of the Lincoln Center Institute, which
trains teachers to use the arts to expand young minds, still shakes
his head over the encounter. Clearly, some people don't know when
to stop pushing their kids.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, however, parents with a more measured
appreciation of how to boost their children's learning power are
tuning in to a host of exciting new findings. Music, in particular,
is emerging as both a pathway and a stimulant to intellectual
growth.
</P>
<P>
   But the visual and dramatic arts can play a big role too, along
with other approaches that are revolutionizing childhood education.
On television, that master teacher ``Sesame Street'' has been
applying some of the latest research in maximizing youngsters'
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Watch carefully and you'll see how lessons on the same topics
are increasingly being clustered for reinforcement. The letter of
the day _ D _ might be shown in different ways: outlined in
candles, and then set to music in clay animation. Preschoolers who
have trouble grasping the lesson in a linguistic way may get it
through music or movement or other presentations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea,'' said Celia Genishi, chairwoman of curriculum and
development at Columbia University's Teachers College, ``is to give
children many different entry points for learning.''
</P>
<P>
   Driving all this is a new understanding of intelligence.
Increasingly, experts are redefining intelligence as more than
linguistic and mathematical ability, the traditional yardsticks.
Rather, they say, it takes many forms.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to specialists such as Howard Gardner, a professor of
education at Harvard who is widely credited with the theory of
multiple intelligences, and Daniel Goleman, author of the
best-selling book ``Emotional Intelligence'' (Bantam Books,
$19.95), our understanding of the workings and expression of
intelligence has widened.
</P>
<P>
   Now we include creative powers and the ability to understand
oneself and others along with the rest of the natural and spiritual
world, as well as the simple ability to get along with other
people.
 &UR; SEVEN KINDS OF INTELLIGENCE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Gardner makes a case for at least seven different intelligences:
linguistic (poet), logical-mathematical (scientist), musical
(composer), spatial (architect), bodily-kinesthetic (dancer,
athlete), interpersonal (salesman, teacher) and intrapersonal
(those with a highly developed sense of self).
</P>
<P>
   The implications of this expanded view of intelligence have been
sweeping. No longer must the label ``smart'' be reserved for the
best readers, writers and counters in the classroom. Now youngsters
who can follow complex dance steps or drum rhythms, organize games
or soothe conflicts with their schoolmates can be recognized as
possessing different types of intelligence. And these skills can be
utilized to learn the ever-crucial reading, writing and arithmetic.
</P>
<P>
   Although scientists are still struggling to understand the
developing brain, there is widespread agreement that the preschool
years open a mental window through which learning can flood in at a
rate never again duplicated in life. Opportunities not exploited at
this time can never be made up.
</P>
<P>
   Within the first four years of life, the child's brain grows to
fully two-thirds of its adult size, evolving at a faster rate than
it ever will again. And the stimulation present at that time will
have a lot to say about the kind of adult the child will become.
 &UR; WHAT PARENTS CAN DO &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In one famous 1960s experiment, scientists at the University of
California at Berkeley raised two groups of lab animals, one in a
setting of wheels and ladders and toys, the other in an
impoverished environment. After several months the animals in the
enriched setting not only were in better health and performed
better, but also had grown larger brains.
</P>
<P>
   So what can parents do to boost their children's learning power?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose them early to music and art.
</P>
<P>
   This should be done not in hopes of uncovering a prodigy, though
that may possibly happen, but because research has found links
between intellectual achievement and musical training and ability.
</P>
<P>
   How early? Well, some mothers-to-be make a point of listening to
Mozart and other soothing symphonists. Their hope is to predispose
their offspring to high culture, although science has yet to
confirm that this works.
</P>
<P>
   Because financially hard-pressed schools around the country have
cut arts programs left and right, parents have to do more to take
up the slack. Music lessons in piano or violin, two of the most
popular instruments for children to learn, can be started as early
as preschool.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some experts say it's almost never too soon to begin
and, for those with true talent, starting too late may mean never
fully exploiting their gifts. The idea is to train children so
early that their technique becomes intuitional.
</P>
<P>
   + Take children to live performances.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better way of exciting them about the arts. Give them
a good view of the conductor. Let them peer into the orchestra,
before or after the performance. Go backstage afterward if
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Many young people's theaters make a practice of letting the
actors in costume mingle with the audience after the curtain. Allow
time after the show for your kids to shake hands with the stars.
Or, for a look behind the scenes of a show or concert, try to
attend a dress rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   + Do dance exercises with young children at home.
</P>
<P>
   The urge to dance and move to rhythm is strong in many children.
Isadora Duncan liked to say she learned to dance in her mother's
womb.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from formal ballet and dance instruction, parents can put
on some music and have children dance or skip to the changing
rhythms. Ask them to imitate sailboats or gliding seagulls. Teach
beats with a makeshift drum.
</P>
<P>
   + At museums, look for ``please touch me'' exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing teaches children faster than hands-on experiences.
Children's museums are particularly rich in such fun, educational
displays.
</P>
<P>
   Many museums also offer children's art programs. Instructors
lead young visitors to a sculpture or painting gallery, talk a
little about the work on display and then give out paint, paper and
crayons with which the children try their own versions.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, parents can do similar things at home using art
books, art supplies and collage materials they have at hand _
anything from cut-up magazines and newspapers to old photos, pieces
of fabric and buttons.
</P>
<P>
   + Buy your child an inexpensive camera.
</P>
<P>
   Older children are often intrigued by photography. The pictures
they take can be developed inexpensively at neighborhood film
depots and used by parents as a springboard into discussions about
color and design: What makes some pictures nicer than others? How
does an artist pick a subject and angle?
</P>
<P>
   + Expose children to other languages at an early age.
</P>
<P>
   With their young brains programmed to soak up information at a
rate they will never achieve again, preschoolers can painlessly lay
the foundations for multilingualism. A foreign language that they
experience now will never sound completely strange to them again
and will be picked up much more quickly in later years.
</P>
<P>
   Research increasingly supports these recommendations. In one
recent study, four classes of first- and second-graders in West
Orange, N.J., were taught music using a highly structured and
demanding program pioneered 60 years ago by the Hungarian composer
Zoltan Kodaly. Their art instruction was also particularly
challenging. Four other classes took conventional music and art.
</P>
<P>
   After two years, the enriched classes had doubled the percentage
of pupils performing at grade level in math, to more than
three-quarters of the class. The other classes had lower gains.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits seem to endure. In profiles of test-takers, the
College Board found that those who studied or played music scored
an average of 51 points higher on the verbal portion of the SAT and
39 points higher on the math portion.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, at the University of California at Irvine,
psychologist Frances Rauscher and neuroscientist Gordon Shaw found
that preschoolers who took keyboard lessons for eight months
boosted their IQ scores on spatial tests by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Rauscher and Shaw reported, college students
who listened to a Mozart sonata for 10 minutes performed better on
spatial IQ tests _ a benefit termed ``the Mozart effect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Music excites the inherent brain patterns and enhances their
use in complex reasoning tasks,'' the researchers concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts, too, pay intellectual dividends. Philip
Yenawine of Development Through Art, former director of education
for the Museum of Modern Art, reported that students who learned to
critically discuss paintings in a museum did better in social
studies and other subjects. They learned to formulate theorems,
draw meaning from abstract ideas and communicate thoughts. And
their writing improved.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, nothing can turn off youngsters faster than forced
marches down endless museum corridors. One clever way of focusing
children's attention is to buy them postcards of works of art and
then challenge them to find the originals on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   Ask open-ended questions such as: What's happening in this
picture? What do you see in it?
</P>
<P>
   Don't look for any special answer _ just signs of thinking.

 By CHARLES DOWNEY  
 From Kiwanis magazine 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Jimmy, a 6-year-old first-grader, should have weighed about 50
pounds but pressed the scales to the 95-pound mark. At his school
near Baton Rouge, La., the lumbering lad always was dead last in
gym-class activities and any sports he played with fellow students.
 &HT;    Because of the flabby rolls that hung over his pants, Jimmy
suffered all the cruel taunts other children could heap on a boy
who weighed almost twice the normal weight.
 &HT;    Eventually, his physician referred him to a weight-loss clinic,
the Committed to Kids Pediatric Weight Management Program at
Louisiana State University in New Orleans.
 &HT;    One of his first prescription slips read: ``Play outside twice a
week for 20 minutes.'' This could entail walking, bicycling,
in-line skating or other common childhood pastimes. At first, it
was difficult for him to huff and puff through those 20 minutes,
but he slowly improved.
 &HT;    Like Jimmy, most obese children live in industrialized nations,
but cases of childhood obesity are found worldwide. American kids
top the childhood heavyweight list: One in four children ages 5 to
12 is 70 percent or more over his or her proper weight, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
 &HT;    Childhood obesity is partly caused by children being home alone
after school and snacking on whatever they want, as often as they
want. Also, more and more children have become couch potatoes who
routinely log four to six hours a day watching television or
playing video games.
 &HT;    Medical doctors, nutritionists and child-behavior specialists
are concerned about these trends, because obese children still are
growing and require certain nutrients for healthy physical and
mental development. Such growth may be stunted by high-fat diets
and sedentary lifestyles.
 &HT;    After a year at a weight-loss clinic, Jimmy worked up to doing
aerobic exercises and other physical activities for 45 minutes five
times a week. He _ along with his family _ also learned
much-improved nutritional habits and reduced his weight to 67
pounds.
 &HT;    But the big plus for Jimmy was constantly finishing first in
physical activities and sports at school. The cruel taunts stopped
when he began placing at the top.
 &HT;    Trading television for sports works, and many children need to
try it. The World Health Organization once surveyed Canadian
children and found that, outside school, the girls were active only
half an hour per week or less. One-fourth of the boys and girls
reported spending at least four hours a day in front of the tube.
 &HT;    ``We don't tell our young patients they must give up
television,'' says Uwe Blecker, medical director of the LSA
weight-loss clinic, ``but instead of watching television or playing
video games four hours a day, we ask them to reduce it to three. Or
we ask them to ride a stationary bike or walk on a treadmill while
watching television.''
 &HT;    It's all too easy for children to get their forks into one of
the biggest health hazards: fatty foods. Health professionals who
monitor the eating habits of young children have found that one
cheeseburger with fries can equal the total amount of fat a child
should consume in two days.
 &HT;    Children who must watch their weight are encouraged to consume
more whole grains, vegetables and fruits while cutting back on _
not eliminating _ dairy products, beef, pork, lamb and high-fat or
highly sugared treats.
 &HT;    Obesity has a genetic link. According to Canada's National
Institute of Nutrition in Ottawa, Ontario, if both parents tip the
scales at a normal weight, the probability of a child becoming
obese is about 10 percent. But if one parent is overweight, the
child's odds of matching that physical trait rise to 49 percent.
 &HT;    If both the mother and father are overweight, a child stands an
80 percent chance of becoming obese, due to a complex mix of
genetic and lifestyle factors that medical scientists don't fully
understand.
 &HT;    What medical science does understand about obesity is the
increased risk of more widespread health woes, such as the
development of diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis or skeletal
problems in hips and legs.
 &HT;    Studies reveal that portly children usually grow into pudgy
teens and adults. Each stage then brings its own woes. For
instance, University surveys and personality inventories show that,
as early as kindergarten, children have an aversion to obesity and
describe their overweight classmates as less likable, less capable
and less able to control themselves.
 &HT;    To curb childhood obesity, the American Pediatric Association
urges families to begin early with proper diets and exercise. When
overweight children learn to reduce and maintain weight through
good nutrition and exercise, the loss is more likely to be
permanent as they grow into young adulthood.
 &HT;    ``One of the primary causes of childhood obesity among our
patients is because families no longer sit down together for dinner
at a fixed time,'' says Baylor College's William Klish. ``Instead,
children eat in front of the television, after `grazing' all
afternoon. But when everybody in a family sits down for dinner at a
fixed time every night, fewer and healthier calories are consumed.
Also, today's children just don't play outside like they did in
years past.''
 &HT;    Families eat less when they eat together, because they talk and
that slows down the speed of eating, giving the stomach's fullness
signals a chance to work. Even small amounts of food will begin
sending satiety signals to the brain after about 20 minutes.
 &HT;    Children tend to lose weight more successfully when the entire
family is involved. Ideal loss for plump children is no more than
one-half to one pound per week.
 &HT;    ``When an overweight child starts watching the types of food he
or she eats, the rest of the family also must watch what they
eat,'' says Marilyn Day, a nutritionist at Children's Hospital in
Denver, Colo. ``It's unfair to forbid cookies and other treats to a
child while others in the home munch them.
 &HT;    ``I've found in my practice that a child often can lose unwanted
pounds through some very simple changes in ordinary foods that are
normally kept in the home,'' she adds. ``I've known children who
cut back from whole milk to skim milk or cut out the highly sugared
cola drinks and lost weight.''
 &HT;    Other researchers have uncovered an unexpected source of flab in
a study group of 168 children ages 2 to 5: fruit juice. In
Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, they
reported that children who drink at least 12 ounces of fruit juice
a day are more likely to be obese.
 &HT;    Young children worldwide are famous for being fussy eaters. More
than one serving of peas or spinach has ended up on the floor or
caused an evening-long power struggle between parents and children.
Studies have disclosed, however, that if caretakers introduce new
or more nutritious foods to young children too forcefully, it can
backfire.
 &HT;    Susan Johnson, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the
Center for Human Nutrition of the University of Colorado Health
Sciences Center in Denver, found in a study of 77 youngsters ages 3
to 5 that those children with the most body fat also had the most
controlling mothers.
 &HT;    Johnson notes that, though parents still are responsible for
making sure that children eat healthful food, the ``children
themselves are capable of figuring out how much to eat.''
 &HT;    Her advice about clean plates? ``Relax a little.''
 &HT;    The study revealed that children whose mothers allowed them to
be spontaneous about food _ to eat when they are hungry and not
necessarily finish all the food given to them _ showed a natural
instinct for regulating their own calories.
 &HT;    So there may be hope for caregivers trying to make vegetables _
and other unfamiliar but healthful food _ more popular with young
children. After all, if it leads to better health via an
appropriate weight, what harm is there in a few servings of peas
and spinach on the dining-room floor?

 By DIANE HARRIS  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It figures. Just as American employers finally appear to be
catching on to the need for family-friendly programs and policies,
a small but vocal group comes along that seems bent on taking those
hard-won benefits away.
 &HT;    Call it a backlash, but a growing number of childless workers
are protesting what they believe to be the inequity of benefits
designed to help working parents better balance the demands of
their personal and professional lives.
 &HT;    ``Programs and policies that exclude large groups of people are
inherently unfair,'' says warehouse-software manufacturer Ann
Price, a member of The Childfree Network, a Citrus Heights,
Calif.-based advocacy group that boasts 5,000 members nationwide.
``If I don't have kids, family-friendly benefits by definition
aren't very friendly to me.''
 &HT;    New research supports the notion that some childless workers
feel they are being stiffed by their employer's focus on the needs
of co-workers with kids. For instance, some 56 percent of work-life
professionals believe that childless workers harbor resentment
toward employees with children, according to a recent survey by The
Conference Board, a business-research group in New York.
 &HT;    ``Where people feel the most discrimination is around time _
having to stay late at the office, having to finish work at home,
not being able to attend to personal responsibilities,'' says
Marcia Brumit Kropf, a vice president with Catalyst, a women's
research and consulting firm in New York. ``The real problem is how
stretched everyone feels in the workplace today.''
 &HT;    With a view toward clearing the air, here is a closer look at
the most common complaints voiced by childless workers, along with
some expert thinking about what's legitimate about the gripes,
what's not and what companies and employees can do to insure a fair
deal for all workers, whether they are parents or not.
 &HT;    + It's a family-friendly world out there.
 &HT;    If only it were true.
 &HT;    ``Over the past five years there has been a sea change in
consciousness, a general recognition that helping employees balance
their professional and private lives is an important business
issue,'' Brumit Kropf says. ``But we have a lot of work left to do
to turn that consciousness into reality.''
 &HT;    In fact, while the range of possible benefits has expanded over
the past decade, the majority of employers have yet to get with the
program.
 &HT;    Consider: Only 37 percent of companies offer paid parental
leave, only 18 percent provide any form of child-care help, such as
an on-site child-care center or backup care, and a scant 12 percent
lend a hand with adoption expenses, according to a 1996 survey of
313 companies by Buck Consultants, a New York-based
benefits-consulting firm.
 &HT;    But while family-friendly programs are not as ubiquitous as
critics claim, a climate that is generally open to family concerns
is.
 &HT;    ``Companies tend to reflect a cultural attitude that views
raising children as a kind of sacred calling,'' says Mary Young, a
researcher at Boston University's School of Management. ``Having to
get home to your kids is a high card of sorts that is hard for a
childless employee to match.''
 &HT;    What would help: The most painful work-life conflict for
employees is to not be treated with respect or recognized as a
whole person with a compelling life off the job, concludes a new
study by human-resources consultant Marci Koblenz of MK Consultants
in Evanston, Ill. And that's as true for childless employees as it
is for working parents, Koblenz found.
 &HT;    Yet the language used to describe programs to help employees
achieve balance _ phrases such as ``family-friendly'' or
``work-family'' _ inadvertently fuels divisiveness by seeming to
exclude anyone who doesn't have kids.
 &HT;    To send a more inclusive message, a growing number of firms are
changing the name of their initiatives to more neutral titles, such
as ``work-life,'' indicating that such programs are intended to
help all employees resolve conflicts between their personal and
professional responsibilities, whether or not they have children.
 &HT;    + Childless workers pick up the slack for working moms and dads.
 &HT;    Three quarters of the work-life experts surveyed by The
Conference Board disputed the notion that employees without
children carry more than their fair share of the work load.
 &HT;    ``Sure, you occasionally hear stories about childless employees
staying until 10 at night to make up the work left behind by a
working parent,'' says Catherine Popper, a vice president with WFD,
a work-family research and consulting firm in Boston. ``But those
incidents by far tend to be the exception, not the rule.''
 &HT;    When such a problem does arise, experts say, the cause can
usually be traced to how a flexible schedule was implemented, not
to the policy itself. Most typically, a well-meaning manager may
approve a working parent's request for flextime without thinking
through the consequences.
 &HT;    What would help: Companies need to train managers about how to
implement flexible schedules, work-family experts suggest. Before a
request for flextime is approved, the supervisor and employee
should discuss how the work will be accomplished and establish ways
for the employee to pass along needed information when she's not in
the office.
 &HT;    ``Managers need to treat flexibility as a business issue, a
strategy to achieve business results,'' Popper says, ``not as an
accommodation.''
 &HT;    + Childless workers do not get a fair share of the benefits pie.
 &HT;    ``An on-site child-care center or a lactation room are icons of
all the money that companies spend on employees with kids,'' says
Ann Price of The Childfree Network. ``For childless workers,
they're a constant reminder of all the benefits dollars that aren't
spent on us.''
 &HT;    Price is not alone in her views: Some 42 percent of the work-
family specialists in The Conference Board survey agreed that
employees without children feel they are subsidizing benefits for
other employees' families lives.
 &HT;    To some extent, the negative feelings simply reflect bad PR on
the part of employers. Companies don't usually talk up benefits
that are used primarily by workers without children, such as
tuition assistance and wellness programs, even though they are far
more common offerings.
 &HT;    What would help: As a first step, work-life consultants urge
companies to conduct focus groups and surveys to determine which
benefits childless employees value most.
 &HT;    ``Simply by asking, you communicate respect, which can head off
a lot of resentment,'' says Boston University's Mary Young.
 &HT;    A small but growing number of companies are designing
cafeteria-style benefits packages that can be used in different
ways by different employees, depending on their particular needs.
 &HT;    Xerox's 5-year-old LifeCycle Assistance Program is a striking
example: Employees are entitled to $10,000 over the course of their
career with the company, to be used for one of three purposes: to
help pay for child care, a down payment on a first home or
unreimbursed health-care expenses for members of one's household.
 &HT;    + Working parents feel they have a superior claim on the need to
balance work and outside interests.
 &HT;    At its most fundamental level, the tension between working
parents and childless employees boils down to a competition for
scarce resources. In this case, the resource is flexibility, which
the majority of employees want and most companies are loath to
grant across the board.
 &HT;    Do working parents have a greater claim on flexibility than
other staffers? The question is hotly debated among employees,
within the human-resources field and the larger community as well.
 &HT;    Certainly, once a company approves flextime for some employees,
it's difficult for anyone to know where to draw the line and on
what grounds. Is your sick child more important than my sick cat?
Is your need to leave on time to pick up your toddler from child
care more compelling than my need to get to a night-school class so
I can earn an MBA? Is your child's softball game more important
than my softball game?
 &HT;    What would help: Fortunately, if a flextime program is managed
correctly, employers don't really have to get into the messy
business of determining the moral merits of each request.
 &HT;    Amoco makes flextime and a compressed workweek available to all
employees, regardless of family status. Indeed, roughly 10,000
Amoco workers, or about a third of the work force, have opted for
the compressed workweek since the program was introduced
company-wide a year ago _ and the number of enrollees with and
without children is proportionate to their numbers in the work
force.
 &HT;    Certainly, the technology now exists to make such flexibility
possible, from voice mail and faxes to computers, beepers and
e-mail.
 &HT;    As Fran Rodgers, founder and CEO of WFD, observes, ``We're in
the midst of a revolution in the way work gets done.''
 &HT;    But the revolution hasn't been won yet. And until it is,
companies, working parents and childless employees must work
together to create the kind of workplace community in which
everyone is considerate of one another's needs, regardless of
family status.

RESEARCHERS FIND WOMEN AS AGGRESSIVE AS MEN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ABIGAIL ZUGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the old Punch and Judy shows of the last century, Punch would
batter Judy under the stage while the audience roared. But now it
seems likely that in their private moments together Judy gave Punch
back a bit of his own.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers studying human aggression are discovering that, in
contrast to the usual stereotypes, patterns of aggression among
girls and women under some circumstances may mirror or even
exaggerate those seen in boys and men. And while women's weapons
are often words, fists may be used, too.
</P>
<P>
   In a large-scale review of dozens of studies of physical
hostility in heterosexual relationships, Dr. John Archer, a
psychologist at the University of Central Lancashire in Great
Britain, has found that although women sustain more serious and
visible injuries than men during domestic disputes, overall they
are just as likely as men to resort to physical aggression during
an argument with a sexual partner.
</P>
<P>
   Archer compiled interviews with tens of thousands of men and
women in Canada, Great Britain, the United States and New Zealand,
and discovered that women who argued with their dates or mates were
actually even slightly more likely than men to use some form of
physical violence, ranging from slapping, kicking and biting, to
choking or using a weapon. The pattern was particularly pronounced
among younger women and women who were dating a partner rather than
married to or living with him, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the base rate of physical aggression in the
population, women tended to have a slightly higher rate than men,''
Archer said. In contrast, though, most instances of serious
violence in his study were caused by men, as were most injuries
that required medical care: Women accounted for 65 to 70 percent of
those requiring medical help as a result of violence between
partners.
</P>
<P>
   Still, ``the large minority of men who got injured is
fascinating,'' Archer said. ``It counters a certain entrenched view
of partner violence as being exclusively male to female.''
</P>
<P>
   Archer's study was reported at a meeting of the International
Society for Research on Aggression held at Ramapo College in
Mahwah, N.J., earlier this month. It is an extraordinary study,
said Dr. Anne Campbell, a psychologist at the University of Durham
in Great Britain, because it lends support to an emerging theory
that women may respond to certain environmental stresses with
physically aggressive behaviors that are analogous to men's,
although often on a different scale of intensity.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, she said, criminologists know that although men
are more likely to commit crimes than women, crime rates in the
genders are also strongly correlated. In other words, in
impoverished, ``high crime'' areas, rates of both violent and
nonviolent crimes increase proportionally among men and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike men, though, women tend to view crime as work rather
than adventure,'' Dr. Campbell said. For example, women spend more
of the proceeds of nonviolent crimes on staples rather than on
luxuries. And women often commit violent crimes against other women
with the very pragmatic purpose of attracting the protection and
financial support of a ``well-resourced'' man.
</P>
<P>
   Patterns of domestic homicide also indicate that women are
capable of significant violence, although often only as a last
resort. Although the vast majority of all murders are committed by
men, ``intimate partner'' homicides were split about equally
between the sexes until about 20 years ago, said Dr. Daniel Nagin,
a public policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two decades, intimate-partner homicides have
declined by about 30 percent. Nagin noted, however, that the
decline has been primarily in rates of women killing men, and
correlates strongly with several environmental changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The decline appears to be related to an improved relative
economic status of females, and a decline in exposure to violent
relationships,'' Nagin said.
</P>
<P>
   This drop also correlates with the availability of alternatives
to violence for women: In an ongoing study of domestic homicides in
29 cities in the United States, the availability of resources like
shelters for battered women and legal advocacy for them has
correlated strongly with lower rates of domestic homicide committed
by women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The resources for women seem to be saving the men's lives,''
Nagin said.
</P>
<P>
   The experts in human aggression are now aware that even in
childhood the similarities between male and female patterns of
aggression are more substantial than is usually recognized.
</P>
<P>
   Until about five years ago scientists studying aggression tended
to include only direct physical or verbal efforts to injure another
person. Then they discovered that great damage can be done to
another person so subtly that even the victim is unaware of the
process. The badmouthing, gossip and elaborate smear campaigns that
can demolish an opponent as effectively as direct verbal or
physical assaults are now formally known in psychological circles
as ``indirect aggression,'' and their patterns are tracked as
carefully as punches and kicks.
</P>
<P>
   With indirect aggression factored into the mix, aggressive
behavior in childhood is no longer primarily a male affair.
</P>
<P>
   In a large observational study of ``trajectories of aggression''
in children, Dr. Richard Tremblay of the Universite de Montreal has
found that physical aggression in both sexes seems to peak around
age 2, then decline steadily, although it remains consistently more
common in boys. Indirect aggression follows the opposite trajectory
_ it becomes more prevalent as children grow older and is
consistently more common in girls.
</P>
<P>
   The effect of external stimuli on these trajectories is still
under intensive speculation, but one long-term study suggests that
the omnipresent influence of television violence may correlate with
overall aggressive behavior in boys and girls in both the short and
the long term.
</P>
<P>
   In a 20-year study of more than 300 Chicago-area children, led
by Dr. L. Rowell Huesmann at the University of Michigan in Ann
Arbor, the more violent television a child watched at ages 6
through 8, the more aggressive behavior that child displayed, no
matter what the child's sex.
</P>
<P>
   And in interviews 15 years later with the grown-up study
participants, the correlation between the television viewing habits
of childhood and adult behavior patterns persisted, Huesmann said
at the Ramapo College meeting. The more television violence the
child watched, the more aggressive the man or woman became. The
correlation was especially marked among those children who told
researchers that they identified with the characters on the
television screen, and thought the events depicted were real.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, 16.7 percent of the young women who had been
``high violence'' television viewers as girls reported having
punched, beat or choked another adult, in contrast to 3.6 percent
of others. Thirty-seven percent of the ``high violence'' viewing
women had thrown something at a spouse during an argument, in
contrast to 16 percent of the others.
</P>
<P>
   ``The evidence is pretty compelling that there is a strong
longitudinal effect,'' Huesmann said.

LIFE BEHIND BARS PROVES TO BE HELLISH IN SIZZLING TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>

c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HUNTSVILLE, Texas _ On a typical day inside Wynne prison, the
cacophony of inmates shouting, hooting and clanging on the cell
bars drowns out most attempts at conversation.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, around 3:30 p.m., the noise-making fades.
</P>
<P>
   It's the hottest part of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too hot to be communicating,'' said Orlando
Rodriguez, grinning and running a hand across his shaved head, a
concession to the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, a convicted arsonist from Bay City in southeast
Texas, has pulled the mattress off his bunk and rolled it into a
cushion on the concrete floor. There, he sits in his underwear,
using his bare bunk as a table for chess playing. A clock radio and
fan dangle on shoelaces from the unoccupied upper bunk, which also
serves as a shelf.
</P>
<P>
   He's doing time in one of the hottest spots _ the third floor of
administrative segregation, where he's locked in his solitary cell
22 hours a day. A nearly two-story wall of windows on the west side
magnifies the heat of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some officer was talking the other day that it got up to 130
degrees, but I don't believe it,'' said the surprisingly upbeat
Rodriguez. His guess is it was 120, tops.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout most of the prison _ a major portion of which was
built in the 1950s _ a steady but warm breeze is blowing from
wall-mounted fans. Warden Michael Wilson has installed 20 new fans
in some cell blocks in the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   He hopes to add 30 more.
</P>
<P>
   As Texas bakes under near-record temperatures, prison life is
even more hellish than normal. Most state prisons have no air
conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   The heat is suspected in the deaths of two inmates so far, one
in May, the other in June, said Dr. Lannette C. Linthicum, the
prison system's health services director.
</P>
<P>
   And late last week, said Linthicum, one inmate was hospitalized
in Tyler for heat stroke, and two others were hospitalized _ in
Abilene and Crosbyton _ with heat-related illnesses. Other
prisoners across the state have been treated, but not hospitalized,
for heat-related illnesses as well.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the cell blocks, the weather is a factor not just for
the 143,000 felons behind bars, but also for the 26,622 state
prison guards who work in the same sweltering areas.
</P>
<P>
   So far, no employees have suffered serious health problems from
the heat, although some prisons have reported isolated incidents of
guards who have become dizzy or even fainted.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Koenig, risk manager for the Texas Department of Criminal
Justice, said the agency has averaged 30 heat-related problems a
month among employees and felons, with most complaining of cramps,
headaches and nausea.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been with the system 13 years,'' Koenig said, ``and this
has been the most extreme heat we've experienced.''
</P>
<P>
   Prisons across Texas have reported indoor temperatures ranging
from 100 to 125 degrees, Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Wynne Farm Unit, one of the oldest prisons in the
state, the 2,500 felons are sweating out their time behind bars
staying cool the only way they know how _ stripped to their boxer
shorts and barefoot, wet towels draped across their heads, with a
small plastic fan blowing. The fans are available to those who
shell out the $7.95 in the prison commissary.
</P>
<P>
   Warden Wilson, who is awaiting 30 more fans for the cell blocks
of Wynne, said the solitary confinement areas are top priority for
fan placement, because those inmates are in their cells for all but
two or three hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   Inmates in the general population, who are assigned to jobs or
who attend school, have more opportunities to escape the heat
buildup in the 5-by-9-foot cells, Wilson said. Classrooms are
air-conditioned.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the prison cell blocks, correctional officer Sam Riggs
is perched in a guard tower with no air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:30 p.m., the thermometer registers 100 degrees in the
shade. But then, the reading doesn't go any higher than 100.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just rather be outside,'' Riggs said, explaining why he
doesn't mind his eight-hour shifts at a job assignment that few
officers cherish. ``Between the two heats, I'd rather have this
(outdoor) heat. The inside heat is hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   Down below, on a concrete pad, other guards and inmates are
subjected not just to the sun, but also the blast of heat from the
pavement and the diesel engines of the tractor-trailers that come
and go all day. The trucks bring in supplies for prison industries
and carry out factory goods made there. Each truck &UR;  &LR; must be
inspected, including the engine area and undercarriage, for
contraband or inmates trying to escape.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the 2,500 Wynne inmates &UR;  &LR; work, at a variety
of jobs, including license-plate manufacturing, a mattress plant,
box factory, diesel mechanic shop and a license sticker and plastic
sign factories.
</P>
<P>
   The lucky ones are in the sticker or sign plants. They are
air-conditioned _ for the benefit of computers not inmates, Wilson
explained.
</P>
<P>
   In the mattress factory, plant manager Jimmy Stone has rolled
out huge box fans to help keep his workers in relative comfort as
they make mattresses for the entire prison system and other
agencies, like state hospitals and county jails.
</P>
<P>
   There's no such relief, though, for those attending vocational
education classes in welding. If summer temperatures weren't
enough, it's exacerbated by the fire from welding equipment and the
long-sleeved leather protective gear and gloves the prisoners must
wear as the work in a three-walled shed.
</P>
<P>
   TDCJ officials say they have taken a number of preventive steps,
from altering work schedules of inmates and rotating employee work
assignments to authorizing wardens to buy Gatorade and sports
drinks for inmates. Those drinks will help replenish electrolytes
and, because they are flavored, will encourage prisoners to drink
more fluids, Koenig said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need some help from nature, but we're doing all we can,''
said Linthicum, the health services director.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, TDCJ placed an emergency order for 100 fans to be
distributed &UR;  &LR; in prisons across the state to help cool things down
on the buses used to move inmates. Other units, like Wynne, are
buying their own fans to install in cell blocks.
</P>
<P>
   Koenig said several units have ordered water misters, which have
been shown to drop the temperature in a cell block 10 to 15
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Forced-air ventilation systems in some of the new prisons are
designed to suck air in from the outside and recirculate it
indoors. But this summer, where temperatures outdoors have reached
108 degrees in West Texas, even that doesn't work very well.
</P>
<P>
   At the Colorado City prison, warden Rodney Cooper said the fans
bringing in the outside air are shut down about 10 a.m. when the
air starts heating up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost like standing in front of a heater,'' he said.
</P>

A CHEAP PC MAY FIT YOU PERFECTLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For all the attention paid to sizzling microprocessors speeds,
dazzling multimedia technologies and snazzy styling, the z's that
are most common in personal computers today are the ones that occur
while the computer is waiting for something to do.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true if the computer is used primarily for
word processing, electronic mail, keeping a calendar and to-do
list, and browsing the Internet _ applications that generally do
not demand the latest and most powerful processors.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best ways to save money when buying a computer is to
be realistic about how it is going to be used.
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of computer applications demand high performance,
including three-dimensional games, software development, graphic
arts and publishing, multimedia explorations and complex financial
analysis. For people who do such things, or who anticipate getting
involved with such applications soon, no computer is fast enough.
</P>
<P>
   And some people are willing to pour money into powerful new
computers just to have the fastest machine on the block, or in the
belief that the more they spend up front, the longer they can
retard the computer's inevitable decline into the technological
junk heap. There is some validity in this thinking, but only if one
puts it in the context of what the computer's main tasks will be.
</P>
<P>
   If one accepts the fact that advances in PC technology are
accelerating even as prices are falling, an argument can be made
for buying a cheap PC today and simply replacing it with a cheaper
and more powerful computer when it can no longer keep up with the
demands made on it. We're not quite at the point of having
disposable PCs, but we're heading in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   This is especially true for the growing number of people who use
the PC primarily as a communications device, more than as a
computational device.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet is the largest driving influence in consumer PC
sales today,'' said Strategic News Service president Mark Anderson,
who was among the first technology analysts to forecast the growing
significance of inexpensive personal computers, or Cheap PCs, as he
calls them. ``Consumers are buying CPC's to get onto the Net.''
</P>
<P>
   For Net-based applications like e-mail, the PC itself may not be
the most critical component of a system. The slowest chip available
today is still idle more than 99 percent of the time while waiting
for someone to type the next character on the keyboard. This is
true even among the newest crop of CPC's selling for less than
$1,000. (When people talk about sub-$1,000 computers, they almost
always leave out the fact that one must spend a few hundred dollars
more on a monitor and a printer.)
</P>
<P>
   Are these cheap PCs a good deal? Or are they last year's
technologies, at the brink of obsolescence even as they come out of
the box?
</P>
<P>
   Virtually every low-cost PC on the market is capable of running
standard applications, except high-end games, for the next 18
months, said Stephen Baker, senior hardware analyst for PC Data of
Reston, Va. ``The big difference now, as opposed to a year ago,''
Baker said, ``is that PCs under $1,000 are designed to be
competitive. They're all based on current technology, so you don't
have to worry as much about obsolescence. It's the low end of the
current stuff, but it's still pretty current.''
</P>
<P>
   But the cheapest machines, those that are now flirting with a
$500 sticker price, are generally built around end-of-the-line
chips and bare minimum configurations. Some manufacturers try to
eke out a profit at these levels by cutting corners, so, if
possible, try the system before you buy it. Some of these come with
rickety keyboards, frail mice, scarce expansion slots, small or
fuzzy monitors, cheap speakers and just enough system and graphics
memory to do basic chores.
</P>
<P>
   But some of the $1,000 models today are surprisingly robust,
certainly for the common applications of word processing and
Internet cruising.
</P>
<P>
   As a general rule, draw the bottom line at 32 megabytes of RAM
(random access memory), a 4-gigabyte hard drive, a 24-speed CD-ROM,
at least 2 megabytes of video memory, a 15-inch monitor, and a
so-called 56K V.90 modem, the current top standard for dial-up
connections to the Internet or an online service. Any of today's
processors in the 233-megahertz or higher range can handle most
basic tasks, but for added oomph make sure the processor comes with
at least 256 KB of something called Level 2 or L2 cache, which
stores frequently used data in high-speed memory.
</P>
<P>
   At these prices, it becomes more important than ever to buy from
reputable companies. Almost all the major PC makers now offer
models under $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   While the average price of a PC bought today (not including
monitor) is still about $1,125, according to market researchers, it
is likely to drift below $1,000 by the end of the year, pushed
downward by price cuts for microprocessors, memory chips and other
standard components.
</P>
<P>
   (According to the research of ZD Market Intelligence, the
popularity of Windows 98, which requires more processing power,
memory and hard disk space than earlier versions of Windows, has
kept the average price higher despite the introduction of cheaper
PCs by Compaq, IBM, Hewlett-Packard and others.)
</P>
<P>
   Intel Corp. cut prices again last week on Pentium and Celeron
processors, and accelerated the introduction of new 300-megahertz
and 333-megahertz Celeron chips that offer higher performance than
the ones now on the market. (They integrate a performance booster
called an L2 cache, which earlier Celeron chips lacked.) Those
chips will be available to computer makers next month.
</P>
<P>
   This will translate into higher momentum for low-cost personal
computers in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
   And Intel's price cuts typically prompt its rivals to cut
prices, too.
</P>
<P>
   It is no wonder, then, that low-cost PCs are popular. They may
be just the right tool for people who have basic computing needs.
Why buy a Ferrari if you just need to drive to the grocery store?

<P>
   Do you know your triglyceride level? New evidence strongly
suggests that it is time to add triglycerides to cholesterol and
homocysteine as substances in the blood that influence your chances
of developing heart disease.
</P>
<P>
   Triglycerides are basic particles of fat carried through the
bloodstream by various molecules. They are derived from fats eaten
in food or made in the body from other energy sources like
carbohydrates.
</P>
<P>
   The new evidence indicates that blood levels of triglycerides
that have long been considered ``normal'' _ 200 milligrams in 100
milliliters of blood serum _ are actually too high and should be
monitored and controlled along with other coronary risk factors.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers at the University of Maryland Medical Center in
Baltimore have found significant cardiac risks above 100
milligrams. They say long-standing uncertainties about the
importance of triglycerides arose in part from mistaken assumptions
about where to draw the line between safe and hazardous levels.
</P>
<P>
   The new studies also call into question the way triglyceride
levels are measured, after a 12-hour fast. Dr. Michael Miller, who
directed the Baltimore study, said the level achieved after a fatty
meal might tell more about a person's chances of developing clogged
arteries.
</P>
<P>
   New Limits of Safety
</P>
<P>
   The National Cholesterol Education Program lists 200 milligrams
as a normal blood level of triglycerides. Levels of 200 milligrams
to 400 milligrams are considered borderline, warranting changes in
diet to bring them down.
</P>
<P>
   Drug therapy to lower triglycerides, according to the national
guidelines, should be reserved for those with levels higher than
400 milligrams as well as those with levels of 200 to 400 who have
other coronary risk factors like smoking, diabetes or high
cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   However, the Baltimore study found that those with triglyceride
levels at or above 100 milligrams (as measured after a 12-hour
fast) were 50 percent more likely than those with levels below 100
to suffer heart attacks, need bypass surgery or angioplasty, or die
from heart disease. This study, which followed 350 men and women
for an 18-year period, was published in May in The Journal of the
American College of Cardiology.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, director of preventive cardiology at the University of
Maryland, said his was just one of several recent studies
``suggesting that we may have been missing the big picture''
regarding triglycerides, because clinicians and medical researchers
had failed to look low enough when they assessed the contribution
of triglycerides to coronary risk.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, researchers had assumed that if high triglyceride
levels were hazardous, the higher the level the greater the risk
would be. But this is not always the case. In fact, some people
with very high triglyceride levels _ 1,000 milligrams or more _ are
no worse off than those with levels of 200.
</P>
<P>
   Further complicating the picture, when triglyceride levels go
up, blood levels of protective HDL-cholesterol go down, suggesting
that low HDLs, not high triglycerides, are really responsible for
any increased coronary risk found in people with high
triglycerides.
</P>
<P>
   ``We showed that a fasting triglyceride level above 100
milligrams is an important risk factor independent of the level of
HDLs,'' Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier finding from the decades-long Framingham Heart Study
had also shown that in women and in people over 65, rising
triglyceride levels increased coronary risk independent of any
cholesterol measurements.
</P>
<P>
   And a Danish study of 3,000 initially healthy middle-aged and
elderly men found that the risk of suffering a first heart attack
rose substantially when triglyceride levels were above 140,
regardless of HDL levels.
</P>
<P>
   In a report in March in the journal Circulation, the team from
Copenhagen University Hospital reported that the Danish men with
the highest triglyceride levels were more than twice as likely to
suffer a heart attack as those with the lowest levels.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in an analysis published last year in the Journal of
Cardiovascular Risk that combined the results of 17 triglyceride
studies among a total of 46,413 men and 10,864 women who had been
followed for years, Dr. John Hokanson and Dr. Melissa Austin of the
University of Washington in Seattle reported, ``Triglyceride is a
risk factor for cardiovascular disease for both men and women in
the general population, independent of HDL.''
</P>
<P>
   Missing from this impressive set of data is a large long-term
study showing that reducing triglyceride levels that are above 100
or even 200 milligrams can prevent serious heart problems. It took
studies like this to convince physicians and the public that it was
worth the money and effort to lower cholesterol levels.
</P>
<P>
   Small studies indicate that lowering high triglycerides may be
as effective in preventing coronary artery disease as lowering the
level of heart-damaging cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   In the Meantime ...
</P>
<P>
   Some people with extremely high triglyceride levels do not get
heart disease, because their triglyceride complexes are too large
to damage arterial cells, whereas others with much lower levels are
in danger because their triglyceride complexes are small.
</P>
<P>
   Triglyceride levels in the blood reach their peak about four
hours after a meal; the more caloric the meal, the higher the peak
and the longer it takes the body to clear excess triglycerides from
the blood. And since triglycerides raise the risk of clotting,
having too much in the blood for too long could precipitate a heart
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Diets high in saturated fats (from meats and dairy foods),
sugars (including natural sugars in fruit), alcohol and refined
carbohydrates (white bread, white rice, etc.) can raise blood
levels of triglycerides. If people on a very low-fat diet replace
fats with sugars and refined starches, triglyceride levels may rise
and protective HDLs fall.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that if weight is not a problem, it may be
better to replace artery-clogging saturated fats with heart-healthy
olive and canola oils and to eat more fish rich in omega-3 fatty
acids like mackerel, sardines, herring, bluefish and salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Being overweight (particularly fat around the middle) and
sedentary also contributes to high levels of triglycerides. The
treatment here is obvious: Eat fewer calories and burn more through
exercise. It is also better for reducing triglyceride levels and
weight to consume many small nutritious meals a day instead of a
few large ones.
</P>
<P>
   Triglyceride levels may also rise somewhat in postmenopausal
women who take estrogen by mouth and in people who take bile acid
sequestrants, a common medication for lowering cholesterol.
</P>
<P>
   If dietary changes, weight loss and exercise fail to bring
elevated triglycerides down to a safe level, effective drug
treatment is available.

 &HT;    NEW PALESTINIAN COKE BOTTLER CALLS DEAL 'MAJOR EVENT' FOR
NATION-BUILDING
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ The deal announced last week between the Coca-Cola
Co. and a Palestinian bottler might be strictly business for the
international soft-drink giant, but it's a symbol of growth here in
the cash-strapped West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking at is as a major event for Palestine,'' said
Zahi Khouri, chairman of the National Beverage Company Ltd., a
bottler based in the West Bank city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
   ``We consider any investment part of the nation-building
process,'' Khouri said.
</P>
<P>
   Khouri, a Palestinian-American with homes in New York and
Jerusalem's ancient, walled, Old City, owns restaurants in central
Florida, including Bennigan's and TGI Fridays. He has also, since
the signing of the Oslo peace accords in 1993, been a co-founder of
several major Palestinian businesses in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Atlanta-based Coca-Cola announced that it was buying
15 percent of Khouri's beverage company -- which he said has a
capital value of about $20 million -- and granting it franchise
rights to sell its soft drinks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an Israeli company has the distributing rights. That
company, the Central Bottling Company, is at the center of a long
relationship which kept Coca-Cola Co. in Israel despite a now-ended
Arab boycott of companies dealing with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's agreement with the Palestinian bottler means the
Israeli bottler will lose its access to the nearly 3 million
residents of the West Bank and Gaza strip. Those areas were
captured by Israel in the 1967 and are now slowly being turned over
to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shackleton, country manager in Israel for Coca-Cola, said
the move was ``purely a business'' decision and not related to the
current political situation -- the eventual turnover of the area to
the Palestinians and the possible formation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He said Coca-Cola tries to use local bottlers in all of the
approximately 200 countries and territories where it sells the
popular soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pepsi-Cola said that early this year his company
granted limited distribution rights to a Palestinian bottler in
Gaza that may eventually be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign companies, such as restaurant chains, car
dealerships and a cellular phone company, have granted franchises
to Palestinian firms.
</P>
<P>
   The deals have come as U.S. and other foreign officials have
encouraged companies to deal directly with Palestinians, in part to
help an economy that many say has actually seen a per capita
downturn since the Oslo peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear to me that the political process
contributed,'' said Ephraim Kleinman, economics professor at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. ``I can only expect there will be more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Khouri and group of investors bought an existing bottler a year
ago and upgraded while it was negotiating with Coca-Cola.

GRAZING BILL: NO PUBLIC OVERSIGHT OF PUBLIC LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

(gm) 
 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With tiresome regularity, Congress drafts new grazing bills that
favor agricultural interests _ to the detriment of our public
lands. This year's giveaway applies to public lands managed by the
U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management.
</P>
<P>
   Misleadingly entitled ``The Forage Improvement Act'' (HR 2493),
forage is the last thing that will be improved by the bill. It has
already passed the U.S. House and now faces Senate committee
action.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, although 270 million acres of public lands are
involved, there will be no hearings or public testimony in the
Senate. There were no legislative hearings in House committees,
either. Congress doesn't want to hear any comments from the public
about the public's land. The message is, ``Shut up. We'll give away
your rights on public lands, and you'll like it.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced in the House last year by Rep. Bob
Smith, R-Ore., who from 1995 through 1996 received $183,502 or 42
percent of his campaign contributions from agricultural interests.
It's clear that this legislation has been bought.
</P>
<P>
   Federal grazing fees under this forage bill formula remain well
below state and private grazing fees schedules. There is no minimum
fee in the new complex formula. Current grazing fees on federal
land do not cover the government's cost for managing the grazing
program. This bill makes the problem worse. Taxpayers will have to
pick up the tab _ to the tune of $500 million or more.
</P>
<P>
   The forage bill will subsidize billionaire livestock owners like
William Hewlett of Hewlett-Packard and Oscar Wyatt, founder and CEO
of Coastal Corp., the nation's 12th largest oil company. It will
subsidize corporate cattle operations like those of Metropolitan
Life and Anheuser-Busch. Nine percent of the grazing permittees
control 60 percent of the forage on public lands. It's the rich who
are supported with taxpayer dollars in this scheme.
</P>
<P>
   To add insult to injury, HR 2493 prohibits members of the public
from monitoring their own public lands _ if those lands are leased
for grazing. If a hunter or sportsman sees the destruction of
riparian or wetlands areas, and he or she reports it, that
information cannot be used by the federal agency that is supposed
to oversee the public lands.
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service and the BLM do not have the personnel to
monitor the millions of acres used for grazing. These agencies
depend upon information provided by hikers, hunters, anglers,
university researchers, and environmental groups. HR 2493 only
allows federal agencies, lessees and permittees, and their paid
consultants to provide monitoring information to the federal
agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The taxpaying public subsidizes those who have grazing leases
and permits on the public lands, but the taxpaying public isn't
allowed to monitor those lands.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does the forage bill restrict who can monitor the
public lands used for grazing, it requires the federal agencies to
``provide reasonable notice of the monitoring to affected
permittees or lessees ... of not less than 48 hours.'' No other
public land user gets such notice _ not mining companies, not oil
companies, not those who hunt or fish or camp on public lands.
</P>
<P>
   Any bank robber would love to have 48-hour notice before police
monitored his activities. Most ranchers take care of their grazing
leases, but for those who don't, the 48-hour rule is an opportunity
to temporarily suspend or alter practices that harm fish and
wildlife or the land itself.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring section of HR 2493 prohibits federal agencies
from taking action even when there are severe problems or threats
to fish and wildlife unless the agencies have multiple years of
data collected over time that show poor management practices by a
permittee or lessee.
</P>
<P>
   Another section of the bill calls for ``an allotment management
plan'' on public lands on which grazing permits or grazing leases
have been granted. ``Allotment'' is a share or portion given out of
a common holding, according to ``Black's Law Dictionary.'' The
language of the bill nudges a permit or lease into ownership.
</P>
<P>
   In a subtle way, the forage bill creates a grazing right where
there should only be a privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The allotment management plan would allow livestock to graze
unsupervised and uncontrolled _ even if public lands were seriously
damaged by overgrazing.
</P>
<P>
   It should be clear why Congress has not held public hearings on
HR 2493.
</P>
<P>
   Johanna Wald, attorney for the Natural Resources Defense
Council, calls this bill ``an attempt to turn back the clock to the
days when the livestock operators and permittees were calling the
shots on the public lands and the public was totally out of the
loop.''
</P>
<P>
   This grazing bill, if passed, will only lead to more acrimony
and litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt sent a letter to Rep.
Smith in February saying that the Department of the Interior would
recommend that the president veto the House version of the grazing
bill. Since the Senate bill is exactly the same, the threat of veto
remains.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better for everyone if this bill died quietly in the
Senate.

SCIENCE Q &AMP; A: WEATHER FORECASTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By C.CLAIBORNE RAY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forecast: Cloudy
</P>
<P>
   Q. When weather forecasters say there is a 50 percent chance of
rain tomorrow, what does that mean? And how far ahead can a
reliable forecast be made?
</P>
<P>
   A. When the National Weather Service forecasters use the term
``probability of precipitation,'' they mean that in 10 instances of
weather patterns similar to the one they are looking at, it rained
five times, said Sam Perugini, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania
State University.
</P>
<P>
   The service keeps cumulative records, and the probability
forecast is a statistic based on what has happened, he said. For
example, if a cold front is expected in mid-July in late afternoon,
and it has rained 7 out of 10 times that such a situation occurred,
there is a 70 percent chance of rain. The forecast covers
precipitation at any time in a stated period, like today, tonight
and tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   As to how far ahead it is practical to forecast, Perugini said:
</P>
<P>
   ``We can be very accurate up to about three days or so, in my
opinion. You can say that tomorrow will be sunny, with a high of
92, but after that, for four to seven days ahead, the way that one
presents what information we know has to be different. You give
more of a range.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can give a sense of what the weather might be like up to
two weeks in advance as a trend, like wet or dry, warmer than
normal or below normal, based on a pattern that favors hot and dry
or a pattern that favors cool and dry. But the specifics we don't
know.''

15 percent of Khouri's beverage company -- which he said has a
capital value of about $20 million -- and granting it franchise
rights to sell its soft drinks in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, an Israeli company has the distributing rights. That
company, the Central Bottling Company, is at the center of a long
relationship which kept Coca-Cola Co. in Israel despite a now-ended
Arab boycott of companies dealing with the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   Coca-Cola's agreement with the Palestinian bottler means the
Israeli bottler will lose its access to the nearly 3 million
residents of the West Bank and Gaza strip. Those areas were
captured by Israel in the 1967 and are now slowly being turned over
to Yasser Arafat's Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Shackleton, country manager in Israel for Coca-Cola, said
the move was ``purely a business'' decision and not related to the
current political situation -- the eventual turnover of the area to
the Palestinians and the possible formation of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
   He said Coca-Cola tries to use local bottlers in all of the
approximately 200 countries and territories where it sells the
popular soft drink.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pepsi-Cola said that early this year his company
granted limited distribution rights to a Palestinian bottler in
Gaza that may eventually be expanded.
</P>
<P>
   Other foreign companies, such as restaurant chains, car
dealerships and a cellular phone company, have granted franchises
to Palestinian firms.
</P>
<P>
   The deals have come as U.S. and other foreign officials have
encouraged companies to deal directly with Palestinians, in part to
help an economy that many say has actually seen a per capita
downturn since the Oslo peace agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quite clear to me that the political process
contributed,'' said Ephraim Kleinman, economics professor at Hebrew
University in Jerusalem. ``I can only expect there will be more and
more.''
</P>
<P>
   Khouri and group of investors bought an existing bottler a year
ago and upgraded while it was negotiating with Coca-Cola.

 By CLAUDIA DREIFUS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Marvin Minsky, 71, a rumpled-looking man who wears shirts
mended together with masking tape, is Toshiba professor of media
arts and sciences, and professor of electrical engineering and
computer sciences at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and
one of the world's leading theorists of artificial intelligence.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, Minsky and John McCarthy, a professor of
computer science at Stanford University, founded a research program
that would evolve into the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.
In addition to inventing and building thinking-machines, Minsky
wrote the classic ``The Society of Mind,'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1986)
in which he tries to show how intelligence works ``by the
particular way the agents in the brain have evolved to interact.''
``The Turing Option,'' (Warner Books, 1992) a novel by Minsky and
Harry Harrison, is about superintelligence in not-too-far-off 2023.
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1960s, science students, particularly those at MIT,
talked of artificial intelligence, or AI, as if it would create
world revolution. Were they too optimistic?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, it got stuck. AI was able to produce all kinds of
wonderful things ... programs that did better than the average
stockbroker or portfolio manager, programs that could fix some
piece of equipment. Around 1980, progress stopped in some ways and
people went off in a number of other directions to try to find some
way to get back. It stopped because we'd done the easy things. In
the eye of eternity, it got stuck for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   A good example is, in 1964 or 1965, one of our students, Daniel
Bobrow (now a vice president at the Xerox Corp.) wrote a program
that could read a question from a high school algebra book, and
sometimes, solve the problem. So it could figure out a little bit
of language and algebra. It didn't get most of the problems because
it couldn't understand the words.
</P>
<P>
   What people tried to do then is get a program that would read a
story from a first- or second-grade children's book. But what
happened was this: For any particular story, we could build into
the program the knowledge necessary to read that story. We didn't
have much trouble with the grammar. As soon as something was
mentioned that the program didn't know about ... (the system broke
down).
</P>
<P>
   One MIT student had a story where some person's daughter was
kidnapped by the Mafia and they demanded a ransom. So he asked the
program ``What should we do?'' The program couldn't understand.
Finally, it asked, ``Why would he pay MONEY to get his daughter
back?''
</P>
<P>
   It could figure out a little bit of language, a little bit of
algebra. It didn't get most of the problems because it couldn't
understand the words. As far as I know, nobody has been able to get
a machine to solve real problems that are informally expressed, the
way somebody would normally express them.
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do you define common sense?
</P>
<P>
   A. Common sense is knowing maybe 30 or 50 million things about
the world and having them represented so that when something
happens, you can make analogies with others. If you have common
sense, you don't classify the things literally; you store them by
what they are useful for or what they remind us of.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, I can see that suitcase (over there in a corner)
as something to stand on to change a light bulb as opposed to
something to carry things in.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Could you get machines to the point where they can deal with
the intangibles of humanness?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's very tangible, what I'm talking about. For example, you
can push something with a stick, but you can't pull it. You can
pull something with a string, but you can't push it. That's common
sense. And no computer knows it. Right now, I'm writing a book, a
sequel to ``The Society of Mind,'' and I am looking at some of
this. What is pain? What is common sense? What is falling in love?
</P>
<P>
   Q. What is love?
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, what are emotions? Emotions are big switches, and there
are hundreds of these. ... If you look at a book about the brain,
the brain just looks like switches. ... You can think of the brain
as a big supermarket of goodies that you can use for different
purposes. Falling in love is turning on some 20 or 30 or these and
turning a lot of the others off. It's some particular arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   To understand it, one has to get some theory of what are the
resources in the brain, what kind of arrangements are compatible
and what happens when you turn several on and they get into
conflict. Being angry is another collection of switches. In this
book, I'm trying to give examples of how these things work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Q. In the 1968 Stanley Kubrick film ``2001: A Space Odyssey,'' a
computer named Hal developed a lethal jealousy of his space
companion, a human astronaut. How far are we away from a jealous
machine?
</P>
<P>
   A. We could be five minutes from it, but it would be so stupid
that we couldn't tell. Though Hal is fiction, why shouldn't he be
jealous? There's an argument between my friend John McCarthy and me
because he thinks you could make smart machines that don't have any
humanlike emotions.
</P>
<P>
   But I think you're going to have to go to great lengths to
prevent them from having some acquisitiveness and the need to
control things. Because to solve a problem, you have to have the
resources and if there are limited resources ...
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where were Stanley Kubrick and his co-author, Arthur C.
Clarke, right with their ``2001: Space Odyssey'' predictions?
</P>
<P>
   A. On just about everything except for the date. It's quite a
remarkable piece.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you believe the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration wastes money by insisting on humans for space
exploration?
</P>
<P>
   A. It's not that they waste money. It's that they waste ALL the
money.
</P>
<P>
   Q. If you were heading NASA, how would you run it?
</P>
<P>
   A. I would have a space station, but it would be unmanned. And
we would throw some robots up there that are not intelligent, but
just controlled through teleoperators and you could sort of feel
what's doing. Then, we could build telescopes and all sorts of
things and perhaps explore the moon and Mars by remote control.
Nobody's thought of much use for space. The clearest use is
building enormous telescopes to see the rest of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Why are manned shots a NASA priority?
</P>
<P>
   A. Because NASA's people are basically oriented toward keeping
themselves alive. They are a big organization. And the biggest part
of it is Houston and that has to be fed, and what Houston is good
at is putting men in space. The Jet Propulsion Lab is much smaller
and has a smaller staff and is good at doing everything else.
</P>
<P>
   So, I think, in order to support that, they get into this
vicious circle where you have to convince yourself that's what the
public wants. Now, I think, the public is more excited by Sojourner
than by astronauts.
</P>
<P>
   Q. When you go to the movies, what do you see?
</P>
<P>
   A. ``Terminator,'' ``Total Recall,'' which had ideas about
implanted memory. Pretty clumsy, but I loved the engineering. I
don't like movies exactly. One of my rules is not to think of the
whole thing as having any unity. The idea of liking a whole movie
is ... People have this idea that they have to like something or
not.
</P>
<P>
   Q. What do you read?
</P>
<P>
   A. Science fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Do you read science fiction in the same way spies read spy
novels _ for ideas?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes. There are a dozen very, very rich sources of ideas out
there. Gregory Benford of UC. Irvine, David Brin, Larry Niven are
the best writers of our period. When they write a book, there's
some big new idea about something. I've also gotten a lot of good
ideas from old-timers like Robert Heimlein and the late Isaac
Asimov.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Where was Mary Shelley right and where was she wrong with her
``Frankenstein'' last century?
</P>
<P>
   A. She certainly was right in predicting how people would not
understand the poor thing. That's SUCH a sad story! By the way,
I've gone through that book very carefully to see if she left any
hints explaining how the robot worked. But alas, no clues and the
funny part is when you read it, you don't mind. &QL;

WARNINGS NOT DETERRING MANY FROM TRYING TO SLIP INTO UNITED STATES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BARRY SHLACHTER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARRIZO SPRINGS, Texas _ The body, blackened by the sun, lay
sprawled below a game fence 25 miles from the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   The young man in the red ball cap and brown jeans might have
gone undiscovered were it not for three fellow Mexicans. After
stumbling onto the body Friday, they decided to report it to
authorities even though they knew it would mean being caught and
sent back across the border,
</P>
<P>
   ``When we saw it, we got scared that it could happen to us,''
explained Miguel Juarez Comener, 28, of Guanajuato, Mexico, who
said he once worked in the kitchen of a Ninfa's restaurant in
Lewisville, Texas. His last job in Mexico was in construction and
paid the equivalent of $40 a week, not enough to support a family.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-year-old who perished became the latest undocumented
immigrant claimed by the searing Texas sun while trying to slip
into the United States. Since mid-May, 51 people desperate for work
have died of heat-related causes in Texas, according to the U.S.
Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican media have been reporting the cases _ of those who
died and those who have been rescued by Border Patrol agents, who
now routinely carry 5-gallon jugs of ice water. Many agents have
also been trained to treat dehydration, and the Border Patrol has
launched a ``Stay Out, Stay Alive'' campaign that includes public
service announcements and fliers aimed at Mexico and Central
America.
</P>
<P>
   But the cautionary tone of Mexican news reports has not made a
dent in the number of people attempting to find jobs in Texas,
Tennessee, Illinois and North Carolina, agents said. Apprehensions
of undocumented immigrants in the Border Patrol's Del Rio sector
now average 356 a day, up 20 percent from a year ago, said Paul
Berg, chief patrol agent for the sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what the aliens tell us, the stories of heat deaths have
had no impact at all,'' said Ben Poncedeleon, 35, a Border Patrol
intelligence officer assigned to the Carrizo Springs station.
</P>
<P>
   Last week near Quemado (Spanish for burnt), a town between Del
Rio and Eagle Pass, agents chased down three undocumented workers,
although two got away.
</P>
<P>
   One of those caught, his long-sleeved knit shirt stained white
with dried sweat, said he had heard the news reports but didn't
realize how bad the heat was.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made the sign of the cross, made a little prayer and said,
`Let's go,''' said Ismail Ruiz, 19, of Torreon, Mexico, who wore
two wooden crosses under his shirt.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had known it was like this, I would never have come,'' he
said through an interpreter. ``I carried a milk jug and filled it
up at a cattle tank, but it wasn't enough water.''
</P>
<P>
   The body found Friday was the second dead heat victim removed
from the sprawling Farias Ranch this month, said its manager, Harry
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two weeks ago, a group of 12 walked up to the house and said a
man was very sick,'' Kelly said. ``When I got there, I checked his
pulse, but he was dead already. The others all wanted to go back.
Five of them were in pretty bad shape and couldn't walk anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Stepped-up operations in sectors to the north and south have
made Carrizo Springs and the rest of the Del Rio sector an
ever-more popular crossing area, although it comprises only about a
quarter of Texas' border with Mexico, Berg said. Patrols taper off
north of Carrizo Springs, a small ranching community 44 miles
southeast of Eagle Pass and the county seat of Dimmit County. If
undocumented workers make it past Carrizo Springs, most can make it
to Crystal City, San Antonio or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   The heavy traffic through the area, combined with the 100-plus
temperatures, has meant that 26 _ more than half _ of the
heat-related deaths among undocumented immigrants have occurred in
his sector, Berg said. Last year, the Del Rio sector recorded just
nine deaths from all causes, including drowning, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Inexplicably, there are more ``runners'' _ undocumented workers
who try to flee when spotted _ near Carrizo Springs than elsewhere,
Poncedeleon said.
</P>
<P>
   But the heat can be an ally of the green-uniformed agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``As soon as they see the helicopter, they drop their water and
make a 300-yard sprint and, because of the heat, they just can't
run any farther,'' said Mark Douglas, an agent who has recovered
two victims of fatal heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Some undocumented workers travel in groups led by paid guides,
known as ``coyotes.'' Others, like Jose Reyes Alvarez, who had
crossed before, risk it on their own. But many didn't count on the
unusually harsh weather this year, Poncedeleon said.
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez, a thin 19-year-old with a wispy mustache and goatee,
emerged from the desert brush after three days and gave himself up
at a highway. Heat exhaustion and brackish water had made him too
ill to go on.
</P>
<P>
   Some undocumented workers say ranchers put deworming chemicals
in the man-made ponds where herds water, said Adolfo Tapia, 38, a
Border Patrol supervisor. To ``purify'' the water, they drop in
lemon and Salde Uvas Picot, a fizzy Mexican patent medicine that
competes with Alka-Seltzer, he said. But rancher Kelly said tank
water can be unfit for humans simply because it's stagnant.
</P>
<P>
   On being picked up, Alvarez immediately reported passing a woman
overcome by heat, prompting a dogged, morning-long search by Border
Patrol agents in a helicopter, trucks, off-road vehicles and on
foot.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Randy Reinhardt steered his Ford Expedition through the
rugged ranchland, bounced past a half-eaten can of beans and a half
jug of yellowish water abandoned by Alvarez. At points, Poncedeleon
and agent Trey Leigh walked miles in the blistering heat to find
any trace of the lost woman.
</P>
<P>
   Roadrunners, wild turkeys, jack rabbits and Santa Gertrudis
cattle crossed the agents' path.
</P>
<P>
   After hours of peering at markings in the dusty ranch roads that
the veteran agents have learned to read, Reinhardt found the
woman's footprints near a bridge. He also found tire tracks. ``She
was picked up,'' he said. ``Vehicle tracks are on top of hers.
That's good news.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez was trying to make his way back to North Carolina where
he had worked in a furniture plant that employed 200 workers. He
planned to marry in January, and his fiance had urged him not to
risk the heat by heading north. To him, it was the difference
between a barely subsistence wage of $35 a week as a carpenter in
Mexico or $450 a week in Candor, N.C., he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had heard about those who had died crossing,'' said the
youth, whose father grows corn and alfalfa on a 116-acre farm _ not
enough to support an extended family, which now includes four sons
living legally in the United States. ``But I needed money to get
married.''
</P>
<P>
   On his first trip, Alvarez paid a guide $600 to smuggle him
across. ``Last time, it was only an hour walk and the coyote had
arranged transport. The coyote doesn't work anymore, and since I'd
done it before, I thought I could do it myself. I have family in
Houston. Once across, I could phone relatives and they could pick
me up,'' he said through an interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   The Rio Grande was chest-high where Alvarez crossed, stripped to
his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``In one hand I held up my suitcase and swam with the other,''
he said. In his suitcase was a jug, which he filled with river
water. Later, he filled it at an irrigation canal. He was sick for
two days, sleeping in the open, killing a rattlesnake with a rock
at one point, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That water made me throw up. But I kept drinking it. I had
nothing else. I felt so bad I went to the road and gave myself
up.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back of Reinhardt's Expedition, Alvarez said his aborted
quest hasn't left him despondent. ``I don't feel too bad because I
was sick.''
</P>
<P>
   Nursing a water bottle, the youth asserted that he wouldn't risk
another crossing but would return to his girlfriend in central
Mexico. But if he did, Alvarez said, he'd carry more water and less
clothes. ``I'd be more careful where I'd cross and I'd carry at
least four (gallon) jugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to drink a lot of water in this heat.''

EXPLAINING THE DIVERSITY OF BEETLES: IT'S WHAT THEY EAT

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Swarming the world in a dazzling array of shapes, colors and
sizes from gargantuan Goliath beetles to jewel-like tortoise
beetles to dearly familiar ladybugs, beetles, with more species
than any other plant or animal group on earth, are the undeniable
rulers of the planet.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so overwhelming is the diversity of these creatures
that it is the subject of what has been called evolutionary
biology's best known (and perhaps only) one-liner. According to
lore, in the middle of this century, British biologist, J.B.S.
Haldane, when asked by a group of theologians what one could glean
about the Creator from a study of His creation, is said to have
replied, ``an inordinate fondness for beetles.'' Yet despite a
longstanding fascination with these armored beasts, biologists have
been able to do little more than speculate about how the 330,000
known species of beetles have come to dominate the living world.
</P>
<P>
   Now a study in the latest issue of Science, says that the secret
to the diversity of beetles lies in what they eat.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Brian D. Farrell, a curator at the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard University, has shown that those groups of
beetles that long ago evolved to eat flowering plants spun off
thousands of species, many more than those beetles that continued
to eat more primitive and less diverse plants. By feasting on
flowering plants, which evolved to become the world's most diverse
group of plants and includes nearly all the familiar species, among
them apple trees, orchids and grasses, the beetles were apparently
able themselves to produce many species.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, researchers say the study explains the diversity not
only of beetles, but of the many insects that have evolved to chew,
suck and otherwise devour flowering plants. Plants and the insects
that eat them are two groups whose diversity demands explanation
because together they make up more than half of all known species.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the classic scenario,'' said Farrell, referring to the
well-accepted notion that the evolution of new species adapting to
unexplored habitats or new ways of life accounts for much of the
diversity of life. ``Here was this huge, underexploited resource,
the flowering plants. Insects that were able to evolve to make the
shift to eat them, enjoyed the fruits, so to speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, the new study provides an answer to one
of the most fundamental, and difficult to address, questions in
biology: Why are there so many species on earth? The reason appears
to be simple: Diversity begets diversity. In fact, it may be no
coincidence that the flowering plants are themselves so diverse,
because the beetles and other insects attacking them might have
provided pressure for the evolution of new, better-defended plant
species.
</P>
<P>
   More plants spawn more beetles. More beetles may spawn more
plants, as well as more parasites on beetles or more predators,
which in turn spawn creatures that eat those predators and on and
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we all believe in and we all think is so,''
said Dr. John N. Thompson, evolutionary biologist at Washington
State University and a fellow at the National Center for Ecological
Analysis and Synthesis in Santa Barbara, Calif. ``This is one of
the best pieces of data we have to show that what we all believe
really is so.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Douglas Futuyma, evolutionary biologist at the State
University of New York at Stony Brook, said of the new study,
``This is going to make quite an impact. The magnitude of the work
is astonishing.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell constructed an evolutionary tree including more than 100
species representing the many kinds of beetles that eat plants. He
used DNA sequence data and data on the shapes of beetle species to
determine which species are most closely related and which are not.
</P>
<P>
   By examining this family tree, Farrell could look at groups of
close relatives and see which had continued eating older, primitive
plants known as gymnosperms, which include pine trees and other
conifers, cycads and ginkgoes, and which beetles had begun eat the
more recently evolved flowering plants. In every case, groups of
beetles that switched to eating flowering plants were more diverse
than their gymnosperm-eating counterparts, in one case a thousand
times more diverse.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers had long theorized that one of the great engines
driving the evolution of diversity was a process known as
co-evolution, a kind of tit-for-tat process in which species adapt
or spin off new species as the species they interact with evolve.
The process was articulated 34 years ago by Dr. Paul Ehrlich at
Stanford University and Dr. Peter Raven at the Missouri Botanical
Garden.
</P>
<P>
   Ehrlich, Bing professor of population studies, said of the new
study, ``This is a nice confirmation that interactions are
important in the diversity of life.''
</P>
<P>
   It is particularly nice because, in recent years, the theory of
co-evolution had fallen on hard times, in large part because of a
study published in 1993 in Science by Dr. Conrad C. Labandeira,
paleobiologist at the National Museum of Natural History at the
Smithsonian Institution and colleague Dr. Jack Sepkoski, a
paleobiologist at the University of Chicago. The two researchers
found that in the fossil record, the numbers of insect families,
large groups of many insect species, did not increase with the
appearance of flowering plants, suggesting that insect diversity
was not associated with the diversification of the plants they ate.
</P>
<P>
   But Labandeira, calling the new study ``very significant,''
agreed with Farrell that their respective studies did not conflict.
The earlier study, he said, looked at insect families, while the
current study looks at the numbers of insect species. Labandeira
said that his continuing study of fossil species would likely
corroborate the new findings.
</P>
<P>
   Some questions remain about the species-rich beetles. As Dr. May
Berenbaum, evolutionary ecologist at the University of Illinois at
Urbana-Champaign notes, it remains a mystery why beetles
diversified so much more wildly than other insects or even mammals
whose mainstay is also the shoots, roots, leaves, flowers or seeds
of these plants.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most surprising result was the discovery that while
some beetles evolved many new species that could eat the evolving
new plant species, other beetles were remarkably conservative in
their eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   At the base of the beetle family tree, Farrell found a number of
ancient lineages of leaf beetles, snout beetles and long-horned
beetles that still eat the primitive gymnosperms that they ate 200
million years old when dinosaurs ruled the earth. Farrell said
these ancient associations are the oldest plant-insect antagonisms
known. In Argentina, where beetles still eat Araucaria, an ancient
lineage of gymnosperms, scientists have even turned up fossil
Araucaria plants chewed up by ancestors of these beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers described the findings as ``astonishing'' and
``extraordinary.'' Labandeira said, ``It's something that a lot of
people probably would not believe. People think that these
associations are very volatile.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason, said Dr. Berenbaum, is that insects are known to be
able to evolve extremely quickly. They have been observed to evolve
insecticide resistance or to switch to eat plant species newly
arrived in their habitat, in contrast to the monotonously
consistent life style of some ancient beetles.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell simply called the community, ``a little Triassic Park.''
</P>
<P>
   Evidence exists that other ancient lineages of moths and
hymenoptera, a group that includes bees and wasps, also eat old
lineages of plants, suggesting that many associations between the
eaters and the eaten persist intact from the deep past. What makes
these associations so stable, whether it is somehow very difficult
for these insects to evolve tastes for new foods, or whether these
ancient plants are too good a treat for some insects to give up
remains a mystery.

THE ICE MASS GOETH?  
 AN UNKIND CUT IN MONGOLIA  
 WHAT STARS EAT FOR DINNER 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The reason water does not slosh through the streets of New York
City or Miami is that it is safely locked up as ice in the West
Antarctic ice sheet. Whether the ice sheet will forever stay that
way no longer seems such a bed-rock certainty.
</P>
<P>
   Pine Island Glacier, a major ice stream that flows into the
Amundsen Sea, has been in retreat for the last four years,
according to a report in this week's Science by Dr. E.J. Rignot of
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   The glacier has a hinge line, the point at which its projecting
tongue leaves the sea bed and starts to float. The floating tongue
is lifted slightly by the ocean tides, and these small heaves and
swells can be detected by radar satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Rignot calculates that the hinge line retreated by three-fourths
of a mile a year from 1992 to 1996, the period for which data are
available.
</P>
<P>
   Because glaciers behave erratically, a four-year record is
insufficient to predict a trend. But Rignot's observations may send
a shiver through climatologists: Pine Island Glacier has been
identified as an Achilles heel of the West Antarctic ice sheet and
a possible trigger for its disintegration.
</P>
<P>
   The melting of the ice sheet might cause an estimated 15-foot
rise in sea level. But that could seem a mere inconvenience
compared with climatic shifts of the past, such as the Grand
Coupure (the Big Cut) that hit Europe 34 million years ago. The
inhabitants of Europe were then mostly perissodactyls, the order of
mammals that includes the rhino and the extinct brontothere or
thunderbeast.
</P>
<P>
   During the Grand Coupure, the entire fauna of Europe changed as
the thunderbeasts and their kind succumbed to a sharp cold phase in
the world's climate.
</P>
<P>
   An Unkind Cut in Mongolia
</P>
<P>
   A counterpart to the Big Cut has now been documented in
Mongolia. With the transition from warm humid conditions to a cold,
arid climate, the Mongolian brontotheres also disappeared and were
succeeded by rodents and hares, according to a fossil survey
reported in this week's Nature by Jin Meng of the University of
Massachusetts and Malcolm C. McKenna of the American Museum of
Natural History. Meng and McKenna propose that this dramatic
makeover of Asian fauna be called the Mongolian Remodeling.
</P>
<P>
   The forces that drove the Grand Coupure and the Mongolian
Remodeling would also have shaped critical events in the evolution
of primates, but details remain to be uncovered.
</P>
<P>
   What Stars Eat for Dinner
</P>
<P>
   The triumphs and tragedies unearthed by paleontologists are
trivial affairs compared with the titanic events that are
astronomers' daily bread. A satellite that scans the skies for
X-rays has turned up a hellish star in the constellation
Sagittarius. Four hundred times a second, the star emits a burst of
X-rays powerful enough to be detected from Earth, 12,000
light-years away.
</P>
<P>
   A slight tremor in these bursts betrays the presence of an
invisible captive, a companion star so close that it orbits the
X-ray pulsar every two hours. A stream of gas is ripped off the
captive star, generating the X-ray bursts as it hits a hot spot on
the pulsar's speeding surface.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers calculate the cannibalization has been in process
for more than 100 million years. As the pulsar acquires extra mass,
its spin increases, accounting for the extraordinary speed of
rotation now observed. Presumably the captive star will be
completely consumed eventually, leaving its voracious host spinning
in solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Theorists have long surmised that fast-spinning pulsars must
have been spun up by some vanished companion. This is the first
time that one has been caught in the act.
</P>
<P>
   The Sagittarius pulsar is reported in this week's Nature by
Dutch and American astronomers. The Dutch team discovered the
pulsar, but the Americans first detected its captive companion. The
Americans might have found the pulsar first, brags a statement put
out by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, had not their
leader, Edward H. Morgan, been kept out of his office by a flat
tire on the morning the initial data from the satellite came
through.

WHEN MEDICINE GOES TOO FAR IN THE PURSUIT OF NORMALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 Alice Dreger, professor of science and technology at Michigan State
University, wrote ``Hermaphrodites and the Medical Invention of
Sex,'' (Harvard University Press, 1998).  
 By ALICE DREGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I realized recently that I suffer from a genetic condition.
Although I have not actually had my genome screened, all the
anatomical signs of Double-X Syndrome are there. And while I could
probably handle the myriad physiological disorders associated with
my condition _ bouts of pain and bleeding coming and going for
decades, hair growth patterns that obviously differ from ``normal''
people's _ the social downsides associated with it are troubling.
</P>
<P>
   Even since the passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act,
people with Double-X remain more likely than others to live below
the poverty line, more likely to be sexually assaulted, and are
legally prohibited from marrying people with the same condition.
</P>
<P>
   Some potential parents have even screened fetuses and aborted
those with Double-X in an effort to avert the tragic life the
syndrome brings. Perhaps you know Double-X by its more common name:
womanhood.
</P>
<P>
   This fact of my ``genetic condition'' came to me one evening as
I sat in a conference room of our local hospital participating in a
community dialogue sponsored by the Human Genome Project. Our group
had just finished reading a rather bleak description of the anatomy
and life of the ``average'' woman with Turner's syndrome: ``webbed
neck, short stature, no chance for bearing children'' and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Turner's syndrome, which affects roughly one in 2,500 girls born
each year, arises when a person is born with a single X chromosome
and no Y. It is, essentially, a ``single-X syndrome.''
</P>
<P>
   Our group was discussing the genetic screening of
pre-implantation embryos, and given the depressing description of
Turner's provided to us, no wonder most everyone in the room,
pro-choicers and pro-lifers alike, saw Turner's as a sad genetic
disease.
</P>
<P>
   But I had by then been studying human intersexuality _
anatomical sexual variations, including Turner's _ for several
years, and had talked with and read the biographies and
autobiographies of many people born intersexed. I knew that women
with Turner's would describe their lives with more balance.
</P>
<P>
   So I began to think about how a woman with single-X and a sense
of humor could describe the life of those of us women with
double-X, and came up with the above portrayal.
</P>
<P>
   My point is not that people with unusual genetic conditions do
not suffer more than those without them; clearly, many do. But I am
troubled that I see ever more cases in which psychosocial problems
caused by stereotypes about anatomy are being ``fixed'' by
``normalizing'' the anatomy. There are serious downsides to this,
both for the person being ``normalized'' and for those around her.
</P>
<P>
   Take for example the ``treatment'' of short stature. Some
pharmaceutical companies and physicians have advocated giving human
growth hormone injections to very short children in an attempt to
help them grow taller than they otherwise would. Profound short
(and tall) stature may lead to disorders like back problems because
our culture structures the physical world for average-height
adults. But no one advocates using the hormone to prevent back
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone treatments are used because of the presumption that an
adult of short stature will not fare as well socially as one of
average size. Indeed, statistically, taller men are more likely
than shorter men to be hired, given a raise or elected president.
Average-sized people see short people and tend to feel sorry for
them. Getting short children to grow more seems pretty beneficent.
</P>
<P>
   The same kind of intended beneficence drives the medical
management of children born intersexed. Many physicians assume that
intersexed children, with their unusual genitalia, will be rejected
by family and peers. So they recommend early cosmetic surgery to
try to erase the signs.
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with these ``normalization'' technologies? First,
it isn't clear that they work. It seems that if an unusual anatomy
leads to a psychosocial problem, ``normalizing'' the anatomy should
solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   But of the few follow-up studies that have been done on intersex
surgeries, none examine the psychological well-being of the
subjects in any real depth. Most simply report on the status of the
postsurgical anatomy, while a very few report on whether the
subjects are married (psychological health is presumed from this).
</P>
<P>
   Psychological follow-up on the growth hormone treatments is
similarly lacking. A study published in the March 28 Lancet
reported that a randomized trial of the hormone in ``short normal
girls'' resulted in the treated girls' averaging a final height of
almost three inches more than the control group, but added that
``no significant psychosocial benefits have yet been shown.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps we should not expect measurable psychological benefits
from a gain of about three inches. Yet recall that the entire
``normalization'' treatment for short stature was designed to
produce psychological benefits.
</P>
<P>
   More worrisome than the loss of focus in these studies is the
fact that these treatments often backfire. Children subjected to
these kinds of treatments often report feelings of inadequacy and
freakishness as a direct result of their parents' and doctors'
attempts at normalization.
</P>
<P>
   And the treatments are not without physical risks. For example,
intersex surgeries all too frequently leave scarred, insensate,
painful and infection-prone genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   So anatomy-focused have we become that children with unusual
conditions are often not provided any professional psychological
counseling. Nor are their parents, who are dealing with their own
feelings of confusion, shame, grief and worry. The result is the
message that the problem is primarily anatomical and, by
consequence, a ``fault'' of the child and perhaps also the parents.
</P>
<P>
   By extension, a dictate then kicks in: If you can fix it, you
should. A friend of mine recalls the time a plastic surgeon came up
to him at a party, looked at his nose and said, ``You know, I can
fix that.'' When my friend said, ``No thanks,'' the plastic surgeon
appeared to think my friend a little crazy.
</P>
<P>
   As normalizing technologies become more accessible, people are
expected to be bothered by their ``unusual'' features and expected
to want to fix them.
</P>
<P>
   Some surgeons say they normalize intersexed children because it
is too hard to be different. One points out that we still live in a
nation where dark-skinned people have a harder time than
light-skinned people do. But would he suggest we work on
technologies to ``fix'' dark skin? Would we call people who refuse
to lighten their children cruel Luddites?
</P>
<P>
   The funny thing is, when I ask people with dark skin if they
would change their color, they tell me no, and when I ask women if
they would rather be men, they tell me no, and I get the same
response when I ask people with unusual anatomies if they would
take a magic pill to erase their unusual features.
</P>
<P>
   They tell me, instead, that they would support an end to social
stereotypes and oppression, but that they would not trade
themselves in for a ``better'' model. This sentiment even comes
from conjoined twins.
</P>
<P>
   Chang and Eng Bunker, the conjoined brothers born early in the
19th century and dubbed the Siamese twins, confessed that they
preferred their state because it enabled them to bring a ``double
strength and a double will'' to each purpose.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, women born with big clitorises confess to liking
their unusual anatomy. But this is the absolutely forbidden
narrative _ not only rejecting normalization but actively
preferring the ``abnormal.''
</P>
<P>
   What do I suggest? First, a few basic realizations. In spite of
medical advances, unusual anatomies generally cannot be fixed in
any significant way without significant risk, and that risk, when
medically unnecessary, should be approved by the person at risk.
</P>
<P>
   We also need to remember that just because it makes sense that
you ought to be able to fix anatomically based psychosocial
problems anatomically, that doesn't mean it is so. Working to
eliminate social stereotypes would be more effective and better for
everyone in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   I do not wish to see options entirely withdrawn from mature
patients; I am suggesting we slow down the normalization of
children, many of whom are likely to gain much more from acceptance
and psychological support than injections and scalpels.
</P>
<P>
   But how do we fix the social problems? When I talk about
intersex, people ask me, ``But what about the locker room?'' Yes,
what about the locker room? If so many people feel trepidation
around it, why don't we fix the locker room? There are ways to
signal to children that they are not the problem, and normalization
technologies are not the way.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of constantly enhancing the norm _ forever upping the
ante of the ``normal'' with new technologies _ we should work on
enhancing the concept of normal by broadening appreciation of
anatomical variation. Show potential parents, medical students and
genetic counselors images of unusual anatomies other than the
deeply pathologized ones they are typically given.
</P>
<P>
   Allow those with the unusual anatomies to describe their own
lives in full and rich detail. Even let them tell the forbidden
narrative of enjoying their Double-X Syndromes.

FIRE SAFETY FOR SHIPS AT SEA  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 2) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unlike the Titanic or the Andrea Doria, the Carnival cruise ship
Ecstasy lost not a single passenger or crew member. But in its
smaller way, the Ecstasy fire, which produced thick smoke that was
on hundreds of television newscasts, will probably contribute to
the evolution of marine safety.
</P>
<P>
   The time line of progress on marine safety reads as a perfect
counterpoint to tragedies afloat. After more than 1,000 people,
mostly children, died on an excursion aboard the General Slocum,
which caught fire in New York in 1904, requirements for lifesaving
gear and fire equipment were tightened.
</P>
<P>
   When more than 1,500 died on the Titanic in 1912, lifeboat
personnel were required to be certified, and an international
conference was called to approve a Convention on the Safety of Life
at Sea. The Andrea Doria-Stockholm crash in 1956, in which 52 died,
brought requirements that hulls be divided by steel bulkheads.
</P>
<P>
   With the Ecstasy, which was built with sprinklers, smoke
inhalation in corridors caused the only injuries, and they were
mild. (The investigators, at this writing, do not know if the
sprinklers were going to be effective in the fire, or if the
fireboats were essential. There were also complaints of confusion
and delay in informing passengers of the fire and the procedures to
follow.)
</P>
<P>
   There were no sprinklers aboard Commodore Cruise Line's Universe
Explorer, where five crew members died of smoke inhalation in a
1996 fire. That accident put the menace of smoke high on the list
at the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates
these events, and the Coast Guard, which controls ship safety for
American vessels and provides the United States delegates to the
negotiations on international maritime rules.
</P>
<P>
   There are many other ships without sprinklers, or even smoke
alarms that go off on the spot. Sometimes they are installed then
taken out _ in a laundry, for example _ because they go off too
often.
</P>
<P>
   Experts at the two government agencies are pressing urgently for
changes that insure better safety for cruise passengers, 80 percent
of them Americans. Most passengers presume that United States
standards are in force on ships that dock in Florida, Louisiana,
California, Washington State or even New York. But the giant cruise
ships, while they may be American owned, are all registered and
taxed in foreign countries, and covered by those countries'
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard does inspect ships that dock in the United
States, but only to verify that the vessel meets the standards of
the Convention on Safety of Life at Sea, or Solas. There should be
twice as many lifeboat seats as potential passengers, and life
jackets for 125 percent of capacity.
</P>
<P>
   The Coast Guard also inspects cruise ships' food facilities and
their hot tubs, under the direction of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   In severe cases, either for overall safety or for bad kitchen
conditions, the Coast Guard can keep a vessel from leaving an
American port. But it is rare, and the stringent safety rules that
govern inland ferries and riverboats do not apply.
</P>
<P>
   The Ecstasy, built in 1991, is registered in Liberia. Her owner,
Carnival, an American company, discussed in its 1997 annual report
why it believes she is virtually exempt from United States taxes.
Panama and the Bahamas also provide flags of convenience to
shipowners who find it more economical to register outside the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, a government report found that 74 percent of ships
visiting United States ports were registered in the Bahamas,
Liberia, Panama and Norway.
</P>
<P>
   Only one United States ocean-going cruise ship remains, American
Hawaii Cruises' Independence, and she is not subject to
international rules because she sails in the Hawaiian islands.
</P>
<P>
   Some ships that visit the United States are registered in
countries with venerable seagoing traditions, Britain, Italy and
Norway among them. But of Liberia, Barry Sweedler, head of the
office of safety recommendations and accomplishments at the
National Transportation Safety Board, said: ``What kind of
standards can it apply? Isn't it in the grip of civil war?''
</P>
<P>
   But just as mailing letters requires some international concords
about doing business, moving in international waters implies some
harmony on standards: signals, rights of way, communications and
rescue obligations.
</P>
<P>
   These basics are adopted by the International Maritime
Organization, a specialized agency of the United Nations set up in
1958, with headquarters in London. Its primary vehicle is Solas;
the most recent version, adopted in 1974, has been amended several
times.
</P>
<P>
   The rules, first designed to protect sailors, cover most aspects
of life at sea, such as load limits for ships and how tonnages are
measured. A passenger ship must be capable of being abandoned 30
minutes after a warning, for example, and lifeboats must be partly
covered to protect the passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Each country is responsible for certifying that ships bearing
its flags meet the requirements of Solas. Each nation delegates the
inspection task to a group called a classification society, which
is paid by the nation's shipowners to do the work.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The Solas cruise ship safety rules are now a patchwork because
the organization's delegates, representing national interests, are
reluctant to tell ship owners to modify existing ships; they would
rather lay down rules for new construction.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1994, for example, all new ships had to come out of
the yard with sprinklers and smoke alarm systems. But long phase-in
times were left for older ships.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent date for retrofitting requirements was October
1997. Solas fire protection rules at that point were nominally
applied to all ships built before October 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Sweedler said that his agency and the Coast Guard had gotten the
impression that there would be ``zero tolerance for noncompliance''
with rules requiring sprinklers, fire detection systems and smoke
alarms in all accommodations, including atriums, stairway
enclosures and corridors, plus self-closing doors. (In the Ecstasy
case, the 1997 rule was redundant, because Carnival had been
building in sprinkler systems on all of its ships since 1982.)
</P>
<P>
   But then, Sweedler said, American safety people began to
discover that the 1997 rule was not watertight. They learned that
15 vessels, including the Universe Explorer, whose laundry room
caught fire near Juneau on July 27, 1996, and the Vistafjord, which
lost a crew member in a linen room fire April 7, 1997, had sought
or received from their countries of registry what amounts to an
exemption from the requirement for sprinklers on board.
</P>
<P>
   The retrofitting rules permit older ships to postpone
installation of sprinklers until 2005 or 2009 provided they were
built of noncombustible materials and met other criteria. Owners
get this exemption by asking their flag nations _ the Bahamas,
Panama, Liberia _ to certify that the ship meets these criteria,
called Method I.
</P>
<P>
   If the exemption is granted, all the Coast Guard can then do to
protect passengers' safety is to verify that the Method I standards
have been met.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board conducted a gruelingly
detailed study of the Universe Explorer's failure to meet 30 of the
Method I criteria under which it was claiming an exemption. In
addition to the lack of sprinklers, for example, a bulkhead was
found to be missing between the laundry room and other areas, and
other repairs and replacements had been carried out with materials
that did not meet Method I rules.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Mayer, chief executive officer of Commodore Cruise Line in
Miami, said that the line was not required by the rules to install
sprinklers, but had a ``moral duty'' to do so. He said that this
work would be done in January 1999, if the design and parts were on
hand in time, or in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
   He said that his company relied on the certification of the
Universe Explorer by its classification society, because it could
not count each door and wall; the previous owner removed the
laundry room bulkhead, he said. It has been replaced now, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Sweedler said that detailed inquiries, like the one on the
Universe Explorer, showed the impossibility of declaring all
pre-1994 vessels fire-safe, either by virtue of sprinklers or by
virtue of construction methods and materials. He recommends a tough
road: that all potential passengers ask their travel agents if
their intended vessel has sprinklers, everywhere, including the
laundry room.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is too inconsistent to assess otherwise, as
Carnival's forward-looking decision in 1982 to build in sprinklers
demonstrates.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it is worth checking the brochure to learn the
country of registry of the ship and the date it went to sea. Ships
built before 1994 may have received exemption from the 1997
sprinkler requirement by claiming they conform to Method I
specifications.
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board points out that
continual modifications may have undone the validity of the claim,
for instance, through use of flammable putty or insulation
materials during a repair.

   Q.(italics)What hotels around Central Park can arrange for
guests who want to bring their dogs. I have two Chesapeake Bay
retrievers: one 70 pounds, one 80 pounds. _ Jack A. Grebb, Upper
Black Eddy, Pa.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Dog owners who want to be right on the park have a choice of
at least five hotels. While only three of them will not take dogs
as large as yours, there are also places a few blocks from the park
that will. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some hotels ask the owner to sign a waiver agreeing to pay for
damage done by the dog or charge a cleaning fee if a dog is a
guest. If there is a single criterion hotels agree on, it is that a
dog be well-behaved. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   While most of the hotels queried said that a dog did not have to
be in a carrier when the guest was out, some pointed out that if a
dog was free the housekeeping staff should not be expected to enter
a room.
</P>
<P>
   Rates here are for rooms, not suites, and apply to mid-August.  &QL;

   If you're planning to take your pet elsewhere in the city or
elsewhere in the United States, here are some helpful resources,
which include not only listings but also tips (playing a tape at
home of music that the dog finds relaxing and taking that tape to
play at your hotel, for example). &QL;

<P>
   Q.(italics)We are planning a bike trip to Brittany in France and
I am having a problem finding trains that take panniers. Can you
help? _ Patricia S. Ferrin, East Hampton, N.Y.(end italics) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Taking a bike aboard a train in France is hardly encouraged.
The high-speed trains known as TGVs do permit them if you don't
mind taking off the wheels and pedals, folding the handlebars in,
putting it all in a bag and finding an out-of-the-way spot to place
the bike. Some local trains have baggage cars with bike racks, but
a pannier packed with gear may not fit.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Ruth Marr, co-owner of Randonee Tours, says that because bikes
sent by train have sometimes arrived more than a day after the
biker, it's best to send a bike ahead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two alternatives to transporting a bike are taking a tour that
provides one and renting.
</P>
<P>
   There are far fewer tours of Brittany than, say, of Provence,
the Dordogne and Burgundy. Here are two companies with
Brittany-only tours. Prices are per person, based on double
occupancy. The hybrid bikes that both use combine the gearing
abilities of a mountain bike with the larger-diameter wheels of a
road bike. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butterfield &AMP; Robinson, 70 Bond Street, Toronto, Ontario M5B
1X3; (800) 678-1147 or (416) 864-1354, fax (416) 864-0541; Web site
www.butterfield.com. Seven-day tours, with six days of cycling,
starting and ending in Nantes, with an average of 30 to 35 miles a
day on flat or gently rolling terrain. Cost: $3,475, which includes
four-star hotels, 14 meals, services of guides and support van,
entrance fees and tips. Equipment: Cannondale 24-speed hybrid or
racing style.
</P>
<P>
   Space is available for Sept. 6. Prices for 1999 have not been
set, but departure dates have been: May 30, June 27, Aug. 29 and
Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Upon request, panniers can made available free. A front
handlebar bag and a rack on the back of the bike are standard
equipment. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Randonee Tours, 249 Bell Avenue, Winnipeg, Manitoba R3L 0J2;
(800) 465-6488 or (204) 475-6939, fax (204) 474-1888; Web site
www.randoneetours.com. Eight-day self-guided tours, with six days
of cycling, starting and ending in Guingamp, with 22 to 26 miles a
day on some hills of moderate difficulty daily. Cost: $1,060, which
includes two- and three-star hotels, seven meals and help a phone
call away.
</P>
<P>
   Equipment: A 21-speed hybrid bike, usually a Raleigh, Gitane or
Lapierre, with rear pannier, pump and puncture repair kit.
Departures any Thursday, Friday or Saturday until Sept. 26.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you want to rent a bike to do your own tour, Ms. Marr
suggests Bourgogne Randonee, in Beaune; (33-3) 80.22.06.03, fax
(33-3) 80.22.15.58. Arrangements can be made by Randonee Tours.
Charge: $10 (at 6 francs to the dollar) for one week plus shipping,
which depends on destination.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a pickup in Chartres and dropoff in Angers, in the
Loire Valley, would cost $127 plus a flat booking fee of $20.

   The State Department is warning Americans about flying on the
flag carrier of Bolivia, Lloyd Aereo Boliviano. The department said
that a number of recent incidents raised concerns about the
airline's safety practices, particularly with Boeing 727s used on
domestic routes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.S. Embassy has instructed its own personnel to minimize
use of these flights whenever possible,'' the State Department
said. ``It also recommends that all American travelers exercise
caution in the use of domestic air services within Bolivia.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An aviation attorney in Washington, Robert D. Papkin, who is
representing the airline, said that the State Department's warning
was unjustified. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``LAB believes it has always followed faithfully all required
standards, and recently had a complete review of the aircraft
conducted by an independent U.S. expert thoroughly familiar with
these aircraft, all of which are flying again with full government
approval.''

   Rangers at Crater Lake National Park in Oregon have closed the
hiking trail to the shore of the nation's deepest lake for most of
the summer so that a fuel line can be replaced, a project that has
also suspended tour-boat service until July 1999. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will be limited to viewing Crater Lake from the rim of
the caldera, 800 feet above the shoreline. The deep-blue lake, in
the Cascade Range of southern Oregon, reaches a depth of 1,932
feet, and is famous for its clear water. The shore is accessible by
a single dirt path, the milelong Cleetwood Trail, which leads to
Cleetwood Cove and the tour-boat dock. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction is expected to last until September, said John
Miele, a park spokesman. Keeping the hiking trail open during that
period would have been hazardous, he said. For information: (541)

   The new National Glass Center in Sunderland, 275 miles north of
London, is, appropriately, made mostly of glass, including a gently
sloping glass roof on which visitors can walk (still _ despite some
embarrassing cracks that have appeared in the roof, possibly design
flaws, possibly the work of vandals). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   All 80,000 square feet of the $27 million center, designed by
the London firm of Gollifer Associates and opened in June, is
devoted to glass and the many uses it has filled in the 1,300 years
since man first mixed sand, lime and fire. The city of Sunderland
is where, in 674, the first stained glass was manufactured for a
monastery. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Exhibition areas include the Kaleidescope Gallery, a permanent
display dealing with the history and manufacture of glass. The many
uses of glass are examined through exhibitions and interactive
displays. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A gallery devoted to temporary exhibitions is now showing
``Glass UK,'' a survey of the studio glass movement, founded in the
1960s when artists broke away from mass production. More than 130
works are are on view. Other highlights include demonstrations by
master artisans, as well as glassmaking classes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The center is open daily. Admission is $6, $3.40 for seniors,
students and children. The National Glass Center, Liberty Way,
Sunderland, SR6 0GL; (44-191) 515-5555. &QL;

   New summer schedules featuring longer hours are in effect at
many archelogical sites and museums in Greece, as a result of a
joint decision by the ministries of tourism and culture. Major
sites are open daily from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. until Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   In September and October the sites and museums will close an
hour earlier. The winter schedule has not been announced.
Previously, many museums closed for prolonged lunch breaks, and
afternoon hours varied. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The places affected are the National Archeological Museum and
the Acropolis in Athens, the Temple of Poseidon in Sounion,
Mycenae, Epidauros, Olympia, Delphi, Dion, the Archeological and
Byzantine Museums of Thessaloniki, Pella, the Palace of Knossos and
Irakleion Museum in Crete, Lindos and the Palace on Rhodes,
Mystras, the Venetian Fortress of Corfu and the Royal Tombs of
Vergina. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Archeological sites that also have museums, such as Olympia,
Delphi, Corinth and the Acropolis in Athens, may now charge only
one admission fee for both the museum and the archelogical site. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Information is available from the Greek National Tourist Office,

   The ice will creak, the wind will whistle and the air will be
cold when a simulated glacial crevasse and the rest of the
Mashantucket Pequot Museum in southeastern Connecticut opens on
Aug. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will see permanent exhibitions that move in time from
the ice age to the present, recounting the history of the Pequots,
the tribe that all but disintegrated before regrouping in the 1970s
and striking it rich with the Foxwoods Resort Casino in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   With $135 million from their casino profits and other sources,
the Pequots have built a 308,000-square-foot museum and research
center, a mile and a half from the casino, to tell their story and
that of the Eastern woodlands.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors will go through the glacier simulation to a
multisensory diorama depicting an 11,000-year-old caribou kill.
They'll walk though a 16th-century Pequot village with life-size
figures, village sounds and the aromas of forest and campfire; view
a 3-D computer model of the 17th-century Pequot fort that was
discovered in 1992 just outside the museum, and proceed outdoors to
a re-creation of an 18th-century farmstead. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequot Museum will also show 13 original films
about the Pequots and other Indian tribes, including ``The
Witness,'' which tells how the Pequots were devastated in the
Pequot War of 1636 to 1638. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The museum's temporary exhibition galleries will feature
contemporary Indian art, archeological artifacts and traveling
exhibitions. A 400-seat auditorium will present live performances
for the public and scholarly conferences on Native American issues.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant will feature Indian dishes, and the museum shop
will specialize in contemporary Native American arts and crafts.
</P>
<P>
   The Pequots are expecting 350,000 visitors a year, and a shuttle
service between the casino and the museum is planned.
</P>
<P>
   The Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center is at 110
Pequot Trail, Mashantucket, Conn.; (800) 411-9671. Open 10 a.m. to
7 p.m., seven days a week (last admission at 6 p.m.); closed
Christmas, Thanksgiving and New Year's Day. Admission: $10, $6 ages
6 to 15, $8 over 55. &QL;

BACH AS MOUNTAIN RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The idea was so preposterous that it hadn't even
occurred: What do you do for an encore after playing virtually all
the organ works of Bach? If you are Christopher Herrick (and not
many other people would try such a thing), you play two pieces
again, and two of the grandest.
</P>
<P>
   Herrick, a superb English organist whom it has been a pleasure
to get to know, finished his hourlong recital at Alice Tully Hall
on Sunday evening, his 14th in 14 days as part of the Lincoln
Center Festival, then added reprises from earlier evenings: the
great Fugues in G minor (BWV 542) and E flat (the ``St. Anne,'' BWV
552). Through almost the entire evening, Herrick was at the peak of
his considerable form, combining precision with panache,
interpretive freedom with a sheer joy in virtuosity.
</P>
<P>
   The playing was, in a word, triumphal, and appropriately so.
Here was shining confirmation, if such had still been needed, that
Herrick's splendid Hyperion recordings are not artificial products
of the studio; they represent a level of command that he can
achieve in concert and sustain throughout an evening.
</P>
<P>
   Understandably, it had not always seemed thus. Herrick achieved
a similar level at times on earlier evenings, as in a powerful
account of the imposing Passacaglia and Fugue in C minor, and on
the whole his playing through at least the 12 recitals I was able
to attend was excellent. But there were letdowns, sometimes for a
moment, sometimes for a work or much of an evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had quite a lot on my mind,'' Herrick said from the stage
on July 20, having just given a mildly distracted account of the
``Little'' G minor Fugue (BWV 578) to begin the second week of his
marathon. ``But this Monday I have only half as much on my mind as
last Monday.''
</P>
<P>
   The task was indeed Herculean, and Herrick had edged it into a
busy schedule only six months before, replacing the ailing New York
organist Donald Joyce, who died in March. Herrick had not only to
coax all the music back into his fingers and toes but also to
familiarize himself with the fine Kuhn organ in Tully Hall and work
out registrations to give each piece a distinctive sound and
character.
</P>
<P>
   When asked at a symposium last Wednesday evening about his daily
regimen during the festival, Herrick said that when hall
availability allowed, he would practice for three hours a day
before the recital and three hours after. ``I'm relieved to say
that I have just finished registering the last program,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, therefore, Herrick was occasionally shown at less
than his best, the more so because of the hall's dry and
unforgiving acoustics. So was all of this a good idea?
</P>
<P>
   You bet. A number of other people seemed to think so, too. (The
14 who claimed to have attended all 14 recitals were photographed
afterward onstage with Herrick.)
</P>
<P>
   For a listener _ unlike Herrick, who had to trudge every step _
it was like flying over a great mountain range: the Rockies, say.
The simile is overworked, to be sure, applied to everything from
the Beethoven piano sonatas to the Mahler symphonies, but it is apt
here. For unlike those bodies of work, which progress more or less
along a single axis, the impression here was of a motley profusion
sprawling in all directions: majestic conical peaks alternating
irregularly with smaller outcroppings of every imaginable shape,
even the odd scruffy hillock.
</P>
<P>
   For the Bach organ works, which come down mostly in copies by
other hands and present myriad problems of dating and authenticity,
no single line of development can be established. Nor is it
possible to view the entire range, to play the advertised
``complete'' canon, in any but the loosest sense. Yet Herrick
provided a convincing sense of an immense whole, suitably varied.
</P>
<P>
   His notions of what to include tended to follow recent
convention in, for example, omitting the ``harpsichord'' toccatas,
now thought by some to be organ works, and performing works of
disputed authenticity, like the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, which
ended the series Sunday. For that inclusion and others, Herrick
received strong and spirited support from the Bach authority
Christoph Wolff, who, at that symposium, decried ``the naivete with
which people declare, `This is Bach, and this is not.'''
</P>
<P>
   Herrick, in any event, made an eloquent case for everything he
played. At the first recital, he noted that in Hollywood movies,
the English are typically cast as bad guys or butlers, and stated
his willingness to serve as Bach's butler. In the end, he was more:
good guy, even hero.

   Tradition is getting a bit of a boot at the Salzburg Festival
this year. Rock music will jolt the Austrian city where Mozart was
born.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to performances of Verdi and Wagner and concerts by
the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra at the five-week event, which
starts on Friday, Gerard Mortier, the artistic director, who has
shaken up the festival since succeeding Herbert von Karajan in
1991, will stage the world premiere of ``Soon,'' a rock musical
about a religious sect by the film director Hal Hartley.
</P>
<P>
   But the city remains a bastion against the full onslaught of the
20th century. ``It is not yet time to invite the Spice Girls to
Salzburg,'' Mortier said.
</P>
<P>
   New Role
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If you were free-associating about what sort of
spectacle you might come upon while passing through the Port
Authority Bus Terminal on Wednesday evening, what would come to
mind?
</P>
<P>
   Those who answered, Shakespeare's ``Midsummer Night's Dream,''
are correct. In what is said to be the first performance of a play
in the terminal, at Eighth Avenue and 42nd Street in Manhattan, the
Waterloo Bridge Theater Company, an off-off-Broadway troupe, will
present a fully costumed, full-length, free performance of the
comedy at 6:30.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brandon Hill, the company's artistic director, said
Shakespeare often staged plays at coaching inns, ``and it occurred
to me that the Port Authority Bus Terminal is a modern-day coaching
inn.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who miss the performance can catch the troupe in ``A
Midsummer Night's Dream'' for four successive weekends beginning on
Thursday at its 74-seat theater at 203 West 38th St., near Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Curtain Calls
</P>
<P>
   Betty Buckley, who won acclaim for her portrayal of Norma
Desmond in ``Sunset Boulevard,'' begins rehearsals next month to
play Mama Rose in a revival of the Jule Styne-Stephen
Sondheim-Arthur Laurents musical ``Gypsy'' at the Paper Mill
Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. Performances begin on Sept. 9 in a run
through Oct. 25. Deborah Gibson is to play the title role.
</P>
<P>
   Already seen by more than 50 million people in at least 27
countries, the long-running musical ``Cats'' still has another
premiere in it. ``Cats'' will have its world television premiere on

UPN, WB AIMING FOR DIFFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; While the WB network is happy targeting viewers
ages 12 to 34, UPN is now going after a broader group, ages 20 to
50.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the WB feel that one of the two newest network
will perish; those at UPN feel the marketplace can sustain both new
ventures.
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard to figure out which of the two has taken the lead
in the ratings race.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of the two broadcasters met with the press over
the weekend as the Television Critics Association's summer press
tour wrapped up.
</P>
<P>
   Chief executive officer Jamie Kellner and Entertainment division
president Garth Ancier of the WB spoke about the need to target a
specific audience while their UPN counterparts considered that a
tragic mistake.
</P>
<P>
   ``The future of our business is going to be very targeted,''
said Kellner, whose network is ahead of its fellow fledgling
competitor both creatively and ratings-wise. ``All the networks
will eventually select certain targets and try to attack those
targets and be very specific toward those groups of people.''
</P>
<P>
   The WB has been extremely successful with shows for its young
audience, such as ``Dawson's Creek'' and ``Buffy the Vampire
Slayer,'' and will add more shows for that crowd this fall.
</P>
<P>
   It's most anticipated series is the good-looking ``Felicity,''
which has been described as `` &UR;  &LR; `Ally McBeal' goes to college'';
``Charmed,'' which reunites producer Aaron Spelling and Shannen
Doherty, who will play a witch; and ``Hyperion Bay,'' starring
former ``Saved by the Bell'' heartthrob Mark-Paul Gosselaar.
</P>
<P>
   UPN president and CEO Dean Valentine, who wants to program for
viewers who don't live in Manhattan or West Los Angeles, has added
the broad comedy ``The Secret World of Desmond Pfeiffer'';
``DiResta,'' about a New York City transit cop; ``Guys Like Us,''
which is two men and a little kid; the post-Civil War period piece
``Legacy''; and ``Mercy Point'' (``ER'' in space).
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to reach adult, middle-class Americans,''
Valentine said. ``If you are somewhere between the ages of 20 and
50, basically, I think network television has abandoned you _
unless you happen to live in Brentwood or Manhattan, somewhere
below 98th Street.''

LIKE, DO YOU LIKE LIKES OR LIKE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release on Sunday, Aug. 2.)  
 (Eds., items in boldface should be set in italics.)  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was the handsome face of the basketball superstar and
footgear endorser Michael Jordan on the cover of Time magazine.
Walter Isaacson, Time's editor, gambled that the iconic Jordan
would astound the sports world in the coming week _ and sure
enough, the cover subject came through with a stellar performance
that won the championship for his Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The copy on the cover identified the face merely as ``Michael,''
on the assumption that if you didn't know the megastar's last name,
you probably lived in a cave beyond reach of mass communication.
Below that, a reverent comment: ``We may never see his likes
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Seventeen letters came in to Time, and several to me,
questioning the use of  &UR; likes &LR; . ``Shouldn't that have read, `We may
never see his  &UR; like &LR;  again'?'' asked J.A. Sullivan III of Caldwell,
N.J. ``I always thought that using  &UR; likes &LR;  had a bad connotation,
as in `I'm finished with the  &UR; likes &LR;  of you.'''
</P>
<P>
   Time's copy editors say they looked it up beforehand in
Merriam-Webster's Third Unabridged Dictionary and Eric Partridge's
Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English. James Kelly, Time's
Saturday editor, preferred the plural and made the call. The
magazine resolutely stands by its usage (look, this isn't nerve
gas) and is braced for any assault by nit-picking readers or gotcha
grammarians.
</P>
<P>
   Partridge was one of the last of the one-man dictionary writers;
that generous sultan of slang used to do his research in the great
reading room of the British Museum, where he was available to help
such aspiring lexicographers as the likes of me. He opined that
 &UR; the like of &LR; , as used by the English vituperator William Cobbett
in the late 18th century, was ``generally in the plural'' today.
</P>
<P>
   Time's other source, Merriam-Webster's Third Unabridged, accepts
 &UR; the likes of &LR;  but lists first  &UR; the like of &LR; , labeling both
colloquial. In M-W's Dictionary of English Usage,  &UR; the like of &LR;  is
described as ``a variant phrase'' well chosen when ``the reference
is to a single object and no disparagement is intended.''
</P>
<P>
   Time could take further solace from Robert Burchfield, editor of
the New Fowler's Modern English Usage, who notes, ``I was upbraided
by a Scotswoman for writing  &UR; Who has not seen the likes of the
following? &LR; '' but found examples of the plural use in the OED.
( &UR; Upbraid &LR; , ``to criticize or scold severely,'' is rooted in the
Old English  &UR; bregden &LR; , ``to snatch, move suddenly,'' which lives in
modern slang as ``put a move on.'' Where was I?)
</P>
<P>
   OK; a case can be made that the plural  &UR; the likes of &LR;  is
acceptable in spoken English. (Lexies don't use the word  &UR; correct &LR; 
anymore.) This despite the usagist Ted Bernstein's condemnation of
it as ``a casualism that has no place in serious writing'' at
bastions of good grammar like The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   The question then becomes: Does  &UR; the likes of &LR;  carry a
pejorative connotation? It does; even loosey-goosey usagists say
that when it has a single object like  &UR; you &LR; , ``it typically carries
overtones of disparagement.'' Even when it is used with  &UR; me &LR; , it
most often implies a gently self-mocking derogation, as used above
with  &UR; such lexicographers as the likes of me &LR; . Sullivan of New
Jersey had it right.
</P>
<P>
   But disparagement of Michael Jordan cannot be what Time
intended. On the contrary, its comment ``We may never see his
 &UR; likes &LR;  again'' is probably bottomed on the rumination of
Shakespeare's Hamlet about his ghostly father: ``He was a man, take
him for all in all, I shall not look upon his  &UR; like &LR;  again.'' Or
``The Odes of Horace'': ``When shall we look upon his  &UR; like &LR; 
again?'' Or the King James Version of the Book of Job, in Jehovah's
whirlwind description of the twisty serpent Leviathan: ``Upon earth
there is not his  &UR; like &LR; , who is made without fear.''
</P>
<P>
   You could say, with a sneer in your voice, ``Thank goodness we
won't be seeing the  &UR; likes &LR;  of him,'' because that plural of  &UR; like &LR; 
is part of a colloquial put-down. But you cannot run somebody down
with ``the  &UR; like &LR;  of him,'' because that  &UR; like &LR;  is comparative, not
pejorative; it means ``We may not see anybody  &UR; like &LR;  him again.''
</P>
<P>
   Why are we breaking our heads over this seemingly insignificant
issue? Because the headline troubled copy editors; because a top
editor weighed their evidence and made a decision about its use on
the cover; because a score of readers then wrote in that it looked
funny to them, and because it also struck me as just a little bit
off.
</P>
<P>
   Moral: Native speakers have an instinct for the ``correct.''
Norma Loquendi, trust your ear.
</P>
<P>
   SQUAD SQUAD STRIKES
</P>
<P>
   In defending the mother tongue from redundancies, often at the
behest of readers organized into ``the Squad Squad,'' I recently
hooted at the use of  &UR; convicted felon &LR;  (a person is not a felon
until convicted of a felony) and  &UR; sworn affidavit &LR;  (which is a
``written declaration upon oath'' akin to  &UR; affiance &LR; , ``to pledge
one's troth'' to a cohabitant once known as a  &UR; fiancee &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   A  &UR; felon &LR;  is still a ``convict,'' but Joseph Restifo, a lawyer
in Philadelphia, sends me this selection from the Pennsylvania
Rules of Civil Procedure: `` &UR; affidavit &LR;  ... either (1) sworn to or
affirmed before an officer authorized by law to administer oaths
... or (2) is unsworn and ... subject to the penalties ... relating
to unsworn falsification to authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Therefore,  &UR; sworn affidavit &LR;  is no longer redundant. Remanded to
usagists down the line for reversal.
</P>
<P>
   Relatedly, I came across some fused words on the Internet that
qualify as oxymorons:  &UR; found missing &LR; ,  &UR; working vacation &LR;  and _
here's an unexpected one _  &UR; tight slacks &LR; . Best is the
throat-clearing oxymoron, used by lawyers for incipient felons to
introduce summations to the jury:  &UR; Now, then &LR; . ...

`RICHARD RODGERS': WONDRIN' WHAT'S BEHIND THOSE GREAT MELODIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
(ART ADV: Photo is being sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers

 (bl)  
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   What constitutes a great melody as opposed to a catchy tune or a
hook? In his six-decade career, Richard Rodgers probably composed
more great melodies than any other American songwriter. The best
ones (``My Funny Valentine,'' ``Where or When,'' ``Bewitched,
Bothered and Bewildered'') have the paradoxical quality of seeming
at once inevitable (you wouldn't think of changing a note or an
accent) and wholly original.
</P>
<P>
   As anyone remotely familiar with Rodgers' history knows, he
worked with two major collaborators of opposite temperament, each
of whom profoundly influenced his style. From the late 1910s
through the early 1940s, he collaborated with Lorenz Hart, who was
alcoholic and homosexual and drank himself to death. The best
Rodgers and Hart songs (the music usually came first) were
sublimely airy flights whose urbane, playful lyrics were often shot
through with a piercing sadness. Even when Hart was on his last
legs, he could still toss off a lyric in a matter of minutes.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1940s, Rodgers teamed up with Oscar Hammerstein II to
refine (with the shows ``Oklahoma!,'' ``Carousel,'' ``South
Pacific'' and ``The King and I'') what became known as the
integrated book musical. His songs with Hammerstein, who almost
always wrote the lyrics first, had a more elevated tone. A family
man from an illustrious theatrical dynasty, Hammerstein was a
painstaking craftsman who often spent weeks putting the finishing
touches on a lyric.
</P>
<P>
   Stylistically, Rodgers' songs with Hammerstein were closer to
European operetta than those written with Hart. Quite a few Rodgers
and Hammerstein songs, including ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' (from
``Carousel'') and ``You've Got to Be Carefully Taught'' (from
``South Pacific'') expressed a philosophy of tolerance and moral
uplift that mirrored the optimistic can-do spirit of American
postwar liberalism.
</P>
<P>
   After Hammerstein died in 1960, a year after the team's hugely
successful ``Sound of Music'' opened on Broadway, Rodgers tried
writing his own lyrics for the hit 1962 show ``No Strings.'' Later
collaborations with Stephen Sondheim, Sheldon Harnick and Martin
Charnin only fleetingly recaptured the magic of his work with Hart
and Hammerstein. Rodgers died in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers has always been remembered as aloof and stern, with a
tendency toward depression, for which he was once hospitalized. And
William G. Hyland's workmanlike but stodgy account of his life and
times adds little or nothing to our skimpy knowledge of his
personal life. His long marriage to Dorothy Feiner is duly noted
without ever being explored. We are told several times that the
composer was a ``ladies man,'' but not what that might mean. The
author appears to take at face value Rodgers' insistence late in
his career that he was the last to know about Hart's personal
demons.
</P>
<P>
   About as critical of its subject as the book gets is in
suggesting that Rodgers' coolness toward others (the result, the
author speculates, of his mother's withholding of affection) caused
his hard-nosed attitude, bordering on ruthlessness, in business
negotiations once he and Hammerstein became the titans of Broadway
with their own organization.
</P>
<P>
   The closest the book comes to telling a juicy story is a
description of how Danny Kaye, returning to the cast of the 1970
musical ``Two by Two'' after fracturing his ankle, largely
abandoned the script and selfishly turned the show into a
vaudeville act.
</P>
<P>
   If Hyland's coverage of Rodgers' personal history is
perfunctory, the book at least serves as a useful clearinghouse of
career information. Its core is a carefully assembled show-by-show
chronology, larded with sensible, if elementary musical analysis
and overly abundant, mostly unrevealing quotations from newspaper
reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the material has been gleaned from previously published
books, including Rodgers' own autobiography ``Musical Stages,'' and
from his letters. The chronology also covers his work as an
instrumental composer, including his music for the television
series ``Victory at Sea''; his frustrating period as a contract
songwriter in Hollywood in the early 1930s, and his and
Hammerstein's roles as producers of other people's work, including
the Irving Berlin show ``Annie Get Your Gun.''
</P>
<P>
   Each musical has its own plot summary and description of the
production and business history with the key songs noted. If you
want to know which famous Rodgers tunes were cut from shows and
re-used later, this book will tell you.
</P>
<P>
   But with its stuffy, plodding, overly reverential tone,
``Richard Rodgers'' is an extremely dull read. Hyland is unable to
convey the excitement of a Broadway opening night or evoke the
sparks of Rodgers' clashes with legendary men of the theater like
Florenz Ziegfeld and Joshua Logan.
</P>
<P>
   His analysis of Rodgers' songs is at once labored and
shortsighted. No mention is made of Rodgers' reaction to the rise
of rock-and-roll or his influence on the work of nontheatrical New
York songwriters like Carole King and Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   The author repeatedly describes Rodgers' tunes as being
``simple.'' True, most did conform to a standard 32-bar format, but
they were far from simple. Beyond repeating the most commonplace
observations about Rodgers' role in the history of musical theater,
the author fails to place him in the broader continuum of American
music and culture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard Rodgers'' has the ponderous official-sounding tone of
a late Rodgers and Hammerstein ballad, say ``Climb Ev'ry
Mountain,'' a song the author seriously overestimates.

`SACRIFICE': GIRLS ARE VICTIMS IN THAI SEX INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(lb) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One after another, the girls, looking even younger than they
are, despite the painted lips and cheeks, tell similar stories of
being lured or coerced from their homes in Burmese hill towns to
the cubicles of Thailand, where they were rented out as virgins two
or three or more times before settling into the practiced
prostitute's life.
</P>
<P>
   One tells of her father's urging, ``Go to Thailand and see the
world.'' What he meant was for her to see the inside of a bar or a
brothel and send some money home. In her village, a girl might earn
a bowl of noodles for a day's work. In Bangkok, she might be
dressed in colorful fabrics _ ``I was so proud in these new
clothes'' _ and perhaps be able to save a few dollars to help
support her parents.
</P>
<P>
   Another tells of being only 12 when she found herself in the
care of a mama-san who bargained with customers over her price.
With little understanding of the language away from her tribe, she
says that when she first heard the phrase ``selling your body,''
she thought it meant cutting off parts of herself for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the testimony of ``Sacrifice,'' Ellen Bruno's report
featuring interviews with a few of the girls who are the
merchandise in Thailand's thriving commerce in sex.
</P>
<P>
   The material is strong, much stronger than the imagery with
which Ms. Bruno embellishes her work. Her reach for visual poetry,
though evocative at times, can also be at odds with the
plain-spoken accounts of the victims. Ms. Bruno finds it difficult
to resist a field of waving grass or a colorful swath of fabric;
she goes in for blurry images of young dancers, and she likes
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary, part of the ``P.O.V.'' series, is compelling
when it allows the girls to speak, but toward the end especially,
it turns fuzzy. A girl's death is described this way: ``Death comes
quickly, hastened by fear and anger and loneliness.'' There is
flame on the screen, and a childish voice says, ``They burn all
that is her.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is more affected than affecting, much less persuasive
than the simple memory of a police raid (``Just another guy coming
into my room''), a pregnancy (``I didn't think of it as my baby''),
the four or five customers a night (``I guess they think we are
cute'') or the confession of an unschooled girl that she couldn't
add up the number of men she had to service during her six
childhood years in a brothel.

TEXAS MOTHER RECEIVES LIFE SENTENCE IN KILLING OF DAUGHTER'S
EX-BOYFRIEND 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ALLAN TURNER 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The wife of a prominent South Texas surgeon who turned
to a border folk healer for help in murdering the teen who jilted
her daughter was sentenced Monday to life in a federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Dora Cisneros, 60, of Brownsville, who was convicted in May of
using an interstate communication device _ a telephone _ in a
murder-for-hire scheme, stood solemn and wordless as visiting U.S.
District Judge Filemon Vela sentenced her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if I could give you less than life,'' the judge said, ``I
don't think, given its gravity and seriousness, that the case
warrants anything less ... All of us who are acquainted with you
and all of us from my community have just one question _ `Why?'''
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by her attorneys, Cisneros faced the judge and remained
silent.
</P>
<P>
   Vela then denied bond for Cisneros' pending appeal, telling
defense attorneys Tony Canales and David Botsford, ``I do not agree
with your position that she poses no threat to herself or to
society.''
</P>
<P>
   Vela also fined the woman $25,000, a sum her attorneys said she
is unable to pay.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's sentencing in the Houston courtroom marked the end of
Cisneros' second trial for the 1993 hit on Joey Fischer, an
18-year-old Brownsville honor student who had broken off his
relationship with Cisneros' daughter, Cristina.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros' earlier conviction on a state capital murder charge
was overturned on appeal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   While Cisneros would have been eligible for consideration for
parole after serving 40 years in state prison, she will be required
to spend the remainder of her life behind bars if the federal
conviction withstands appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Mercedes Martinez, 77, the folk healer Cisneros consulted
to arrange Fischer's death, is serving a 20-year sentence for
conspiracy in state prison. Daniel Garza, a San Antonio house
painter who also assisted in arranging the killing, is serving life
in state prison.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, who secretly taped her conversations with Cisneros,
was a star witness in the federal trial.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony showed Cisneros acted out of rage against Fischer, who
had briefly dated her daughter, now a San Antonio college student.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer, described as a ``late bloomer'' who had never had a
girlfriend, began dating Cristina Cisneros _ both were students at
an exclusive, co-ed Catholic high school _ in the spring of 1992.
The romance lasted only months, however, as Fischer apparently
dumped the Cisneros teen in favor of a girl from San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony showed that Dora Cisneros met with Fischer's family in
an attempt to patch up the failed relationship. When that proved
unsuccessful, the indignant mother contacted the Rio Grande Valley
folk healer to work magic against the offending youth.
</P>
<P>
   When the elderly healer declined, Cisneros enlisted her help in
arranging a hit on the high school student for $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez then contacted the San Antonio house painter, a former
client, who was acquainted with contract killers in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was fatally shot twice in March 1993 as he washed the
windshield of a car in his family's driveway. The shots were heard
by Fischer's mother, brother, sister and stepfather, but no one
witnessed the crime.
</P>
<P>
   The scheme began to unravel, though, when authorities found a
Dallas bail bondsman's business card at the scene. The card
ultimately led to the house painter, then to Martinez and Cisneros.
</P>
<P>
   After Monday's sentencing, the dead youth's mother, Corrine
Nelson, tearfully embraced relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I feel relieved that justice was served,'' she said,
``but it will never be over.''
</P>
<P>
   Her sentiments were echoed by assistant U.S. Attorney Mervyn
Mosbacker. ``Justice has prevailed, that's what is significant for
the community,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Fischer's father, A.J. Fischer, and stepfather, Vernon
Nelson, praised Harris County jurors in the federal court for
rectifying the ``miscarriage of justice'' at the hands of the state
appeals court that struck down the earlier conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot fathom that kind of mind _ so deviant,'' Fischer's
father responded when asked if he could empathize with a woman
facing life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's twisted,'' Nelson, the youth's stepfather added.
``Forgive her? God forgive me, no.''

CRITICS SEE LIMITS ON LEGISLATIVE TERMS CAUSING TURMOIL IN
CALIFORNIA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ In the plush and private Assembly Members'
Lounge, there are three kinds of headache reliever and one brand of
antacid available at no charge from hospital-sized dispensers
sitting above the numerous coffee urns.
</P>
<P>
   These days, they may not be enough.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest headache in the California state Capitol is dealing
with the fallout from eight years of term limits. Under Proposition
140, the initiative voters approved in 1990, Assembly members are
limited to three two-year terms in office. Senators can serve up to
eight years.
</P>
<P>
   Although some people believe the Capitol has become vastly more
democratic, state politics has been flipped on its face, lawmakers
and lobbyists say, with weaker leaders, perpetually inexperienced
legislators and a governor and his vast bureaucracy seizing more
power than ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are now seeing the full harvest of term limits,'' said
Assemblyman Don Perata, D-Alameda, who is running for the state
Senate before his Assembly terms are up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who put term limits on the ballot had this in mind.
These are people who did not believe in government and felt the
best way to minimize it was to create an ongoing change of elected
officials ... and everybody is in a state of chaos.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, one first-term Assembly member co-sponsored a bill,
then inexplicably rallied opposition to it. Other lawmakers openly
discuss trading votes or eagerly ask lobbyists for campaign
contributions in Capitol hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Democrats are submitting to Republican Gov. Pete
Wilson's plan for a huge tax cut, something they wouldn't have
considered just weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am satisfied that we have fractured the concentration of
power,'' said Lewis Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation
Committee and co-author of the 1990 term limits initiative.
``That's a good thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly leadership is still trying to figure out the new
political dynamic. Tactical procedural errors, which occur
frequently, quickly turn into crises or another example of failed
leadership. It takes hours just to get everybody in line for a
single vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tiny disagreements over policy turn into personality clashes.
The Assembly has yet to pass an effective assault weapons ban
because two Democrats, who earlier had voted for the measure, were
in personal spats with the Assembly leadership and the author of
the bill.
</P>
<P>
   After only three terms, many are distracted by new campaigns for
other offices. A few are leaving even before their terms are up,
because they don't want to miss a chance to run for an open Senate
seat.
</P>
<P>
   Desperate for some real advice on how to cope, Democrats
continuously consult with former Assembly Speaker Willie Brown, a
Democrat who is now mayor of San Francisco. This is the supreme
irony of term limits: The one lawmaker the limited-government
advocates wanted thrown out still helps run the place by providing
advice to lawmakers without his experience in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's happening over there is a function of term limits, pure
and simple,'' said Senate President pro tem John Burton, D-San
Francisco, who left the Assembly because of term limits and must
leave the Senate in 2004. ``There's nothing you can do about it,
unless you repeal term limits.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the entire Legislature will turn over when 11
senators are forced out of office at the end of their terms,
including Democrat Ralph Dills of El Segundo, who joined the
Legislature during the Depression, and Quentin Kopp of San
Francisco, the craggy intellectual and last remaining independent.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist have become more powerful because they, like the
governor, have the time and experience to manipulate information.
Yet even lobbyists complain that lawmakers want to rush things
through without thinking, just to get a law under their belts.
</P>
<P>
   Lobbyist Kathy Dresslar said she has spoken with new lawmakers
about their bills when they suddenly start talking about upcoming
political fund-raisers, a clear violation of the law prohibiting a
promise of money for support.
</P>
<P>
   ``I strongly believe it's due to unfamiliarity with the law,''
Dresslar said. ``It's not a deliberate shakedown. They are just
naive. They just find themselves busier than they have even been in
their life, and it all comes out in the same breath.''

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Monday was the 22nd consecutive day of high temperatures of 100
degrees or greater in Dallas, Texas. Sprawling high pressure at
20,000 feet will remain over the southern Plains Tuesday, providing
bright sunshine and squelching the development of thunderstorms.
Highs will top 100 across much of Texas and Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   The stationary front marking the boundary between the torrid air
hovering over the southern Plains and a more seasonable air mass to
the north will be the focus for thunder from Colorado to the Deep
South. One cluster of thunderstorms will drench Alabama and Georgia
while another cluster will develop over Colorado. Tropical
downpours will form along the central Gulf Coast as cooling sea
breezes lift moist air into towering cumulus clouds.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, burgeoning warmth and humidity will affect the
Northeast as breezes from the south increase. Ample sun will allow
temperatures to approach 90 degrees in much of the Piedmont, though
the increased humidity will support a few showers over the
Appalachians. A cold front that promises to bring an end to the
humidity in New England by Thursday will ignite a broken line of
storms over the upper Midwest. Behind the cold front, bright
sunshine and comfortable humidity will grace the northern Plains.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, thunderstorms will percolate in the afternoon over
the Rockies from Montana to New Mexico while unusual heat plagues
the interior Pacific Northwest. California will be seasonal with
some clouds along the coastline.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Tropical Depression
</P>
<P>
   The first tropical depression of the Atlantic hurricane season
was christened Monday west of Africa. The system grew from a
cluster of thunderstorms that earlier rumbled west off the coast of
Africa. Vast amounts of heat were released in thunderstorms as
water vapor condensed in cloud droplets. In turn, heating caused
barometric pressure to lower. Like a hot potato, the area of lowest
pressure hopped from place to place, but as thunderstorms
organized, heating was focused at the center and a circulation of
winds began. With sustained winds of 30 mph, the depression was
born.

VOTE TALLY UNDER WAY IN CAMBODIA

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ International observers voiced cautious
optimism Monday over the conduct of Cambodia's parliamentary
election as villagers and townspeople in 11,699 polling places
painstakingly tallied Sunday's ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Rising before dawn to get an early start, as many voters did the
day before, local election officials followed elaborate procedures
to reopen the sealed ballot boxes and check and cross-check the
ballots.
</P>
<P>
   With the first official results not expected until Saturday, the
country was alive Monday with claims and counterclaims of victory,
best-guess analyses and fears of manipulation by the governing
party headed by the country's strongman, Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
   Reports from polling stations indicated that Hun Sen's party was
in a close race with that of his rival and former coalition
partner, Prince Norodom Ranariddh. A third party headed by a critic
of the government, Sam Rainsy, also appeared to have considerable
support. Few votes were going to the remaining 36 parties.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome _ and however fair or unfair the vote tally
_ no party was expected to win the two-thirds vote needed to form a
government in the 122-seat National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Election analysts said that once the votes were counted, they
expected hard bargaining over the shape of a new government and
that the crucial question was whether the loser would accept the
result.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever the outcome of this election _ if it's very close or
if it's very clear, whatever happens _ the important thing is they
must honor and respect the people's wishes,'' said Glenys Kinnock,
the special representative of the European Union, which is largely
financing the election.
</P>
<P>
   In the Philippines, where she is attending a regional
conference, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright struck a
similar note, saying, ``The real test of Cambodia's democracy will
come after the ballots are counted.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Kinnock, visiting a downtown counting station Monday,
offered a positive preliminary assessment of the voting itself. She
said the election on Sunday, in which officials said more than 90
percent of the country's 5.4 million registered voters took part,
was ``almost entirely free of serious irregularities.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the laborious vote count Monday, in provincial offices
crowded with election officials and observers from independent
monitoring groups, Ms. Kinnock said: ``I think the process of
verification of the votes seems to be very satisfactory, and that's
the message we're getting from other areas of Cambodia as well.
From what I have seen, every possible effort has been made to make
sure that the votes are counted fairly and very carefully.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Thun Saray, director of the local poll-watch group Comfrel,
said, ``Although there were some irregularities and incidents of a
serious nature, these did not take place on a wide scale.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign observers from the European Union and the United
Nations, interviewed Monday at several rural polling stations, also
said they were impressed by the seriousness and apparent
transparency of the count. But some election observers voiced
concern over possible manipulation in the next stages of the tally,
in which local totals are consolidated, after a delay Monday night
in an announcement of preliminary partial returns.
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the delay, a spokesman for the National Election
Committee said the faxes his office had received from polling
stations were illegible and lacked official stamps. In addition, he
said, the available results were so few that they could not offer a
useful sample of the nationwide vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are not significant,'' said the spokesman, Samraing
Kimsan. ``We want to have more news.''
</P>
<P>
   Sam Rainsy, who has been a leading critic of the election even
as he took part in it, told reporters that he was worried by the
delay. ``We are moving into a very dangerous game,'' he said.
``They want to buy time. They want to arrange the results of the
election.''
</P>
<P>
   Foreign and Cambodian observers of the election have been
concerned from the start about manipulation, given the strong-arm
practices of Hun Sen's party and its near-total control of
government and military power throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Hun Sen has also demonstrated his determination to hold power,
demanding and getting a share of leadership after losing the last
election in 1993 and seizing full control a year ago in a coup in
which he ousted his co-prime minister, Prince Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
   Since the coup, human rights groups and U.N. monitors say, at
least 100 of Hun Sen's opponents have been killed. The 30-day
election campaign was preceded and accompanied by a variety of
abuses carried out by Hun Sen's Cambodian People's Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``These abuses consisted of widespread and subtle intimidation
of potential opposition voters in the countryside, de facto
vote-buying by Hun Sen's ruling Cambodian People's Party,
inequitable media coverage and violence, including killings of
opposition activists,'' said the International Crisis Group, an
independent international human rights monitoring agency.
</P>
<P>
   The Crisis Group also pointed out what is in effect a
self-inflicted no-win situation for Hun Sen's party, which has lost
the trust of much of the outside world. ``If the opposition wins in
a decisive way, the international community can easily conclude
that the elections were sufficiently free and fair,'' the group
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``However, if the ruling party wins convincingly, doubts will
always persist over the conduct of the polls,'' it said. ``It will
never be possible to determine whether the CPP election victory was
a result of intimidation, vote buying and violence or else it
broadly represented the will of the people.''

   CONSUMER-WATCH _ ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay
to use bank ATM machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe
they're just getting smarter. Many are shifting to their own banks'
machines to avoid being charged twice for their transactions -- one
fee by the bank that owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their
own, and another fee by their own bank. At the same time, the
surcharges continue to rise, new studies show. (Tharpe, Atlanta

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a
thousand participants at a World Future Society conference mulled
over forecasts for the 21st century, trying to discern what changes
would be coming around the 2000 bend. While opinions varied on many
issues, the futurists seemed to have little doubt about this: Women
will become the dominant players in the economy and the home. The
futurists referred to ``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost
certain outcome of the ``post-divorce'' society. (Geewax, Atlanta

   WALLSTREET _ ATLANTA _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
thinks the stock market is a bigger threat to the economy than the

market tanked. The household wealth created by an eight-year bull

   JUNO _ The most coveted Internet users are the ones who don't
really know how to use the Web. Juno (http://www.juno.com), the
popular, advertiser-supported free e-mail service, realized the day
is coming when its 5.5 million users will want to do more on the
Net than just send e-mail. They are, in the words of Juno President

   MINDSPRING _ It's always nice to watch David beat Goliath.
Watching the soaring stock prices of Atlanta-based Internet service

 &HT;    Wall Street: Companies are supplying proof to back up
Greenspan's caution about earnings
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan thinks the
stock market is a bigger threat to the economy than the Asian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated his argument last week in his semiannual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before Congress, after which the stock
market tanked.
</P>
<P>
   The household wealth created by an eight-year bull market has
helped to create ``as impressive (an economy) as any I have
witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the
American economy,'' said Greenspan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Primarily because of the rise in stock prices, about $12.5
trillion has been added to the value of household assets since the
end of 1994,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While only a fraction of that enormous sum has been spent, it
was enough to play an instrumental role in ``propelling the economy
forward.''
</P>
<P>
   The upside of this spending has been steady job growth,
increased job security and more revenue to local, state and federal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   But the downside is the prospect of renewed inflation,
especially the kind of wage inflation generated when job growth
exceeds labor force expansion.
</P>
<P>
   If inflation occurs, the Fed would be forced to act, probably by
raising interest rates to restrain the economy, Greenspan
explained.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better, Greenspan suggested, if household spending
slowed.
</P>
<P>
   If the stock market were less rewarding, it would generate less
household wealth, spending would slow and the economy would expand
at a less inflationary pace.
</P>
<P>
   But how do you make stocks less attractive?
</P>
<P>
   According to Greenspan, you tell investors the truth -- that the
``three-to-five-year (profit) projections of analysts are
unrealistic'' and that ``the real world'' will make that clear ``in
no uncertain terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's how Greenspan expressed it: ``Reduced prospects for the
return to capital would not only affect investment directly but
could also affect consumption if stock prices adjust to a less
optimistic view of earnings prospects.''
</P>
<P>
   Translated: If earnings prospects were less optimistic,
investment returns could be lower, not only reducing direct
investment but household spending as well.
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Greenspan may get a chance to find out what effect
shrinking profit growth will have on stocks, since profit growth is
in fact shrinking and the news is getting around.
</P>
<P>
   According to First Call, a Boston research group that tracks
earnings forecasts, only 3.7 percent of the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
companies that have reported second-quarter earnings -- and just
over half of them have -- have posted year-over-year profit growth.
A year ago it was 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1998, most of the people who have put money in stocks had
only experienced strong earnings growth.
</P>
<P>
   S&AMP;P 500 companies posted double-digit earnings growth in all but
four of the 28 quarters between 1992 and the end of 1997 -- some of
them recording gains of 25 percent or 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   First Call research director Charles L. Hill calls that an
``unprecedented record.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What is unusual about the current (seven-year economic)
expansion, and probably is a record, is the number of quarters with
double-digit profit growth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That's the kind of profit growth that propelled the S&AMP;P 500 to
annual gains of better than 20 percent from 1995 through 1997, and,
so far this year, 17.56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Hill, Greenspan and others say this level of quarterly
profit growth will not continue in an economy that Greenspan, at
least, will do what he can to restrain.

   CONSUMER-WATCH _ ATLANTA -- Maybe, just maybe, customers who pay
to use bank ATM machines are beginning to fight back. Or maybe
they're just getting smarter. Many are shifting to their own banks'
machines to avoid being charged twice for their transactions -- one
fee by the bank that owns the ATM, if it is a bank other than their
own, and another fee by their own bank. At the same time, the
surcharges continue to rise, new studies show. (Tharpe, Atlanta

   GEEWAX-COLUMN _ ATLANTA -- Last week in Chicago, about a
thousand participants at a World Future Society conference mulled
over forecasts for the 21st century, trying to discern what changes
would be coming around the 2000 bend. While opinions varied on many
issues, the futurists seemed to have little doubt about this: Women
will become the dominant players in the economy and the home. The
futurists referred to ``the coming matriarchy'' as an almost
certain outcome of the ``post-divorce'' society. (Geewax, Atlanta

   WALLSTREET _ ATLANTA _ Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan
thinks the stock market is a bigger threat to the economy than the
Asian crisis. He repeated his argument last week in his semiannual
Humphrey-Hawkins testimony before Congress, after which the stock
market tanked. The household wealth created by an eight-year bull
market has helped to create ``as impressive (an economy) as any I
have witnessed in my near half-century of daily observation of the
American economy,'' said Greenspan. (Walker, Atlanta

Windows CE is a sign Microsoft is determined to compete in every
market where a rival operating system might gain some traction, as

   JUNO _ The most coveted Internet users are the ones who don't

popular, advertiser-supported free e-mail service, realized the day

Net than just send e-mail. They are, in the words of Juno President
Charles Ardai, ``a group that has taken its first step onto the
Internet.'' Rather than watch them drift off to other ISPs, Juno
has decided to try to become an ISP itself. (Katz, Atlanta

   CAPITOL-WESTON-MENTALHEALTH (Undated) _ Russell Weston chose an
unusually public place, but he appears to have a great deal in
common with other delusional mentally ill people who become
violent, illustrating the gaping cracks in the nation's
mental-health network. His illness was well-known to family, mental
health officials and even federal authorities, but because of the
closing of state mental hospitals, the treatment of choice for him
was the honor system: counting on him to take the often unpleasant
psychoactive drugs prescribed for his schizophrenia. He lived in
rural areas, where psychiatric monitoring of him was extremely
limited. And he traveled between two states, encouraging at least
one to solve his long-term care by sending him back to the other.

NICOLAS CAGE KEEPS THE ACTION COMING

 Includes a color slide of Nicolas Cage in a scene from ``Snake
Eyes.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    He doesn't mind being called a movie star.
 &HT;    A lot of big names insist on being considered actors, not stars.
And with a Best Actor Oscar for ``Leaving Las Vegas'' (1995),
Nicolas Cage is more entitled than most to make that distinction.
But he insists that he doesn't have any problem with Hollywood
stardom.
 &HT;    ``I've been acting professionally since I was 17, and I've sort
of slowly grown up in the industry,'' says Cage, now 34 and the
most unlikely member of the elite A-list, $20-million-per-film
contingent. ``Nothing has been overnight, so I'm comfortable with
everything that's happened.
 &HT;    ``I'd better be comfortable, because I can't go back,'' he adds.
``I've got projects that excite me and am working with directors
who are wonderful, so I'm where I want to be.''
 &HT;    Cage is in the midst of a remarkable hot streak that encompasses
``Leaving Las Vegas,'' ``The Rock'' (1996), ``Con Air'' (1997),
``Face/Off'' (1997) and, most recently, ``City of Angels'' (1998).
He's proven not only his range but also his popularity with
audiences who have followed him from drama to action to
otherworldly romance.
 &HT;    On August 7, Cage returns to action with Brian De Palma's
thriller, ``Snake Eyes.'' The film casts Cage as Rick Santoro, an
on-the-take Atlantic City cop who joins his pal, Navy Cmdr. Kevin
Dunne (Gary Sinise), to unravel _ on the spot _ the assassination
of the Secretary of Defense during a major boxing match.
 &HT;    ``I'd just played the angel in `City of Angels,' and that was
more of a reserved, introverted performance,'' Cage says as he
settles into a chair at the Four Seasons Hotel in Beverly Hills.
 &HT;    ``I felt liberated when I knew I'd be playing Rick Santoro,''
the actor recalls. ``I got into the character's rust-colored suit
and the Hawaiian jacket, and I thought, `This guy feels good, he's
the king of the city. I can have some fun with him.'
 &HT;    ``My friends who've seen the film said, `It's the old Nic
again,''' he says. ``Maybe I'm back to my `Wild at Heart' (1990)
days.''
 &HT;    Deserved or not _ and it's an eminently debatable point _ De
Palma has a reputation as a director who provides style over
substance. Cage acknowledges that reputation, but considers it
unwarranted.
 &HT;    ``Brian loves actors, and you feel this sense of trust from
him,'' he says. ``I felt safe that I could go for it, that he'd
print the right take and I wouldn't be embarrassed.
 &HT;    ``I've never understood the feeling that his technical expertise
overshadows his actors,'' Cage adds. ``My opinion of his previous
films and my experience with him was that he's equally devoted to
the camera and the actors.
 &HT;    ``At one point we shot a scene and then went to lunch, and I
wasn't thrilled with what I did but didn't say anything,'' the
actor recalls. ``I came back from lunch ready to shoot the next
scene, and Brian said, `Let's do that last scene again.'
 &HT;    ``And I nailed it,'' Cage says appreciatively. ``During lunch
Brian noticed that the scene didn't quite work, and we redid it.
That to me is not a director concerned with the technical aspects
at the expense of the performances.''
 &HT;    Though Cage played standard-issue heroes in ``The Rock'' and
``Con Air,'' lately he's been returning to some of the sort of
risky performance choices that made him so intriguing a screen
presence early in his career. He chewed every last bit of scenery
in ``Face/Off,'' went New Age in ``City of Angels'' and is all
jittery energy in ``Snake Eyes.''
 &HT;    Of course, it's one thing to take risks in low-budget,
early-career ventures such as ``Valley Girl'' (1982), ``Raising
Arizona'' (1987), ``Moonstruck'' (1987) and ``Vampire's Kiss''
(1989). It's another thing entirely to do it with the whole world
watching, at $20 million a pop.
 &HT;    ``That's a reality or, at least, a state of mind that's
impossible to deny,'' Cage says, a sly grin crossing his face.
``The worries are there, but I've thought a lot about it and I'm
not so sure my work in `Face/Off' or even `Snake Eyes' is that
mainstream.
 &HT;    ``There were some things I did in `Face/Off' that were direct
steals from `Vampire's Kiss,''' he insists. ``So I think that my
independent background was a laboratory to cut my teeth and learn
what I could do and how I could express myself.
 &HT;    ``I can still tap into that edge and use it, even if the stakes
are higher now.''
 &HT;    Cage used to tell interviewers that his performances were
offbeat because he himself was offbeat.
 &HT;    ``Like many of us, I've sometimes had a feeling of being a
little different,'' he says. ``When I was in school I was always
considered imaginative or offbeat.
 &HT;    ``Today when I meet people, they actually say that I seem quite
normal,'' he says. ``I've changed. I think everybody changes. It's
impossible not to live and grow and change.''
 &HT;    Cage smiles.
 &HT;    ``I'm not the same kid I was when I was 17,'' he says after a
moment. ``I'm 34 now, and in growing up you go through all kinds of
maturation processes.
 &HT;    ``The thing about being famous is that whatever you say in the
press when you're 17 stays there,'' he adds, ``but that 17-year-old
is not the same person as the 34-year-old.''
 &HT;    Cage will next be seen in ``8mm'' _ pronounced ``eight
millimeter'' _ a dark drama about the world of snuff films. With
the much-discussed ``Superman'' feature grounded indefinitely due
to budget concerns, Cage will spend this fall shooting ``Bringing
Out the Dead,'' in which he'll play a burned-out paramedic.
 &HT;    The latter film reunites the ``Taxi Driver'' team of director
Martin Scorsese and screenwriter Paul Schrader. After it, Cage's
plans are murkier. He may play Howard Hughes in De Palma's
biography of the eccentric billionaire or star in and produce a
big-screen version of the beloved television sitcom, ``The
Courtship of Eddie's Father.''
 &HT;    So busy is Cage at the moment that he admits that his family is
getting the short end of the stick, especially his wife, actress
Patricia Arquette.
 &HT;    ``You know what? I am fitting life into career now,'' he says,
``but that will change. All of us in the business, if we're really
lucky, get a certain pocket where you're hot and get the roles you
want.
 &HT;    ``I'm going to be 40 in six years,'' the actor adds, ``so now is
the time to make my mark, to really strike. After that I will
probably have more time to myself, to do outside things, to slow
down.''
 &HT;    In the meantime, he's grateful to have a wife who understands
the business firsthand.
 &HT;    ``You kind of have to hope that the people around you, close to
you, understand the position you're in,'' he says. ``At some point
I'd like to blend the two and do a film with Patricia. We're trying
to find a way to do that.
 &HT;    ``In general, though, I feel that I made the right choice in
working as much as I have been.''
 &HT;    Cage shakes his head, lost in thought.
 &HT;    ``I feel older than 34, much older,'' he says. ``That's a good
thing and a bad thing: Because I've been working so hard since I
was 17, I haven't had a lot of play time.
 &HT;    ``But acting has given me a responsibility and a maturity,
perhaps even a wisdom, that I'm very thankful for,'' Cage says.
``So I'm happy.''

SCREAM GIRL: THE RETURN OF JAMIE LEE CURTIS 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.)

prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative

 Includes a color slide of Jamie Lee Curtis in a scene from
``Halloween: H20.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    It takes a lot to frighten Jamie Lee Curtis.
 &HT;    Don't try to spook the original teen scream queen with dark
shadows, strange sounds or even slashing knives.
 &HT;    ``I can watch gore all day long,'' she says. ``I can watch Linda
Blair's head spin around in `The Exorcist' until it falls off.''
 &HT;    No wonder, though. As the star of the seminal ``Halloween''
(1978) and ``Halloween II'' (1981), not to mention lesser chillers
such as ``Prom Night,'' ``Terror Train'' and ``The Fog'' (all
1980), she's been there, done that.
 &HT;    And now she's back there, back doing that. ``Halloween: H20,''
opening on Aug. 7, picks up her character, Laurie Strode, 20 years
after the events of the first two films in the series. She's the
mother of a teen-age son and, understandably, still has some
psychological issues to work out from her past.
 &HT;    Looking lovely in navy pants and a cashmere tank top, her hair
short and spiky, Curtis explains over coffee on an early Sunday
morning at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel that the movie was, in a
way, a return to her roots. It was ``Halloween,'' after all, that
made the daughter of Tony Curtis and Janet Leigh a star in her own
right.
 &HT;    ``It was strange,'' she says, ``but about three years ago, a
friend of mine mentioned, `Did you know that ``Halloween'' is about
to hit its 20th anniversary?'''
 &HT;    Intrigued, Curtis met with Miramax chief Bob Weinstein, who at
the time was finishing postproduction work on a little-touted movie
called ``Scream'' (1996).
 &HT;    ``I said to Bob, `A lot of bad stuff happens to the young women
in horror films and then everybody just goes home. And nobody ever
thinks of the fact that Laurie Strode survived. She has been alive
for 20 years.'
 &HT;    ``To me we had an opportunity to show what happens to a
victim,'' Curtis says. ``There are real people out there who are
very damaged and who go through these experiences. They try to live
a normal life _ they get married, they have children. But you can't
have a normal life when your soul is taken away from you.''
 &HT;    Curtis smiles.
 &HT;    ``I know I should probably be lighter about all of this, because
it's a `Halloween' movie,'' she admits, ``but I take this very
seriously. To me this sequel is not just about a nutjob who is
running around with an ax. It's really about what happens when
everything that is good is taken away from a young person. Laurie
lost her trust, her courage and her ability to love.''
 &HT;    To prepare, Curtis did something she had avoided for almost 20
years: She watched all the old ``Halloween'' films. She also
practiced her scream, which is as blood-curdling as ever.
 &HT;    Curtis laughs.
 &HT;    ``I actually did a Planet Hollywood appearance recently, and for
the first time in my public life, I screamed outside the work,''
she says. ``It felt very weird. I actually went home and said, `Why
did I do that?' Somehow it sounded fake to me.''
 &HT;    Curtis wasn't the only slasher-movie veteran on set. Janet
Leigh, best known for ``Psycho'' (1960), has a hilarious cameo as
her daughter's secretary.
 &HT;    ``You know, my mom is the best,'' Curtis says. ``My mom is from
a very meager background. She made sure I grew up in a very normal
way. I know it sounds a little Pollyanna-ish, but both of us are
really appreciative that we had careers.
 &HT;    ``For her and I to share a genre that is the pinnacle of both of
our careers is a joy,'' Curtis adds.
 &HT;    The actress grew up outside of Los Angeles as the daughter of
Hollywood royalty. Inside her own office these days are old Screen
Stories magazines featuring pictures of Leigh, a baby Jamie and
sister Kelly. The headline on one: ``Janet Leigh says: We Are One
of the Three Happiest Families In Hollywood.''
 &HT;    That wasn't exactly the case. Curtis was only 4 when her parents
divorced. Eventually Leigh married businessman Robert Brandt, and
the family stabilized. Still, there are scars from her parents'
breakup.
 &HT;    ``When I sit down to write children's books, my mind immediately
goes to the age of 4,'' says Curtis, whose new book ``Today I Feel
Silly'' is due out this fall. ``Age 4 is when my family split up
for good. I think you never get over that feeling of loss.''
 &HT;    The 40-year-old Curtis has sworn to spare her children such
loss. She and her husband, director Christopher Guest, have two
children, 11-year-old Annie and 2-year-old Tom, and Curtis says
they're her top concern.
 &HT;    ``It's really all about my children,'' she says. ``Chris and I
don't do the social side of Hollywood at all. We live a quiet life.
We don't seek attention.''
 &HT;    Oh, and don't worry, the kids won't be seeing ``Halloween:
H20.''
 &HT;    ``I want my daughter to feel safe in the world,'' Curtis says.
``I have a real problem introducing images into her world that are
disturbing and fearful. As soon as she hits 14 or 15, she can start
to understand right and wrong, fiction and nonfiction. But she is
11.
 &HT;    ``I'm not sure if the opening scene of `Scream' or `H20' are
images I want in her world,'' Curtis adds. ``What good could
possibly come from her seeing that stuff?''
 &HT;    It's only fair: Curtis didn't see ``Psycho'' until she was in
her late teens.
 &HT;    ``I remember my mother never wanting me to see it,'' Curtis
says. ``But I caught the movie on the late-late show, and I was
horrified. Even worse was that my mother had one of those
shot-by-shot books from `Psycho.' I remember looking in that book
as a little kid and freaking out.
 &HT;    ``I've never seen `Psycho' on the big screen and never will,''
Curtis says. ``I mean, that's my mom up there.''
 &HT;    One other thing: Even if her character survives the latest
``Halloween,'' don't expect to see Curtis in a new string of
sequels.
 &HT;    ``This is the end for me,'' she insists. ``Let Neve Campbell be
the new scream queen.''
 &HT;    Actually, Curtis says, she doesn't like sequels in general. The
only one that might interest her would be ``True Lies II.''
 &HT;    ``I would love to re-examine that character, because I took a
lot of hits,'' she says. ``People said because I did a strip scene
that it was demeaning to women. I thought this was one of the
strongest women I've ever played.''
 &HT;    To date, anyway. In the upcoming ``Virus,'' Curtis gets to do
some big-time action scenes. In fact, through that film she's
realized a longtime goal: having her own action figure.
 &HT;    ``Do you know that scene in `Jerry Maguire' where Tom Cruise
says to the girl, `You complete me?'''
 &HT;    She smiles.
 &HT;    ``Well, that's how I felt about my doll,'' she says. ``I looked
at her and said, `You complete me.'''

 Includes a color slide of Adrian Lyne directing a scene from
``Lolita.'' 
 By JEANNE WOLF and SHEP MORGAN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Adrian Lyne slumps gratefully into a chair in a Pasadena hotel
suite.
 &HT;    ``Thank God, it's cool in here,'' he says with a sigh.
 &HT;    The heat has been on Lyne for several years now, all on account
of ``Lolita.'' It's taken two years and recourse to the small
screen to bring his adaptation of the Vladimir Nabokov novel to
American audiences, after Hollywood waffled at the thought of
distributing a movie about a grown man's lust for a 12-year-old
girl.
 &HT;    The controversial, $58 million film will premiere Aug. 2 on
Showtime, which is billing it as the most expensive first-run film
ever on cable. It will also receive limited theatrical release to
qualify for Academy Awards consideration.
 &HT;    It's not as if the 57-year-old director is a stranger to
controversy. After all, he's the man who shook audiences with Kim
Basinger and Mickey Rourke's explicit pawings in ``Nine 1/2 Weeks''
(1986), shocked them with equally steamy sex between Michael
Douglas and Glenn Close in ``Fatal Attraction'' (1987) and then
paired Demi Moore and Robert Redford for ``Indecent Proposal''
(1993), which suggested that the price of a good woman's virtue
might be $1 million.
 &HT;    But no previous ruckus compared to the flap raised by
``Lolita,'' which stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert and
newcomer Dominique Swain as the provocative Lolita.
 &HT;    ``In my films, I've explored vulnerability and weakness in
relationships,'' the director says, ``and it becomes a bit puzzling
when people just isolate the sexuality.
 &HT;    ``People are forever talking about the sex scene between Michael
and Glenn in `Fatal Attraction,''' he adds. ``They all fixate on
it, but it only consumes about two minutes of screen time.
 &HT;    ``I live in France a good deal of the time, and the French don't
seem to have the same obsession with sex that Americans do,'' Lyne
continues. ``I don't mean everyone isn't interested in sex, and
there's no reason why they shouldn't be. But here, and I guess in
England too, it somehow becomes associated with guilt. So I get
accused of making smutty movies.''
 &HT;    That's not new for ``Lolita,'' which was the subject of
censorship battles as a 1950s novel and as a 1962 film. Director
Stanley Kubrick's version had no sex scenes whatever. In fact,
under pressure from the Hays Office, Kubrick wasn't even permitted
to show an onscreen kiss between James Mason and Sue Lyon.
 &HT;    ``Naturally, there have been a lot of comparisons between my
version and Kubrick's,'' Lyne says. ``That's difficult for me to
talk about because, although I admire Stanley tremendously, his
`Lolita' is not one of my favorite films.
 &HT;    ``I fought to keep the sex scenes between Jeremy and Dominique
because I thought they were essential,'' he says. ``People seem
uncomfortable that they seem erotic. I realized they had to be,
because we're seeing this through Humbert Humbert's eyes. Lolita is
his erotic obsession. That has to be shown.''
 &HT;    Lyne chuckles.
 &HT;    ``The irony is that Jeremy and I felt a lot more uncomfortable
than Dominique did,'' he says, smiling. ``She never seemed to have
an anxious moment. Her mother and her teacher were always right
there with her.
 &HT;    ``There was never any contact between her and Jeremy,'' he adds,
``because we had this thing called `the pad' that separated their
bodies. When it came to the glimpses of Lolita nude, we used a body
double.''
 &HT;    He pauses for a moment.
 &HT;    ``But I remember the scene when Dominique first really kissed
Jeremy, with her tongue in his mouth and everything,'' he says.
``We had talked about how she had already given a boyfriend a
French kiss, so she knew what it was all about. But when we rolled
the camera, Dominique kissed Jeremy with such gusto that the crew
was sort of stunned, as was I. You could hear an audible gasp on
the set.''
 &HT;    Defining the limits of what he could actually show in a theater
was a challenge, Lyne admits.
 &HT;    ``It's an R-rated movie, not an NC-17,'' he says. ``I spent five
or six weeks in the editing room with an attorney, going over every
frame of the sex scenes. I took out a bit here and a piece there.
The result has already been shown in Europe, and you'll see exactly
the same version on Showtime.''
 &HT;    Lyne remains hopeful that viewers will see beyond the sex to
discover a story that encompasses much more.
 &HT;    ``In his novel, Nabokov makes you horrified by what Humbert does
to Lolita,'' he says reflectively. ``You recoil from it. Yet you
also occasionally find yourself laughing and, ultimately, you begin
to feel a sort of sympathy for this man.
 &HT;    ``You begin to understand that he really did love Lolita in his
screwed-up way,'' the director says. ``I think that, if she had
stayed with him, he would have been faithful to her to his dying
day.
 &HT;    ``There's a kind of redemption for Humbert at the end,'' he
concludes. ``I think you feel that in my film, and I think that's
something that Kubrick never achieved in his.
 &HT;    ``Perhaps what's disturbing about what I've put up on the screen
is that there are so many shades of gray,'' Lyne adds. ``The
audience finds itself reluctantly sympathizing with a man they feel
awkward about sympathizing with. That's why the novel makes you
uncomfortable, and that's why the film makes you uncomfortable.''
 &HT;    Part of the problem with finding an American distributor for the
film was bad timing. ``Lolita'' was completed at almost the same
time that the nation was horrified by the killing of tiny JonBenet
Ramsey in Boulder, Colo., and shocked by the revelation of the
murders of children held captive by a child-pornography ring in
Belgium.
 &HT;    ``There's a sensitivity toward child abuse in the '90s that I'm
not sure we ever had before to this degree,'' the director admits.
``I saw a TV show not long ago on which kids were being instructed
about how to react when touched by an adult in certain ways. It's
easy for that to blossom into over-reaction.''
 &HT;    Lyne recalls a recent situation in which he felt exactly that
kind of response.
 &HT;    ``I was in a restaurant in France,'' he says. ``I saw a girl of
about 13 in her father's lap, kind of flinging her arms around him
and giving him a kiss. I suddenly found myself a bit put off,
wondering what was going on. Five years ago, I wouldn't have given
it a second thought.
 &HT;    ``Kids should be protected,'' he concludes, ``but I think
there's a case for overprotection.''
 &HT;    The little-seen, very expensive ``Lolita'' has proven something
of a millstone to Lyne, consuming years of his career. He admits to
ambivalence about the whole experience.
 &HT;    ``It's been a tough ride,'' he says. ``If I had known in the
beginning all that it was going to require, I might not have taken
the ride.
 &HT;    ``But I'm incredibly happy to have brought Nabokov's novel to a
wider audience,'' the director adds. ``It's so extraordinary and I
know it will endure, even if the film doesn't.''
 &HT;    He sighs.
 &HT;    ``This is a tough act to follow,'' he admits. ``I'm not sure
what I'll tackle next, because it's been so hard to let go of
`Lolita.' In the end, if just a few scenes in the movie hold a
candle to what Nabokov put on paper, then it's all been
worthwhile.''

THE ZEN OF `FISHING WITH JOHN' 
</HEADLINE>

entertainment package.)

 Includes a color slide of host John Lurie and singer Tom Waits in a
scene from ``Fishing With John.'' 
 By CHARLES STRUM  
 c.1998 The New York Times  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To grasp ``Fishing With John,'' a six-part series of loopy water
safaris on the Independent Film Channel, it helps to understand the
Lurie principle, named for the creator, co-star and director of the
show, John Lurie.
</P>
<P>
   It is this: Life is like fishing. If you just sit there,
something is bound to occur to you.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe this is not the Lurie principle. A chat with the
45-year-old Lurie, an actor and saxophonist _ his avant-garde jazz
band, the Lounge Lizards, recently released a new CD called ``Queen
of All Ears'' _ will not clarify much about the creative process,
his or anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   But then, who cares? ``Fishing With John,'' whose initial six
episodes are airing on IFC throughout August, is not about clarity
as much as it is about spending corporate money to film improbable
fishing vacations with your pals.
</P>
<P>
   In the first four installments, each running 30 minutes, Lurie
invited filmmaker Jim Jarmusch to Montauk, Long Island, to fish for
blue shark. Singer Tom Waits came to Jamaica for red snapper. Actor
Matt Dillon went to Costa Rica for snook and tarpon, while fellow
actor Willem Dafoe headed for Maine for ice fishing.
</P>
<P>
   The end of the Dafoe episode is perhaps the most startling
moment in the series. After 11 days of failure outside their
do-it-yourself hobo's shed on a frozen lake, the two men die of
starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the final, two-part episode, a special trip to
Thailand with actor Dennis Hopper, opens with the purposely
intrusive narrator _ the unctuous, generic, true-life-adventure
voice of Robb Webb _ saying, ``I made a mistake. John is still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus relieved, viewers are off on the last great quest of the
series, ``in search of the elusive giant squid.'' Please note:
Hopper and Lurie have chosen to stalk their prey, a 60-foot
behemoth that lives miles below the surface, with spinning reels
and fiberglass rods.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's partly a travelogue _ a surreal travelogue _ partly a
play, like a kids' play,'' Lurie says in a telephone interview from
New York. ``You know, like you build a fort in your living room
with your best friend when you're 10?
</P>
<P>
   ``They're attacking macho,'' he says of the shows. ``They're
also an interview show. Each one has a myth to it, almost like a
folklore thing to it.''
</P>
<P>
   As for scripts, Lurie says, ``I never told anybody to say
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   This is probably true. Here's an example from one of many quiet
interludes, as Hopper and Lurie, whose vacation wardrobe looks as
if it were designed by Kramer of ``Seinfeld,'' enjoy an impromptu
chat.
</P>
<P>
   Lurie: ``Why do you think that when people go on vacation they
wear the most ridiculous clothes? Things they would never wear.
It's like, you know, `Well, I'm a bank clerk, so I'm going wild
when I go on my vacation, shock people with my colorful shorts.'
You think that's what it is?
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not really interested in this conversation?''
</P>
<P>
   Hopper: ``Not really.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what it is. You figured it out, and I'm agreeing with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Thailand jaunt provides ample illustration of Lurie's need
to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't know we were going after giant squid,'' he says.
``We could have been trying out for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point in the filming, he and Hopper came across some
monks, but their conversation was inadvertently not recorded.
Later, during editing, Lurie decided to have the narrator explain
that the two fishermen had come upon an ``order of squid monks''
and had asked them for the secret to finding the giant squid, but
``the monks only showed them photographs of their families.''
</P>
<P>
   Lurie reports that the series has been shown at theaters in
Japan, where it's a big hit. In fact, he says, the productions were
underwritten by a Japanese company, Telecom Japan, ``that makes
weird travel shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no clue,'' he adds cheerfully. ``I don't know why
they did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Will there be more shows? Lurie hopes so, and adds that he
already knows whom he'd like to invite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Noam Chomsky and Gorbachev,'' he says. ``I want to use the
wine spot on his head as a map.''

NADER ENVISIONS TORT LAW MUSEUM AS TOURIST LURE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (bl)  
 By JONATHAN RABINOWITZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTED, Conn. _ At first glance, only a first-year law student
whose sole ambition is to make law review would appear to be a
likely visitor to a museum here in rural Connecticut dedicated to
the seemingly arcane topic of tort law.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would be hard to blame the people of this old mill
town if they seem a bit skeptical that a proposed museum to honor
some of the most reviled professionals in the country _ trial
lawyers _ was a surefire way to transform their downtown into a
mecca for weekend visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to Ralph Nader, Winsted's town's most famous native
son, as he details his dream of a Museum of American Tort Law and
brings his passion, which launched the consumer movement, to the
unlikely cause of making personal injury law into a tourist
attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be the Pinto with the exploding gas tank, flammable
pajamas, asbestos and breast implants, the whole history of medical
malpractice, and of course the more recent toxic pollution, like
Love Canal,'' Nader said in a telephone interview, sounding like a
carnival barker reeling off a litany of horrors that could rival
the more macabre exhibits at Madame Tussaud's.
</P>
<P>
   The project manager, Dr. Fred Hyde, remarked that there even
would be a gift shop that would sell ``the tschatchkes of tort
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, like models of defective toys, products that were
taken off the market,'' added Hyde, a consultant with degrees in
both medicine and law. ``We don't want to trivialize it, but we
want to have a way to memorialize the visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader's vision for a family trip, of course, has a distinctly
political edge. He has begun a $10 million fund-raising effort for
the museum at a time when the rights of citizens to sue large
corporations for faulty products is very much under attack.
Business groups, whom Nader has dubbed ``tort deformers,'' have
been pushing Congress to pass legislation that could restrict the
amount of damages a plaintiff could win in such suits.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, scheduled to open in late 1999 or early 2000,
clearly is intended to cast a more positive light on the practices
that have resulted in large jury awards to consumers who bought
questionable products, not to mention the lucrative fees for the
lawyers who championed them.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, proponents of tort reform dismiss the whole idea as
little more than propaganda for trial lawyers. ``Mr. Nader should
make sure to have ample parking space for trial lawyers' his and
her Lear jets,'' mocked Lester Brickman, a professor at Benjamin N.
Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, who has argued that
lawyers contingency fees are too high.
</P>
<P>
   And other critics have wondered aloud about the potential perils
of opening such a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be able to serve hot coffee in a museum cafe for fear
of scalding customers' mouths? How can display cases be built
without sharp corners that could accidentally cut scrambling
children? And will lawyers whose work is portrayed not to their
liking sue for defamation?
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of this small city in the foothills of the
Berkshire Mountains, residents were a bit puzzled by the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Virtually no one here is happy that the old factory building
that would house the museum has been all but vacant for years.
Built in the late 19th century to manufacture gold and silver
fixtures for coffins, it is on a prominent downtown corner, across
from a pool hall and an auto parts store, right on the banks of the
Mad River.
</P>
<P>
   In more than a dozen interviews, local citizens generally
remarked that a tort museum was better than nothing. Still, people
were confused about what exactly they were getting.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a tort?'' said Monique Goulet, 20, a clerk at Ivery &AMP;
Dudley Pharmacy on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they the blue laws?'' asked Bill Wood, owner of the
nearby Deluxe Package Store.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, tort does not refer to laws regulating moral behavior,
nor to a cake made with many eggs and often grated nuts or dry
bread crumbs and usually covered with a rich frosting. It is a
legal term for a wrongful act that can be the basis of a civil
lawsuit, though its exact place in jurisprudence is very much up
for debate.
</P>
<P>
   For some, tort means justice and restitution. One pharmacy
clerk, who thought that people could learn a lot from such a
museum, described torts as ``the laws that protect the little
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who rose to prominence in 1965 with his book ``Unsafe at
Any Speed,'' revealing the design flaws of the Chevrolet Corvair
and other automobiles, called the American tort system the ``best
system in the world,'' a pillar of United States democracy that is
not adequately appreciated by the general public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tort law, the law of personal injury, was a major step on the
march to justice,'' Nader, a 64-year-old graduate of Harvard Law
School, explained. ``There's been a lot of attention to civil
liberties but not to physical integrity - how our law protects the
physical integrity of human beings from harmful behavior, unsafe
products, toxic chemical or auto crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Others believe tort means little more than big money for
lawyers. They charge that big settlements lead to frivolous suits
and that the system creates huge costs for business, which
discourage companies from innovating.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lagassey, a 32-year-old machinist who was born and
raised here, said he appreciated Nader's efforts, though he would
prefer to see the building reopen as a factory. ``There's too much
suing,'' he said. ``What we need is jobs.''
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is unlikely that many manufacturing jobs will return
to Winsted, once an independent small city but now a section of the
town of Winchester, population 11,000, about 24 miles northwest of
Hartford. While Winsted had years ago been a place that made
clocks, knives and woolen clothes, it today is a poor pocket in
tony Litchfield County, a haven for New Yorkers with country homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's father, a Lebanese immigrant who died in 1991, ran a
restaurant here. His mother, Rose, and sister, Claire, still live
here. Another sister, Laura, an anthropology professor at the
University of California, Berkeley, spends summers here. And the
family is well-known in this town, though not always well-loved,
for its involvement in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's late brother Shafeek is credited with bringing a
community college to the town in the 1960s, over much local
opposition. A decade ago, the Naders fought unsuccessfully to stop
the town from tearing down an old school, and more recently they
have spearheaded _ with mixed success _ an effort to maintain a
local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A Nader family foundation, Northeast Highlands Resources
Preservation Trust, purchased the empty factory building in the
early 1980s with the goal of using it to encourage the development
of small businesses. That effort has yielded little results, and
the only people in the building are three public interest lawyers,
who work on community and agricultural projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``That building has sat empty too long,'' said Noreen
Lampognana, a 61-year-old Winsted native, who was curious to learn
more about the tort museum. ``The Naders have done some nice things
for this town,'' she added, though cautioning that their ideas
sometimes raise people's ire. ``They're very intelligent, maybe too
intelligent to the degree that a lot of common people think they're
eccentric.''
</P>
<P>
   While some local people wondered who would come to this museum,
its boosters maintain that educational tourism is a booming
industry and that the number of specialty museums has grown rapidly
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Spamtown U.S.A., a museum honoring Hormel Food Corp.'s most
famous product, attracted more than 60,000 visitors last year, and
is being expanded.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a lantern museum, a garlic museum, 63 medical
museums and 31 lumber and timber museums, not to mention a museum
on every conceivable sport,'' said Nader. ``But no law museum.''
</P>
<P>
   The only thing that comes close, Nader added, was the exhibition
area in the basement of the American Bar Association in Chicago,
which he described as a ``cubby hole.'' Tort law ``has a a great
history, and there's nothing covering it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader last month started to send letters to potential
supporters, describing the museum. He also has solicited design
proposals from several prominent museum design firms.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to raise $5 million by the end of the year that will
be used to renovate the factory building, as well as to establish
an endowment to fund outreach programs, establish a web site and
cover administration costs. In the future, Nader said he hopes to
raise another $5 million so that the museum can lease exhibition
space in Washington and hold conferences in Winsted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is supposed to provide an interactive experience,
said Hyde, the project manager, who has both medical and law
degrees, with re-enactment of famous trials. Visitors could
actually sit in a real jury panel, Nader exclaimed, and hear the
same testimony that actual jurors once heard.
</P>
<P>
   (``Donahue suggested that,'' Nader added, referring to the
former television talk show host, Phil Donahue, who has made a
pledge to the museum.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, there will be artifacts, Hyde promised, noting that he
wanted to find a vintage Corvair or an old Pinto fuel tank.
</P>
<P>
   Already lawyers are calling to donate trial exhibits to the
museum's collection. ``I just had a call from a fellow who wanted
to send a defective refrigerator,'' said Hyde. ``Everyone has a
case somewhere. These are real things that happened to real people,
these things can all be memorialized.''
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers have to capture a jury's interest, and there are
warehouses full of elaborate trial displays across the country,
Hyde said. '
</P>
<P>
   ``My God, they're like Hollywood,'' he added. ``Like seeing
Spielberg in a courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader insisted it would be riveting. ``This has all the drama
that television has _ industrial violence, the battle between
corporations and lonely litigants and exceptional lawyers,'' he
said. ``This is David versus Goliath. These are stories of great
human triumph.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved Monday a special benefit of a
year's pay, tax free, to the widows of the two Capitol Police
officers who were slain last week.
</P>
<P>
   The widow of Detective John M. Gibson will receive $51,866, and
the widow of Private First Class Jacob J. Chestnut, $47,280.
</P>
<P>
   The House resolution also formally establishes a memorial fund
for the officers' widows and children. Gibson and Chestnut were the
first Capitol Police officers to die in the line of duty since the
creation of the police force more than 100 years ago. Donations can
be sent to the US Capitol Police Memorial Fund, Washington, D.C.
20515.
</P>
<P>
   Both Gibson and Chestnut were 18-year veterans of the Capitol
Police. Gibson, 42, leaves his wife, Evelyn, and three children, a
17-year-old daughter and two sons, ages 12 and 14. Evelyn Gibson is
the niece of Representative J. Joseph Moakley, a South Boston
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, 58, who was within months of retirement, is survived
by his wife, Wen, their two children, and three children from a
previous marriage.

IMMIGRANT-BOMBS - In deadly summer heat, illegal immigrants
crossing the southern Arizona desert are increasingly at risk of
being blown up by bombs. Rising numbers of trespassers are
traveling through the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range
northwest of Yuma, a site controlled by the U.S. Marine Corps but
used by all military branches, even NATO, to train bombing pilots.
The danger is advertised on warning signs in Spanish in English,
but that hasn't deterred crossers. In just two weeks between June
19 and July, the Border Patrol picked up nearly 350 people on or
near the range. By GRACIELA SEVILLA. Story will move in the ``A''
category.  &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABORTION-POLITICS (Undated) - In a political climate of mounting
restrictions against abortion and escalating violence at clinics,
some abortion-rights supporters foresee a day when abortion is
legal but offered only by an underground network of doctors. In
fact, that is the new strategy that has been adopted by abortion
opponents, the same critics say, and it's working. In Arizona,
abortion is readily available only in Phoenix, Tucson, and
Flagstaff. The result, critics say, is that women have fewer
choices and are increasingly likely to turn to clinics like the one
in Phoenix in which a patient of Dr. John Biskind's bled to death.
With ABORTION-MEDICINE. By CHRIS MOESER. Story will move in the
``A`` category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
ABORTION-MEDICINE (Undated) - Access to safe abortions is
threatened by the lack of qualified doctors who perform the
procedure, and that could lead to increased incidents like the one
in Phoenix in which a woman bled to death from a punctured uterus,
supporters of women's reproductive rights say. Dr. Beth Weber,
medical services director for Planned Parenthood of Central and
Northern Arizona, said part of the problem is historical ignorance
by young doctors entering practice. ``Most of the younger
physicians are unaware of the pre-Roe (vs. Wade) days when women
did seek illegal abortions,`' she said. ``They don't understand the
repercussions when abortion is not provided and not provided
safely.`` By Vanessa DeRuyter. Story will move inthe ``A''
category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
BRADY (Undated) - Potential buyers of shotguns and rifles, take
heed: if you make your purchase Nov. 30 or later, your background
will be checked by law enforcement agencies. If you didn't know
this was coming, you're far from alone. By CHARLES KELLY. Story
will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ALARMS (Phoenix) - If you believe the numbers, Phoenix-area
homeowners have more to fear from Christmas decorations, billowing
drapes, and feisty ferrets than from robbers. That's because 65
percent of the alarms called into Phoenix police are false, wasting
millions of dollars and thousands of hours annually. False reports
are now fined, and the worst offenders go to False Alarm School. By
HANNAH MILLER. Story will move in the ``A'' category. &QL; 
 &QL; 
ADS-OVERLOAD (Undated) - A new pizza delivery offer is
rubber-banded to your doorknob _ every day. Classified circulars
are so numbing they are slowly turning to mulch on your front lawn.
``Banner'' advertisements on the Internet are disguised to look
like computer upgrades. You have to wear a certain T-shirt to get
free popcorn at the movies. Rump roast is on sale at Albertson's.
The phone rings and a resonant recorded male voice says, ``Hello. .
.'' Americans are besieged by advertising, an estimated 600 to
1,200 commercial messages every day. By MARTIN VAN DER WERF. Story
will move in the ``F'' and ``K'' categories. &QL;

 &HT;    Keeping the faith while keeping the faith

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA-- Kathryn Padberg bounced once and then laughed as her
feet slipped off a pogo stick.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is hard!'' she exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   Back up she went, and slipped again.
</P>
<P>
   And again. And again. And again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stilts were easier,'' she concluded, handing the pogo
stick to its next victim.
</P>
<P>
   Padberg, 18, came to Atlanta from Merrillville, Ind. to be part
of the 30,000-strong National Lutheran Church-Missouri Synod Youth
Gathering meeting through Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm having a great time!'' she said. ``I have met so many
different people from so many different states! The high you get
from being here is great.''
</P>
<P>
   Every convention that comes to Atlanta should be so much fun:
</P>
<P>
   A carousel.
</P>
<P>
   Tricycle races.
</P>
<P>
   Music and dancing every night.
</P>
<P>
   All in the Georgia World Congress Center.
</P>
<P>
   But there's also Bible study in the Georgia Dome, food-sorting
at the Atlanta Food Bank and workshops on everything from
Adolescent Spirituality to the theology of ``The X-Files.''
</P>
<P>
   Heat did not wither nor rain dampen the enthusiasm of the youth.
</P>
<P>
   They traveled in groups, some with matching T-shirts _ bright
yellow from Nebraska, Orange from Kansas, smoky blue from Southern
Illinois _ but all with the ubiquitous red back packs stuffed by
local volunteers. By noon Monday the Lost and Found department (not
to be confused with a band called Lost and Found that performed
Sunday night) had collected 18 of the backpacks, along with boxes
full of sunglasses, shirts, wallets, hotel keys and other assorted
droppings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where're y'all from?'' a boy in a red backpack asked, in a
cowboy accent, as he stood shoulder-to-armpit on a subway with
dozens of other backpack equipped teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minneso-o-ta, don'cha'know,'' replied a tall blonde girl,
speaking intentionally as if she just stepped onto the set of
``Fargo.'' ``Where'r'you from?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Waco, Texas,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was repeated on escalators and in food court lines,
standing on corners waiting for stoplights and sitting, with
numbers in hand, waiting to donate blood.
</P>
<P>
   ``It strengthens your faith to be around this many other people
who share the same faith','' said Luke Walta of Eau Claire, Wisc.,
a 20-year-old college student in a ``Satan Is Ugly as Sin'' T-shirt
who had just given a pint to the Red Cross. Walta, along as an
advisor, attended the last triennial youth gathering three years
ago in San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the magnitude of it,'' said John Paluch, 16, from just
outside Houston. Paluch sat at a table gluing pieces of felt
together to make a ``story quilt'' in the Southern Culture area. He
pointed to a cross to represent Christ, a circle of braided red and
black strips to symbolize the struggle between good and evil, and a
flame that he said lights his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that we can all get together and have a great
time and not really worry about drugs, sex or violence,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While organizers hope Paluch is right and there's no sex in the
hotel rooms, they made sure it was on the program. A group of girls
sat in an empty room 45 minutes early to make sure they got seats
to ``Chastity, Because You're Worth It,'' and inside a double
ballroom there was standing room only, with kids outside waiting
for the next session of ``Sex and Dating.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaker Bob Lenz read a Bible verse from 1 Corninthians about
sinning against the body, ``the temple of God.'' He laughed about
the awkwardness of first kisses and prayed about the destruction
caused by sexual abuse. He recounted his mother's talk to him about
sex when he was a teenager: ``Keep your pants up and your zipper
up. That's what my mom really said.'' And he told hundreds of
teen-agers that he has never had sexual intercourse with anyone
except his wife of 15 years. They cheered.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing. It's indescribable,'' said Alexis Johnson, 15,
of DeKalb County who helped cover the gathering for a daily
newspaper, The Atlanta Call, being published by a teen-age staff
for the teen-age city inside the congress center. ``You have that
feeling inside that all these youth are here in the name of the
Lord. They are not ashamed to say they believe in God.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They're well behaved. They ain't wild,'' said congress center
cleaning worker Michelle Haynes as she stood, broom and dustpan in
hand, sweeping up bits of trash in an exhibit hall full of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they're cool,'' said her co-worker, Sharon Sims.
</P>
<P>
   ``They sure are happy,'' said Haynes. ``They're happy,'' agreed
Sims, and they swept on.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Modern Library's list is just another list
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We are a listing nation. Not in the maritime sense of a ship
taking on water, but in our mania for ranking things. Usually by
10s. We rank the 10 Best Steakhouses, 10 Best Beaches No One Knows
About (after which, everyone does), 10 Best Mutual Funds ...
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press started all this when it began ranking the
Top 10 college football teams. Sportswriters who had never seen
most of the teams play, even on television, would decree week by
week who was best, who was second best, who was third, fourth,
fifth ... all the way down, now, to No. 25. In time it's liable to
become the Top 100, just like the Modern Library's list of the best
English-language novels of the century.
</P>
<P>
   In either case, football or literature, it's hard to come off
magisterial when you're pinning a tail on a donkey. You're safe
with Nebraska and Florida State, but beyond that is anybody's
guess.
</P>
<P>
   That being so, you'd expect a certain randomness and anarchy.
Instead, as most know but will not admit, a good bit of looking
over the shoulder goes on. (``Where've you got Washington State?''
``I've got A&AMP;M at No. 6. Think that's too high?'')
</P>
<P>
   So it goes, as Kurt Vonnegut would say, with literary lists.
James Joyce at No. 1, with ``Ulysses.'' Also at No. 3, with ``A
Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man.'' F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose
stock over the years has risen and plummeted and risen again, at a
surprising No. 2, with ``The Great Gatsby.'' But the real surprise
_ well, there were many, but this one took the chair out from under
me _ was Vladimir Nabokov at No. 4, with ``Lolita.'' The august
jury is telling us the century has seen but three novels in English
better than the story of a middle-aged man's obsession with a
13-year-old girl. Just three.
</P>
<P>
   For one reason or another, no one is happy with the nts. Even
so, one little thing gnaws at me, and I might as well say it: The
people who composed the jury simply have not read all those books.
</P>
<P>
   Assertions that cannot be proved are, obviously, hobbled from
the start. But it's an assertion in response to an implicit claim.
I don't take many things on faith. If it's incumbent on me, or
anyone else, to prove the jury hasn't read the material, it's
equally incumbent on the jury to give reason to believe its members
have read all 100 of those books.
</P>
<P>
   And not just those 100, but _ just as important _ several
hundred more. A ranking of 100 has no meaning outside a larger
context. In this case, that means a few hundred that did not make
it. How many unranked books? I don't think 400 is asking too much.
It's probably asking too little.
</P>
<P>
   So it would interest me to know which 400 other books
Christopher Cerf, Gore Vidal, Vartan Gregorian, William Styron,
A.S. Byatt and the rest of that jury have read cover to cover. Not
that these people aren't well read, mind you, but I just don't
believe any one of them, even the omnivorous Vidal, has read that
many. (It would be unkind to ask the same of the college kids who
got up their own list, something called the Radcliffe Publishing
Course list.)
</P>
<P>
   Do I cavil? I think not. It would have been fine with me had the
jury said, ``Look, folks, some of us have read more of these books
than others, we've talked to friends who've read books we missed,
and we've dredged up some old reviews in the Times. We've put our
heads together, and this is how it shakes out. See what you
think.''
</P>
<P>
   But the jury didn't do that, and, with few exceptions, neither
did it suggest why those books transcend the century. Is it because
of ideas given life in the story? Is it because of their artistic
merit as novels? Their influence on literature in English? On how
we view the world? ( I don't think, in many instances, it's because
they keep you up nights.)
</P>
<P>
   These aren't trivial questions. It's fairly clear why jurors
ranked Joyce's ``Ulysses'' No. 1. ``The watershed of the 20th
century from which all modernism flows,'' Styron pronounced. And
flows, he might have said, 'round and 'round, inasmuch as
circularity and return to origins are two of its motifs.
</P>
<P>
   But significance, after a point, becomes its own justification,
and that's never good. Once it does, words and meaning part
company. In some accounts of the Top 100, they split rather quickly
and that great all-purpose imponderable was pressed into service.
Thus, in its second paragraph, The New York Times called Joyce's
``Ulysses'' ``a metaphor for the human condition.''
</P>
<P>
   It did not tell us what the human condition was. It is not
exactly self-evident, any more than the significance of ``Lolita.''
Maybe someone should empanel a jury to rank the Top 100 nonsense
expressions in English. I vote ``the human condition'' No. 1.

 &HT;    Rolling Stone: Gays not accepted as much in rural Georgia
counties
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The times they are a-changing _ at least everywhere but in
pockets of the South. When Sam Baldwin decided to come out of the
closet, the high school sophomore realized he could not go through
adolescence as a gay teenager in Cherokee County(Ga.). So he moved
in with his father in Cobb County(Ga.). Before he left, Baldwin
tells Rolling Stone ($3) contributing editor David Lipski, ``One
gay student got his mailbox crushed and his car tires slashed. I
didn't want to be the only one anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin has plenty of company, according to Lipski, who
interviewed more than 100 gay teens nationwide. In Atlanta, where
Lipski interviewed several teens who do their cruising around the
Tara shopping center, there is more acceptance. Not so in the
boondocks. ``Nobody ever used the word gay in Cairo,'' says Tom
White, who grew up in the small Georgia town. And in Heard
County(Ga.), Lipski was chased off the high school grounds by two
police officers when he tried to interview a gay student.
</P>
<P>
   -- In-depth coverage: National Geographic ($5) is famous for its
prize-winning photography, but this month's cover is truly
eye-popping. The landmark issue features 3-D images of the surface
of Mars and the wreck of the Titanic. Yes, you have to wear those
silly red-and-green cardboard glasses to view them, but the effect
is remarkable. Photographer Emory Kristof shot the Titanic using
paired video cameras on a 50-hour expedition at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean. In the Mars photographs, transmitted from the tiny
rover Sojourner, you can see everything but little green men.
</P>
<P>
   -- Lone gunman: In the aftermath of the Capitol shootout Friday,
Newsweek ($2.95) chose to feature a blurry photograph of accused
gunman Russell Eugene Weston Jr. on the cover. Time ($2.95) opted
to go with E. coli, and devoted five pages inside to as washing
your hands after handling raw meat and cooking hamburgers
thoroughly, Kluger stresses there's not much even the most
germ-wary person can do.
</P>
<P>
   -- By George: John F. Kennedy Jr. knows that sex sells.
Otherwise he wouldn't keep putting glamorous babes on the cover of
George ($2.95). But behind the glitter is a magazine that's solid
and sophisticated. The August issue features several compelling
articles, including a portrait of imprisoned Mary Kay Letourneau,
36, the teacher who fell in love with a 13-year-old student and is
pregnant with their second child. Also of note is ``A Mobster's
Last Resort,'' a fascinating portrait of turn-of-the-century Hot
Springs, Ark., when gangster Owen Madden used the town as a
playground.
</P>
<P>
   -- Quick reads: If you haven't read enough about Tom Hanks
lately, pick up the latest People ($2.79). The two-time Oscar
winner talks about love, work and, of course, ``Saving Private
Ryan.'' Entertainment Weekly ($2.79) reports that ``There's
Something About Mary'' is just another in a long line of gross-out
movies. Remember the flatulence scene in ``Blazing Saddles'' or the
barfing scenes in and ``The Exorcist''? Of all the special effects,
says director John Waters, throwing up is the cheapest.

 &HT;    Tabloids spoon believers weekly dose of paranormal
 &HT;    By Carolyn Nizzi Warmbold
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some results of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's Southern
Focus Poll may bring smiles of recognition to readers of
supermarket tabloids.
</P>
<P>
   A sizable minority of respondents believe in UFOs, ghosts,
extraterrestrials and psychic healing. An even greater number place
credence in devil possession, superstitions and ESP.
</P>
<P>
   These topics, mostly ignored or ridiculed in the mainstream
media, have long been staples in the weeklies sold near checkout
lines. These papers' content combines a high CQ _ cosmic quotient _
with grocery store gospel _ news of weeping Madonnas and the like.
</P>
<P>
   A recent Sun, for example, predicted a great flood in a cover
spread labeled ``Bible Prophecies Come True.'' In other stories, it
asserted that ``demonic possessions have risen to plaguelike
proportions'' and that there is ``a frightening rash of UFO
sightings throughout North America.'' It linked Mother Teresa to a
bleeding crucifix in Calcutta, India, and ran an ad for a prayer
with an ``ironclad guarantee.''
</P>
<P>
   The AJC poll suggests that such topics do resonate with large
numbers. History suggests this has long been the case. Supermarket
tabloids' content can be traced at least as far back as English
``broadside ballads,'' published in the 16th to 19th centuries.
These were rhymed compositions, often about crimes, public hangings
or cosmic phenomenons, printed on a single sheet, to be sung and
sold in the street. The broadsides were often illustrated with
woodcut prints of their subjects: a pigheaded woman, ghosts
walking, a woman possessed.
</P>
<P>
   The 17th-century diarist Samuel Pepys categorized broadside
themes in 10 categories, which have endured through the centuries
to our tabloid era. These include devotion and morality; ``history
_ true and fabulous''; tragedy, including judgments of God; and
``love fortunate'' and ``love unfortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, however, supermarket tabloids' CQ seems to be
declining. Not too many years ago, stories about hauntings, UFO
sightings and miracles were common in The National Enquirer, the
nation's best-selling and best-known tab. Recently, however, the
Enquirer has tended more toward Hollywood phenoms than heavenly
ones.
</P>
<P>
   The gap is not likely to be filled by the mainstream daily
press, despite the recent surge in coverage of religion, faith and
values. These pages and sections are more apt to cite ordained
ministers than doomsday specialists.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean the archetypal news of cosmic mystery will
go unreported. The void, one suspects, will largely be filled by
the Internet, home of niche interests. UFO Web sites feature photos
and videos of sightings, interviews with abductees, reports,
articles and much more, including 52 indicators of UFO encounters
or alien abduction.
</P>
<P>
   Exclamation-point headlines being the staple of supermarket
tabloids, let me predict this one: World Wide Web to Go Cosmic!!!
That prognostication, be warned, does not come with an ironclad
guarantee.

 &HT;    Father claims voice led to drowning son
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSWELL, GA. -- You don't have to convince John Robinson, 52,
that ESP is real.
</P>
<P>
   When his 15-year-old son was 4, they were swimming at a friend's
house, and something ``very weird'' happened, Robinson says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was way down at the other end of the pool from him,
talking,'' says the retired Air Force colonel. ``All of a sudden, I
heard a voice, and it was very emphatic, clear as a bell, as if
someone was talking to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I swam to the other end, and my son, who couldn't swim, had
slipped off an inner tube and fell to the bottom. If I hadn't come,
he'd have drowned.''
</P>
<P>
   Adds Robinson, one of the people who responded to The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution's Southern Focus Poll: ``There's a lot we
don't understand. But there's no doubt in my mind that what saved
David was supernatural. It was something in the mind that we don't
understand.''
</P>
<P>
   Other poll respondents also offered stories of uncanny
intuition.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Kimsey, 50, of Loganville had a premonition just before
Christmas 1987 that someone at their family gathering wouldn't be
around another year.
</P>
<P>
   She'd never sensed anything so morbid or so vivid, and she
immediately went hunting for a video camera to record the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a strong impression it was my daddy,'' she said. ``And
sure enough, he died in February. It wasn't a fluke, because I'd
thought it might be my grandmother, who was in ill health. Things
have happened all my life I couldn't explain.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, the premonition didn't come in a dream, but in
broad daylight. She was simply overwhelmed by ``this urge, a real
need, to find this video camera. It was like somebody was standing
behind me saying, `You need to do this.' It wasn't a verbal voice;
I could sense it more than hear it. I think it was the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   Robinson maintains that ``we're all so bombarded with stuff on
TV, you never know what to believe. I am religious, but I think
there's things about the mind we don't even come close to
understanding in this unfathomable universe.''
</P>
<P>
   He himself was saved during his tour in Vietnam by a voice that
told him to take a later plane from one base to another, he says.
</P>
<P>
   The one he'd been scheduled to take crashed, killing everyone on
board.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes you think,'' he says. ``And I think about these
things every day.''

 &HT;    Country stars to release meaningful albums
 &HT;    By Russ DeVault
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill, two of country's ultra-respected
singers and songwriters, have career-marking albums coming Aug. 11.
Harris' ``Spyboy,'' also the name of her band, is significant
because it's a live career retrospective. Gill's ``The Key'' comes
about a month after his divorce from Janis Arnold Gill and about a
year after the death of his father, Stanley Gill. Gill's title cut,
``The Key to Life'' is about his father and features Gill, a gifted
picker whose life has always figured into his songs, playing his
father's banjo.
</P>
<P>
   After noting that the ``Spyboy'' liner notes don't say where the
live tracks were recorded, Harris fans may recall that she helped
the late Gram Parsons with a faked ``live'' medley on his 1974
album ``Grievous Angel.'' Reminded of that, Harris laughs, then
says she simply wanted to be ``nonspecific'' about where the tracks
were recorded. The long-ago faux medley, Harris says, was done
``very tongue-in-cheek with a tip of the hat to the things we'd
done and places we'd played.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: The winner for ``Best New Show for the `98-`99 TV
season'' is. . .
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coolest new TV series coming this fall? That would probably
be ``Buddy Faro'' (9 p.m. ET, Fridays on CBS), a swingin',
retro-hip detective comedy that's rat-packed with goofy dazzle.
</P>
<P>
   The most unlikely new star? No quetion, it's Sammo Hung, a
tubby, blank-faced Hong Kong martial arts whiz of astounding grace
whose English is as thick as his midsection. He'll star in
``Martial Arts'' (9 p.m. ET, Saturdays on CBS).
</P>
<P>
   The sweetest new couple? Moira Kelly (``Chaplin'') and Jason
Beghe (``G.I. Jane'') who play a newly married public defender and
cop in ``To Have and to Hold'' (9 p.m. ET, Wednesdays on CBS).
They're sexy, funny and have chemistry to burn.
</P>
<P>
   The chances of any of these new shows breaking out and becoming
a hit? Think snowballs on Satan's sidewalk. And not just because
they all happen to be on CBS, although that probably doesn't help.
CBS is taking chances, but its audience doesn't usually want
chances; it wants ``Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman'' back on the air.
</P>
<P>
   Television is no more fair than the rest of the universe, and
arguably less sometimes. Starting late next month, six networks
will start bringing forth 37 new shows, most of which will fail,
and most of which deserve to fail. What's sad is when TV gets it
right, and the audience gets it wrong. Witness last season, when
the smart, edgy ``Nothing Sacred'' died, while ``Veronica's
Closet,'' a comedy that flopped around like a marlin on a boat
deck, was a Top 10 hit just because it followed ``Seinfeld.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm just back from two weeks in California spent watching most
of the upcoming fall series and talking to the people who make
them. There's no single trend; the zeitgeist is as hazy as the
skies, and Los Angeles was under its highest-level smog alert some
of the time I was there.
</P>
<P>
   When they're not idiotically promising that all of their new
shows will be strong, brave and true, most network executives are
fretting that the system of making pilot episodes in the spring to
launch as series in the fall has broken down irretrievably. There's
too many shows, and too little talent to make them, particularly
talented writers. ``As an actor, you're a victim of the writer,''
says actor William Devane, breaking through the fog of numbed
optimism with which most stars try to promote their new series.
Actually, the viewers are victims, too.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it's amazing when a show itself breaks through. Like
the WB's ``Felicity,'' (9 p.m. ET, Tuesdays) about a confused but
endearing young woman (played by Keri Russell) in her freshman year
of college, midway between Claire Danes' Angela of ``My So-Called
Life'' and Calista Flockhart's ``Ally McBeal'' _ two shows it has
the potential to emulate. Or ``Cupid,'' a slight but very romantic
drama (10 p.m. ET, Saturdays on ABC) that will appeal to those
people staying home Saturday night and drowning their sorrows with
Haagen Dazs.
</P>
<P>
   The bad, of course, also abounds, which comes as no surprise.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's sitcom ``Costello'' (8:30 ET, Tuesdays on Fox) stars Sue
Costello, a tart, painfully honest stand-up comic from South
Boston. Her show, though is just painful: a bunch of dim louts in a
bar. It's what ``Cheers'' would have been if all the customers had
been Carla's in-laws.
</P>
<P>
   ``Vengeance Unlimited'' is a nasty little piece of work starring
Michael Madsen (``Reservoir Dogs'') as a vigilante. ABC is airing
it at 8 p.m. ET, Thursdays, which is too early in the evening; 3
a.m. would have been a better choice.
</P>
<P>
   WB's ``The Army Show'' is so stunningly stupid it makes you long
for the sophisticated wit of ``McHale's Navy,'' while NBC's surfin'
soap opera ``Wind on Water'' (8 p.m. ET, Saturdays) is mainly a
desperation career move for Bo Derek, which pretty much tells you
what you need to know.
</P>
<P>
   But most of the new fall series are not really hateful, they're
just there, or will be soon (and gone even sooner).
</P>
<P>
   So what will be the big hit be? Based on the Duh! theory of
prognostication favored by highly paid media buyers on Madison
Avenue, it's ``Jesse,'' which will air at 8:30 p.m. ET, Thursdays
on NBC, between ``Friends'' and ``Frasier.'' Christina Applegate,
having shed every trace of her Kelly Bundy image, plays a single
mom working in her father's bar in Madison, Wisc., and playing
emotional caretaker for the men in her life: young son, bellicose
dad, wierdo brother. It's likable enough, and somehow managed to
escape being run through the NBC sitcom homogenization machine
(``Suddenly Fired Up Naked in the City''), but if I never see
episode two, I'll live.
</P>
<P>
   There's also some strange dualism theme running through the fall
schedule; there's two of practically everything, including Olsen
twins. Their new show, ``Two of a Kind'' (8 p.m. ET, Fridays on
ABC) kind of sums up this doppelganger effect.
</P>
<P>
   There's two shows that go behind the scenes at TV shows (``The
Brian Benben Show,'' 9:30 p.m. ET, Mondays on CBS) and ``Sports
Night'' (9:30 p.m. ET, Tuesdays on ABC). There's two sitcoms about
black families moving into white suburbia (``The Hughleys,'' 8:30
p.m. ET, Tuesdays on ABC) and ``Living in Captivity'' (8 p.m. ET,
Fridays on Fox). There's two shows about big, boisterous Irish
families in Boston (the aforementioned ``Costello'' and ``To Have
and to Hold''). Guess how many shows there are about single dads
with wacky brothers raising little kids? Count 'em: ``Brother's
Keeper'' (9:30 p.m. ET, Fridays on ABC) and ``Holding the Baby''
(7:30 p.m. ET, Sunday on Fox).
</P>
<P>
   But if popular culture can survive two big feature films about
giant rocks heading toward earth in one summer, it can survive the
Olsen-twinning of television.

 &HT;    The real truth about television
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pasadena, Calif. _ Every summer, the networks trot out their new
fall shows for the Television Critics Association meeting here,
which concluded Sunday. And every summer, every show is great, to
hear the people involved tell it.
</P>
<P>
   No sitcom actor took a gig in a second-rate show that will soon
be cancelled because he or she needed to pay the mortgage; no, the
script or the character really spoke to him. Every producer got his
first choice for a cast. Every cast has bonded and become like a
family.
</P>
<P>
   Yeah, right. But sometimes, some interesting truths, or just
plain unscripted comments, slip out. A few examples from this
summer's tour of fall shows:
</P>
<P>
   -- ``We're selling tennis shoes and potato chips. That's what
shows are on television for.'' _ D. L. Hughley, star of the
upcoming ABC sitcom ``The Hughleys.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I would like the idea of combining stunt casting with
actual stunts. Get Sharon Stone and fire her out of a cannon.'' _
Michael J. Fox of ``Spin City.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``There's just so many (programs) that tend to be about
dating, and more dating, and specifically very beautiful
20-year-olds dating.'' _ Producer Diane English, creator of
``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I really didn't know who she was. My dad and my grandpa
sure did.'' _ Twentysomething actor Brian Gross on co-starring in a
new series with Bo Derek.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``To me, 'edgy' has become a bit tiresome.'' _ Ken Olin, star
of CBS's upcoming ``L.A. Doctors,'' on one of TV's favorite
buzzwords.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I think I'd like to see more shows about single, white,
thirtysomething, pretty women working in the media.'' _ Producer
Tom Werner (``3rd Rock From the Sun''), sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``In a way we're like athletes, except we're older, fatter
and we run like girls.'' _ ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' star Colin
Mochrie, on training to do improvisational comedy.
</P>
<P>
   -- ``I came out of a (network) meeting a couple of weeks ago,
and they said the first rule was: nothing rural, nothing Southern,
nothing dealing with country and western, nothing dealing with
anyone over 40 _ literally.'' _ Producer Matt Williams (``Home
Improvement'').
</P>
<P>

 &HT;    Summer wisdom: It's time for teens to get molars out
 &HT;    By Bette Harrison
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For many teenagers, summer means hanging out with friends,
lazing by the pool, perhaps working and, ugh, having their wisdom
teeth pulled.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the teenage rite of summer,'' groans Reanna Justus, 18,
of Cobb County(Ga.), who along with her twin, Amanda, will undergo
the surgery in August. ``Most of my friends already have had it
done. We need to do it before we get our senior pictures taken so
we won't look like chipmunks.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most teens dread the procedure. Having their
wisdom teeth pulled is often their first experience with surgery.
The best part of the whole ordeal comes afterward, when their moms
fuss over them, changing ice packs and offering them special soft
treats like applesauce and Italian ices.
</P>
<P>
   Wisdom teeth, or third molars, are the last teeth to develop.
Although some adults have mouths large enough to accommodate them,
most don't. If there isn't room, infection, pain and crowding of
existing teeth may occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can usually tell by the time they're in their midteens
whether or not their wisdom teeth are going to have adequate room
to erupt properly,'' says Marietta oral surgeon Dr. John Freihaut.
``The teenage years are an ideal time to have wisdom teeth removed
because young people heal quickly and with few complications.''
</P>
<P>
   The procedure is so common _ Freihaut estimates that two out of
every three teens will need their wisdom teeth extracted _ that
almost every teen knows at least one other who's had it done this
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Straight had hers taken out July 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually, it wasn't bad,'' says Straight, 18, of Suwanee, Ga..
``I think having your braces tightened is worse, you know, in the
pain department.''
</P>
<P>
   Teens trade wisdom teeth extraction stories like war veterans _
this one swelled out to ``here''; that one chug-a-lugged
painkillers; another couldn't eat anything except chocolate pudding
for two days.
</P>
<P>
   But Michael Goldstein, 17, of Cobb County, didn't mind the
experience a bit.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, they give you laughing gas and you float around the
room for a while,'' he says. ``Then they numb you. Then they wake
you up and it's over.''
</P>
<P>
   So how long did he exist on chocolate pudding?
</P>
<P>
   ``What pudding?'' he laughs. ``I always put food before pain.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: 19TH-CENTURY NOVELISTS, STOP SPINNING IN YOUR
GRAVES 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With all due respect to Arthur Schlesinger Jr., A.S. Byatt,
William Styron and the others who, acting at the behest of the
Modern Library, produced a list of the 100 greatest
English-language novels of the century, the truth is that the
entire endeavor is so drenched in caprice as to be close to silly.
</P>
<P>
   You might be able scientifically to pick the 100 best-ever
baseball players, because there would be a certain statistical
basis to rely on. The same is not the case with works of the
imagination. Still, the purpose of the exercise was to provoke
discussion, always a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   Should ``Ulysses'' really have been No. 1, especially when one
suspects that almost nobody, probably including most members of the
Modern Library panel, has ever read James Joyce's difficult
masterpiece from cover to cover? How can Joseph Conrad's immortal
``Lord Jim'' be No. 85, while ``Zuleika Dobson'' by Max Beerbohm
ends up 59th? And here's another question that emerged from a
recent conversation duly provoked by the Modern Library list: How
many of the books on it would still be there if the selections had
included works of the 19th century as well? My own quick answer is
not many.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when one starts examining this issue a bit more closely,
the Modern Library list of 20th-century writers virtually
demonstrates that the 19th century was a greater epoch for
literature. In any case, I offer that statement (one that is
certainly no more outrageous than some of the choices in the Modern
Library list) as a challenge for rebuttal.
</P>
<P>
   It is true, of course, that the Modern Library list has many
very good novels: two by Joyce as well as works by F. Scott
Fitzgerald, William Faulkner, Vladimir Nabokov, Robert Graves and
Virginia Woolf, along with books by Henry James and Joseph Conrad,
19th-century men whose greatest works squeaked in just over the
20th-century line.
</P>
<P>
   But on the 19th-century list would be Charles Dickens and Herman
Melville, Jane Austen and Mark Twain (``the Lincoln of our
literature,'' said William Dean Howells). Comparing Virginia Woolf
with Jane Austen, in my view, is similar to comparing Samuel
Richardson of ``Clarissa'' with Henry Fielding of ``Tom Jones,'' as
Samuel Johnson did. ``There is more knowledge of the heart in one
letter of Richardson's than in all `Tom Jones,' '' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   I would say that there is more literary genius in every chapter
of Austen than there is in the entire oeuvre of Woolf. ``To the
Lighthouse'' is a fine but somewhat precious and dull work,
certainly not one to be mentioned in the same breath with ``Pride
and Prejudice''; yet it got the 15th spot on the Modern Library
list.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest monuments in American literature are, I would
argue, ``Huckleberry Finn'' and ``Moby-Dick.'' Indeed, what serious
person could maintain, if those two books had been included, that
they would not have ended up higher than the two top American
entries on the Modern Library 20th-century list, ``Gatsby'' and
Nabokov's ``Lolita''?
</P>
<P>
   These latter two works are indisputably great, but I do not
believe that either of them has the mightiness of theme, the
narrative power or the transgressive originality of the Melville
and the Twain.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other 19th-century novels that would crowd out most of
the 20th-century selections: ``Vanity Fair,'' by William Makepeace
Thackeray; ``Billy Budd,'' by Melville; ``Middlemarch,'' by George
Eliot; ``Far From the Madding Crowd,'' by Thomas Hardy, and at
least six books each by Dickens and Austen. That is not to mention
Stephen Crane's ``Red Badge of Courage,'' Nathaniel Hawthorne's
``Scarlet Letter'' or ``The Last of the Mohicans'' by James
Fenimore Cooper. If I am right that the 19th-century list would be
greater than the 20th-century one, the next question is why.
</P>
<P>
   This is not easy to answer, given the difficulty of ever knowing
why the literary imagination seems to flourish at certain times and
in certain places but not in others. Perhaps the 19th century was
greater than the 20th because, except for the Napoleonic Wars that
opened it and for the American Civil War, it was a period of
relatively small and short military conflicts. As Jason Epstein,
senior editor at Random House, puts it, the great war of the 20th
century lasted with some brief interruptions from the beginning of
World War I in 1914 to the end of the Cold War in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   It has been argued that civil or international turmoil is a
stimulus to great writing. But the hypothesis here is that the
20th-century wars were so devastating that they led to a loss of
spirit and confidence, both of which are necessary for the
production of great literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 19th century was fundamentally an optimistic, progressive
century,'' Epstein said. ``Things were going to get better. The
20th century was riddled with angst and disillusion, and each
century produced its appropriate literature. The consensus in
retrospect is that the 19th century produced greater literature
than the 20th, so the conclusion would seem to be that optimism is
better for literature than pessimism.''
</P>
<P>
   World War I and the powerful despondency that it created, the
disgust with the human animal that it generated, aided in the
development of an over-elaborated, introspective sensibility that,
while critical to the modernism pioneered by Joyce, also led
literature toward self-consciousness and away from events.
</P>
<P>
   And in this sense, the literary age of feeling, of personal,
sexual, political and stylistic exploration, seems somehow smaller
than the literary age of great moral and philosophical narrative.
The priority given to literary experimentation in the 20th-century
novels of politics and consciousness seems to have operated in the
recent Modern Library list.
</P>
<P>
   How else to explain why ``Lolita,'' ``To the Lighthouse'' and
``Portnoy's Complaint'' are high on the 20th-century list while
Conrad's ``Lord Jim,'' a far greater work, in my opinion, than any
of those three, ended up No. 85?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm all wrong, but I don't think so. Surely my preferences
are no more capricious than ranking Aldous Huxley's ``Brave New
World'' as the fifth-best book in English of the century, a strange
choice indeed!

about CitySearch, an Internet company, she called her broker to buy
the stock. But in her haste, she took a wrong turn on the
information superhighway. CitySearch, which soon is going public,
will use the ticker symbol CTYS. In the meantime, another company,
Cityscape Financial, is using the same symbol. She mistakenly

EFFORTS UNDER WAY TO REFORM CHINA'S MILITARY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CHINA-MILITARY-ECON) 
(mk) 
 By SETH FAISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's broad array of military-run and
military-related enterprises are undergoing a deep transformation
that is intended to yield a fighting force that is more
professional, less distracted by nonmilitary business and, above
all, better controlled by generals allied with President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   A series of deep-seated reforms, begun early this year but
largely shielded from public view, emerged part way last week when
Jiang publicly ordered the armed forces to relinquish all of their
multifarious business operations, ostensibly as a way to combat the
military's extensive role in smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that is only one part of a larger shift under way in China's
military, Western and Chinese analysts say. Overall, the idea is to
sort out the myriad pieces that make up China's jigsaw puzzle of a
military-industrial complex into two sides: military consumers of
weaponry on one side, and civilian producers on the other.
</P>
<P>
   While many key personnel shifts have already been made, deeper
structural changes may take years. So far, Jiang appears to have
the support of the army's top generals, but potential opposition
from middle ranks is harder to gauge.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, the reforms will include these steps:
</P>
<P>
   _ Making the army more professional, by turning its focus back
to military preparedness, and away from money-making.
</P>
<P>
   _ Making military units more accountable, by more clearly
defining lines of control.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the lawlessness, arrogance and hidden caches of money
by officers, who have generated bitter resentment among ordinary
people.
</P>
<P>
   _ Forcing the army to rely on its official budget, $11 billion
in 1998, and not on side earnings from the companies it has been
operating.
</P>
<P>
   _ Helping Beijing better control the military's most egregious
activities. An epidemic of smuggling goods into China has been
dominated by the military in recent years. A spate of free-lance
arms dealing, like selling missiles to Iran and AK-47s to
California, has badly embarrassed China's diplomatic efforts to
improve its image abroad.
</P>
<P>
   _ Reducing the overall size of the army to 2.5 million soldiers,
from the current 3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, various units of the military control roughly 15,000
mostly small and medium-sized businesses, which experts say range
from garment factories to transport companies to hotels.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely that anyone inside or outside the military has a
clear accounting of how much these enterprises earn, not to mention
the money made by illegal activities like smuggling. It is equally
difficult to ascertain just how much of this money goes to military
operations, and how much simply disappears into the pockets of
individual officers.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, Jiang is trying to redirect traffic at the chaotic
intersection of China's military, politics, law enforcement and
money-making, as unruly in recent years as the tremendous traffic
jams that paralyze Beijing streets each day.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mainland's military-business complex at the beginning of
the next decade may no longer be as high-profile, well-connected or
sprawling as today,'' Tai Ming Cheung, an expert on China's
military who works in Hong Kong for Kroll Associates, wrote
recently. ``But it is likely to remain powerful and more focused.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Jiang is up against considerable obstacles. Officers in
the army wield considerable influence in a system where access is
still more important than talent.
</P>
<P>
   Extracting a lucrative business from any owner can be difficult.
In China, the highly secretive nature of the military's financial
arrangements may make it difficult to discern real lines of
ownership and control over businesses, even if they are ostensibly
relinquished.
</P>
<P>
   And in cutting off the military's free-lance enterprises, Jiang
may place an added burden on the central government. But it is
unlikely that the military budget will be increased by more than 10
percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, though Jiang is pushing military reforms in the form
of a political campaign that demands compliance, Chinese military
officers accustomed to a long history of such campaigns have a
well-honed sense of how to adjust to the political line of the day,
without actually doing much.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, apparently as part of the campaign, the authorities
released a report called China's National Defense that for the
first time made public the basic operations of the army. Although
it contains no significant new information, the report is a
symbolic opening for an organization long shrouded in secrecy and
is intended in part to ease the concerns of China's neighbors about
a military threat.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang derives his ultimate authority in China as chairman of the
Communist Party's Central Military Commission, where he succeeded
Deng Xiaoping. Many of the changes under way in the military are a
late stage of Jiang's efforts to gradually replace Deng's military
allies with his own.
</P>
<P>
   One milestone fell in September, when Gen. Liu Huaqing retired
from the Communist Party's ruling Politburo and from the Central
Military Commission. Liu was believed to have overseen many of the
military's business operations, and his departure opened the way
for significant change.
</P>
<P>
   In March this year, as many of Beijing's central ministries were
reorganized, the Chinese authorities made a brief announcement that
an organization called the Commission of Science, Technology and
Industry for National Defense was being reinvented to gain civilian
control over most defense-related industries.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, the authorities announced the forming of a new
wing of the army called the General Armaments Department, intended
to oversee requirements for new weapons.
</P>
<P>
   They were small clues to portentous changes. China's
military-industrial complex is so enormous that it is sometimes
hard to see where it begins and ends. Yet the thrust of these
changes was to divide the defense industry into two clear sides,
with the army deciding what it needs, and civilians running
production.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   ``It's a push to separate the military buyers from the
sellers,'' said a Western expert in China's military, based in Hong
Kong. ``The domestic military manufacturers are extremely poor at
delivering product on time. The idea is to make them more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Realigning the core businesses among China's 15,000 companies
owned or controlled by the military will also inevitably lead to
deep change involving some of the most lucrative and powerful
positions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has said repeatedly that he wants to wean the military off
its secondary income from these companies, and to rely solely on
money from the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, who works for Kroll, estimates that more than 95 percent
of all Chinese military enterprises are small and medium-sized
companies. It may not be difficult to sell or transfer the bulk of
these companies into civilian hands.
</P>
<P>
   A more critical question is what happens to the 500 to 1,000
large enterprises that generate about three-quarters of the untold
billions of dollars earned by military-owned or controlled
businesses, many of which are being consolidated into
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The largest among them, like China Poly Group, Xinxing Group and
Carrie Enterprises, are already international corporations with
offices around the world, including in the United States. Military
leaders will likely be more reluctant to let go of these jewels
unless they are given a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, an expert in China's military at Rand Corp.,
noted that official news accounts of Jiang's announcement last week
were riddled with ambiguities about the scope of the order to
separate military from business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This warrants some skepticism on the parameters of what Jiang
is undertaking,'' said Pollack. ``Though I think even a few actions
here to curtail some of the friskier business units would resonate
with a cynical public.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key factors in the transformation of the military and
defense-related industries is the reorganization of the Commission
for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, also
known as COSTIND.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, with Deng at the helm of China's military, the
commission was run like a personal fiefdom of the family of Marshal
Nie Rongzhen, a veteran of the Long March, the defining experience
for elder leaders of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1994, as Jiang began trying to oppose the widespread
nepotism in the defense industry, was Nie's daughter, Nie Li,
forced to retire from the board of the commission. Yet her husband,
Gen. Ding Henggao, remained in charge of the commission until
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ding was best known outside China for championing the
development of long-range ballistic missiles and the Long March
series of satellite launching systems. Ding was replaced by another
military leader, Lt. Gen. Cao Gangchuan, a deputy chief of staff in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year, as the commission was reformed, a civilian was
placed in charge: Liu Jibin, a former vice minister of finance with
experience in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the commission technically answered both to the
State Council, China's Cabinet, and to the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission, probably the single most powerful
organization in China's vast political apparatus. The military
commission often overruled or meddled with decisions by the State
Council, causing innumerable delays.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new reforms, the Commission for Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense is expected to exercise direct
control over key groups a civilian-run defense industry. That
includes China Aerospace Corp., Aviation Industries Corp., China
North Industries Corp., China National Nuclear Corp. and China
State Shipbuilding Corp.

STUDY SHOWS MOST EMPLOYERS SATISFIED IN HIRING WELFARE RECIPIENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (EDs: FILED in ``w'' and ``f'' categories)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By NICOLE TSONG

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most employers who hire former welfare recipients
are satisfied with their work, but a majority of the workers get
low pay and few benefits, according to two reports released Monday
by the Urban Institute, a Washington-based think tank.
</P>
<P>
   Seventy percent of the employers who have hired people on
welfare said the new workers have a positive attitude and are
reliable, according to one of the reports. These traits are the two
most important attributes for entry-level positions such as
cashiers, busboys and hotel housekeepers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   In hiring people off welfare rolls, employers are sending a
message of ``get to work on time, be courteous, have a good
attitude and get along with people,'' said Jack Meyer, president of
the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), which produced
the report on employers for the Urban Institute.
</P>
<P>
   Other job qualifications such as experience and training were
far less important to the 500 employers surveyed around the
country. Meyer said 12 percent of them rated experience high and 4
percent ranked training as important when they hired people for
entry-level jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 500, more than 60 percent, said they had hired welfare
recipients, and 94 percent of those 309 employers said they would
be willing to hire more such workers again, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute also released a report on income differences
between people on welfare and those who have taken entry-level jobs
in 12 states _ Alabama, California, Colorado, Florida,
Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Jersey, New
York, Texas and Washington.
</P>
<P>
   About two thirds of the entry-level jobs available to welfare
recipients pay less than $6 an hour, the report said. The annual
income of a welfare family of three jumps an average of 51 percent
when one member of the family takes a part-time job working 20
hours a week and earning the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. That
family's income goes from $8,808 to $12,888, the study reported.
</P>
<P>
   If the employee gets a full-time job working 35 hours a week at
the minimum wage, the family income goes up another 20 percent, the
report said. About half the entry-level jobs available to people on
welfare are part-time.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people still living on the edge,'' Meyer said.
``They are quite vulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   The combination of low wages and no or few health benefits is
still a problem for former welfare recipients, even though a large
number of employers are willing to hire them, he added.
</P>
<P>
   The Urban Institute's report said only half of the firms that
offer entry-level jobs have health insurance and paid vacations for
those workers. A quarter of the firms offer no benefits, it added.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the year that President Clinton signed Congress'
welfare overhaul legislation into law, 12.4 million people were
receiving cash assistance, according to the Department of Health
and Human Services. Millions have left the welfare rolls since
then, but many others are deterred by the lack of health insurance
and day care, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're going to keep people in the labor force beyond a
year or two, they're going to need to know they have a sick day,
that they have health coverage,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Although government incentives encouraging employers to hire
entry-level workers are numerous, nearly three quarters of the
bosses surveyed did not know about such programs as subsidies and
federal or state tax credits, the ESRI report said.

INVESTORS STILL WARY ON RUSSIA'S DEBT SITUATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian stock prices plummeted again Monday, a clear
indication that investors still doubt whether the government can
make good on a pledge to climb out of its seemingly bottomless hole
of domestic and international debt.
</P>
<P>
   The government seemed to underscore its plight by announcing
over the weekend that it would raise money by selling part of its
controlling stake in the huge Gazprom natural-gas monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Trading System index of stock prices, which fell 17
per cent last week, dropped another 9.1 percent Monday, to 143.46,
roughly where it was before the International Monetary Fund agreed
to prop up the government's finances with billions in new loans.
</P>
<P>
   The first of those loans, totaling $4.8 billion, reached
Russia's central bank late last week and was used to increase
foreign-exchange and gold reserves, which had been dropping
rapidly. One condition on the loans was Russia's commitment to make
sweeping and basic changes in how it assesses and collects taxes
and in its spending policies, a promise that President Boris
Yeltsin's government has made but which the Russian Parliament so
far has rejected.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst in London for Salomon Smith Barney, Mohamed Erian,
said that the loan package and the promise of reforms alone are
good news, but not good enough to satisfy skittish investors who
have seen similar promises fail before.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a reform-minded team in place,'' said Erian, the
firm's European chief of emerging market research. ``The issue
comes down to implementation, implementation, implementation. And
the market is watching that very, very carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin's reforms still face at least two major obstacles: more
opposition from the Parliament, which is expected to resume
considering the fiscal overhaul next month, and opposition from
consumers and big business, both of which face higher taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Given the fall in stock prices, it seemed a poor time for the
government to sell shares in Gazprom. American Depository Receipts
in Gazprom, which are traded on foreign stock markets, have fallen
by more than one third in the last 10 days, to a 52-week low.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin approved plans this weekend to sell 5.87 percentage
points of the government's 41 percent stake in Gazprom, the world's
largest natural-gas company and a linchpin of the Russian economy.
The shares being sold are worth about $1.4 billion on foreign
markets, and experts suggested Monday that the government would try
to interest two foreign partners in Gazprom ventures, the Royal
Dutch/Shell Group and ENI SpA, the Italian energy conglomerate, to
buy the shares. The stock would be worth considerably less _ about
$520 million _ were it sold to Russians on the Russian stock
market.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov said the sale would ``enable
the government to attract additional funds to the budget and keep
the state's position'' as the largest shareholder in Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
   Though the government's financial position has improved in the
last week, it still must find $7 billion by the end of September to
pay off bonds that were sold at very high interest rates earlier
this year when the treasury was in a severe cash crunch.

   NEW YORK _ The setting for ``Twelfth Night'' is an Oriental
fantasy of the mind. As far as the eye can see, there is a road
winding through water. At the front of the Vivian Beaumont stage,
actors are lolling sybaritically, surrounded by burning candles and
incense. Nearby is a pool for swimming and dunking. Later in the
play there will be a rainstorm. In Bob Crowley's enchanting scenic
design for Nicholas Hytner's production, water is the central motif
_ more than 10,000 gallons at every performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally and metaphorically a waterlogged play,''
Crowley said. ``It begins with a shipwreck, and the water imagery
is in virtually every other scene. There is also the narcissism of
the characters, constantly looking at their own reflections. The
idea of water being the first mirror, the twinning of things _ all
that has resonance.''
</P>
<P>
   And, he said, ``there is a liquidity about the theatrical floor
plan.'' The set is ``all curved,'' he said, trilling his ``r'' so
that the word itself sounded curved.
</P>
<P>
   It is a set unlike any other previously at the Beaumont and a
most unusual design for ``Twelfth Night,'' which is generally
presented in a variation of house and garden: alternating between
the Duke's palace and Olivia's luxurious home, with Viola disguised
as the Duke's male messenger plying a path between the two. Seldom
is the play presented completely alfresco as in this Lincoln Center
Theater production.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample performance dexterity onstage, beginning with Max
Wright, Brian Murray and Philip Bosco as the comic characters,
although some reviewers had reservations about several of the other
actors. There was unanimous enthusiasm for the scenery. The set is
the first striking element that greets theatergoers. Applaud the
scenery? ``I have no objection,'' Crowley said.
</P>
<P>
   After more than 20 years of working in the theater, the
45-year-old designer is accustomed to ovations, this year with
``Twelfth Night,'' several seasons ago with Hytner's production of
``Carousel,'' also at the Beaumont.
</P>
<P>
   Crowley, who was born in Ireland, studied painting and sculpture
before going to drama school and deciding to be a scenic designer.
In England he has worked both at the Royal Shakespeare Company (the
original production of ``Les Liaisons Dangereuses'') and the Royal
National Theater.
</P>
<P>
   He has designed in the widest diversity of surroundings, from
the small Cottesloe Theater at the National (an intimate,
corridor-style production of ``King Lear,'' starring Ian Holm) to
Royal Albert Hall (``La Traviata''). At the National, he also did
David Hare's trilogy about major English institutions, filling the
great expanse of the Olivier stage with photographic collages as
well as swiftly sliding columns.
</P>
<P>
   In the second act of Hare's ``Amy's View'' (starring Judi
Dench), the star's dressing room opens up and is replaced by a
deep, transforming look at the theater stage and what is behind it.
As Crowley says, ``The space determines the way a production should
look.''
</P>
<P>
   Hytner, who has frequently worked with Crowley in theater and
opera over the last 10 years, said about his collaborator: ``He
always responds poetically to a play. His sets are often painterly.
My taste, which is influenced by Bob, is not toward architectural
literalism or social realism. The kind of worlds we like to create
are worlds of the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley specializes in creating magical environments. To the
director as to the designer, Shakespeare's Illyria in ``Twelfth
Night'' meant, in Hytner's words, ``not here, not now, somewhere
different, a world where romantic impossibilities are made possible
_ a midsummer madness that can be resolved through the power of the
stage.''

EXCESSIVE BREAKS CONSIDERED COMPANY THEFT?

By KEN LLOYD  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Question: At a recent staff meeting, I stated that
taking too long a break was the same as stealing, and that making a
personal call should count as one of your breaks. Now, everyone is
giving me the cold shoulder. Was I off base, and should I offer an
apology? C.K.
</P>
<P>
   Answer: When fellow employees give you the cold shoulder because
of some arguably defensible job-related comments you made, they are
far more off base than you. If they disagree with your comments,
the appropriate response is discussion, not ostracism.
</P>
<P>
   There are many experts who regard overly lengthy breaks as a
form of theft, and they could just as easily argue that personal
calls should count as breaks. Presumably your associates would
ostracize these experts too.
</P>
<P>
   However, the reality is that people are going to take breaks,
occasionally long breaks, and they are going to make personal
calls, and none of this needs to be viewed automatically as theft
or grounds for reduced break time. In this age of increased
flexibility, long hours and family commitments, such actions are
commonplace and acceptable, as long as they are not excessive.
</P>
<P>
   There is a standard of reasonableness that needs to be applied
here. When personal calls or breaks enter the unreasonable zone for
your company, these behaviors can be described in many ways, such
as insubordination, disloyalty or even theft.
</P>
<P>
   The issue that you raised calls for more discussion with your
colleagues. And, by any standard of reasonableness, they owe you an
apology.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I happened to overhear a couple of people I work with refer
to me as a spy for management. I was stunned and said nothing at
the time. I have never spied on anybody, and I am personally
offended. Is there anything I should say to them? S.R.
</P>
<P>
   A: If you rush to tell these delightful associates that you
overheard what they said, they will probably respond with, ``Aha!
You were spying on us!''
</P>
<P>
   It is interesting to note that when employees feel that a
co-worker is spying on them, such employees are often doing
something they would prefer to keep away from management. In such
circumstances, there can even be some paranoia, with these
employees looking around for spies and even inventing them. In your
situation, it sounds like they invented you.
</P>
<P>
   Since this accusation is so distressing for you, along with the
fact that this type of claim can be rather contagious, there is a
way to communicate your concern to these individuals, without
generating a counterattack. During a lunch or informal
conversation, indicate that all of you used to work well together,
and you wonder why that seems to be slipping. Soon enough, the spy
comment will be released, and you can express your feelings and
facts on this matter.
</P>
<P>
   Another approach is to consider discussing your concern with the
informal leader of the work group. If this person aligns himself or
herself with you, the inventive detractors are likely to fall into
line.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I recently found out about two jobs in different departments
at a local company and had an ``informal chat'' with people from
both. The meetings were two weeks apart. It has been four weeks
since the first meeting, and although I normally would call the
first person, I liked the second position better and hate to push
the first person to make any decision before the second position is
available, which will be at least three weeks from my meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But, if I don't call, someone else may get that job, and, if it
is offered to me, do I turn it down and risk losing the second
position and then having nothing? M.D
</P>
<P>
   A: Since the second position is the one you want, it is the one
you really should pursue. If you go with the first position, the
second position is going to be lingering in the back of your mind,
and that preoccupation can interfere with your job satisfaction and
performance.
</P>
<P>
   Hence, the game plan should be to maintain regular contact with
the decison makers for the second position. You need to be in a
sales mode here, and persistence definitely counts.
</P>
<P>
   If you are pursued for the first position, you should call your
contacts for the second position and let them know you are not
trying to apply leverage, but an offer is forthcoming. Let your
first choice know you prefer to work for them. Ask where they are
in their decision making and where you are in their decision
making. If you go with your second choice, you are in for a lot of
second guessing.

 NEW YORK: the stage.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As usual, Crowley began his research in a museum. In creating
the New England background for ``Carousel,'' he was inspired by the
paintings of Andrew Wyeth and Winslow Homer. With ``Twelfth
Night,'' he drew upon two exhibitions at the Metropolitan Museum of
Art: one of Oriental carpets, the other of illustrated pages from
an Indian manuscript. The designer and Hytner saw them early this
year when Crowley was working on the elaborate, highly graphic sets
for Paul Simon's ``Capeman.'' Crowley made clear that he had not
tried to reproduce anything in the exhibitions for ``Twelfth
Night,'' but approached them for their atmospheric emanations.
</P>
<P>
   The environment is generically Eastern, stressing the play's
fabulistic side. ``We talked about the hallucinogenic nature of the
piece and the obsessive nature of the people who occupy the
place,'' Crowley said. The aim was to give `'people's desire and
dreams _ and the language _ room to breathe.'' The approach, as
with all his Shakespeare productions, is to keep it ``fairly free
and abstract'' and not to ``straitjacket it into a certain time,
place or period.''
</P>
<P>
   The closest the production comes to a period is in dealing with
the comic characters who are like ``English freeloaders abroad,''
while the others are exotics, with the Duke ``the ruler of a
strange land living in an extraordinary kind of Buddhist temple''
and Olivia the equivalent of Rapunzel locked in a tower.
</P>
<P>
   Studying pictures of the Alhambra gardens, Crowley was struck by
the way that light filtered through the space so that things were
half seen. Avoiding solid scenery, he wanted the setting to have a
translucent quality, so that people could be glimpsed on the wing.
Intentionally, the feeling is cinematic, with crosscuts between
scenes. As one scene finishes downstage, another begins upstage.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the characters met,'' he said, ``they would recognize each
other and the play would finish. Instead, they take the opposite
road like we all do in life, and life goes on.''
</P>
<P>
   Working closely with costume designer Catherine Zuber, he was
conscious, he said, of ``the idea of disguise, that it's only a
layer of clothing, a thin piece of fabric protecting somebody from
being discovered.''
</P>
<P>
   Crowley likes to deal with natural elements, with fire for the
witches in a production of ``Macbeth,'' and with water here and in
``The Night of the Iguana'' at the National Theater, in which there
was a thunderous tropical rainstorm onstage. For ``Twelfth Night,''
the walkways had to be made safe for the actors rushing across the
paths. Extra care was taken to avoid flooding, so that there would
not be ``a very wet `Brain' downstairs,'' he said, referring to ``A
New Brain,'' the William Finn musical at the Mitzi Newhouse Theater
(where, several seasons ago, Crowley did an imaginatively high-tech
set for ``Hapgood'').
</P>
<P>
   For ``Twelfth Night,'' the Beaumont stage was opened to its
widest dimension. Because the audience looks down on the open
stage, as it might in a Greek amphitheater, everything _ the cast
as well as the minimal scenery _ is low-lying. ``The most important
part of the Beaumont is the floor,'' Crowley said, explaining why
the actors often recline.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Beaumont was considered a difficult if not an
unworkable stage. Crowley was undeterred by the reputation of the
theater, finding it an exhilarating place to work: ``I'm quite
happy to work in big spaces, the bigger the better.'' One director
who previously solved the Beaumont problem was Peter Brook. He
presented his version of ``Carmen'' in a sandpit in the middle of
the arena. That production and Brook himself were models for
Crowley.
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke about Brook's influence, he clarified his own
concept of design. Heretically, he does not like scenery, at least
not an abundance of it, whenever possible choosing the simplest
setting. In this production, there are a bench and at one point a
wall, both of which pop out of the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate moving furniture onstage,'' he said, ``and it is even
harder to move it offstage.'' Only cushions are carried on and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather look at a beautifully lit backstage with a
great actor in the middle of it than a great production with 55
tons of naturalistic living rooms flying in and out,'' Crowley
said. In his eyes, an empty stage can be a design choice, and it
can be exquisite, if properly lighted. ``I'm putting myself out of
work, aren't I?'' he said with a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Pointing to Brook's production of ``The Cherry Orchard,'' in
which there were carpets and an absolute minimum of furniture, he
said there was no such thing as something's not being designed:
``As Brook says in `The Empty Space,' the minute an actor walks
across the stage and somebody looks at him, that is the beginning
of a piece of theater.''
</P>
<P>
   But where does the designer come in? Crowley responded with
questions: ``Is the floor wooden or is it a piece of canvas? Is it
covered in dirt? Does it need sweeping? What's illuminating the
actor? Those are all design decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   As always, he first makes sketches, followed by a scale model of
the set, which in this case he sent to the production manager with
a note attached: ``Here's the model as requested. Just add water.''
</P>
<P>
   After the model was unveiled for the cast and crew at the
Beaumont, the director and the designer walked outside the theater
into the plaza, where they faced the large pool with a Henry Moore
sculpture in the middle. Although he has often sat by that pool,
Crowley said he ``had completely forgotten that what is outside the
building reflects what the audience sees inside.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, he said, he thought about floating a miniature
version of the Moore sculpture in the set, but decided to leave
such parallels to the imagination of theatergoers, who arrive in
this Illyria as to another world.

WHY AREN'T MAINSTREAMERS BUYING ALTERNATIVE COUNTRY?
</HEADLINE>
 
(Accompanied by BC-ALTERNATIVE-COUNTRY-PRIMER) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the summer of 1998, alternative-country is everywhere:
</P>
<P>
   _Junior Brown, whose music can sound like Ernest Tubb jamming
with Jimi Hendrix, does very funny commercials for Lipton ice tea.
</P>
<P>
   _Whiskeytown, having received incredible critical notice for its
latest CD, ``Strangers Almanac,'' is opening for John Fogerty.
</P>
<P>
   _Former cult favorite Robert Earl Keen has become a major Texas
singer/songwriter who can fill small halls.
</P>
<P>
   _The Old 97's are THE most popular band in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   _Critics are hailing Lucinda Williams' just-released ``Car
Wheels on a Gravel Road'' as one of the year's best CDs.
</P>
<P>
   _And alt-country acts such as Steve Earle, the Mavericks,
BR5-49, Wilco, Joe Ely, Son Volt, the Bottle Rockets, Don Walser
and Gillian Welch fill clubs nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   But good luck trying to find any of the above on mainstream
country stations. Don't hold your breath while looking for their
CDs on the national CD or singles charts.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone loves alt-country _ except mainstream country.
</P>
<P>
   Call it alt-country or insurgent country or y'allternative or No
Depression, but this music hasn't caught on with most of the people
who love Garth, Shania, LeAnn, George and Reba. Despite laudatory
reviews, the top alt-country acts (BR5-49, Brown, Wilco and Earle)
sell, at most, 150,000 CDs _ a pittance in an era when most top
country acts can sell at least 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   Look at the Mavericks, who have learned the hard way what it
means to buck the system: When their music was more easily
identified as country, they were Nashville's darlings: Their third
CD, 1994's ``What a Crying Shame,'' sold 1.2 million copies. But
this year's excellent ``Trampoline,'' which adds more Latin
touches, has sold just more than 100,000 copies and fell out of the
national Top 40 after less than four months.
</P>
<P>
   But industry observers, musicians, label executives and such
alt-country stars as Robert Earl Keen say the pendulum is swinging
back; that mainstream country has become so homogeneous, so slick
and so faceless that country fans will eventually reach for the
music's raw, blue-collar core.
</P>
<P>
   ``The face of country music WILL change,'' says Keen, who is
recording his next CD in Austin, Texas. ``It's really bad right
now. But there will be a respite, because even diehard country fans
I know can't stand it, and it's going to turn in the next couple
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Marino, the Americana editor of Gavin Magazine, a radio
industry trade publication, says that ``country used to have a
specific, loyal audience _ now it's pop music. The two audiences
are sharing performers now, people like Shania and LeAnn and Garth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, alt-country is truer to country traditions than
mainstream country. Don Walser, Joe Ely, the Mavericks _ they're
all rooted in country traditions, and they're going to attract
people who want something more traditional.''
</P>
<P>
   Alternative-country can be described, generally, as anything
that's identifiably country but, well, somehow outside the narrow,
slick sound currently in vogue in Nashville. It can be the
Nashville-goes-Latin sound of the Mavericks or Steve Earle's
hard-edged tales of hard living or the throwback sounds of Robert
Earl Keen or Junior Brown, which hark back to, respectively, the
``outlaw'' movement of the '70s or the glory days of Lefty Frizzell
and Tubb.
</P>
<P>
   And as the name implies, there's often a nod toward rock 'n'
roll. Which is hardly new: From Elvis Presley to Bob Dylan, major
rock artists have always had more than a little country in their
sound.
</P>
<P>
   The ties became closer in the late '60s and early '70s with the
Byrds' groundbreaking '68 LP ``Sweetheart of the Rodeo'' and
records by the Flying Burrito Brothers, the Burritos' star-crossed
leader Gram Parsons, and the Grateful Dead's ``Workingman's Dead.''
</P>
<P>
   In the '70s, the Eagles' ``Tequila Sunrise'' and ``Lyin' Eyes''
were played on mainstream rock stations. In 1981, Elvis Costello
released ``Almost Blue,'' a straight country record that included
Hank Williams and Gram Parsons covers. The '80s brought a wave of
acts combining country, punk and roots music, including Jason &AMP; the
Scorchers and Lone Justice. Lyle Lovett, k.d. lang and Earle were
all embraced, to one degree or another, by rock and/or folk fans.
</P>
<P>
   If alt-country is having an impact on mainstream country today,
however, it's through the songs these artists are writing for
mainstream artists.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Lauderdale, John Prine and Buddy Miller make a good living
(or at least a lot of supplemental income) by writing hits for
others. Prine co-wrote Strait's recent No. 1 hit ``I Just Want to
Dance With You.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that many alternative songwriters are writing hits
bodes well for the situation,'' says Mike Ireland, whose debut CD,
``Learning How to Live,'' has won critical praise for its blend of
honky-tonk and the string-laden ``countrypolitan'' sound favored in
the '70s. ``If alternative-country never breaks, we'll continue to
have Lucinda Williams and John Prine records _ they'll be able to
continue to make music. In country, it matters who the songwriter
is _ there's a level of respect there.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Still, some believe that the genre will continue to be on the
fringe, and that performers will only break through on a
case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   After all, notes Marino and others, the alt-country acts that
have had some success have all had, well, a gimmick, a certain
kitsch appeal: Brown has his guit-steel and funny lyrics, BR5-49
have their throwback hillbilly clothes and humor. The subtlety of a
Wilco, or the country-meets-Latin sound of the Mavericks will
likely remain at odds with the slick sounds coming out of
Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Others speculate that alt-country will find a home in mainstream
or alternative rock, discovered by rock fans looking for something
that's not as slick as Hootie, that's more adult than matchbox 20
and that sounds nothing at all like techno.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Snider, a partner in the Gypsy Tea Room, a Deep Ellum venue
in Dallas that books a lot of alt-country acts, says the music
attracts a variety of fans. ``The people who come to the Tea Room
are just people who like good music _ you get some country fans,
some rockabilly fans, the swing crowd,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   And Murry Hammond, bassist for the Old 97's, says that his band
has ``much more to do culturally'' with rock audiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Country isn't a mystery to rock people,'' he says. ``They know
Hank Williams and the real stuff from the cheese-ball stuff. It's
like all the rock people who have warmed up to swing _ it's
basically uptempo boogie. And it's happening _ we get intense
airplay on some rock stations. Groups like Wilco and us have a real
good chance of being embraced by the rock people.''
</P>
<P>
   Rob Miller, president and co-founder of Chicago's Bloodshot
Records, agrees. Bloodshot, he says, was founded in 1993 as a
reaction against how boring alternative rock was, not how boring
mainstream country was.
</P>
<P>
   He sees the audience for Bloodshot acts such as the Waco
Brothers, Robbie Fulks and Moonshine Willy as aging alt-rock fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get the same honesty from our acts as you did from the
Replacements _ it's three chords and in your face,'' he says.
``Most of our audience is disaffected rock fans, aging punks like
myself. I wouldn't have liked what we put out when I was 16 _ young
rock fans just hear `country,' and it's a big red flag.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new BR5-49 CD, ``Big Backyard Beat Show,'' which was
released July 14, is getting a major push toward independent CD
stores in an attempt to generate a buzz in the alt-rock community,
according to Dan Herrington, sales and marketing manager of Arista
Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're drilling for oil here _ you never know,'' says
Herrington, noting that the band has already made inroads in rock
by opening for both Bob Dylan and the Black Crowes. ``But if you
see a Whiskeytown show, or a BR show, a lot of the audience is the
same people who like the swing stuff. They're both danceable, and
they're both an alternative to Third Eye Blind and Tonic and
matchbox 20.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has to be the wave of the future. For alt-country to be
big and go to the masses, it'll take that Nirvana syndrome _ one
song by one band and everyone follows the leader. Hopefully BR will
be that band.''
</P>
<P>
   But can anybody be that band? Redbeard, a longtime disc jockey
at KTXQ/102.1 FM, thinks rock fans probably always will resist
anything labeled ``country.''
</P>
<P>
   Redbeard says his station has played Denton's Slobberbone, as
well as the Jayhawks and Wilco, but in general ``it just doesn't
break through. Country stations say it's rock, and rock stations
say it's country. The problem that's always plagued country-rock
plagues it now: Nobody will claim it as their own.''
</P>
<P>
   And maybe that's OK. There's a large enough audience for
alt-country CDs that the artists can continue to record and tour,
if not get rich. And if that Nirvana-ish hit doesn't ever kick the
door wide open for every other band _ that's OK, too. For guys like
Murry Hammond, filling clubs around the country and getting to play
the music they want to play is reward enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of country people don't care about us or look like us,''
he says. ``They'll never give us the time of day. People in
alt-country will never become more mainstream musically _ we're not
capable of it. And the fact that alt-country is an incredible
failure commercially is a pretty good indication it's doing
something right.''

   _ Notes: One of the few pleasant aspects to this woeful
Cincinnati season has been the resurgence of Pete Harnisch's
career. After a horrible 1997 that included more than four months
on the disabled list because of anxiety and insomnia and his
release by Milwaukee during the winter, Harnisch has rebounded to
become the Reds' most consistent starter. While he is 1-4 in his
last seven starts, he has maintained a sub-3.50 ERA since May.
Until he gave up six earned runs at Colorado in his last start,
Harnisch had a string of 16 games in which he allowed three earned
runs or less. His record has been hurt by Cincinnati's laggard
offense, which has scored one run behind him in six of his 16
games. After several weeks of unsteady work, Millwood is starting
on five days of rest for the second time this month, and although
he is 1-1 in his last two starts, he has recovered from some rocky
work in mid-June. After giving up 12 runs in two games against
Montreal (June 19) and the New York Yankees (June 24), Millwood has
allowed just five runs in his last 23 innings (1.96 ERA).
Cincinnati is one of two teams, along with Houston, that Millwood
has yet to face in his career. In his debut against five clubs this
season, he has gone 3-1.

 &HT;    Veteran Martin ready to settle in
 &HT;    By Matt Winkeljohn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tony Martin has pretty much adjusted to his change in
residence, after buying a condominium. Now, it's just a matter of
settling into his new job.
</P>
<P>
   When the Falcons traded next year's second-round draft choice to
San Diego to acquire Martin, they did so with the intention of
replacing Bert Emanuel as the speed receiver.
</P>
<P>
   But Martin, who will be 33 on Sept. 5, is being reminded that
it's not always defensive backs he has to worry about. There are 11
receivers in camp, and sometimes there aren't enough balls to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, he hasn't had many opportunities yet to catch
balls (in live drills),'' receivers coach Rennie Simmons said.
``It's my experience that sometimes you'll go two or three
practices and only get one or two balls, and then get several at
once. But in drills, he's shown us everything we expected.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin doesn't seem to mind the logjam, at least not yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``Overall, everything is going OK,'' said Martin, a 10- veteran.
``I'm still learning the offense. We have a young group of hungry
receivers who bust their butts to get to balls. That's good.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month's trade brought Martin to the same city as his
father, Hal, and that's good for business. Hal, who buys and sells
radio stations, also handles many of Tony's financial affairs.
Martin recently bought a music recording studio in Charlotte,
although he hasn't opened the doors yet.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, Martin, a 6-foot-1, 181-pound former
quarterback from Mesa College in Colorado, is out to prove he's
still the player he was in 1996, when he went to the Pro Bowl after
catching 85 passes for 1,171 yards and 14 touchdowns _ tying the
NFL high that season.
</P>
<P>
   He again led the Chargers in receiving in 1997, but his 63
catches for 904 yards and six touchdowns gave some people the
impression he might be aging.
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Martin says. For one thing, he was one of just 10
Chargers to start every game. And when quarterbacks Stan Humphries
and Jim Everett went down with season-ending injuries, the team's
passing attack became nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very frustrating,'' Martin said. ``You didn't know who
the quarterback was going to be the next week, and it's hard enough
getting used to one quarterback.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage of passes, Martin is having no problems
adjusting to Falcons' quarterback Chris Chandler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, I didn't think he could throw the ball like he can,''
Martin said. ``He puts the ball in spots you don't think he can.
And I thought Humphries threw a great deep ball, but Chris throws a
beautiful deep ball.''

 &HT;    Marino willing to give NFL another year _ at least
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ The real-life picture of Dan Marino loping onto
the Miami Dolphins practice field last week was enough to elicit
thousand-word essays on the relentless ticking of the NFL's
biological clock.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a quarter-century after Marino began firing footballs at
the stop sign outside his parents' home in the South Oakland
section of Pittsburgh, the trademark hop-step that preceded
millions of passes has all but disappeared. An incredible release,
once measured in nano-seconds, has slowed. And when Marino enters
the locker room now during his 16th training camp, an assistant
trainer usually is a stride behind with two bags of ice.
</P>
<P>
   Marino has nothing wrong with his ears, however, and he hears
the clock ticking on his crusade to add a Super Bowl ring to all
those gaudy passing records. His best football, he acknowledges, is
behind him. Even if this camp isn't Marino's final fling, he won't
have many more.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think at this stage of my career, I'd love to play a lot
longer, because I still enjoy the game,'' Marino said. ``But will
that happen? I'm really not sure. I feel like I can (keep playing).
I'm not sure I will.''
</P>
<P>
   It was painful to watch Marino struggle last year in a moribund
offense bereft of playmakers, and the results left Miami
management, the fans of South Florida and even some of his young
teammates skeptical about what to expect in 1998. Marino will turn
37 in seven weeks. His career passer rating is superior to all 18
quarterbacks in the Hall of Fame, but he threw only 16 touchdown
passes last year, his fewest in a full season, and had five
interceptions returned for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   It would have been anathema several years ago to suggest the
Dolphins might be better off without Marino, who holds 24 league
records and shares seven others. But callers to a local sports-talk
radio station are pushing for coach Jimmy Johnson to begin the
transition by turning over the offense to backup quarterback Craig
Erickson.
</P>
<P>
   And team officials correctly pointed out that the Miami defense
is more settled than the offense for one of the first times in
franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Marino's cool demeanor off the field often has been perceived as
indifference. And his fiery sideline tantrums, usually directed at
receivers running wayward routes or some inexplicable playcalling
by departed coordinator Gary Stevens, were viewed as selfish. But
nobody ever doubted his physical ability until last year's
late-season collapse.
</P>
<P>
   Marino knows that his skills have deteriorated. How much remains
to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can still make all the throws when nothing around him
breaks down,'' said Keith Jackson, a former Miami tight end. ``But
everybody's coming after the ol' gunslinger now.''
</P>
<P>
   Plenty of questions surround the franchise in Johnson's third
season, but none seems bigger than this one: In the twilight of a
Hall of Fame career, can the Miami quarterback approximate the
Marino of old or is he simply an old Marino?
</P>
<P>
   Marino worked diligently each of the last two offseasons to cut
his weight, and the new regimen has paid dividends. His body-fat is
at an all-time low. The paunch that appeared about five years ago
is gone; his upper body is taut, and Marino has gone four-straight
years without offseason surgery.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's taken care of himself,'' Johnson said. ``But we have to
take care of him, too. If we do that, Danny won't have to feel like
he's under the gun to win every game himself.''
</P>
<P>
   So, Johnson fired Stevens, who abandoned the running game too
easily and overwhelmed players with ponderous game plans. He also
scrapped the Don Shula-designed offense Marino used for his first
15 years and a four-wide-receiver set that contributed to the
Dolphins' undoing in December.
</P>
<P>
   In his first two seasons, Johnson meant to establish the same
type of physical running game he had in Dallas. But he always
leaned on Marino's arm when things got tough. This year, he has
mandated the run. Shula and Stevens were offensive pack rats,
annually adding new wrinkles, never editing out the old, and the
result was an encyclopedic playbook that confused even veteran
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes sometimes because people didn't understand
what it was they were supposed to be doing,'' Johnson said. ``With
a young team and because of free-agency, you have to be simpler.''
</P>
<P>
   Offensive tackle James Brown said, ``There were times last year
when the (opposition) defense knew what we were doing better than
we did.''
</P>
<P>
   There is an economy of words in the Dolphins' new offense, fewer
audibles and, Johnson said, more of his imprint. If the overhaul
stripped Marino of a comfort zone, it also has done away with the
normal camp tedium. The quarterback can't react from years of rote
anymore, because he's learning the offense like everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a kind of kick in the (butt), but really a good
one,'' Marino said. ``It won't be as monotonous a camp now.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes were obvious in two practices Saturday. In years
past, a seven-on-seven passing drill drew most of the attention,
and Marino might go days without missing a receiver against the
skeleton defense. On Saturday, the focus was a run-the-gauntlet
ball-carrying drill meant to test a player's toughness.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the offensive line terribly unsettled, Miami will run
the ball and Marino will, for the first time in his legendary
career, become a complementary player. He is comfortable with the
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've played in many games where I've thrown it 60 times and we
got out butts kicked, and that's no fun,'' said Marino, who has
thrown fewer than 25 passes in just 18 games and more than 40
passes in 53. ``It's more fun, believe me, when you throw it 20 or
30 times and win.''
</P>
<P>
   If Marino and the Dolphins can make such a dramatic conversion,
then the best quarterback never to win a championship could have a
sweet 16th season. If they can't, a bittersweet year figures to be
Marino's last.

 &HT;    Revamped Browns still anyone's team
 &HT;    By Len Pasquarelli
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS - The bid process for a resurrected Cleveland Browns
franchise won't conclude here today, but it could escalate to
another level.
</P>
<P>
   During a one-day session, NFL owners will fine-tune the process,
and there is a chance that league officials will narrow the field
of candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Credit-card magnate Al Lerner, a one-time partner of former
Browns owner Art Modell, is perceived as the front-runner. His
status was enhanced last week when San Francisco 49ers team
president Carmen Policy resigned to join the Lerner bid, and the
partnership was endorsed by former Browns quarterback Bernie Kosar.
</P>
<P>
   But commissioner Paul Tagliabue insisted that the Lerner group
is not a certainty to get the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we've been told, everything is still wide open,''
said Charles Dolan, whose group includes comedian Bill Cosby and
Hall of Fame coach Don Shula. ``There's still a long way to go in
this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, a lot of money will be spent in pursuit of the
Browns, who begin play in 1999. The first sealed-bid process in
league history probably won't fetch the $1 billion franchise fee
several owners had predicted two months ago. But the winning bid is
expected to come in between $500 million-$600 million, and the
ownership should be determined by September.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given all the revenues that franchise is going to generate, I
think that we're certainly justified . . . in expecting something
in that range,'' Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although there will be plenty of debate over the plan to stock
the Browns with players, a formula similar to that used with
Carolina and Jacksonville could be adopted.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, there is a good chance owners will approve the sale
of the Minnesota Vikings to San Antonio businessman Red McCombs.
The powerful finance committee huddled here Monday evening to
review documents on that deal.

 &HT;    Big accomplishments expected from Ga. Southern
 &HT;    By Earnest Reese
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREENVILLE, N.C. _ The Georgia Southern Eagles are the choice of
both the media and coaches to soar highest in the nine-member
Southern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of no one attending the conference's annual
two-day ``Rouser'' that ended Monday afternoon, the team picked to
finish atop the league is stationed in Statesboro.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, first-year coach Paul Johnson guided Georgia
Southern to a 10-3 record and the school's second Southern
Conference title since it joined the league in '93. And now the
locals in Statesboro are talking loudly about a possible fifth 1-AA
national title. ``That just means we've got a target on our chest
and everybody is shooting at us,'' said Johnson, who has been
associated with 50 victories at Georgia Southern.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, enough people thinkJohnson and his staff have
brought the Eagles back to the level that won four national titles.
</P>
<P>
   A four-year assistant at Georgia Southern during the coaching
days of Erk Russell, Johnson was part of two of those
championships, in 1985 and '86. His 1997 team, which lost three
games by a combined total of 22 points, returns 17 starters among
47 lettermen.
</P>
<P>
   And Georgia Southern's schedule could not be more favorable for
quarterback Greg Hill and mates to make a run for the championship.
The Eagles start the season with three games at Paulson Stadium
among a total of seven home games.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, at 5-11, 165 pounds, was a big numbers guy as a freshman
and sophomore. Last season, the Saratoga, Fla., native rushed for
1,171 yards and 18 touchdowns, and passed 770 yards more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Physically, (Hill) is as good as any quarterback I've ever
coached,'' said Johnson, who worked with legendary Eagle Tracy Ham.
``I'm excited about him, and I think he's going to have a great
season.''
</P>
<P>
   In the conference media poll, the Eagles received 17 of the 18
first-place votes. The other went to Furman, which was picked
fourth in both polls, behind Appalachian State and East Tennessee
State.
</P>
<P>
   ``In all honesty, Georgia Southern is in the right position, and
probably East Tennessee,'' Western Carolina coach Bill Bleil said.
``But three through nine could go any way.''
</P>
<P>
   East Tennessee State, which replaced SMU-bound Mike Cavan last
year with 39-year-old Paul Hamilton, was the runnerup pick in the
coaches' poll but third behind Appalachian State in the media
voting.
</P>
<P>
   Despite being the overwhelming choice to win the conference
crown, Georgia Southern had only one player selected to the
pre-season all-conference first offensive unit, junior guard Mark
Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Three Eagles were picked for the first defensive unit: linemen
Voncellies Allen, a junior, and Eric Davis, a senior, and sophomore
linebacker Daryl Morrell.
</P>
<P>
   The conference gathering ended Monday with a speech by former
NFL quarterback and coach Sam Wyche, who played at North Fulton
High School and Furman.

   U.S. Runway Shows May Be Held Earlier
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The wheels are turning to shift the entire slate of
women's American runway shows from the end of the fashion cycle to
the beginning, pre-empting London, Milan and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an 80 percent chance the shows will be early,'' said
Fern Mallis, the executive director of Seventh on Sixth, the
organizing body for the unified American shows held twice a year in
Bryant Park and other locations around the city. Normally, they are
held in April and in late October. The change would mean shows in
February and September.
</P>
<P>
   Seventh on Sixth personnel are now busy with the men's shows
that are under way and when they are over, their attention will
shift to reorganizing the women's schedule. Dates under review for
the fall 1999 shows are Feb. 8 to 12 and Feb. 14 to 19. The
American menswear shows, which take place in early February or
midmonth, may be adjusted to give the industry more time between
menswear and women's wear.
</P>
<P>
   While the final decision rests with the designers for whom Ms.
Mallis works, conversations have already taken place with sponsors,
Bryant Park Restoration Corp., which runs Bryant Park, and FTL
Architects, which provides the tents. Several designers said they
would rather wait another season to make the switch but the
industry cannot afford to have a split fashion week, Ms. Mallis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Not all designers welcome the move to earlier dates. As Nicole
Miller pointed out, it will force designers to show their clothes
long before the consumer is ready to buy. She added that it would
ignite a forest fire of earlier shows, earlier deliveries to
retailers and earlier promotional sales in stores. But she said she
would go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Mallis said, ``Some people see that if the bulk of the
people are going to move, they'll do it, though grudgingly.''
</P>
<P>
   Erecting and heating tents in February would not be a problem,
Ms. Mallis said she has been told. But if there is a snowstorm,
fashion week will be fraught with complications. Bryant Park has
pledged to work with Seventh on Sixth on the new dates but has
already sounded the alarm. ``Early September is still very much
summer in New York City,'' Ms. Mallis said. ``People will not be
too happy that we're taking over the park at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan follows news of the decision by Helmut Lang, Calvin
Klein, Donna Karan and Searle Blatt, announced this month, to stage
their spring 1998 show in September rather than October or early
November.
</P>
<P>
   Sneakers Change Tune
</P>
<P>
   While the United States is choking on sneaker endorsements by
athletes, an Australian sneaker company, Royal Distributions, has
moved to music. It has hired Goldie, the irreverent English DJ and
producer, to design a special-edition athletic footwear, which it
called Royal Headz.
</P>
<P>
   The company made 2,000 pairs, all of which sold out, according
to a spokeswoman for Royal. The Headz name is a play on metal heads
music. She did not know if the Goldie sneaker would be made
available in the United States, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Barneys New York will introduce Royal Elastics for fall.
Made from synthetic material, the distinctive Royal slip-on
sneakers, or trainers, as the English call their athletic footwear,
have elastic side gussets and look somewhat like a designer version
of a traditional sneaker crossbred with an orderly's shoes.
</P>
<P>
   Music is the engine that drives style. And there are as many
people these days making fashion statements in sneakers as there
are working out in them. However, athletic footwear companies have
not tapped into this entertainer-endorsement market.
</P>
<P>
   Nike, for example, still depends solely on athletes like Michael
Jordan, Tiger Woods, Sheryl Swoopes and Dawn Staley to design and
endorse its products. ``We position ourselves as a company that is
geared to athletes,'' Robert Mitchell, senior manager for corporate
communications for Nike, said. ``If someone wants to wear the
products for some other purpose, that's fine, but Nike products are
produced for athletes.''

HOMEOWNER GETS COMMUNITY SERVICE IN GIRL'S DRINKING DEATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOREEN IUDICA VIGUE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A North Andover man was ordered Monday to perform 100
hours of community service in a case in which a teenage girl died
after getting drunk at a party at his house.
</P>
<P>
   John Zarella, 45, was allowed by a Lawrence District Court judge
to plead no contest to a charge of contributing to the delinquency
of a minor. Under the plea Zarella did not have to admit guilt
before accepting punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Ellen Flatley accepted the plea despite a tearful plea
from the victim's mother to punish Zarella more severely for
allowing minors to drink alcoholic beverages in his house &UR;  &LR; and then
ignoring the victim as she lay on his basement floor, dying.
</P>
<P>
   Meaghan Duggan, 17, fell down a flight of basement stairs in
Zarella's Campion Road home on Sept. 27 and cracked her skull in
two places. Duggan's mother, Teresa, said Zarella admitted to
her &UR;  &LR; that he supplied alcohol to the teenagers who were celebrating
his daughter Nicole's 18th birthday in his home.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan, a senior at North Andover High School, tumbled down the
stairs after drinking about 15 beers, then lay at the base of the
steps for seven hours before an ambulance was called. It was
revealed in court Monday that Duggan was dragged unconcious on the
basement floor while others cleaned up around her and that Zarella
and a another person stepped over her.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could they do that?'' Duggan's mother, Teresa, demanded.
``You wouldn't do it to an animal. How could you do it to a
child?''
</P>
<P>
   Zarella, who owns a water and sewer pipe cleaning business, left
the court without comment and could not be reached by telephone
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Flatley also ordered Zarella to attend a seminar on brain
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Duggan, who has terminal cancer and who lost her husband
to the same disease in 1991, sobbed as she delivered her victim
impact statement to the court. She recalled a daughter who lit up a
room when she walked in; a girl who kissed and hugged her mother
daily and whose smile and embrace will be missed forever. Meaghan's
older sister, Marcia, also told the court about the pain of losing
a sister.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe it is a slap to Meaghan's memory for John Zarella to
stand here and not admit what he did,'' said Teresa Duggan. ``I
will become a victim again if you just slap John Zarella on the
wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   An Essex County prosecutor recommended that Judge Flatley find
Zarella guilty and sentence him to one year in the county House of
Correction with 60 days to be served and the balance suspended for
two years probation.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney may appeal the judge's decision at the end
of Zarella's one-year community service sentence, according to
Charles Grimes, a spokesman for Essex District Attorney Kevin
Burke.
</P>
<P>
   Duggan's attorneys, meanwhile, will likely file a civil suit
against Zarella next week. Robert R. Berluti said the suit would be
the only way the Duggans can make Zarella accountable for his
actions.

 &HT;    Most with hearing loss don't seek help
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As a teenager, Debra Stelling first noticed she
couldn't hear high tones. A ambulance would wail by her house and
she wouldn't realize it unless her mother pointed it out.
</P>
<P>
   But it took nearly three decades, a growing distance between her
and her friends and listening problems at work before Stelling, 42,
finally decided to check out her hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Stelling is not alone in her reluctance. According to the Mayo
Clinic, only one in five people with hearing loss use hearing aids.
Those who don't blame ear wax, the social stigma of old age or the
high cost of hearing aids. Others cite cosmetic reasons or friends
or relatives with bad experiences.
</P>
<P>
   And because hearing loss often occurs gradually, many don't
realize their problem immediately or deny it, refusing to seek
help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They put it off on someone else, (saying) `If you spoke up or
stopped mumbling, then I could hear you.' It becomes someone else's
problem,'' said Kadyn Williams, an audiologist and co-director of
Audiological Consultants of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing loss affects nearly 28 million Americans. About
one-third of them developed hearing loss problems in part because
of noise. Age, too, is a factor. About 10 million American adults
over the age of 65 have difficulty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Stelling also was hesitant to seek help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `I'm too young to have a hearing problem. It's an
older person's problem,'' the Roswell resident said.
</P>
<P>
   But on a trip with her husband and another couple, she found
herself avoiding a friend because her friend's voice was so
soft-spoken and low, it was inaudible to her. Within a month after
the trip, she went to Audiological Consultants of Atlanta and got
an in-the-canal hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   To the normal eye, the hearing aid is barely noticeable. But to
those close to her, the difference was evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now when I say, `huh?,' my boss asks if my hearing aid is
in,'' she said.

 &HT;    Technology advances behind better hearing devices
 &HT;    By Ellen Lee
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It took some time to convince Ernest Norsworthy Jr.
that he needed a hearing aid. So when he eventually decided to
purchase one, he didn't want any old hearing aid. He didn't want to
be like his friends, who had tried them before and hated them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't ready to join that crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Norsworthy didn't have anything to worry about. Today's hearing
aid market is vast compared to even a decade ago. Within the last
few years, hearing aids have made technological strides, becoming
smaller and more complex than ever. The industry, with more than 35
manufacturers, sells nearly 1.7 million hearing aids a year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've tried hearing aids in the past and they were
unsuccessful, you should consider trying them again because new
technology has made a significant difference,'' said Laura
Dennison, an audiologist and the vice chairwoman of the Georgia
State Board of Hearing Aid Dealers and Dispensers. The 28 million
Americans who have some degree of hearing loss have a bundle of
products to chose from. Hearing aids, which are miniature
amplification systems equipped with a microphone, amplifier,
receiver/speaker and battery, can help even the hardest of hearing,
but consumers must pay attention to their own tastes and needs to
select the right one.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a much bigger ball park and it gets confusing to inform
everyone about what's available,'' said Dennison. ``There's so much
more available now than five years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   The most apparent change is the shrinking size of the hearing
aid. Large, bulky instruments are reserved for extreme hearing loss
problems. Today, hearing aids come in such small sizes that they're
nearly undetectable. Smaller than the diameter of a dime, the
tiniest hearing aids can be slipped completely into the canal of
the ear.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller sizes are a cosmetic boon for those who don't want
to advertise their hearing problems. Smaller hearing aids also have
the advantage of reducing the whistling sound that hearing aids can
make when they come in close contact with another person or a
telephone.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller hearing aids have their disadvantages, too. Many of the
smaller hearing aids have less power and are most beneficial for
those with mild to moderate hearing losses. Those who opt for the
smaller hearing aids, especially the ones that go in the canal or
completely in the canal of the ear, must adjust to having something
lodged into the ear and must learn how to manipulate it, sometimes
even using a remote control.
</P>
<P>
   But technology has provided more than just a size issue. The way
hearing aids process sounds changed dramatically several years ago,
when manufacturers began offering programmable hearing aids.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of amplifying all sounds, the way traditional analog
hearing aids do, audiologists can adjust the programmable hearing
aids to reduce loud, harsh sounds while amplifying soft sounds.
</P>
<P>
   Then, within the last three years, manufacturers developed the
digital hearing aid, which processes sounds digitally like a CD.
</P>
<P>
   Widex, a hearing aid manufacturer, became the first company to
offer a digital in-the-ear hearing aid in 1996 and the first to
offer a digital, completely-in-the-canal hearing aid in 1997. Now
other hearing aid manufacturers like Oticon and Bernafon have
produced their own line of digital aids.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of digital technology, sounds are more
fine-tuned and less distorted. The digital hearing aid can filter
sounds, and in the process, suppress certain unwanted sounds. Also
programmed by a computer in the audiologist's office, the digital
hearing aid can adjust to the environment a person is in. For
instance, in a setting like a restaurant, the hearing aid turns
down background noise while still amplifying the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   Norsworthy, after researching on the Internet and attending a
workshop, chose a digital, behind the ear hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was impressed because I like computers and this is like a
computer in the ear,'' said the 68-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Norsworthy made a serious investment. Some, but not all,
insurance companies pay for hearing aids or hearing tests.
Norsworthy paid for his own. His set of two digital hearing aids
cost him $4,600, with a two-year warranty. In Atlanta, audiologists
charge between $4,600-$6,000 for a set of digital hearing aids,
depending on size, with smaller ones usually costing more. A set of
programmable hearing aids costs $3,000 to $5,000, while analog aids
are generally the cheapest, $1,700 to $3,000 for a set of two.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big commitment to buy these, but it's something that
improves the quality of life. It's better than a piece of jewelry
or vacation,'' said Carol Fisher, a homemaker in her early 50s.
</P>
<P>
   Mail order hearing aids _ often advertised as a sound amplifier,
rather than an aid _ can cost under $400 for a set, but are not
recommended by audiologists because most people with hearing loss
must work with a hearing aid specialist to determine their level of
hearing loss and an appropriate hearing aid.
</P>
<P>
   Some audiologists, including Dennison, said that the digital
hearing aid, despite its technology, is not worth the extra
investment. Some programmable hearing aids often can do a similar
job for a lower price, she said. Other hearing specialists beg to
differ.
</P>
<P>
   Kadyn Williams, an audiologist and co-director of Audiological
Consultants of Atlanta, warned that consumers must be wary.``Not
all programmable hearing aids are equal,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher, one her patients, first had a programmable in-the-canal
hearing aid. Two years later, she tried a digital,
completely-in-the-canal digital hearing aid and found that it
controlled sound better _ and most importantly, the clarity
improved, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, hearing aids do not fix hearing loss problems. They
simply amplify sounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``You may not hear you like when you were 16, but it has nothing
to do with the aid. It's what the ear is doing to the signal,''
said Dennison. ``(Hearing aids) are not perfect by any means. You
need to keep in mind that it is still an aid. It is not a cure.''

PRODUCT PLUGS LOSE PUNCH AMID COMMERCIAL OVERLOAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN VAN DER WERF  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - A new pizza delivery offer is rubber-banded to your
doorknob _ every day. Classified circulars are so numbing they are
slowly turning to mulch on your front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banner'' advertisements on the Internet are disguised to look
like computer upgrades. You have to wear a certain T-shirt to get
free popcorn at the movies. Rump roast is on sale at Albertson's.
The phone rings and a resonant recorded male voice says, ``Hello. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   You hang up. You know what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are besieged by advertising, an estimated 600 to 1,200
commercial messages every day. And that's probably an underestimate
on days they visit a mall or a supermarket. Or watch MTV.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't going to change. The advertising industry is growing at
a pace faster than almost any other; 1998 should be the first year
it becomes a $200 billion-a-year business domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much advertising that I think the industry is kind
of inoculating the public against it,'' said Tim Riester, partner
in Riester/Robb advertising agency of Phoenix. ``As we do consumer
testing to try to figure out a way to get to consumers, we find
people have just become jaded.''
</P>
<P>
   There was probably a time when someone saw a sign atop a
taxicab, and said, ``Wow! What a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are five blimps floating over the Super Bowl in
addition to the once-extraordinary Goodyear blimp, and chihuahuas
lead us in reverential songs to taco chains, and we shrug our
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are resorting to beaming advertisements onto clouds
with lasers. A middle school in Grapevine, Texas, has a Dr Pepper
billboard on the roof to catch the attention of passing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of other advertising techniques just getting tested
are likely to reach consumers soon:
</P>
<P>
   _Direct-mail videos and CD-ROMs. This idea started with
political candidates in 1992 and is spreading quickly. Some Phoenix
area consumers have gotten videos in the mail from A.J.'s Fine
Foods; Whole Foods, a new supermarket in Tempe; and Coulter
Cadillac. Expect it to grow dramatically, with Jiffy Lube, LA
Fitness and Nationwide Insurance among the companies that have
signed up lately to send videos to potential customers, said Robert
Brucato, an account manager in the Phoenix office of Vaughan
Communications, a Minneapolis company that is one of the
originators of the approach.
</P>
<P>
   _Movie advertisements on ATMs. Quick sound and video clips play
while you wait for your money. This has been test-marketed in San
Diego since November and may spread nationally.
</P>
<P>
   _There are ads for the Arizona Lottery on the handles of the gas
nozzles at Circle K convenience stores. . Some Arco and SuperPumper
stations have taken the concept one step further, fitting gas-pump
islands with video screens that run a stream of advertisements to
capture the attention of bored tank-fillers.
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft was paying $200 to university professors who used its
programming tools in a scholarly presentation, or merely mentioned
the software. That offer has been pulled off the company's Web
site, but company officials hint that it might return.
</P>
<P>
   _Sabre Group Holdings Inc., owner of the nation's largest
travel-agent reservation network, said earlier this month that it
is considering selling individual travel itineraries to hotels,
car-rental agencies and other business partners. Consumers' travel
plans are ``a potential gold mine,'' according to the company. This
plan, however, might run aground because of privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   What a refreshing change that would be. There is very little
that is considered off-limits for advertising. Consider the growing
number of bars and restaurants putting advertisements on the inside
of the door to restroom stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always trying to figure out the sacred places where no
advertisers have gone before, and we all rush there,'' said Will
Rodgers, a partner in SHR Perceptual Management in Scottsdale.
``They end up being further ways to pollute our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The public has become so inured to it that the very notion of
what constitutes advertising is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN are being congratulated for their
``commercial-free'' broadcasts of World Cup soccer games. Instead
of interrupting play, the announcers said, ``Thanks to Budweiser
(or Canon or the U.S. Army, et al) for sponsoring this portion of
the game commercial-free.'' Then that sponsor's logo was on the
screen for five minutes or so, until the next sponsor took over.
</P>
<P>
   By whose definition is that ``commercial-free''?
</P>
<P>
   Billboards are banned along urban freeways, but advertisers have
figured out a way around that. A year ago, the Arizona Department
of Transportation announced that it would allow commercial
enterprises to adopt sections of the highway and pay for their
cleanup. Now the signs, which used to have the names of an Elks
Club or a college fraternity, carry the logos of Fox 10, or KZZP
radio, or Popular Outdoor stores.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in sports, it's way out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   You may have thought sports had reached the depths of crass
commercialism seven years ago when a college football bowl game was
named after a Weed Eater.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, every timeout, every listing of stats has a sponsor.
Nearly every stadium also has a corporate name, and the sale of the
naming rights are automatically figured as a source of revenue when
the stadium is being financed. This seems to be an American
phenomenon. Note that the new soccer stadium outside Paris is the
Stade de France, not the Evian Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a baseball game, and just so you won't concentrate too
much on the batter, a rolling sign behind him is advising you where
to get a home loan or what sports drink to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is Diamondbacks' Bank One Ballpark,
the stadium with the biggest advertising package of any sports
stadium in history, a $430 million agreement with 60 companies.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball fan was so outraged that he couldn't find an
American flag for all of the billboards at BOB that he wrote a
letter to ``The Arizona Republic'' to complain about it. You know,
the newspaper that has the most prominent sign of all at the
ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   People used to go to the movies for an escape from real life. No
more. It was maybe 10 years ago that advertisements started running
in movie theaters before the feature film, but long before that,
ads were running as part of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the astronauts in the British sci-fi flick ``Fire
Maidens fromOuter Space'' called uncanny amounts of camera time to
their Camel cigarettes and Longines watches.
</P>
<P>
   This sales method really seemed to hit its stride with the
Superman movies of the late '70s and '80s. Villains were constantly
being hurtled into every sort of billboard. It was in ``Superman''
(1978), the original, that we learned that back in Smallville,
Clark Kent's breakfast of champions was . . . Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, with each new James Bond movie, you can expect ad
campaigns with star Pierce Brosnan not only hawking the film but
all the products he uses in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger. Better. Ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   They have been the watchwords of the advertising world. But
there are many more examples of creeping advertising that are more
cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not only do you get spam, or ``junk'' e-mail, you get spam
pages. Call the number back and you get a recorded message
describing how to earn $1,000 a week by selling from your home, or
some other such pitch. There are ads on golf courses that show
golfers the shape and length of the hole, then advise them where to
drink after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every television station or network has its logo in
the lower right-hand corner of the screen at all times. Except, of
course, when there are real ads running. On a recent afternoon, the
Channel 3 (KTVK) logo was superimposed over the Superstation logo
on ``Inside Edition,'' which, showing that it is learning, has
moved its logo to the lower left-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets know everything about you. Research shows that soup
sales drop 6 percent if the cans are arranged alphabetically on the
shelves. Toothbrush sales increase 8 percent if they are at eye
level. Background music with 60 beats per minute increases sales by
38.2 percent over music with 108 beats per minute. It's all a
science, and now some enterprising marketer has found that grocery
shoppers also look at the floor a lot. So now that's where ads are
appearing _ beneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit advertising used to be no more complex than a sticker on a
bunch of bananas that told you where they were grown and who grew
them. Pick up an apple now and a sticker tells you that ``Liar,
Liar'' is available on video.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us have become walking billboards. Not only do we seek
out and pay a premium for clothing designed by Tommy Hilfiger or
Guess?, we are willing to wear shirts that advertise the maker.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever form of imagemaking.
</P>
<P>
   For clothing manufacturers, creating an attitude is as important
as designing a fashion. People are looking to create a personality
for themselves by the clothes they wear. Wearing clothing with the
name printed on it helps create that image, Riester said.
</P>
<P>
   According to several ad executives, this sort of imagemaking is
where the industry is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Richardson, partner in a small Phoenix advertising
agency, Richardson Or Richardson, said, ``I think the way to cut
through the clutter is to make ads that don't look like ads.
Consumers no longer buy products, they buy brands. You need to
create a culture for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nike isn't just a maker of athletic shoes. It is a
major player in youth sports and event promotion. The swoosh logo
gives the buyer an association with famous athletes, all of them
carefully selected. And it is now a retailing concept: Niketown,
the huge, multilevel stores with video walls and loud music that
are slowly spreading around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environment, an association,'' Richardson said. ``That
is advertising in the year 2000. That is how you sell Nike shoes
today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that is similar to the way Dodge saved its
truck business, Rodgers said. Ford may run ads saying its vehicles
are ``built Ford tough,'' but Dodge, by attaching a grille that
looks as if it came from a Mack truck, ``redefined what tough looks
like.'' Now Dodge, a distant third before the redesign, sells
almost as many trucks as Ford, the industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   Simple visual images that are instantly associated with a
product will become more important, Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world gets more complicated, we tend to want to
simplify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riester sees advertising heading in a completely different
direction. The competition just to get products into a store is so
intense, he said, that he sees more marketing being directed at
buyers, store owners and the other people making decisions on
product mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot buttons that would motivate a store are much different
than those that will motivate the consumer,'' Riester said. ``I
think that's the direction the smart companies will go.''
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean we will never again be subjected to Louie, the
Budweiser iguana?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in advertising, this has been researched.
</P>
<P>
   Don Godfrey, a professor of journalism at Arizona State
University who has studied advertising extensively, said studies
have consistently found that ``the more annoying the ad, the more
we remember it.'' &QL;

<P>
   UNDATED - A new pizza delivery offer is rubber-banded to your
doorknob _ every day. Classified circulars are so numbing they are
slowly turning to mulch on your front lawn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banner'' advertisements on the Internet are disguised to look
like computer upgrades. You have to wear a certain T-shirt to get
free popcorn at the movies. Rump roast is on sale at Albertson's.
The phone rings and a resonant recorded male voice says, ``Hello. .
.''
</P>
<P>
   You hang up. You know what's coming.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are besieged by advertising, an estimated 600 to 1,200
commercial messages every day. And that's probably an underestimate
on days they visit a mall or a supermarket. Or watch MTV.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't going to change. The advertising industry is growing at
a pace faster than almost any other; 1998 should be the first year
it becomes a $200 billion-a-year business domestically.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much advertising that I think the industry is kind
of inoculating the public against it,'' said Tim Riester, partner
in Riester/Robb advertising agency of Phoenix. ``As we do consumer
testing to try to figure out a way to get to consumers, we find
people have just become jaded.''
</P>
<P>
   There was probably a time when someone saw a sign atop a
taxicab, and said, ``Wow! What a great idea.''
</P>
<P>
   Now there are five blimps floating over the Super Bowl in
addition to the once-extraordinary Goodyear blimp, and chihuahuas
lead us in reverential songs to taco chains, and we shrug our
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   Advertisers are resorting to beaming advertisements onto clouds
with lasers. A middle school in Grapevine, Texas, has a Dr Pepper
billboard on the roof to catch the attention of passing airplanes.
</P>
<P>
   And a lot of other advertising techniques just getting tested
are likely to reach consumers soon:
</P>
<P>
   _Direct-mail videos and CD-ROMs. This idea started with
political candidates in 1992 and is spreading quickly. Some Phoenix
area consumers have gotten videos in the mail from A.J.'s Fine
Foods; Whole Foods, a new supermarket in Tempe; and Coulter
Cadillac. Expect it to grow dramatically, with Jiffy Lube, LA
Fitness and Nationwide Insurance among the companies that have
signed up lately to send videos to potential customers, said Robert
Brucato, an account manager in the Phoenix office of Vaughan
Communications, a Minneapolis company that is one of the
originators of the approach.
</P>
<P>
   _Movie advertisements on ATMs. Quick sound and video clips play
while you wait for your money. This has been test-marketed in San
Diego since November and may spread nationally.
</P>
<P>
   _There are ads for the Arizona Lottery on the handles of the gas
nozzles at Circle K convenience stores. . Some Arco and SuperPumper
stations have taken the concept one step further, fitting gas-pump
islands with video screens that run a stream of advertisements to
capture the attention of bored tank-fillers.
</P>
<P>
   _Microsoft was paying $200 to university professors who used its
programming tools in a scholarly presentation, or merely mentioned
the software. That offer has been pulled off the company's Web
site, but company officials hint that it might return.
</P>
<P>
   _Sabre Group Holdings Inc., owner of the nation's largest
travel-agent reservation network, said earlier this month that it
is considering selling individual travel itineraries to hotels,
car-rental agencies and other business partners. Consumers' travel
plans are ``a potential gold mine,'' according to the company. This
plan, however, might run aground because of privacy concerns.
</P>
<P>
   What a refreshing change that would be. There is very little
that is considered off-limits for advertising. Consider the growing
number of bars and restaurants putting advertisements on the inside
of the door to restroom stalls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always trying to figure out the sacred places where no
advertisers have gone before, and we all rush there,'' said Will
Rodgers, a partner in SHR Perceptual Management in Scottsdale.
``They end up being further ways to pollute our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   The public has become so inured to it that the very notion of
what constitutes advertising is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ABC and ESPN are being congratulated for their
``commercial-free'' broadcasts of World Cup soccer games. Instead
of interrupting play, the announcers said, ``Thanks to Budweiser
(or Canon or the U.S. Army, et al) for sponsoring this portion of
the game commercial-free.'' Then that sponsor's logo was on the
screen for five minutes or so, until the next sponsor took over.
</P>
<P>
   By whose definition is that ``commercial-free''?
</P>
<P>
   Billboards are banned along urban freeways, but advertisers have
figured out a way around that. A year ago, the Arizona Department
of Transportation announced that it would allow commercial
enterprises to adopt sections of the highway and pay for their
cleanup. Now the signs, which used to have the names of an Elks
Club or a college fraternity, carry the logos of Fox 10, or KZZP
radio, or Popular Outdoor stores.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, in sports, it's way out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   You may have thought sports had reached the depths of crass
commercialism seven years ago when a college football bowl game was
named after a Weed Eater.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, every timeout, every listing of stats has a sponsor.
Nearly every stadium also has a corporate name, and the sale of the
naming rights are automatically figured as a source of revenue when
the stadium is being financed. This seems to be an American
phenomenon. Note that the new soccer stadium outside Paris is the
Stade de France, not the Evian Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   Watch a baseball game, and just so you won't concentrate too
much on the batter, a rolling sign behind him is advising you where
to get a home loan or what sports drink to buy.
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there is Diamondbacks' Bank One Ballpark,
the stadium with the biggest advertising package of any sports
stadium in history, a $430 million agreement with 60 companies.
</P>
<P>
   One baseball fan was so outraged that he couldn't find an
American flag for all of the billboards at BOB that he wrote a
letter to ``The
</P>
<P>
   Arizona Republic'' to complain about it. You know, the newspaper
that has the most prominent sign of all at the ballpark.
</P>
<P>
   People used to go to the movies for an escape from real life. No
more. It was maybe 10 years ago that advertisements started running
in movie theaters before the feature film, but long before that,
ads were running as part of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   In 1954, the astronauts in the British sci-fi flick ``Fire
Maidens fromOuter Space'' called uncanny amounts of camera time to
their Camel cigarettes and Longines watches.
</P>
<P>
   This sales method really seemed to hit its stride with the
Superman movies of the late '70s and '80s. Villains were constantly
being hurtled into every sort of billboard. It was in ``Superman''
(1978), the original, that we learned that back in Smallville,
Clark Kent's breakfast of champions was . . . Cheerios.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, with each new James Bond movie, you can expect ad
campaigns with star Pierce Brosnan not only hawking the film but
all the products he uses in it.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger. Better. Ubiquitous.
</P>
<P>
   They have been the watchwords of the advertising world. But
there are many more examples of creeping advertising that are more
cunning.
</P>
<P>
   Now, not only do you get spam, or ``junk'' e-mail, you get spam
pages. Call the number back and you get a recorded message
describing how to earn $1,000 a week by selling from your home, or
some other such pitch. There are ads on golf courses that show
golfers the shape and length of the hole, then advise them where to
drink after the game.
</P>
<P>
   Just about every television station or network has its logo in
the lower right-hand corner of the screen at all times. Except, of
course, when there are real ads running. On a recent afternoon, the
Channel 3 (KTVK) logo was superimposed over the Superstation logo
on ``Inside Edition,'' which, showing that it is learning, has
moved its logo to the lower left-hand corner.
</P>
<P>
   Supermarkets know everything about you. Research shows that soup
sales drop 6 percent if the cans are arranged alphabetically on the
shelves. Toothbrush sales increase 8 percent if they are at eye
level. Background music with 60 beats per minute increases sales by
38.2 percent over music with 108 beats per minute. It's all a
science, and now some enterprising marketer has found that grocery
shoppers also look at the floor a lot. So now that's where ads are
appearing _ beneath our feet.
</P>
<P>
   Fruit advertising used to be no more complex than a sticker on a
bunch of bananas that told you where they were grown and who grew
them. Pick up an apple now and a sticker tells you that ``Liar,
Liar'' is available on video.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of us have become walking billboards. Not only do we seek
out and pay a premium for clothing designed by Tommy Hilfiger or
Guess?, we are willing to wear shirts that advertise the maker.
</P>
<P>
   It is a clever form of imagemaking.
</P>
<P>
   For clothing manufacturers, creating an attitude is as important
as designing a fashion. People are looking to create a personality
for themselves by the clothes they wear. Wearing clothing with the
name printed on it helps create that image, Riester said.
</P>
<P>
   According to several ad executives, this sort of imagemaking is
where the industry is headed.
</P>
<P>
   Forrest Richardson, partner in a small Phoenix advertising
agency, Richardson Or Richardson, said, ``I think the way to cut
through the clutter is to make ads that don't look like ads.
Consumers no longer buy products, they buy brands. You need to
create a culture for yours.''
</P>
<P>
   For example, Nike isn't just a maker of athletic shoes. It is a
major player in youth sports and event promotion. The swoosh logo
gives the buyer an association with famous athletes, all of them
carefully selected. And it is now a retailing concept: Niketown,
the huge, multilevel stores with video walls and loud music that
are slowly spreading around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an environment, an association,'' Richardson said. ``That
is advertising in the year 2000. That is how you sell Nike shoes
today.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an approach that is similar to the way Dodge saved its
truck business, Rodgers said. Ford may run ads saying its vehicles
are ``built Ford tough,'' but Dodge, by attaching a grille that
looks as if it came from a Mack truck, ``redefined what tough looks
like.'' Now Dodge, a distant third before the redesign, sells
almost as many trucks as Ford, the industry leader.
</P>
<P>
   Simple visual images that are instantly associated with a
product will become more important, Rodgers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the world gets more complicated, we tend to want to
simplify,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Riester sees advertising heading in a completely different
direction. The competition just to get products into a store is so
intense, he said, that he sees more marketing being directed at
buyers, store owners and the other people making decisions on
product mix.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hot buttons that would motivate a store are much different
than those that will motivate the consumer,'' Riester said. ``I
think that's the direction the smart companies will go.''
</P>
<P>
   So does that mean we will never again be subjected to Louie, the
Budweiser iguana?
</P>
<P>
   Not likely.
</P>
<P>
   Like everything else in advertising, this has been researched.
</P>
<P>
   Don Godfrey, a professor of journalism at Arizona State
University who has studied advertising extensively, said studies
have consistently found that ``the more annoying the ad, the more
we remember it.'' &QL;

MONTINI-COLUMN (Phoenix) -When I see the TV news coverage today
showing the flag-draped caskets of Detective John M. Gibson and
Officer Jacob J. Chestnut of the Capitol Police, killed in a
shoot-out last Friday, I'll be thinking of Phoenix Officer Robert
Fike. I'll be thinking of Officer Leonard Kolodziej and DPS officer
Bob Martin, and Maricopa County sheriff's Deputy Vernon Marconnet,
and DPS officer Ed Rebel, and Phoenix Officer Kenneth Collings, and
Corrections officer Brent Lumley. All of them died in the line of
duty. None of them got what Chestnut and Gibson are getting. By
E.J.MONTINI. Story will move in the ``A'' and ``K'' categories.

FALL TV SCHEDULES CERTAINLY DO LOOK SAFE _ AND SORRY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Reporters covering the annual fall season preview
in Pasadena returned to their hotel rooms to find an unwanted
intruder: a 4-foot inflatable punching bag of Hong Kong action star
Sammo Hung. CBS had planted the wiggly, wobbly air bag to promote
``Martial Law,'' its campy drama featuring the pleasingly plump
Hung, who established his reputation as a skilled physical
performer in Kung Fu comedies like ``Enter the Fat Dragon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Martial Law,'' about a Hong Kong cop who joins the Los Angeles
police force, is CBS' attempt to squelch its image as the network
for the gray-haired, a PBS with sitcoms. By offering a series in
which kicking and fighting is emphasized over plot and
characterization, (uh, isn't that ``Walker, Texas Ranger''?) CBS
expects to lure those disloyal young males who disappeared when its
NFL football telecasts did.
</P>
<P>
   With pigskin returning this season, CBS expects its male
audience to come back. For insurance, it has lined up a
testosterone-laden fall season. Seven of nine series screened here
featured male leads; the others are ``Maggie Winters,'' with
``Murphy Brown's'' Faith Ford as a woman forced to return to her
tiny hometown, and ``To Have &AMP; To Hold,'' a romantic drama zeroing
in on the union of a hard-nosed detective (Jason Beghe) and his
longtime love, a feminist lawyer (Moira Kelly).
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get younger,'' admitted Leslie Moonves, CBS'
president and chief executive officer, during the 19-day publicity
blitz called the ``press tour,'' which ended Sunday with UPN and
its almost laughable version of must-see TV. ``This effort is
partially based on economics and partly to provide a broad range of
programming for our viewers. We want to have something for everyone
on CBS.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the new mantra for NBC, CBS and ABC _ to be ``broad,''
to be something to everyone, to, basically, color inside the lines
and drive the posted speed limit. In other words, to be safe. Never
before has television entered a season with such trepidation and
self-doubt, trying to create TV programs people want to watch while
keeping a strict account of the bottom line.
</P>
<P>
   As channel choices multiply, as the audience continues to drift
from the traditional networks to cable, satellite and the Internet,
producers and network executives are less willing to take risks,
even as audience erosion continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't gamble when you're a really big network,'' says
Teller, half of the comedy-magician duo Penn and Teller, whose new
series of variety specials will air on cable's FX this fall.
``They've got this idea: You must go after 21-year-olds who drink
this brand of beer. And if you have three minutes that might not be
exactly what they're looking for, then everybody's going to run
away. And I just believe that human beings are more complex than
that. I believe you learn a lot from demographics and focus groups.
But I also believe that, you know, 20-year-old frat boys also want
to see stuff that's good once in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good'' is relative in the new TV landscape. For every
``Becker,'' CBS' midseason hope, a well-conceived Ted Danson sitcom
about a cantankerous doctor, there are five series like ``Mercy
Point,'' a painful-to-watch UPN drama that's a cross between ``ER''
and ``Close Encounters of the Third Kind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now there's a tremendous drain on the creative community
_ it's as simple as that,'' says Amy Lippman, co-creator and
co-executive producer of ``Party of Five.'' ``It's a situation
where there are more shows than performers with national followings
or possessing a persona which translates well to TV or even
writers, who are being hired and promoted before they are ready.
They merely write in packs, feeding off other shows.''
</P>
<P>
   MORE
</P>
<P>
   Thus, sameness. ``They all tend to be about dating and more
dating, and specifically very beautiful 20-year-olds dating,'' is
the way Diane English, ``Murphy Brown'' creator and producer whose
new series is ``Living in Captivity'' on Fox, puts it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And it's probably true that there are just a handful of people
who can execute these things well at any given time on the planet,
and so when you try to do 65 of these things a season, you're just
not going to get a level of quality that you would get 20 years ago
from a singular talent like Norman Lear.''
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, 36 new series are scheduled to begin this season,
beginning as early as the second week of August and as late as
mid-October. With 21 comedies, the yuks rule, though that number is
smaller than in years past. (Last season, NBC had 18 comedies; this
season, just 14).
</P>
<P>
   Comedy pilots screened here worth mentioning are NBC's ``Will &AMP;
Grace''; Fox's ``That '70s Show''; and ABC's ``Two of a Kind,''
``The Hughleys'' and particularly ``Sports Night,'' a high-grade
dramatization of ESPN's popular ``Sports Center.'' (Nathan Lane's
sitcom, ``Encore!Encore!,'' wasn't screened.)
</P>
<P>
   On the drama side, The WB's ``Hyperion Bay'' and ``Felicity''
are worth recommending. The romantic in me wanted to see more of
``To Have &AMP; To Hold'' before dismissing it to the cancellation
heap. NBC's family drama ``Trinity,'' from ``ER's'' John Wells,
received far more notice for its focus on Irish Americans (the
``ethnic'' trend for the season) than for its content.
</P>
<P>
   But there's not one ``Ally McBeal'' among the bunch, not one
series that clears your senses from the first sniff.
</P>
<P>
   After being battered for ``Nothing Sacred'' and ``Cracker,''
last season's most engaging one-two punch, ABC wanted to ``go
lighter, have more fun,'' and the result is ``Cupid,'' about a man
convinced he's the Love God; ``Vengeance Unlimited,'' about a
creepy vigilante; and ``Fantasy Island,'' which has taken on a
darker face lift with Malcolm McDowell as Mr. Roarke. He and the
other island workers aren't there for fun _ they appear to be
trapped, paying off some kind of nefarious dues.
</P>
<P>
   By moving ``King of the Hill'' to Tuesdays, Fox broke up the
great one-two punch it had on Sundays with ``The Simpsons.'' In
terms of gaining viewers on other nights, it's not a bad move.
``King'' will face two weary giants in ``Home Improvement'' on ABC
and ``Mad About You'' on NBC. Both are likely in their final
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting back watching the bigger boys duke it out is The WB,
which opened its session with a video montage of its young, hot
stars, many of whom are popping up in feature films. With the new
``Felicity,'' another series starring young pretty people, joining
``Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ``Dawson's Creek,'' The WB is
creating a trend in which networks are about as narrow as cable
channels.
</P>
<P>
   ``To some degree (the networks) are starting to become
self-defined,'' said Garth Ancier, The WB's president of
entertainment. ``Fox is still a younger network than NBC or ABC.
You don't need a chart to know that it's your parents watching CBS.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's exciting to us is that you can build a real business on
12- to 34-year-olds. That's the hot target. It says you don't do
your shows with Ted Danson. You do them with Joshua Jackson. Or
Sarah Michelle Gellar. That's the future of television as we see
it.''

 CLINTON MULLS MARKET-ORIENTED APPROACH TO SOCIAL SECURITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ President Clinton said Monday that he was
seriously considering relying on the financial markets to help
solve Social Security's long-term problems, but said he had not
made up his mind about any of the details.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a forum and town hall meeting here on Social
Security, Clinton discussed the pros and cons of establishing
individual investment accounts within the retirement system or
having the government itself invest a chunk of Social Security's
reserves in stocks and bonds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I honestly don't know what I would do today,'' Clinton said
when asked which option he would choose if forced to make a
decision.
</P>
<P>
   But he all but endorsed the general notion of seeking higher
investment returns on Wall Street to reduce the need for benefit
cuts, tax increases or other changes to ensure that Social Security
will be able to pay promised retirement benefits in coming decades
to the baby boom generation. Without any changes, Social Security
will run short of money starting in 2032.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's any way we can get a higher rate of return in a
market economy, while minimizing the risk, whether it's in either
one of these approaches, we ought to go for it, because the other
alternatives were much less pleasant already,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The president has not made any final decisions, his aides said,
and some of his advisers still argue that Social Security should
not invest at all in stocks and corporate bonds. Currently Social
Security's reserves are invested in safe but relatively
low-yielding government bonds.
</P>
<P>
   But White House officials said investing in the markets will
more than likely be a component of whatever approach Clinton
ultimately supports.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president was very much making clear that he is seriously
considering some form of equity investment as part of Social
Security reform,'' said White House economic policy adviser Gene
Sperling. ``But he is holding out the caveat that the public and
Congress and the administration are going to have to be willing to
deal with the potential downsides of the risk.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Nearly all proposals for shoring up Social Security rely to some
degree on reaping the presumed gains available on Wall Street. But
there is a vast gulf between one camp _ led by Republicans but
including a number of prominent Democrats _ that wants to allow
individuals to invest a portion of their Social Security payroll
taxes, and another camp led by liberal Democrats in the House that
is pushing for the government to invest the retirement system's
reserves.
</P>
<P>
   The differing approaches were vigorously debated Monday by
politicians of both parties and a panel of experts assembled here
for the third in a series of Social Security forums organized this
year by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Diamond, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said private investments in the market as part of
Social Security would be risky for individuals, and that a chunk of
any gains would be eaten up by the high costs of administering
millions of accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Boskin, an economist at Stanford University, said there
was a ``very strong moral case'' in favor of granting Americans the
chance to own stocks and build wealth in their own name, and that
many of the criticisms of private accounts amounted to ``scare
mongering.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton won a measure of support Monday from Sen. Pete Domenici,
R-N.M., who was among those on the stage with the president. Like
Clinton, Domenici is battling plans by House Republicans to use
projected federal budget surpluses to finance a big tax cut as well
as to deal with Social Security's problems.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called in January for any surpluses to be placed off
limits until the country settles on a plan for Social Security.
Domenici reiterated his support for that approach Monday, saying
Clinton had settled on a ``fantastic fiscal policy.''

FALSE ALARMS RING UP BIG BILLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HANNAH MILLER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Thousands of Phoenix area homeowners and business
people have installed alarm systems to ward off burglars.
</P>
<P>
   But it seems they have more to fear from Christmas decorations,
billowing drapes and feisty pets.
</P>
<P>
   That's because 65 percent of alarm calls to police in Phoenix
alone are false, caused by an endless variety of human errors and
costing police $4.9 million last year.
</P>
<P>
   In Phoenix, alarms are one of the top three calls police
receive, along with domestic violence and suspicious persons.
</P>
<P>
   It's the price of fear _ escalating in the past five years as
the number of alarm systems in homes has doubled, as prices drop
and developers install systems as standard features.
</P>
<P>
   And some people must pay the ultimate price: False Alarm School.
</P>
<P>
   ``Micky set my alarm off,'' admitted Bob Stott, sitting at a
school-style desk last week in a small room at the Mesa Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's my ferret.''
</P>
<P>
   The schools, usually held twice a month in several Phoenix area
cities, are two-hour sessions where the electronically challenged
can learn the secrets of their security systems. Most students are
there voluntarily, though Tempe requires its top 10 violators every
month to attend.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 students have gone through Mesa's class, and
Phoenix boasts a 90 percent success rate _ no more false alarms _
for its students. Now Glendale and Chandler are considering
starting schools of their own.
</P>
<P>
   New homeowner Donna Foster said she enrolled just to prevent
having to pay Mesa's fine, which is $50 per false alarm after the
first four free ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to say it, but I set my motion detector off the first
day I had it,'' Foster said. ``I think it was the paper drapes . .
.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of the cause, police are left to deal with the result
_ 282 false alarms a day last year in Phoenix alone. An estimated
70 percent are due to human error _ which is combatable, although
alarm operating instructions are often as well understood as those
for a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   The problem has become so bad that most cities have hired
administrators just to deal with the devices, which now monitor 1
in 6 American homes. Cities also have introduced increasingly
stiffer fines for false alarms to cover costs.
</P>
<P>
   Perimeter monitors, fixed-glass alarms, passive infrared, panic
buttons _ homeowners feel safer, and business owners swear by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who doesn't have one in this area,'' said Claire
Schere, a Scottsdale retiree who lives alone _ and well-guarded _
``is just crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   But the statistics from Phoenix don't conclusively show that
alarms deter break-ins. And experts say that the largest proportion
of burglary happens to those who can't afford alarms anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Valley police take alarms seriously, recommending them to
homeowners and giving calls the highest priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do prevent burglary,'' said Detective Mike McCullough of
the Phoenix Police Department, ``but in an intangible way.''
</P>
<P>
   Mesa police Sgt. Bryan Soller said, ``We always treat alarms as
the real thing. It's not aggravating, but it is a burden.
Especially if we're getting hammered in the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Not every city is as lucky. In many, the false-alarm rate is as
high as 98 percent. Las Vegas doesn't even dispatch an officer
anymore, unless on-scene security guards or owners call it in
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix area homeowners can relax: Police will respond, no
matter what. One unlucky Mesa police officer drove out to a house
four times one night before he realized a balloon was setting off
the home's motion detector.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's definitely worth having an alarm in your home,'' said
Susan Brenton of the Arizona Burglary and Fire Alarm Association.
``Just make sure that you are familiar with it.''
</P>
<P>
   And as Brenton herself knows, no one is safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``My house was broken into two weeks ago,'' Brenton said.
``Because my alarm went off, all they got was an old VCR. And
that's when I was at the National Alarm Association conference.'' &QL;

<P>
   BEIJING _ China's locomotive-like economic growth and its
brittle public face have helped foment a perception overseas that
it poses a growing military threat to its neighbors. In the next
century, some experts have predicted, China could even clash
militarily with the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Yet by today's measurements, sketched out vaguely in a report
issued here Monday, China's military forces are still rudimentary
by international standards. China's military budget was officially
less than $10 billion in 1998, not 4 percent of the U.S. budget and
less than half of South Korea's.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no mention of the estimated 15,000 businesses
controlled by the army or how much they earn.
</P>
<P>
   The report, ``China's National Defense,'' is a rare public
description of the scope of operations by the People's Liberation
Army. The study was apparently written for an international
audience, laden as it is with assurances that China is a
peace-loving nation.
</P>
<P>
   Although the report reveals no previously unknown vital
information about the military forces, Western military analysts
said it was a milestone for a military whose most basic operations
are ordinarily considered secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese don't give very much away here,'' said Tai Ming
Cheung, an expert on the Chinese military who works for the Hong
Kong office of Kroll Associates. ``The real issue is that it's a
symbolic breakthrough just to release this kind of report.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from other countries, especially the United
States, to be more open about its basic operations, Beijing has
used the report to outline the army's basic aims, duties and
operations. Yet much of the study is simply bland pronouncements
about the commitment to peace and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Facts show that China is a responsible big country and a firm
force safeguarding world peace and stability,'' is a typical
sentence.
</P>
<P>
   The report reiterates Beijing's long-held position on Taiwan,
that reunification is favored through peaceful means, but that
resorting to force is always an option.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most relevant section is on expenditures, even
though it relies only on official statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing its military spending into three categories, the report
says that $3.5 billion was spent last year on personnel costs, $3.2
billion on ``maintenance of activities'' and $3.1 billion on
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Overall the report insists that the national military policy is
defensive in nature and is geared toward resisting aggression. It
extols the country's ``peace-loving tradition'' and says China has
resorted to military force only after an enemy had struck first _
though border disputes with India in 1962 and Vietnam in 1979 might
suggest otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese people are willing, together with the people of
the other countries in the world,'' the study says, ``to make
unremitting efforts for the lofty cause of promoting world peace
and development.''

LAWMAKERS SHOW RENEWED INTEREST IN VISITORS CENTER IN WAKE OF
SHOOTINGS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prompted by the deadly shootings of two Capitol
guards, lawmakers have resurrected the idea of constructing an
underground visitors center where tourists could be screened before
entering the main building.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss, said Monday that he
was ready to move on the visitors center, which he estimated could
cost as much as $125 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we should look at even doing it this year,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lott and others said the visitors center would not only enhance
security but provide more comfortable accommodations and
educational facilities for the millions of people who visit the
Capitol each year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always troubles me when I come to work in the Capitol and I
see our constituents lined up in the heat, the rain, the snow and
with nowhere really to go to find out what they are fixing to see,
to get information on this great building,'' said Lott.
</P>
<P>
   Lott said he hoped private interests would fund most of the
project. About $23 million has been raised for the project through
the sale of a commemorative coin that was issued on the 200th
anniversary of the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for a visitors center was proposed in 1983 in response
to a bomb that exploded that year in the Senate area. The initial
plans were completed in 1991. At the time, a number of lawmakers,
including then House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., objected
to the cost and scope of the center.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later Congress appropriated $2.5 million to translate
the concept into a formal design. In 1995 the architect of the
Capitol presented the refined plan to Congress, with a $95 million
price tag.
</P>
<P>
   A 1995 draft plan submitted to Congress called for all tourists
to go through a central screening area in the visitors center,
which would be constructed underground on the east grounds of the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   After they moved through the security area, the tourists would
be allowed to proceed by escalator, stairs or elevator into the
Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Currently tourists enter through a number of doors at the
Capitol, where they go through metal detectors.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that the security area would be placed ``at a
secure distance from the Capitol itself.'' It would include metal
detectors, facilities for interrogation and a temporary storage
area for impounded property.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed three-level visitors center would also include a
cafeteria, rest rooms, an exhibition hall and auditoriums where
tourists could watch a 15-minute informational video.
</P>
<P>
   While lawmakers are expressing renewed interest in the visitors
center, a spokesman for a conservative taxpayer's groups said the
project would be an expensive and ineffective solution to violence
in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't any proof that an underground visitors center
would stop a deranged mad man with a gun,'' said Pete Sepp, a
spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union. ``Unfortunately
Congress can take a tragedy and head in the wrong direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Sepp said that if lawmakers are worried about security, they
should consider beefing up police presence or building just an
underground checkpoint rather than an elaborate visitors center. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   _BR5-49. Great clothes, great songs, a great twangy
neo-hillbilly sound and a dandy sense of humor all make this
Nashville band one of the genre's emerging superstar outfits.
</P>
<P>
   _Junior Brown. Beyond the oddly shaped guit-steel and the
hilarious slice-of-night-life lyrics (as in ``My Wife Thinks You're
Dead'') there is an amazing amount of real talent and passion, as
both an instrumentalist and a keeper of the Ray Price/Ernest Tubb
flame.
</P>
<P>
   _Steve Earle. One part troubador, one part stone hard rocker,
Earle has long been one of Nashville's best songwriters. And in
recent years, having put drugs behind him, he's recorded two
excellent CDs, ``Train a Comin' '' and ``I Feel Alright.''
</P>
<P>
   _Joe Ely. With his ability to blend honky-tonk, roadhouse rock
and blues, Ely was alt-country a good 20 years before people began
throwing the term around. He still delivers dynamite shows and
terrific CDs, including the recent ``Twistin' in the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   _Robert Earl Keen. Another Texan, another great writer. Keen's
mix of danceable country and folk first made him hugely popular on
Texas college campuses, but recently he's gone beyond cult fave.
</P>
<P>
   _The Mavericks. America's best band? Quite possibly. With their
mix of trad country, Latin, rock and lounge, the Miami-based band
(led by the gorgeous, Roy Orbisonish vocals of Raul Malo) has cut a
series of wonderfully eclectic records, including this year's
marvelous ``Trampoline.''
</P>
<P>
   _Old 97's. The Dallas-based 97's' raw-boned country-rock sound
has a real chance of being embraced by a wide rock audience _ and
certainly deserves to be. Catch 'em whenever you can, and look for
a new CD in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _Gillian Welch. She grew up in Los Angeles, but her music sounds
straight out of the hills of West Virginia, circa 1933. Welch's
debut, ``Revival,'' was one of the best CDs of 1996, and ``Hell
Among the Yearlings'' (which comes out in August) is just as good.
</P>
<P>
   _Whiskeytown. One part mournful country and one part Tom
Petty-meets-the-Replacements rock, the music Ryan Adams and his
posse makes is all frayed edges and regret, and often as memorable
as that of classic country artists. The band will open for John
Fogerty at Starplex in August.
</P>
<P>
   _Wilco. Like Son Volt, this band was formed out of the ashes of
the highly influential Uncle Tupelo. Wilco is the better band: Jeff
Tweedy and company make finely honed music that could almost be
called art-country _ and sometimes rocks plenty hard. ``Being
There,'' from 1996, is the place to go _ and the band recently
teamed up with English folkie Billy Bragg for ``Mermaid Avenue,'' a
collection of previously unrecorded Woody Guthrie songs.
</P>
<P>
   _Lucinda Williams. The recent ``Car Wheels on a Gravel Road'' is
getting a ton of attention, but the Louisiana-born
singer/songwriter has never put out a bad (or even mediocre) CD.
Rootsy, restless, bluesy, tough and dark, her sound and deft,
less-is-more lyrics are among the best in country _ alt or
otherwise.

STUDY FINDS WELFARE RECIPIENTS BENEFIT FROM PART-TIME JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DORIS SUE WONG  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Welfare recipients in Massachusetts are better off
financially if they work even part-time, minimum-wage jobs,
according to a study released Monday by a nonpartisan research
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The study by the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C., said the
typical welfare family consisting of a single mother with two
children receives $825 a month in cash benefits and food stamps in
Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But with the state now making transitional child care subsidies
and health coverage available, by just working 20 hours a week at
$5.15 an hour, the mother can increase the family's monthly income
47 percent to $1,209.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite jobs that are generally low-wage, part-time, and with
few benefits, work does pay for welfare recipients making the
transition from public assistance into the working world,'' Greg
Acs, co-author of the study, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts is among 12 states the nonpartisan research
organization has chosen to examine as part of its multi-year study
on the impact of the shifting of responsibility for social programs
from the federal government to states.
</P>
<P>
   As with the 11 other states, however, the study found that in
Massachusetts the economic benefits of working tend to be less
dramatic when a mother works more hours and at a higher salary,
largely because she can no longer take advantage of the federal
earned income tax credit, the report found.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a mother who moves into a fulltime, minimum wage
job from a part-time one would see her income jump another 20
percent to $1448 a month. But, if her hourly wage goes up to $9 an
hour, she will only see a five percent boost to $1522.
</P>
<P>
   Deborah Harris, a lawyer who specializes in welfare issues for
the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute, an advocacy group, had not
seen the report, but observed: ``The state has done a lot to help
work pay. But the welfare time limits closes the door to families
trying to work their way off welfare.''
</P>
<P>
   State welfare officials, meanwhile, felt vindicated by the
study.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been saying that for years, that people are much better
off working,'' said Dick Powers, spokesman for the Department of
Transitional Assistance.

IF IT'S THE RIGHT VERDICT, THE TIME DOESN'T MATTER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The jury got it right. Again.
</P>
<P>
   Jurors in New Braunfels, Texas, found ex-Air Force Academy Cadet
David Graham guilty of capital murder, the same verdict delivered
by Fort Worth jurors who were asked to decide the fate of Graham's
former fiance, Diane Zamora.
</P>
<P>
   Zamora's jury convicted her of capital murder in February, and
she is serving a sentence of life in prison. Judge Don Leonard
sentenced Graham to life shortly after the guilty verdict was
announced on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Capital murder carries an automatic life sentence when
prosecutors do not seek the death penalty, and they did not seek it
in the case of either Zamora or Graham.
</P>
<P>
   Graham and Zamora were found guilty of murdering 16-year-old
Adrianne Jones in December 1995. They killed Jones wantonly,
brutally and without anything resembling justification. It was a
sociopathic act committed by two teen-agers who harbored no respect
for human life or the fundamental dictates of existence in a
civilized society.
</P>
<P>
   According to prosecutors, Zamora believed that Graham had a
sexual encounter with Jones and demanded that Graham prove his love
by killing Jones. Prosecutor Mike Parrish said during Graham's
trial that the affair never happened, which made the killing all
the more heinous and inexplicable.
</P>
<P>
   It's unfathomable: Graham and Zamora committed coldblooded
murder because Zamora ``imagined'' that Graham had cheated on her?
</P>
<P>
   Life in prison hardly seems sufficient punishment for
individuals who could be so blatantly indifferent to the life of an
innocent young woman.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Jones and Scott Jones, Adrianne's brothers, were on
target when they addressed the court after Graham was sentenced and
described him as an animal.
</P>
<P>
   Justin said he couldn't hate an animal, but Scott glared at
Graham and said that he ``ruined so many lives, so many families.
Unlike my brother, I can hate an animal, and I hate David Graham.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Braunfels jury deserves society's congratulations and
gratitude for fulfilling its collective responsibility to see that
justice was done. Defense attorney Dan Cogdell had reminded the
jurors at the end of his closing argument that they held justice in
their hands, and they took him at his word _ although a conviction
for capital murder was surely not what Cogdell had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing matters except the eventual verdict, of course, but some
trial watchers were wondering by midday Friday if the Graham jurors
were up to the task that had been assigned to them. This looked as
much like an open-and-shut situation as a capital murder case can
be; Cogdell didn't even put on a defense, resting his case without
calling a single witness to testify on Graham's behalf.
</P>
<P>
   Cogdell said he didn't need to call witnesses because
prosecutors hadn't proved their case. That statement seemed even
more preposterous than his claim that Graham had nothing to do with
the killing _ that he was nowhere near the murder scene when his
pistol was used to fire two bullets into Jones' head.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors offered up, among other evidence, the murder weapon;
a confession that Graham personally composed on a word processor;
and witnesses who testified that Zamora had told them that she and
Graham committed the crime together.
</P>
<P>
   How in the world could jurors deliberate for nearly 10 hours
before realizing that the evidence added up to a guilty verdict?
They should have convicted Graham in 10 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, why quibble about methods when the results are
impeccable? These jurors may have been slow, but they were
effective.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, jurors deliberated for nearly seven hours in the Zamora
trial, and they had darn near a suitcase full of confessions to go
on _ not to mention Zamora's testimony, which struck some courtroom
observers as far more laughable than plausible.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, it doesn't matter in the least how long it takes a
jury to arrive at its decision _ as long as the decision is the
right one.
</P>
<P>
   And the decision in the Graham case was definitely the right
one.

   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Optimistically, Dorothy Edouart recites her
mantra. ``I haven't won yet, but I've got the letters saying I won,
and I'll be getting my winnings very soon,'' she says outside the
airy dining room of the retirement center where she lives. ``All I
have to do is send in my entries and my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edouart, an 88-year-old widow, has played magazine
sweepstakes and similar promotions passionately for years. In a
54-day period in 1995, she wrote 148 checks to 56 contests,
according to her check register. Her family estimates that in five
years she spent $60,000 on magazines she never read and merchandise
she never used, without winning a dime.
</P>
<P>
   To continue playing, Mrs. Edouart moved here from Rhode Island
to escape her children's objections. Now, she is suing her son for
the right to sell the family's estate, saying she needs more money
for sweepstakes. The family is seeking to have her declared
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, people are fooled every day into believing
they have won sweepstakes and other contests, misled by
attention-grabbing graphics and official-sounding language.
</P>
<P>
   Most people understand that these pitches are come-ons to buy
magazines and other products. ``We just throw them away,'' Lucille
Corwin said of the sweepstakes entry forms that fill her mailbox at
Sun City Center, a Florida retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   But from big cities to small villages, the mailboxes that fill
fastest are those that belong to the elderly. And all too often the
people who believe the sophisticated pitches and spend large sums
they cannot afford on hundreds of magazine subscriptions or on
other goods they do not want are elderly, too.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the sweepstakes business by The New York Times
provides a look at the inner workings of an industry that has grown
dramatically, offering bigger and bigger prizes to millions of
households to persuade people to buy everything from magazines to
videos to flower bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   As the stakes and competition have risen, so has the
sophistication and, in some cases, critics argue, deception.
Marketing experts and copywriters at the brand-name sweepstakes
operations, like Reader's Digest and American Family Publishers,
use increasingly sensational language and graphics to make their
sweepstakes stand out.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, authorities say, fraudulent copycats and
telemarketers are using the techniques of legitimate sweepstakes,
and lists of their contestants, to prey on people they know are
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to distinguish the legitimate
sweepstakes from the frauds,'' said Michael T. Kogut, an assistant
attorney general in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But recently even the well-known legitimate sweepstakes have
come under scrutiny because of concern that they promise too much.
Among the elderly who prove vulnerable, some are lonely and seeking
excitement. Others do not understand the rules printed in small
type.
</P>
<P>
   And many take literally what they read when they open envelopes
marked ``Registered Documents Enclosed'' and ``Personal and
Confidential'' and inside find Sports Illustrated announcing that
they have won $833,337, or Publishers Clearing House congratulating
them on ``your selection to be a Guaranteed Cash Prize Winner with
a timely response.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks who are in their 70s, 80s and 90s grew up in an era
where, if something was official or appeared to have something to
do with the government, it must be OK,'' said William E. Arnold,
director of the gerontology program at Arizona State University,
who is studying the effects of sweepstakes on the elderly. ``Even
looking at some of the legitimate mailings, there is enough stuff
in there that makes it sound official that they don't read the fine
print.''

<P>
   ENORMOUS STAKES: SWEEPSTAKES MEAN MORE SUBSCRIPTIONS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate sweepstakes industry has mushroomed from a single
contest at Reader's Digest magazine in 1962 to hundreds of contests
a year. More than 400 million of the most sophisticated packages in
the direct-mail business are sent to households in the United
States each year by the two largest sweepstakes companies, American
Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   For the magazine industry, the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of all new magazine subscriptions are generated
through sweepstakes, industry experts say. They are worth hundreds
of millions of dollars to magazines because publishers can charge
advertisers more as subscriptions increase.
</P>
<P>
   The business is profitable for the sweepstakes operators because
they keep about half of the subscription money they collect and
sell other merchandise through their contests.
</P>
<P>
   The power of sweepstakes is evident in carefully guarded
industry statistics. A sweepstakes mailing for magazine
subscriptions is four to five times more likely to generate an
order than a mailing without a prize or contest, said Larry Stone,
a former senior official at Publishers Clearing House and Reader's
Digest and a rare insider willing to describe how the industry
works.
</P>
<P>
   From the size and color of the type to the texture of the paper
and the number of pages, every element of a sweepstakes package is
designed to persuade readers to play the sweepstakes _ and to order
magazines or other products. Representatives of the sweepstakes
companies say their mailings are designed only to provide people
with the fantasy of winning and comply with laws that require
mailings to make clear that no purchase is necessary and that
entries that include orders have no more chance of winning than
those that do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very long history of making disclosures in our
copy beyond what has been required by law,'' said Michael Brizel,
an executive at Reader's Digest, a unit of The Reader's Digest
Association. ``We think that the people we mail to clearly
understand the difference between buying these high-quality
products and entering the sweepstakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of state officials, who share
regulation of the sweepstakes industry with the federal government,
say some sweepstakes mailings have crossed the line from persuasion
to deception. Trying to make everyone believe he or she is a
winner, these officials argue, flouts the law. After years of
isolated action, state authorities have opened an offensive with
the potential to change the way the sweepstakes industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 32 states and the District of Columbia reached an
agreement with American Family Publishers, which is owned jointly
by a unit of Time Inc. and an investment group associated with the
Pritzker family of Chicago. The company paid $2.25 million to the
states and agreed to stop telling people they were winners, unless
they had actually won, and to emphasize in mailings that no
purchase was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, South Carolina and West
Virginia went further and sued American Family Publishers, accusing
it of deceptive practices and seeking restitution for customers.
Also named as defendants were Dick Clark and Ed McMahon, who
promote the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Those five states also are cooperating as they expand scrutiny
of other companies. Gary L. Betz, special counsel to the Florida
attorney general, said his office is investigating Publishers
Clearing House, the other big sweepstakes company, and scrutinizing
recent mailings by Reader's Digest and Time.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Clearing House, based in Port Washington, N.Y., is a
limited partnership with a majority held by trusts and charities
connected to its founder, the Mertz family.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Publishers also faces 26 class-action civil
suits and 11 suits brought by individuals seeking millions of
dollars in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former circulation executive at Time Inc., Susan
Caughman, became chief executive of American Family Enterprises,
the parent company of American Family Publishers. Her first goal,
she said, was to negotiate the settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to making it as clear as possible that we are
honest and we are proud of what we do as a contest,'' Ms. Caughman
said. ``It should help distance us from the fraudulent operators
who are abusing our good name.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's redesigned mailings are toned down, but they
continue to relegate to small print the odds of winning the $10
million prize _ 150 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those odds are better than the chance of winning the $1
million prize in Reader's Digest's 1998 President's Prize: 600
million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the industry expressed concern that the problems
of American Family Publishers have harmed other companies. Tighter
restrictions are likely to spread throughout the industry. Also,
consumers often have difficulty telling one sweepstakes from
another, so bad publicity for one threatens all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They squeezed the golden goose, and everybody is going to get
hurt,'' said Stone, the former publishing company executive.
``Nobody can tell these companies apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced in June in the Senate would expand the
federal government's role in regulating sweepstakes mailings. The
bill would require key disclaimers to be printed in large type,
restrain other language and allow the Postal Service to destroy
mail that does not comply. A hearing on the bill is scheduled for
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of Americans, I get these things in the mail, and
they are so realistic that consumers are misled into believing they
have won a big prize,'' Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
who wrote the bill, said in an interview.

 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three major happenings, all of a different nature
and beyond White House control, are about to have a dramatic impact
on the final phase of the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   For public excitement this cannot match Powerball mania. Nor is
it Zorro.
</P>
<P>
   But the long-running tale of political thrust and counter-thrust
that is the story of President Clinton's survival in public office
is reaching a turning point. Very soon, nothing will be as we have
known it.
</P>
<P>
   The president's fortunes now turn on the closing actions of
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, the exit from the White House of
some of Clinton's best friends and a constitutional reality that
defines his office.
</P>
<P>
   The most sensational transformation will stem from Starr's rapid
move, for better or worse, into the last aspect of his Monica
Lewinksy probe. Finally he is confronting the principals, and a
report to Congress appears near.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Starr has the bad political judgment to indict the
25-year-old former White House intern for the shocking,
unforgivable crime of catching a president's eye is unclear.
Negotiations to give her and her mother immunity have suddenly been
revived. And nobody knows what Lewinsky may say on the stand.
</P>
<P>
   But by sending Clinton an unprecedented subpoena to testify
before a grand jury, Starr is forcing him into a constitutional
showdown with potentially grave consequences for the separation of
the three co-equal branches of government.
</P>
<P>
   This is a signal that Starr has no other potential witnesses and
is winding up or down, depending upon your point of view, his
unrelenting pursuit of alleged Clinton wrongdoing. After four
years, this will be a relief, no matter what evidence Starr
eventually claims to have accumulated. This distraction has
outlived its welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Individually, both Clinton and Starr will emerge diminished. The
battle between them has become so nasty that neither can win.
Clinton's legacy has been forever tarnished. As for Starr, all he
can do is retreat to Pepperdine University in California.
</P>
<P>
   The second drama involves the loss of confidants rather than the
clash of enemies. The pending departure from the White House of
popular spokesman Mike McCurry, powerful chief of staff Erskine
Bowles and other key advisers may be more significant than it first
appears.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how able their replacements, the new aides are
essentially employment afterthoughts and can never reach a level of
political experience and presidential intimacy equal to that of
their predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   It's lonely at the top and it's about to become lonelier.
</P>
<P>
   The president may come to rely on them, or may not. They may
give better or worse advice. But they are unlikely to develop the
personal relationship to successfully overcome Clinton's weaknesses
with their own wisdom as he enters his least promising presidential
period.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the third saber cutting into Clinton's power. After
this fall's congressional elections, his lame-duck status becomes
acute. And if Democrats do not increase their numbers in Congress,
his isolation could marginalize him.
</P>
<P>
   The knowledge that he can serve only two more years leaves him
without the normal presidential leverage. Voters and other
politicians will look elsewhere, toward Vice President Al Gore,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush or other figures with the future
potential of reward and retribution.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the best that Clinton may be able to hope for is a
world in which he will be ignored and peacefully consigned in due
time to the peripheral role of other retired presidents. The
alternative scenario is Starr's vision of convincing the courts and
the Congress that Clinton deserves to be impeached now before he
can get away.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation meant to explain Starr's excesses has ranged from
his presumed frustration over an inability to prove anything
damning to a presumed fury over sweeping presidential obstruction
of justice, witness-tampering and various other felonious abuses of
power. We dummies not on the favored lists for leaking such gossip
don't know where the truth lies, if anywhere. The leakees may not
know either.
</P>
<P>
   But the tawdry saga now approaches a new era. The president is
likely to speak up at last, in response to Starr's legal end-game.
Then Starr will have to fish or cut bait in response to the
president's political end-game. Good.

<P>
   SEDUCTIVE BAIT: ENTRY MAILINGS BECOME A SCIENCE
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, sweepstakes are the victims of their own success.
The Reader's Digest sweepstakes helped it become the
largest-circulation magazine in the world. Other magazines followed
suit. Next came the so-called stamp sheets assembled by Publishers
Clearing House and American Family Publishers, offering discount
subscriptions to 300 or more magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Clearing House and American Family Publishers will
not release revenue figures. But Dan Capell, editor of Capell's
Circulation Report, said the two operations generate about 30
percent of all new magazine subscriptions each year.
</P>
<P>
   Designing a sweepstakes package is a science. Marketing and
promotions experts develop the central pitch. Copywriters and
graphic artists come up with words and images to convey the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Stone and other insiders said, lawyers haggle over the
details to keep the package within the law. But the goal is always
the same _ to sell products by entertaining and involving the
person receiving the mailing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to involve people through the stamps, seals and
stickers known in the trade as action devices. Over the years, the
industry has discovered that the more gimmicks in a mailing, the
better the response.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope may have an official-looking message. The most
recent mailing from American Family Publishers, for example, has a
bright orange card on the envelope back that says, ``ATTENTION.
UNAWARDED PRIZE DEPOSIT PRE-AUTHORIZATION FORM.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, almost all mailings include several pages with numerous
action devices. The newest American Family Publishers mailing
requires people to detach the pre-authorization form, detach an
entry form that resembles a check and affix a gold seal to the
completed form before mailing the entry.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and other experts said the motive is simple. The more that
people have to do in a mailing, the better chance they think they
have of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings often begin by blaring the news, ``You are a winner.''
Then comes a description of the contest and an urgent request at
the end to send in the response form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basic persuasion communication,'' said Arnold of Arizona
State University. ``You hit them in the beginning with the bold
print, and you close with a statement that you need to send this
and, by the way, if you buy some things it might help. They also
work on reciprocity. You buy something from us, and we'll reward
you.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sayer, executive director of advertising at Publishers
Clearinghouse, compared the gimmicks and language to a department
store's ``sale'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do find that the sweepstakes get them in the store, and
once we get them in, we like to involve them,'' he said. ``But we
take care to write them clearly and believe that there should be no
confusion whatsoever for anyone who reads them carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   A successful sweepstakes generates subscription orders from 10
percent of the recipients, industry experts say. The entries with
orders are called ``the pull.'' When a mailing is sent to 50
million households, a 10 percent pull translates into $50 million
or more in revenue. A much larger group _ about 30 percent _
returns the entry form without ordering.
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes officials would not disclose their results, but Ms.
Caughman of American Family Publishers said a 10 percent pull would
be bad from a mailing to proven customers, and good from a mailing
to people who had not bought before.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations require that all entries have an equal chance of
winning. But subtle distinctions sometimes reinforce the
misconception that you have a better chance if you order something.
</P>
<P>
   A blatant example was used this year by American Family
Publishers. Entries with magazine orders went into an envelope
addressed to contest headquarters in Tampa, Fla. People who were
not ordering anything were instructed to mail their entries to a
post office box in Waycross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the entries wound up in Tampa, but the illusion was that
you had a better chance by mailing it directly to the sweepstakes
headquarters,'' said James Lyons, an investigator with the Florida
Attorney General's office.
</P>
<P>
   The basic accusation by the states against American Family
Publishers is that its entry forms have evolved into sophisticated
shams that violate state laws against deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an American Family Publishers mailing in January
declared to millions of recipients: ``IT'S DOWN TO A 2-PERSON RACE
FOR $11,000,000. YOU AND ONE OTHER PERSON. WERE ISSUED THE WINNING
NUMBER. WHOEVER RETURNS IT FIRST WINS IT ALL!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caughman, the American Family Publishers chief executive,
said the company voluntarily withdrew that mailing in February and
stopped routing entries without orders to Georgia. She said other
practices are under review.
</P>
<P>
   But practices decried by the attorneys general were featured in
recent sweepstakes mailings by Sports Illustrated and Time, both
published by Time Inc., one of the partners in American Family
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   A promotion in March for Sports Illustrated, for example, was
mailed in an official-looking brown envelope with the words
``Registered Documents Enclosed'' on the front. Inside was a manila
folder, stamped in red ``Keep This Document in a Safe Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying letter blared the good news, ``OUR SWEEPSTAKES
RESULTS ARE FINAL: (the recipient's name) HAS WON A CASH PRIZE OF
$833,377.00!'' It went on, ``A BANK CHECK FOR $833,337.00 IS ON ITS
WAY TO (the recipient's address)!'' Finally, it said, ``A BANK
CHECK FOR $833,337.00 IN CASH WILL BE SENT TO YOU VIA CERTIFIED
MAIL IF YOU RESPOND NOW!''
</P>
<P>
   The caveats came in small type. The first, just above the
headline about winning, said, ``If you have and return the Grand
Prize winning entry in time, we will officially announce that.''
The back of the manila folder, in small print under the heading
``Official Rules,'' disclosed that the actual deadline was a year
away, March 31, 1999. And the odds of winning the grand prize
turned out to be 1 in 120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc., said the
solicitation was not misleading. ``We have no interest in deceiving
either existing or potential customers,'' he said. ``We run our
sweepstakes honestly and ethically.''

   TRUE BELIEVERS: FOR SOME, PASTIME BECOMES OBSESSION
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Carson's grandfather committed suicide. Mrs. Carson, who
lives near Seattle, described the events leading to his death on
condition that his name not be used, because some relatives
objected to the publicity. Law-enforcement authorities confirmed
the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his wife went into the nursing home with Alzheimer's, my
grandfather started playing for something to do when he was
alone,'' Mrs. Carson said. ``It just went from something he did to
occupy his time to an obsession. He truly believed that each time
he sent in his form he would be the $10 million winner, as long as
he bought something.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the family discovered the retired building
contractor's garage was filled with pallets of merchandise and
magazines. They sold the goods at a garage sale. Less than a year
later, the garage was full again.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives met many times to discuss the problem. The only answer
seemed to be to go to court to have the grandfather declared
incompetent. The relatives could not bring themselves to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the hardest working person all of his life,'' Mrs.
Carson said. ``He saved and saved. He was never frivolous. And he
was in complete control, except he was just brainwashed by these
sweepstakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 8, Mrs. Carson said, her grandfather was found dead in
his truck from carbon monoxide poisoning. Going through his papers,
the family determined that he had spent more than $100,000 on
sweepstakes and similar contests. His bank account had been closed,
and his utilities were about to be shut off.
</P>
<P>
   Some elderly people have become so convinced they are winners
that they have flown to American Family Publishers headquarters in
Tampa to try to collect their prizes. Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman
for the company, said only a fraction of recipients misunderstand
the mailings and fewer go to Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   A different story was told by former employees of Time Customer
Service, the subsidiary of Time Warner that handles calls from
customers of American Family Publishers in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Tampa last week, Anne E. Curran, the
customer service manager for the sweepstakes account until she
resigned in April, said she had to deal with so many disgruntled
people who thought they had won that she feared for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individuals Curran met with who had traveled to Tampa to
claim prizes they believed they had won in the AFP sweepstakes were
often very angry or very depressed upon learning that they had not
won and had traveled to Tampa for nothing,'' said the suit. ``As a
consequence, Curran began to experience emotional distress and fear
for her personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Without specifying the number, the suit said more people started
traveling to Tampa to collect their prizes in recent months. So
many went that they were given the code name ``visitors'' and Ms.
Curran was instructed to keep cash in a fund ``specifically set up
to silence them,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Customer Service filed its own suit against Ms. Curran,
contending that she misappropriated company electronic mail and
demanded money not to disclose it. The Time suit did not address
Ms. Curran's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Another former employee of Time Customer Service, Kim Venezia,
said that during her three years with the company many callers
believed they had won. ``During the sweeps season, from October to
March, I was handling 200 to 300 calls a day, and over half of them
were people who thought they had won,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just illiterate people. And it's not just the
elderly. I talked to all sorts of people who thought they had
won.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst times, she said, were when a cab would pull up to the
building's employee entrance while she and other workers were
taking a cigarette break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it,'' she said. ``Here comes gramps with a briefcase
or a box with all his sweepstakes entries. Security stopped them.
The two supervisors for mail and telephones would flip a coin to
see who would have to go tell this person they didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Edouart fervently believes that sweepstakes riches are
just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, well-spoken woman, Mrs. Edouart had been living
comfortably with her family in Jamestown, R.I., in a house that she
had bought and put in a trust. The trust required the family to
care for her until her death, at which time the house would go to
her heirs. But several months ago she moved to a retirement center
in Vero Beach on Florida's Atlantic Coast to escape the objections
of her son and other relatives to her sweepstakes playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do it to make a little money,'' Mrs. Edouart said in an
interview recently. ``That's the only reason. I just need to get
enough money to take care of myself. It doesn't hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Edouart's son discovered that she was spending $2,000 a
month on magazines she never read and merchandise she did not need
in response to sweepstakes mailings, said her daughter-in-law,
Susan Zwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 12 hours a day at her desk writing checks and
filling out entry forms _ and this is a woman with arthritis,'' Ms.
Zwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Her family's objections escalated in heated disputes. ``She
would say, `It's my money and I can do with it what I want,''' Ms.
Zwick said. ``We'd say that we were afraid she was being taken
advantage of. And she'd say, `Now you think I'm stupid and old and
being taken advantage of.'''
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Florida, Mrs. Edouart filed suit to remove the
Jamestown house from the trust. Mrs. Edouart said that she needed
more money for the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my winnings I won't be able to collect because I don't
have enough money to send them the $25 fee.''
</P>

to defraud the elderly. (Will run Tuesday for Wednesday papers.)

   SWEEPSTAKES-ELDERLY-I (Vero Beach, Fla.) _ Across the country,
people are fooled every day into believing they have won
sweepstakes and other contests, misled by attention-grabbing
graphics and official-sounding language. Most people understand
that these pitches are come-ons to buy magazines and other

And all too often the people who believe the sophisticated pitches

health officials and even federal authorities, but because of the
closing of state mental hospitals, the treatment of choice for him
was the honor system: counting on him to take the often unpleasant
psychoactive drugs prescribed for his schizophrenia. He lived in
rural areas, where psychiatric monitoring of him was extremely
limited. And he traveled between two states, encouraging at least
one to solve his long-term care by sending him back to the other.

 &HT;    CLINTON AWARDS ARLINGTON CEMETERY BURIAL TO NON-VETERAN POLICE
OFFICER KILLED IN CAPITOL
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;    By CHRISTI HARLAN
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In honor of an officer who fell defending a symbol
of democracy, President Clinton on Monday awarded a hero's burial
to Capitol Police special agent John Gibson, saying the non-veteran
will join other American heroes at Arlington Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's decision came as members of Congress and countless
visitors to the Capitol paid their respects Monday to Gibson and
fellow officer Jacob ``J.J.'' Chestnut, who were gunned down Friday
at their posts in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, an Vietnam-era Air Force veteran, will also be laid to
rest in Arlington Cemetery. Both burials will be later this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system worked, but at a terrible personal cost,'' House
Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., said Monday during a solemn and
sometimes teary tribute in the House. ``We are safe because of
their sacrifice.''
</P>
<P>
   The House set aside its legislative agenda Monday to honor the
work and lives of Gibson and Chestnut, casting votes only on
resolutions recognizing the two men and ensuring that they will be
remembered and that their families will be cared for.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow we must live our lives knowing that this country was
a better place because of the dedication and the courage of these
two men,'' said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, in whose
office the gunman was downed after fatally shooting Gibson, a
member of DeLay's personal security team.
</P>
<P>
   Near the door where the gunman entered the Capitol Friday, a
public memorial continued to grow Monday: a wreath DeLay; two tiny
teddy bears in red sweaters with white hearts; a child's drawing of
a U.S. flag, inscribed ``God Bless America _ Regina.''
</P>
<P>
   The flowers, some in bouquets, some a single stem, continued to
arrive as well, from anonymous well-wishers and from well-known
mourners, among them Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., and Sen. Phil Gramm,
R-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol that was wracked by terror and violence Friday
becomes a shrine Tuesday to the two officers as they lie in state
in the Capitol's Rotunda before and after a memorial service to be
attended by the officers' families, members of Congress and both
Clinton and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, an Air Force veteran of Vietnam veteran, and Gibson
will be buried later this week at Arlington Cemetery.

PANEL OUSTS CAREY FROM TEAMSTERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN WILMSEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighteen months after suspicions surfaced about the 1996
Teamsters election, a federally appointed board Monday expelled
President Ron Carey from the union for an illegal fund-raising
scheme that became the deciding factor in his narrow re-election
over James P. Hoffa.
</P>
<P>
   Carey has repeatedly denied knowing anything about the scheme
that directed $885,000 in union funds to third-party political
groups to benefit his campaign in the final frantic days before the
election.
</P>
<P>
   But in Monday's ruling, the Independent Review Board found Carey
was responsible for the plot. The board also expelled the union's
political director, William Hamilton, and in a scathing 35-page
report said, ``The serious breaches of trust by Hamilton and Carey
require severe sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
   The ruling is a blow to supporters of Carey, who during 30 years
as a Teamsters officer gained a reputation for cleaning up the
notoriously corrupt union. Hoffa supporters, meanwhile, rejoiced
and seized the moment as a political opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today's Independent Review Board decision banning Ron Carey
from the Teamsters for life is a small step toward returning
honest, competent and, above all, democratically-elected leadership
to the Teamsters,'' Hoffa said in a statement shortly after the
ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IRB's decision drives a stake through the heart of the
myth peddled by Carey sympathizers inside and outside the
Teamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffa, who is again running for the presidency in the upcoming
September election, said a ``free and fair'' election should be
held ``immediately.'' The September mail ballot was called for
after the fund-raising scandal emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Evidence of a campaign scheme surfaced just weeks after the
December 1996 election, in which Carey and Hoffa ran brutal
neck-and-neck campaigns. Carey won unexpectedly by a narrow margin,
prompting Hoffa supporters to demand a recount and investigate the
possibility of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   John Murphy, secretary treasurer of Teamsters local 122 in
Boston and a Hoffa supporter, said he discovered some suspicious
documents in Carey's campaign finance disclosures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at those things, it didn't take a rocket scientist to
see there was something rotten in Denmark,'' Murphy said.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery led to federal investigations, including an FBI
probe into allegations that union money was illegally funneled
through groups including Citizen Action and Project Vote to finance
Carey's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Under the rules of federally supervised elections, Teamsters
union officials are barred from accepting campaign contributions
from any employers, whether or not they employ Teamsters, and from
using union money to finance their elections.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation netted a number of Carey supporters, including
consultant Michael Ansara, of Somerville, Mass., who was chief
executive of Share Group, Inc., a telemarketing company. He pleaded
guilty last year to conspiracy charges and agreed to cooperate with
federal investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Carey's former campaign manager and another consultant, Martin
Davis, also pleaded guilty to federal charges stemming from the
scheme, and political director Hamilton was indicted by a federal
grand jury in New York. Carey until Monday had been largely
unmarked by the investigations and had maintained it was the
unsolicited work of staffers and political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the end of a long, arduous march,'' Murphy said of
Monday's decision. ``What this did today is confirm what I have
long believed. It's time now for all Teamsters to put this behind
them. The people who supported Carey I know feel betrayed and
disappointed. In general, I think the whole scandal has been very
demoralizing. All of organized labor has been hurt. It will take a
few years to recover from this.''

 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ Teams are attempting fewer stolen bases against the
Braves this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''I know one thing,'' said catcher Javy Lopez. ''It's not
because they're afraid they're going to be thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is being hard on himself. In one season, he has gone from
one of the easiest catchers to steal on to above the National
League norm. He caught just 28 of 98 attempted steals (28.6
percent) in 1997. Through the first 105 games this season, that
rate has improved to 36.7 percent (22 of 60). The average NL
catcher this season throws out 33.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ''The last few days have been terrible,'' said Lopez, after
teams stole three bases in his last five games. ''But I think I've
been doing a lot better than the year before last. Compared to last
year, I don't see that many people try to steal this year.
Sometimes, we go like five or six games without anybody trying to
steal a base. Most of the time when they do try to steal, the
hitters swings the bat, like a hit and run.''
</P>
<P>
   Stolen base attempts are down slightly in the NL this season,
from one attempt every 8.2 innings in 1997 to one every 10.6
innings this year. This may be partly explained by home run mania
and the state of pitching in an expansion year, prompting managers
to wait on the long ball rather attempting to create runs.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the explanation, Lopez has had a marked improvement,
coming in the same season when he's having his best season at the
plate.
</P>
<P>
   ''I look forward to throwing more people out at second base,''
he said, ''but I've had it in my mind to improve all my numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Perez is carrying a rainbow-colors bruised on his left
buttock, courtesy of bullpen coach Ned Yost, who hit the reserve
catcher during batting practice Sunday. The bruise has caused such
appreciation around the clubhouse that Yost actually autographed
it.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's my first righty,'' said Yost, who in his eight seasons
with the club recalls previously hitting only Dwight Smith and Tony
Tarasco.
</P>
<P>
   Added starter
</P>
<P>
   The Reds firmed up their pitching plans for the series, moving
up Steve Parris to pitch Wednesday's game and giving left-hander
Rick Krivda his first start as a Red on Thursday afternoon. Parris
had been set for Thursday but was moved when after the club demoted
projected starter Scott Winchester on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Krivda was acquired from Cleveland June 16 in exchange for Eddie
Priest and had been used in relief nine times. Thursday will be his
first NL start. He started a total of 34 games for Baltimore the
previous three seasons but was waived by the Orioles during spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   Relief
</P>
<P>
   The Braves bullpen came into Monday's game with a 4.07 ERA, the
seventh highest in the league. They have also worked the fewest
innings (232-1/3) and yielded the fourth lowest batting average
(.239). Atlanta starters, who have the lowest group ERA in the
league (3.02), give up a .245 average.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro news
</P>
<P>
   If the Braves are waiting for a sign that Pedro Borbon is close
to being able assume a left-handed set-up role in Atlanta, those
hopes were not helped by the latest report from Class AAA Richmond.
Borbon, on injury rehab assignment the last several weeks, gave up
three runs in the seventh as Richmond lost to Indianapolis 4-1
Sunday. In six Richmond appearances, Borbon had given up eight hits
and six runs while striking out three in 5-2/3 innings.

LONG-GUN BUYERS FACE BACKGROUND CHECKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES KELLY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Potential buyers of shotguns and rifles, take heed: if
you make your purchase Nov. 30 or later, your background will be
checked by law enforcement agencies.
</P>
<P>
   If you didn't know this was coming, you're far from alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's very low awareness, almost non-existent awareness, at
this time,'' said Dave LaRue, owner of Legendary Guns in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Background checks for handgun sales _ primarily to ensure that
the buyer doesn't have a criminal record _ have been conducted
under the Brady Law since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady Law provided for similar checks for long guns starting
five years after the original legislation passed in 1993. But that
fact hasn't been highly publicized.
</P>
<P>
   The new system will use ``instant checks,'' as opposed to the
potential five-day wait now involved in buying a handgun. But
Arizona already uses instant checks, so shooting-industry people
predict the transition will be smooth.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come in here and with a 10- or 15-minute background
check, they're on their way, no hassle,'' said Marty Mandall, owner
of Mandall Shooting Supplies in Scottsdale, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   Paul McComb, a Legendary Guns customer, said that he's not
thrilled about the extended checks, but that they don't really
bother him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can start getting paranoid about Big Brother and he's
checking on everything,'' said McComb, a television photographer.
``But realistically, I don't think it's a big issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Technically, Nov. 30 will mark a switch from a potential
five-day wait for a background check for handgun sales to a
potential three-day wait for all gun sales.
</P>
<P>
   But the possible three-day delay would kick in only if an
instant check turns up some suspicious issue that needs to be
cleared up.
</P>
<P>
   And, in fact, Arizona will see little practical change.
</P>
<P>
   The Handgun Clearance Center at the Arizona Department of Public
Safety already checks people out in minutes, said Teresa Fuentes,
head of the center. The hurry-up checks will continue when long
guns are added to the mix, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The changeover will bring some differences, however.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, her department will be called the Firearms
Clearance Center. For another, its workload will increase by 50 to
75 percent. And, for a third, it will be checking more types of
records than before.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the DPS clears buyers if they don't have a felony
conviction, aren't the target of a warrant, and haven't been
convicted of a misdemeanor involving domestic violence, Fuentes
said.
</P>
<P>
   But starting Nov. 30, the department will check for other
disqualifiers. Right now, it's adding computer files that will
allow it to check military, immigration and, where possible,
mental-health records. Some states, including Arizona, won't allow
checks of mental-health records.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to criminals, the Brady Law bars sales to people who
are under indictment or who have a dishonorable discharge from the
military, those who have renounced U.S. citizenship or are illegal
immigrants, and those with mental problems.
</P>
<P>
   It also disqualifies drug addicts, but documenting drug
addiction is difficult, Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Arizona buyers have been subject only to
criminal-record checks because the other records weren't readily
available, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Only about 2.5 percent of potential buyers have been
disqualified since the Brady Law checks began in Arizona in 1994,
Fuentes said.
</P>
<P>
   Before passage of Brady, the National Rifle Association _ the
major lobbying group for gun owners _ asked for the instant checks,
believing them to be less burdensome than waiting periods for gun
buyers.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the long-gun checks are in the offing, the NRA says the
new checks will be fine as long as they are carried out reasonably.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think gun owners are both optimistic and cautious,'' NRA
spokesman Jim Manown said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA is concerned because the FBI wants to levy a $16 tax on
gun buyers for each check and to hold onto the sales records for 18
months following the sale, Manown said.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA opposes both proposals, and is backing legislation that
would ban the tax and force the FBI to destroy its records of a gun
sale immediately after the sale.
</P>
<P>
   Gun-control advocates also have mixed feelings about the new
check on long guns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We support the background check on long guns,'' said Nancy
Hua, a spokeswoman for Handgun Control Inc., based in Washington,
D.C. ``However, we're not happy with the fact that the waiting
period goes away.''
</P>
<P>
   Hua said Handgun Control thinks there should be a mandatory
three- to five-day waiting period for handgun sales, to guard
against angry people looking for revenge and depressed people
looking for a way out.
</P>
<P>
   Some people, though, regard the new long-gun checks with pained
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   One of them is John Weir, manager of Don's Sport Shop, 7803 E.
McDowell Road in Scottsdale.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate to see it,'' Weir said. ``It's just one more thing that
government interferes in.'' &QL;

<P>
   PETERBOROUGH, Ontario _ Like other men who have dipped paddles
into dark, clear waters and felt the soulful satisfaction of
gliding through perfect silence, John Jennings has been captivated
by canoes. He has been that way since he was a boy, and he can
think of few things better than to enter the northern wilderness
with four weeks of supplies in a 16-foot canoe and simply
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, Jennings has pursued an obsessive, some
might think odd, dream that has made his treasured wilderness
outings rare. A bookish, soft-spoken college professor whose
enthusiasm for Canadian history is matched only by his passion for
the fine elegance of canoes, Jennings has devoted himself to
founding a museum dedicated to the Canadian canoe.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, he feels he is also doing his bit to keep his
country together.
</P>
<P>
   Taking shape now in some old industrial buildings in this
canoe-making town in the hill country northeast of Toronto is the
Canadian Canoe Museum, a national collection of about 600 canoes
that, taken together, trace the history of Canada and paint a
picture of the rugged spirit and boundless energy needed to
establish this enormous country.
</P>
<P>
   For Jennings, the canoe and the pioneering voyageurs who
traveled in them across the North American wilds are to Canada what
the dark stallion and the solitary cowboy are to the United States.
Or at least they could be.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canoe is really the closest thing Canada has to a national
symbol,'' Jennings said during a stroll through the building where
some of the canoes have been on display since last July.
</P>
<P>
   No admission fee is collected yet because the exhibits are still
too limited, he said. But the museum's staff is in the middle of a
$7 million fund-raising campaign, and opening the museum's
collection has been a way to bring people on board.
</P>
<P>
   The oldest canoe in the collection was discovered in a swamp in
Ontario and is thought to date back more than 500 years _ long
before the first Europeans arrived. The odd west coast Kootenay
canoe _ with a sturgeon-shaped nose _ is unlike those found
anywhere except in the Amur Valley of Siberia, proof that people
from Asia brought their culture with them when they crossed the
Bering Strait to North America.
</P>
<P>
   The canoe used by a Canadian man to travel from Winnipeg,
Manitoba, to the mouth of the Amazon River in South America is part
of the museum's collection. So is the ceremonial canoe that Grand
Chief Matthew Coon Come of the Cree Indians carried through the
streets of New York City to stop the construction of the James Bay
II hydroelectric project in northern Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   Jennings, a professor of history at Trent University in
Peterborough, is on a crusade not just to build a museum but also
to have the canoe recognized as a romantic symbol of Canada's
founding, one that crosses the lines between French, English and
native people that so often tend to divide the country.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that, as a symbol of unity, the canoe might at first
have problems because it was French fur trappers and explorers who
adopted the native Indians' big birch bark canoes _ canot in
Quebecois French _ to reach deep into the continent while English
colonists were still huddled east of the Appalachian and Allegheny
mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But English explorers eventually followed the same watery trail
in similar canoes and what's important is that Canada needs a
symbol, Jennings said. Researching a book about the significance of
the American cowboy, he found that it was only in the late 19th
century, when worries about the crime and depredation of U.S.
cities were rampant, that the myth of the heroic, ruggedly
individualistic cowboy was written, in large part by urban writers
from the East.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same thing could easily happen with the image of the
voyageur,'' Jennings said. ``The more urban people are, the most
susceptible they are to the image of the wilderness.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   He may be on to something. The McMichael Canadian Art
Collection, which is widely known for its works by the Group of
Seven _ some of Canada's most famous artists _ is featuring a
special exhibition of 69 works connected to canoes. In some, like
Frances Anne Hopkins' ``Canoe Manned by Voyageurs Passing a
Waterfall,'' a canoe is being paddled or carried. In others, the
canoe's presence is merely implied by the artist's point of view.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had an exceptional response,'' said Linda Morita,
project leader for the exhibition, called ``In the Wild.'' She said
the show, in Kleinburg, has drawn serious art lovers as well as
people who are not necessarily interested in art but came to see
the canoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many it was a kind of emotional response,'' Ms. Morita
said. ``The canoe has a certain history and emotional attachment to
the Canadian experience.''
</P>
<P>
   It is that attachment that the makers of Upper Canada beer are
trying to tap. The advertising campaign for their new maple brown
ale uses a print of a voyageur canoe to appeal to Canadians' thirst
for a positive reflection of their own history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are Canadian icons, an easily and highly recognizable
part of our heritage,'' said Dan Fox, marketing director of Sleeman
Breweries Ltd., which manufactures the maple beer. He said
marketing research has found that Canadians seem to have ``a
greater interest and affinity to the spirit and values of the
Canadians who helped build this country.''
</P>
<P>
   The immensity of Canada _ its vast expanses of ice and water,
its rugged peaks and huge plains _ has always pulled against the
concept of nationhood. ``Canadians don't have the mythology that
helps them understand who they are,'' former Prime Minister Kim
Campbell said at a seminar this year.
</P>
<P>
   There is the maple leaf on Canada's flag, but Jennings points
out that he saw few maple leaves in Alberta, where he grew up.
There is hockey, but with expansion most National Hockey League
teams are not in Canada and players are no longer mostly Canadians.
Not everyone loves the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, and the
beaver _ well, an orange-toothed rodent has its limitations as a
national symbol.
</P>
<P>
   But not the canoe. ``The canoe reaches deep into our history and
extends into our future as the symbol of our stewardship of the
land,'' Jennings wrote in an essay on the Canadian canoe. ``The
symbol of the canoe can do much to bring Canadians together and
remind them of their quiet passion for this land.''
</P>
<P>
   With 2.1 million Canadian paddlers and 1.3 million canoes and
kayaks lying on their sides at Canadian cottages and river camps,
this is a country that already is at home with, and entranced by,
canoes. And Jennings is not alone in using a 16-foot cedar plank
canoe to measure the Canadian character.
</P>
<P>
   A widely visited Canadian news site on the Internet is called
Canoe. The popular Canadian historian Pierre Berton once defined a
Canadian as ``somebody who knows how to make love in a canoe.''
</P>
<P>
   And in the 1940s, long before he became prime minister, a young
Pierre Elliott Trudeau wrote evocatively of a voyage into Canada's
outback.
</P>
<P>
   ``What sets a canoeing expedition apart is that it purifies you
more rapidly and inescapably than any other,'' Trudeau wrote.
``Travel a thousand miles by train and you are a brute; pedal five
hundred on a bicycle and you remain basically a bourgeois; paddle a
hundred in a canoe and you are already a child of nature.''
</P>
<P>
   Or a Canadian.

ANALYSIS: QUESTION WITHOUT AN ANSWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By issuing a subpoena to President Clinton to
testify before a grand jury that is investigating him for possible
federal crimes, Kenneth Starr has made urgent and concrete the
theoretical question that has hovered at the margins of the
independent counsel's 4-year-old investigation: Can a sitting
president be subject to criminal prosecution?
</P>
<P>
   Despite fervent and opposing assertions by partisans on both
sides, the answer is no more clear now than when the investigation
began, or when lawyers for President Nixon brought the question to
the Supreme Court nearly 25 years ago. That is to say: No one
knows.
</P>
<P>
   The justices never answered Nixon's question, although as a
corollary to the Watergate tapes, the court accepted briefs and
heard argument on whether impeachment was the sole means of
pursuing criminal charges against a sitting president. The court
did rule that Nixon had to turn over the incriminating White House
tapes, rejecting his claim of executive privilege. Nixon had been
named an unindicted co-conspirator by the Watergate grand jury,
whose jurisdiction he was challenging in the months before he
resigned after losing his Supreme Court battle.
</P>
<P>
   Leon Jaworski, the last Watergate special prosecutor, was candid
with the Supreme Court in acknowledging the constitutional
ambiguity of his position. ``It is an open and substantial question
whether an incumbent president is subject to indictment,'' he wrote
in his Supreme Court brief, adding: ``Resort to constitutional
interpretation, history and policy does not provide a definitive
answer to the question of whether a sitting president enjoys
absolute immunity from the ordinary processes of the criminal
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers in Jaworski's office, after researching the question,
had told him he could seek an indictment of Nixon. But the
prosecutor, who died in 1982, wrote in his memoirs that while he
believed the Supreme Court might support indicting a sitting
president for a crime such as murder, it would not uphold an
indictment for obstruction of justice, especially given that the
House of Representatives had already begun impeachment proceedings.
For that reason, he had sought only to have the president named an
unindicted co-conspirator. Nixon's lawyer, James St. Clair, argued
that even that action was a constitutional ``nullity,'' beyond the
grand jury's authority.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution itself is both elaborately explicit and
frustratingly inscrutable on the question of whether impeachment
stands alone. Article I gives the House of Representatives ``the
sole power of impeachment'' and the Senate ``the sole power to try
all impeachments,'' language that does not necessarily displace
ordinary criminal proceedings. However, Article I goes on to state
that an impeached official, after conviction by the Senate, ``shall
nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment
and punishment, according to law.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Clair argued in his Supreme Court brief on Nixon's behalf
that this language demonstrated the Framers' intent that any
prosecution would follow impeachment and removal from office and
that, consequently, a president could not be prosecuted while in
office. In his rejoinder, Jaworski said the sentence only meant
that an impeached official could not raise a double jeopardy
objection to a subsequent prosecution, since the Constitution
obviously contemplated the availability of both.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Supreme Court did not decide the question, the
briefs remain as pithy, fully developed expressions of the
competing positions on impeachment versus prosecution. In addition
to the textual debate over how to interpret Article I, the lawyers
also disputed the issue on the deeper, structural ground of the
constitutional separation of powers.
</P>
<P>
   Since prosecution is an executive branch function, and since
Article II of the Constitution declares that ``the executive power
shall be vested in a President of the United States of America,''
St. Clair argued that ``it is hardly reasonable or sensible to
consider the president subject to such prosecutions.'' Jaworski
argued in turn that the country ``has evolved since 1789,'' with
expansion of the executive branch far beyond the office of the
president itself into numerous departments and agencies, so that
the classic theory of the ``unitary executive'' was not a realistic
way to frame the issue.
</P>
<P>
   And there the issue has sat, unexamined by any court, since
1974. In the current search for any possibly relevant history, some
lawyers and historians have resurrected an opinion by Chief Justice
John Marshall from 1807, sitting not in his Supreme Court function
but as a trial judge presiding over the grand jury in Richmond,
Va., that indicted Aaron Burr for treason. After Burr sought
documents from President Jefferson that he said were necessary for
his defense, the chief justice issued a subpoena to the president
on the ground that Burr, on trial for his life in a capital case,
had a constitutional right to evidence in his favor.
</P>
<P>
   The president complied by offering an edited version of the
material, which Burr accepted. Burr was acquitted of the charges
and the case never reached the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   There is ample precedent, in fact, for presidents to appear as
witnesses in criminal investigations of others. President Ford gave
testimony on videotape against a woman who tried to assassinate
him, and President Reagan objected but ultimately gave videotaped
testimony in the Iran-contra prosecution of one of his aides, Adm.
John Poindexter. Much earlier, Presidents Monroe and Grant also
provided testimony in criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   But in none of these cases was the president himself the
criminal target. After more than 200 years of silence, the Supreme
Court may finally answer the question, unless somebody backs down
first _ either Starr, from a constitutional battle he might not
win, or Clinton, who could win the legal battle while losing what
may weigh heaviest in the fevered calculations now taking place,
the political war.

 &HT;    CLINTON FACES SETBACKS IN BATTLE WITH STARR
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's face-off with independent
counsel Kenneth Starr intensified on three fronts Monday, with a
ruling requiring deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsey to
testify before a grand jury, a surprise meeting between Starr's
office and Monica Lewinsky and deadline negotiations over whether
Clinton might be interrogated as early as this week.
</P>
<P>
   In a potentially damaging setback for Clinton, a U.S. appeals
court ruled that his conversations with Lindsey, perhaps Clinton's
closest confidant, are not shielded by traditional attorney-client
privilege and are fair game for Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ''A government attorney may not invoke the attorney-client
privilege in response to grand jury questions seeking information
relating to the possible commission of a federal crime,'' stated
the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   As an attorney working for the White House, Lindsey's job ``is
not to defend clients against criminal charges and it is not to
protect wrongdoers from public exposure,'' the judges stated in a
two-to-one ruling that upheld a lower court's earlier decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has appeared several times before the grand jury, but
reportedly has declined to respond to key questions from Starr,
asserting attorney-client privilege designed to protect the
confidentiality of discussions held between individuals and their
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff issued a statement Monday
assailing the court ruling and saying he is considering whether to
appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals has decided
that, unlike every other attorney and client in this country,
government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the right to
have confidential communications,'' Ruff's statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ''The practical result of the court's decision is that the
president, and all other government officials, will be less likely
to receive full and frank advice about their official obligations
and duties from government attorneys,'' Ruff wrote. ''Without the
privilege, frank and candid exchange of information and advice will
be chilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was made by U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Judith
Rogers, a Clinton appointee, and Bush appointee Judge A. Raymond
Randolph, according to the Associated Press. Judge David Tatel,
another Clinton nominee, dissented from the main part of the
decision, warning of the potential for the sort of ``chilling
effect'' alluded to by Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   On a second front, Lewinsky met for several hours on Monday with
members of Starr's office, according to the Associated Press, in
the first such meeting known to have taken place since January.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is seeking immunity from federal prosecutors in
exchange for her testimony in Starr's investigation into
allegations that Clinton had an Oval Office affair with the former
White House intern and later coached her to lie about it under
oath.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has denied both charges.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the investigation told the Associated Press
that Starr's office reached no immunity deal with Lewinsky on
Monday and that another meeting was anticipated, somewhere outside
of Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Starr last January refused to grant Lewinsky immunity in
exchange for her testimony that an affair took place. On tapes of
recorded conversations, Lewinsky reportedly talked about the
alleged affair and said Clinton urged her to deny it.
</P>
<P>
   Against the frenzied backdrop of court activity and immunity
talks, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, held negotiations
with Starr's office over whether, and under what terms, the
president might testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's office issued a brief statement confirming that the
talks were underway, but offered nothing of substance beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Office of Independent Counsel, as we
have in the past, to devise a way for the president to provide
information for the OIC's investigation, consistent with his
constitutional role and responsibilities'' the statement said. ``It
would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of failed talks with the White House about the
prospect of Clinton coming forward and testifying voluntarily,
Starr has subpoenaed Clinton to appear before the grand jury this
week. The White House has yet to publicly respond.
</P>
<P>
   A refusal to testify could spark a constitutional crisis
centered on the question of whether the federal courts may compel a
sitting president to testify in criminal proceedings against
himself.
</P>
<P>
   A refusal could also place Clinton in a politically precarious
position. He said, when the Lewinsky allegations first surfaced in
mid-January, that questions about his relationship with her were
legitimate and that he hoped to answer those questions sooner
rather than later.
</P>
<P>
   A refusal to come forward now and do so could make his denials
ring hollow to some people, and even Clinton's fellow Democrats on
Capitol Hill have hinted in recent days that stiffing a Starr
subpoena would be a move few public figures would support.
</P>
<P>
   Another matter reportedly under discussion between Kendall and
Starr is the question of where Clinton might testify _ in the
regular grand jury room, as Starr insists, or in the White House or
Kendall's office, as Clinton would prefer.
</P>
<P>
   One possible compromise reportedly under discussion would have
Clinton testify live from the White House, transmitting his
testimony over a closed-circuit television system to the grand
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   Also at issue is whether Clinton would appear before the grand
jury alone, as is customary, or with his attorney, as he would
prefer.

EAST ASIAN NATIONS NOT INSPIRED BY NEW JAPANESE LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Japanese voters are not the only people who reacted
tepidly to the election of Keizo Obuchi as the leader of Japan's
governing party. The choice of Obuchi has deflated many in the rest
of Asia, who were hoping that a forceful new leader would step up
to recharge Japan's weak economy and repair its faltering financial
system.
</P>
<P>
   Because of their extensive trade, foreign investment and credit
links with Japan, most Asian countries are effectively hostage to
Japanese economic fortunes. As Japan has slid into a recession, it
has dragged down resilient Asian economies like those of Taiwan,
Hong Kong and Singapore, and deepened the pain for weaker economies
like South Korea's, Thailand's and Indonesia's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of Asia is looking for, and demanding that Japan be the
locomotive to pull it out of this slump,'' William Overholt, head
of research at BankBoston in Singapore, said in assessing the
selection Friday of Obuchi, who will likely become the next prime
minister of Japan. ``The region was really hanging on this
election, and people were hoping for a dynamic prime minister.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks across Asia declined sharply Monday, as investors
expressed pessimism that a government led by Obuchi, who has been
foreign minister, would perform the radical surgery that economists
say is needed to revive the Japanese economy. In Tokyo, the
benchmark Nikkei index of 225 issues dropped 2.5 percent, while the
Hong Kong market slipped 3.3 percent. The dollar strengthened to
141.95 yen in Asia and rose further to 142.41 in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The gloomy reaction came despite Obuchi's assurances in a
meeting over the weekend with Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
that he would move quickly to revive Japan's economy. ``I can and
will act promptly,'' U.S. officials quoted Obuchi as telling
Albright, who was in Manila to attend a meeting of foreign
ministers from Asian and Pacific nations.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi, 61, is expected to seek about $42 billion in tax cuts
and $70 billion in additional public spending to stimulate consumer
demand. But he has offered few proposals about how to reform the
Japanese banking system, which is staggering under $600 billion in
troubled debt. Until he does, analysts said, economies like
Thailand's and Hong Kong's, which depend heavily on Japan for
loans, will continue to suffer, as Japanese banks curtail their
lending.
</P>
<P>
   As leader of the governing Liberal Democratic Party, Obuchi is
all but certain to be elected prime minister this week. Analysts
said that one measure of his determination to confront Japan's
problems will be his choice of finance minister. Monday,
speculation centered on Kiichi Miyazawa, a 78-year-old party elder
and former prime minister, though Japanese newspapers said he was
also considering two other officials: Seiroku Kajiyama and Koiichi
Kato.
</P>
<P>
   Kajiyama, who challenged Obuchi in the race for the party
presidency, would offer some hope to the markets, according to a
few analysts, because he expressed a willingness to shut down
troubled banks. But other experts said that no finance minister, or
even prime minister, could rise above a system that prizes
consensus and prefers incremental change to upheaval.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is no radical change or speeding up of the reforms in
Japan, I'm afraid it will delay the recovery of the rest of the
region,'' said Chia Yew Boon, research director at Santander
Investment Securities in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   Chia said Japan's economic problems were hurting other Asian
markets in three ways. First, the weak yen makes Japanese products
cheaper than those of neighboring countries, further depressing
their already poor exports. Second, the troubles in Japan's
financial system force banks to call in loans to other Asian
countries, damaging businesses in the region.
</P>
<P>
   Third, and potentially most destabilizing, the collapse of the
Japanese economic model is eroding confidence in other Asian
countries, like South Korea and Malaysia, which have imitated Japan
by creating a handful of large, national conglomerates with close
ties to banks and government agencies.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On Friday, Moody's Investors Service lowered its rating on
Malaysian government debt, citing ``the rapid deterioration in
Malaysia's economy this year and the expected effects on the
banking sector and government finance.'' The downgrading has forced
the Malaysian government to postpone a $2 billion bond issue
planned for later in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's troubles affect Asian countries in different ways.
Malaysia and Indonesia, for example, export huge quantities of raw
material like timber to Japan. In 1997, such exports accounted for
11.5 percent of Malaysia's gross domestic product and 6.8 percent
of Indonesia's, according to Santander. As Japan's housing market
has stalled and demand for timber has declined, so have Malaysian
and Indonesian exports.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese banks have been prodigious lenders to Asian countries _
both to companies and governments. Hong Kong-based companies owe
$40.7 billion to Japanese banks, an amount equivalent to 23 percent
of the territory's gross domestic product. The Indonesian
government owes $22.8 billion, or 10.6 percent of its annual
output. Now, the spigot has been turned off _ to the chagrin of
property developers in Hong Kong and Cabinet ministers in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
   For Asians, the most alarming thing about Japan's travails is
the possibility that the cure could be worse than the disease. In
order for Tokyo to reform the banking system, analysts said it must
first acknowledge that some of the biggest Japanese banks are
insolvent, and then close them. The outgoing prime minister,
Ryutaro Hashimoto, took the first steps by authorizing the
development of a bridge-bank program to protect depositors in
smaller banks.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just one baby step in cleaning up the financial
system,'' said Ronald Bevacqua, a Merrill Lynch economist in Tokyo,
``I have no question that Obuchi will take the first step. But will
he take the following steps?''
</P>
<P>
   Bevacqua said Obuchi had as good a chance of success as any
Japanese politician _ partly because he has many friends in his
party and few enemies outside it. That may enable him to steer a
painful financial package through the Parliament more effectively
than a more confrontational leader.
</P>
<P>
   As for the other Asian nations, they can really only be
bystanders. Japan's economy is too big for its neighbors to export
around and too powerful for them to control. They are in the
frustrating position of hoping that Obuchi can deliver on his
campaign promises _ and then go well beyond them.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Margolis, a regional strategist with Merrill Lynch in
Hong Kong, said, ``Even if the Japanese locomotive doesn't come out
of the siding and needs a radical repair job, it's probably better
to get on with that than deal with years of zero growth and
consumer demand.''

 &HT;    Time for Barnes to set himself apart
 &HT;    By Tom Baxter
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Let me tell you something.
</P>
<P>
   You're going to hear that a lot in the next four months. He
enunciates the words more carefully these days _ in court or at the
Capitol the phrase used to roll off his lips as one word,
``lemmetellyasumpthin'' - but Roy Barnes still uses the phrase as
liberally as Newt Gingrich says ``frankly.''
</P>
<P>
   That phrase is also a conversational tip-off to the strengths
and weaknesses which the Democratic nominee-in-suspension _ a
working title for his status until the runoff makes the nomination
official _ brings to the governor's race.
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, Barnes can tell you something, about hardware
stores, suburban growth, Georgia law and the General Assembly. He
is the only lawyer-legislator of his generation to invite
comparison with former Rep. Denmark Groover, who was legendary for
his command of the state code. Barnes has been known to leave a
morning session of the legislature and win a multi-million-dollar
court judgment in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, sometimes he'll tell you something and wish
he hadn't, as was the case when he wisecracked to reporters in the
closing days of the primary campaign that his wife, Marie, was
pregnant. Lewis Massey's wife, Amy, who is pregnant, took offense
at the inference her condition was connected to her husband being
the race and demanded an apology.
</P>
<P>
   The troubles created by Barnes' quick tongue have been mostly
minor distractions, but even those can be deadly in a race as
tightly paced as this one is going to be.
</P>
<P>
   The last few days have been heady ones for the Barnes campaign,
with Massey's suspension of his campaign and Guy Millner's
unexpected problems with Mike Bowers. Those developments create the
illusion of a lead. In fact, Barnes has to hurry to make up the gap
between himself and Millner, whom the Democrat coyly declined over
the weekend to designate as his opponent pending the results of the
recount.
</P>
<P>
   For all the reputation he enjoys in government and legal
circles, Barnes is a little like a famed Broadway actor taking a
crack at an action movie. He has to appeal to a much wider
audience, within a fraction of the attention span to which he's
accustomed. Above all, he can't afford the mistake of thinking that
his audience knows him already.
</P>
<P>
   The millions Barnes laid out on early television in the primary
race could be crucial to his chances in the general election, if
that early exposure helped define Barnes to new voters before
Millner takes a shot at it.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had Millner referred to him as ``lawyer Barnes'' in
his only primary debate than Barnes began referring to Millner as
``defendant Millner.'' He can give as good as he gets in verbal
volleys, but Barnes now faces an opponent who can spend what it
takes to paint him in a negative light from now until November.
Compared to what he faces in the general election, Massey's
negative ads were only a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
   With his folksy appeal, suburban background and big-city
finesse, Barnes has the potential to create a sort of Georgia
Party, one that might briefly unite disaffected Bowers voters,
Democratic core groups and independents looking for a candidate
with roots in the state and a proven track record.
</P>
<P>
   A former colleague of Barnes pinpointed the weakness in this
strategy: ``Barnes is very Georgia,'' he said, ``but Georgia
isn't.''
</P>
<P>
   To win this race, in other words, Barnes has to stretch himself
past the associations built up over a career, and rely on more than
a reputation that stretches back to law school at UGA. And he
doesn't have much time to do it.

SERBS ADVANCE IN KOSOVO, IMPERILING DIPLOMATIC EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MIKE O'CONNOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia _ Yugoslav government forces continued
their intensive attacks against separatist guerrillas across Kosovo
province on Monday, officials said. The soldiers have retaken
stretches of major roads that were held by the rebels, the
officials added, and are beginning to confine the rebels to two
areas of the province.
</P>
<P>
   Western diplomats here said the attacks might have dealt the
ethnic Albanian rebels their worst setback of the war, but they
acknowledged that information from the field was skimpy.
</P>
<P>
   The government attacks threaten Western efforts to stop the war
through negotiations, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of tens of thousands of civilians who live in the areas
under attack is unknown. Relief agencies say they cannot determine
how badly those people may need food and medical supplies because
aid workers are being kept away by the fighting and by government
checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of foreign diplomats who have been allowed to visit
the combat zones report that the government appears to be trying to
clear rebel forces from major roads. Whether the government forces
will continue the fighting in the countryside if they regain
control of the roads is impossible to predict, the diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   Government press officials, eager to demonstrate a successful
military action, allowed a convoy of journalists to drive from
Pristina, the provincial capital, to Pec late Monday, but the
convoy came under sniper fire in rebel territory.
</P>
<P>
   The government offensive comes as Western diplomats were turning
a bit less pessimistic about their chances of persuading ethnic
Albanian leaders and the Serbs to negotiate. Albanians are about 90
percent of the population of Kosovo, and some of their political
leaders and the rebels are demanding independence from Serbia,
which forms the major part of Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and European diplomats who have been trying to induce
ethnic Albanian leaders to join in forming a negotiating team said
the Serbian offensive might be angering the Albanians to the point
that they will not negotiate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have yet to build a strong enough negotiating base that it
can withstand this kind of blast,'' a Western diplomat said.
``Violence never helps real negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   One diplomat said that if the guerrillas, who call themselves
the Kosovo Liberation Army, are badly hurt, they might refuse to
negotiate until they regained some losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a problem ending this war if one side or the other
feels too strong or too weak,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Yugoslav officials said the second stage of the government
offensive began in earnest Monday as troops moved to force the
rebels into two areas in the center of the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a third area, near Junik on the Albanian border, about 1,500
rebels were surrounded, the officials said, adding that their
surrender will be demanded. But for the two other, much larger
groups of rebels, the strategy is to contain them, the officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will have the roads and they will be concentrated in
pockets we can control,'' one government official said, adding that
the burden of caring for thousands of civilians would make it
difficult for the guerrillas to mount a significant counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   The officials are close to the Yugoslav military and spoke on
the condition that they not be identified by name.
</P>
<P>
   Relief workers estimate that as many as 90,000 people have fled
their homes and are now living in areas under rebel control. Some
of the areas are isolated and were poor even before the refugees
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The relief workers worry about sanitary conditions and the
availability of food, water and medicine for refugees. In one area,
very near where government troops are now attacking, 10,000 to
15,000 ethnic Albanians have arrived after fleeing fighting nine
days ago, the aid workers said, and diplomats expressed concern
that many of the refugees would join the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   U.S., European and Russian diplomats and military experts were
to be allowed to monitor the conflict, starting July 1. But most
monitors have not arrived, and three U.S. military cargo planes
carrying armored cars and radios for the monitors were first
allowed to land in Yugoslavia on Monday, diplomats said.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel forces have grown quickly and have established their
own authority in about one-third of the country, diplomats say. But
foreign military analysts and ethnic Albanian leaders say the
rebels are still poorly armed and badly organized. With disputes
and competing strategies among its leaders, the Kosovo Liberation
Army may take some time to regroup from the Serbian attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But as government troops move to retake roads and clear broad
areas of land on either side to protect them, they now have
hundreds of square miles to guard.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, diplomats say, the government was having trouble
paying the costs of military operations well before this offensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gains from this offensive could ebb away because of
something as simple as not having enough money to buy fuel to keep
all the soldiers and tanks deployed,'' one Western diplomat said.

ALONE AT THE TOP: PANTANI CONQUERS THE ALPS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Colo.)   (bl)  
 By SAMUEL ABT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LES DEUX ALPES, France _ Climbing with startling power in heavy
rain, Marco Pantani shook up the Tour de France on Monday as he
finished alone in the Alps and soared from fourth place over all
into the leader's yellow jersey by nearly four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Pantani, the Italian leader of the Mercatone Uno team, was
magnificent. He bolted away from the main group of favorites
halfway up the third of four major climbs, overtook an early
breakaway and then rocketed up the final climb with nobody able to
keep him in sight.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the 117-mile trip from Grenoble to the resort of Les
Deux Alpes in 5 hours 43 minutes 45 seconds, a speed of about 20
miles an hour over mountain roads shrouded in fog and slick with
the daylong rain. So slippery were the conditions that the
lightweight Pantani skidded and fell on the first climb. Obviously
he recovered.
</P>
<P>
   His main victim in the remaining 141-man field was Jan Ullrich,
the German leader of the Telekom team, the defending Tour champion
and the overall leader when the stage started. After working hard
all day, Ullrich faded severely in the last climb and finished
25th, 8:57 behind the winner.
</P>
<P>
   Since he led Pantani by 3:01, that translated into a deficit of
5:56 for Ullrich, who is in fourth place overall.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Julich from Glenwood Springs, Colo., the top rider with
Cofidis, held on to second place over all by finishing fifth, 5:43
behind. He trails Pantani by 3:53.
</P>
<P>
   Il Pirata, the Pirate, as Pantani styles himself, did not win
the Tour on Monday because he still faces two more days in the Alps
and then a long individual time trial Saturday, the day before the
bicycle race ends in Paris. But he took a credible option on
victory in the same manner in which he won the Giro d'Italia, the
world's second-ranked race, last month.
</P>
<P>
   In that race, he demolished his rivals in the mountains and then
surpassed himself to finish third in the time trial, his weak
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to talk now about the time trial,'' he said after
this 15th of 21 daily stages. ``Let me enjoy myself first on the
day of my greatest victory. I didn't come to the Tour expecting to
win it, because it really isn't suited for climbers.''
</P>
<P>
   The remark drew a laugh from his listeners even though he has
been saying this for months, complaining that the mountain stages
were not difficult enough and that only two ended on a peak, as
this stage did. The next stage, for example, ends with a 24.9-mile
descent from the Alps, allowing rivals he might leave behind uphill
to catch him downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now that I've got the yellow jersey,'' Pantani said,
``I'll try to wear it to Paris.''
</P>
<P>
   Julich, however, was not conceding victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The weather really bothered me,'' he said, ``and I didn't have
a good day.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He noted that he nearly crashed on the final descent when the
road turned right but he swerved left as he tried to don a rain
jacket to keep him warm on the fast run downhill.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he intended to shadow Pantani as he had Ullrich, Julich
said: ``Only if I want to finish second. If I want to win, I have
to attack Pantani.''
</P>
<P>
   Easier said than done. This was the second mountain victory in
the 85th Tour for the 28-year-old Pantani, who wears an earring and
a bandanna over his shaven head. He also won last week in the
Pyrenees after finishing second the day before when he accelerated
too late in the day and could not quite catch an early leader.
</P>
<P>
   His timing Monday was exemplary. After staying with the main
group over the first climb, the Croix de Fer's 15.2 miles with a
grade of 5.1 percent, and the second, the Telegraphe's 7.3 miles at
6.8 percent, Pantani unleashed himself on the big one. That was the
Galibier, 11.4 miles at 6.8 percent to a height of 8,728 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Cheered on by an immense and soaked crowd, he left Ullrich,
Julich and their teammates planted. About 2.5 miles later, at the
peak, he led them by 2:50.
</P>
<P>
   Roaring through the descent with a group of early leaders,
Pantani reached the start of the 5.5-mile climb, again on a 6.8
percent grade, to Les Deux Alpes with four companions. He travels
fastest who travels alone, the Italian decided.
</P>
<P>
   As the rain pelted down, Pantani pelted up. When he finally
raised his arms in triumph as he crossed the finish line, he was
1:54 ahead of the next man, Rodolfo Massi, an Italian with Casino
and the nominal leader of the climbing competition.
</P>
<P>
   Massi, who has collected points on the small hills that Pantani
neglects, rode a brave race Monday, but there is no confusion about
who really is king of the mountains.

AMID TEARS, PRAISE, ROTUNDA PREPARED FOR SLAIN POLICEMEN 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amid black bunting and heavy hearts, Congress
resumed the nation's business Monday, as thousands of men and women
who work in the US Capitol mourned two police officers who died
protecting the marble monument.
</P>
<P>
   Tears flowed from a dank loading dock to a crowded cafeteria
counter to the chandeliered corridors of power. ``We lost two
members of our family,'' said Kaye Willis, a Senate doorkeeper,
after drying her eyes. ``And all I can see is their smiling
faces.''
</P>
<P>
   As workers prepared for the slain officers to lie in state
Tuesday in the historic Rotunda, lawmakers set aside partisan
bickering to pay tribute to Capitol Police Detective John M.
Gibson, 42, and Private First Class Jacob J. ``J.J.'' Chestnut, 58.
</P>
<P>
   The officers died Friday in a bloody gun battle with Russell E.
Weston Jr., an unemployed drifter who invaded the Capitol, firing
until he was critically wounded in the office of Representative Tom
DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip.
</P>
<P>
   The House and Senate, in their first official sessions since the
tragedy, immediately passed resolutions praising the officers and
authorizing memorial trust funds for their wives and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``They died saving lives,'' said DeLay, whose office door was
draped in black bunting and guarded by officers with badges banded
in black ribbon. ``They died doing their duty.''
</P>
<P>
   DeLay called Gibson, a Waltham, Mass. native who served on his
personal security team, his ``guardian angel.''
</P>
<P>
   The first officers slain in defense of the Capitol, Gibson and
Chestnut were little known beyond their immediate circles of
friends, family and co-workers. But like the unknown soldiers of
war, they are expected to represent all law enforcement officers
who have been killed in the line of duty when they are honored
today in a memorial service led by President Clinton and
congressional leaders.
</P>
<P>
   It will mark the first time that two coffins have lain in state
at the same time in the Rotunda. To date, only 24 national leaders
and heroes have received the honor in the Rotunda, including
Presidents Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is fitting that these two brave men will lie in state in
the Capitol building where they gave their lives,'' said Senator
Edward M. Kennedy, the late president's brother.
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, Kennedy placed two dozen yellow roses on a floral
tribute to the officers that sprawls up the marble steps on the
east side of the Capitol building. With each bouquet, he left a
card that offered ``deepest condolences, as we mourn the loss of a
profile in courage.''
</P>
<P>
   The cards were signed: ``The Kennedy family.''
</P>
<P>
   The memory of both officers, who will be buried at Arlington
National Cemetery after funerals later this week, was alive
throughout the Capitol. Their ready smiles were familiar to many:
politicians and pages, tour guides and maintenance workers,
congressional aides and fellow officers.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, a 20-year Air Force veteran who had served 18 years as
a Capitol Police officer, was recalled for maintaining his genial
nature, even as he was demanding that House staffers run through
the metal detector every box of fried chicken they brought into the
Capitol to make sure they contained no contraband.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, who also served 18 years on the Capitol Police force,
was known for seizing the attention of those around him with a
simple glance.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you remember John, remember that grin that could melt
your heart or tell you that you had done wrong with just one
look,'' said DeLay, quoting an aide, Mary Ellen Wright, who saw
Gibson shot to death as he exchanged gunfire with Weston at the
threshold of DeLay's office. ``When you remember John, remember
that twinkle in his eye...a twinkle of compassion and love.''
</P>
<P>
   Another DeLay aide described Gibson, a deeply religious man who
graduated from St. Mary of the Annunciation High School in
Cambridge, Mass. in 1974, as his ``vision of what a Catholic priest
would be like if he was allowed to marry and raise a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the joint House and Senate resolution, which passed both
chambers on unanimous votes, plaques commemorating each officer
will be placed near the spots where they died. Congress also will
pay for their funerals and give each of their families a sum equal
to one year's pay.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Senate spent much of the day debating a federal
credit union bill, the House postponed all other activities as the
days dwindle to the summer recess, which begins for the Senate on
Friday and the House on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   However, the tragedy prompted lawmakers from both chambers to
discuss reviving a plan to build a visitors center outside the
Capitol that would limit access to the building and improve
security.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, security appeared tighter in the tragedy's aftermath,
and many officers who rarely wore their optional bullet-resistant
vests before the shooting wore them Monday. And the crush of
tourists continued at its usual pace of 18,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   As they stood near the spot where the shootings occurred, Ann
Easter, of Clayton, N.Y., said she had worried about how her
8-year-old son, Chris, would react to visiting the scene of the
crime. But she said he was assured by Gibson's and Chestnut's
heroism. And he agreed. ``I feel safe and secure,'' he said.

<P>
   Foreign observers have always had trouble understanding Israel's
complex politics and following the twists and turns of the Jewish
state's foreign policy. But nothing in Israeli political history
has raised eyebrows like the ascendancy of Binyamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu is still popular despite his razor-thin margin of
victory over Shimon Peres, in the '96 elections _ and, since then,
his repeated diplomatic blunders and derailment of a peace process
that is overwhelmingly supported by Israelis _ nearly 60 percent,
according to recent polls.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed Netanyahu's continued appeal is the great paradox of
Israeli politics today.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the Netanyahu enigma is a new configuration of
domestic forces that has allowed him to rule the country
comfortably and commit foreign-policy mistakes with electoral
impunity.
</P>
<P>
   Netanyahu relies today on a conservative alliance comprising
three major forces: Israel's nationalist right, its radical right
and its soft right.
</P>
<P>
   The first two groups have long been part of Israel's political
landscape. What is new is the soft right, an odd melange of
ultra-Orthodox Jews and secular immigrants from the former Soviet
Union, whose newfound influence lets Netanyahu defy political
gravity.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, when the Labor Party lost an election for the first
time ever to the Likud Party, Israel's political map has been split
into two large and roughly equal ideological camps polarized over
the future of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
   While Labor, under Yitzhak Rabin and Peres, advocated moderation
and territorial compromise, the Likud of Menachem Begin and Yitzhak
Shamir pursued a hard-line agenda, urging the settlement and
eventual annexation of the occupied territories. In the center has
been a smaller ultra-Orthodox camp that cares less about the
territories or the Palestinians than about government largesse.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Rabin's appeal as a security-minded pragmatist led
Labor back to power. This made possible the Oslo accords with the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and a formal peace treaty
with Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's right was galvanized by the Six Day War of 1967, in
which Israel took the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan, the
Gaza Strip and the Sinai from Egypt, and the Golan Heights from
Syria. Since then, the Israeli right has been composed of two major
segments: the secular nationalist right, embodied in the Likud of
Begin and Shamir, and the radical right, spearheaded by settlers of
the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
   The radical right is far more militant than the Likud and has a
penchant for extra-parliamentary politics and extralegal action,
including illegal settlement-building and violence.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the ultra-Orthodox, who do not serve in the
Israeli army, remain disinterested in the national issues of war,
peace, the territories and the Palestinians. Convinced that all
these ``minor'' problems will be resolved in the messianic era, the
ultra-Orthodox have focused exclusively on the welfare of their
constituents and the prosperity of their yeshivas, or religious
seminaries.
</P>
<P>
   By playing a shrewd game of hard-to-get with both Labor and
Likud, the ultra-Orthodox are experts at pushing through
legislation enshrining their monopoly over religious affairs and
obtaining large state subsidies for their communities and yeshivas.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli politics has, however, quietly undergone a great shift.
As highlighted by the 1996 elections, the ultra-Orthodox camp has
moved decisively rightward and now offers virtually automatic,
monolithic support for the Likud Party's prime ministerial
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The ultra-Orthodox shift to the right has been neither
ideological nor theological. The sages, as ever, see Jewish
settlements in the West Bank as meaningless. They address the
question of whether to hold on to the territories only in terms of
``pikuakh nefesh,'' the principle in Jewish law that saving lives
is one's paramount obligation, and thus, in fact, may be willing to
back a territorial compromise that would avert bloodshed. The
movement of the ultra-Orthodox toward the nationalist right and the
radical right has been primarily emotional, based on a mutual
animosity toward the Arabs and the godless Israeli left.
</P>
<P>
   As for the new soft right, their stock in trade is intense
mistrust of and hostility toward Arabs and _ thought to be just as
bad _ their secularized Jewish ``collaborators'' on the Israeli
left. The most aggressive element within the soft right is its
political activists, hundreds of young men, in their 20s and 30s,
who support Netanyahu with unbridled enthusiasm.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1977, the year the Likud first won power, the
ultra-Orthodox ranks have grown dramatically with students exempted
from service in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) because they wish
to devote their lives to the study of Jewish law. But the higher
seminary enrollment produced many marginal students who were
ill-prepared for rigorous studies.
</P>
<P>
   These restless and energetic young men were astutely targeted by
the followers of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane, an extremist from
Brooklyn who fomented anti-Arab violence. Many of these marginal
students were attracted to the quasi-fascist Kahanist subculture of
violence ``in the name of God'' and aggressive radical-right
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Another segment of Israeli ultra-Orthodoxy _ Habad, the Hasidic
followers of the late Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson of New York
_ have long been close to the Israeli right. Since Israel took the
West Bank in 1967, Habad's revered spiritual leader repeatedly
insisted on the holiness of the entire land of Israel, including
the newly won territories.
</P>
<P>
   For years, however, Habad stressed its nonpartisan educational
mission. But of late, the intensity of Israel's struggle over the
territories dragged the movement into politics, with a marked and
growing right-wing bias. In 1996, Habad money poured into
Netanyahu's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The 1992-96 Labor government, with what appeared to be an
anti-religious political and legislative agenda, was enough to
unite the soft right. So was a forceful radical-right campaign
against the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
   Shrewdly focusing on the ``unholy alliance'' between Rabin,
Peres and Israeli Arabs _ the alleged ``secret partners'' of
``arch-terrorist'' Yasir Arafat and the PLO _ the Israeli radical
right further succeeded in mobilizing the soft right. Moreover, a
wave of suicide terrorism by the Islamists of Hamas had a
devastating effect on the Israeli psyche, cementing this emotional
alliance and paving the way for Netanyahu's victory.
</P>
<P>
   But without the overwhelming support of Jews from the former
Soviet Union who have immigrated to Israel since 1990, Netanyahu
would never have been elected. Making up more than 10 percent of
the Israeli electorate, Russian Jews have become a major factor in
the nation's politics, and 65 percent of them voted for Netanyahu
in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   It is clear that most Russian Israelis cannot tolerate the
rhetoric of the left because of their painful memories of the
Soviet Union. Having been exposed to intense anti-Semitism, many of
these insecure immigrants share the widespread ultra-Orthodox
distrust of Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   While the Russians, unlike the ultra-Orthodox, do not have an
echelon of young activists who dictate their political agenda, they
are nourished by several conservative daily newspapers printed in
their native language. This right-leaning Russian press is, in
fact, the unifying element of a highly diverse group.
</P>
<P>
   However, with their secularism, heterogeneity and large number
of countries of origin, the Jews from the former Soviet Union are
the softest part of the soft right. Russian electoral behavior can
be quite pragmatic. While their rhetoric remains conservative, the
Russians are in nobody's pocket. Netanyahu will have to work hard
to keep their loyalty.
</P>
<P>
   Grateful to the soft right for its votes, Netanyahu has been
quick to recognize the price of its continued support. A superb
communicator, Netanyahu knows that this emotional constituency is
enamored of chauvinist rhetoric and attacks on Arab terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   When a crisis with the Palestinians, Hizballah, the Clinton
administration or alleged ``Arab sympathizers'' anywhere erupts, a
belligerent Netanyahu rushes for the cameras. The astounding
success of this media strategy was evident after the Mossad, the
Israeli security service, bungled an assassination attempt last
year on a Hamas leader in Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   Under fire from the Labor Party, the United States and a livid
King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

King Hussein of Jordan, Netanyahu told the soft right exactly what
they most wished to hear: that, regardless of political risk, he
would continue to hunt terrorists wherever they might be and that
Israelis' security would remain his sole consideration.
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, in a meeting with an elderly Sephardic
kabbalistic rabbi, Netanyahu pandered again to soft-right
sentiment.
</P>
<P>
   Not realizing that he could be heard by reporters, the prime
minister whispered that Israeli leftists had forgotten how to be
Jews and could not be entrusted with the nation's security because
they are prepared to accept Israeli Arabs as partners in
government.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the vocal departures of Binyamin Ze'ev Begin _ the
son of Menachem Begin, the Likud's founder _ and others from
Netanyahu's cabinet undermined his authority among members of his
own party.
</P>
<P>
   But with the backing of the soft right, who either disregard his
critics outright or see them merely as ``in-fighters,'' Netanyahu
is able to maintain solid public support and convince his
detractors that he is still the best game around. In an age of
television and virtual politics, the soft right is a great asset
for a leader of Netanyahu's style.
</P>
<P>
   And, to be sure, the ultra-Orthodox and the Russians dislike the
Arabs and distrust the secular left, but they are not prepared to
enter into a bloody confrontation with the Palestinians or Syrians.
Unlike the Israeli right's hard core, which is ready to fight for
the land of Israel and to accept the concomitant sacrifices, most
Israelis, including the Russian immigrants, are opposed to spilling
blood to keep the West Bank. Ultra-Orthodox and Russian families of
soldiers are especially likely to resent any government that leads
the nation into a costly military confrontation.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, by making it known to Netanyahu that a continued
deterioration in the peace process could cause them to switch
allegiances, the soft right may have its finest hour.

TOLL OF U.N.'S CIVILIAN WORKERS OVERTAKES MILITARY DEATHS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ An expert in famine relief with more than 25
years' experience in Africa was killed Thursday in Burundi, the
latest victim in series of violent deaths among U.N. officials.
</P>
<P>
   After the killing of three unarmed military observers and their
translator in Tajikistan this month, the United Nations said that
more civilians than soldiers had been killed this year in missions
around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The killing in Bujumbura of the aid expert, Renato Ricciardi, an
Italian who was working for the World Food Program, raises the toll
in just that organization to six this year. Ricciardi was ambushed,
robbed and shot in his house.
</P>
<P>
   The team in Tajikistan _ Jourajon Mahramov of Tajikistan, Adolfo
Sharpegue of Uruguay, Ryszard Szewczyk of Poland and Akino Yukata
of Japan _ were on patrol in a marked U.N. vehicle when they were
``ambushed and ruthlessly executed,'' a U.N. statement said last
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary General Kofi Annan called it ``an act of coldblooded
murder.''
</P>
<P>
   The deaths in Tajikistan followed the kidnappings and killings
this month of two Afghans who were working for U.N. agencies in
Jalalabad, Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   Since Jan. 1, 17 civilians have died in U.N. service, and 13
soldiers have died in military peacekeeping operations. Last year
the toll was 44 on-duty soldiers and 17 civilians.
</P>
<P>
   Nine civilians killed this year died in airplane or helicopter
crashes, including the secretary general's envoy in Angola, Alioune
Blondin Beye, who died in a still unexplained plane crash in the
Ivory Coast this month. The other eight were killed or died in what
appeared to be deliberate attacks, the United Nations said.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials and independent aid agencies are increasingly
concerned about the perils of working in civil conflicts, where
outsiders are often deliberately made a focus. Officials say the
respect traditionally shown for international monitors or aid
workers has all but disappeared in many areas, where violent
criminals also attack or kidnap people in remote posts.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. officials said Monday that Annan had requested a report on
dangers to aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Concerns about safety contribute to a reluctance to accept
assignments, even on short-term contracts, for U.N. work where law
and order have broken down.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. Emergency Relief Coordinator Sergio Viera de Mello said in
an interview Monday that attacks on relief workers were ``becoming
almost routine.'' He said that was why the United Nations was
insisting that such violence be considered war crimes under the
proposed International Criminal Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a convention for peacekeeping personnel,'' de Mello
said. ``But nowhere are humanitarian staff given any sort of
international protection.''

 BEIJING: running production. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a push to separate the military buyers from the
sellers,'' said a Western expert in China's military, based in Hong
Kong. ``The domestic military manufacturers are extremely poor at
delivering product on time. The idea is to make them more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Realigning the core businesses among China's 15,000 companies
owned or controlled by the military will also inevitably lead to
deep change involving some of the most lucrative and powerful
positions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has said repeatedly that he wants to wean the military off
its secondary income from these companies, and to rely solely on
money from the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, who works for Kroll, estimates that more than 95 percent
of all Chinese military enterprises are small and medium-sized
companies. It may not be difficult to sell or transfer the bulk of
these companies into civilian hands.
</P>
<P>
   A more critical question is what happens to the 500 to 1,000
large enterprises that generate about three-quarters of the untold
billions of dollars earned by military-owned or controlled
businesses, many of which are being consolidated into
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The largest among them, like China Poly Group, Xinxing Group and
Carrie Enterprises, are already international corporations with
offices around the world, including in the United States. Military
leaders will likely be more reluctant to let go of these jewels
unless they are given a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, an expert in China's military at Rand Corp.,
noted that official news accounts of Jiang's announcement last week
were riddled with ambiguities about the scope of the order to
separate military from business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This warrants some skepticism on the parameters of what Jiang
is undertaking,'' said Pollack. ``Though I think even a few actions
here to curtail some of the friskier business units would resonate
with a cynical public.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key factors in the transformation of the military and
defense-related industries is the reorganization of the Commission
for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, also
known as COSTIND.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, with Deng at the helm of China's military, the
commission was run like a personal fiefdom of the family of Marshal
Nie Rongzhen, a veteran of the Long March, the defining experience
for elder leaders of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1994, as Jiang began trying to oppose the widespread
nepotism in the defense industry, was Nie's daughter, Nie Li,
forced to retire from the board of the commission. Yet her husband,
Gen. Ding Henggao, remained in charge of the commission until
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ding was best known outside China for championing the
development of long-range ballistic missiles and the Long March
series of satellite launching systems. Ding was replaced by another
military leader, Lt. Gen. Cao Gangchuan, a deputy chief of staff in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year, as the commission was reformed, a civilian was
placed in charge: Liu Jibin, a former vice minister of finance with
experience in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the commission technically answered both to the
State Council, China's Cabinet, and to the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission, probably the single most powerful
organization in China's vast political apparatus. The military
commission often overruled or meddled with decisions by the State
Council, causing innumerable delays.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new reforms, the Commission for Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense is expected to exercise direct
control over key groups a civilian-run defense industry. That
includes China Aerospace Corp., Aviation Industries Corp., China
North Industries Corp., China National Nuclear Corp. and China
State Shipbuilding Corp.

ARMY EXPECTED TO ADOPT NEW RULES ON FRATERNIZATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Department of Defense plans to order the Army
to adopt strict new prohibitions on dating, sexual intimacy and
other close relationships between officers and enlisted personnel,
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rules would make the Army's fraternization policy
consistent with those already in effect in the Air Force, the Navy
and the Marine Corps. Those services bar virtually all personal
relationships between officers and enlisted personnel, from that of
gambling buddy to that of business associate. The Army currently
allows them, so long as they do not involve people within the same
company or chain of command.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed changes have emerged from one of two Pentagon
reviews of the military's regulation of personal behavior and
morality. And like the other review, of the prosecution of
adultery, the review of fraternization has had officials struggling
to balance the demands of military discipline with the mores of the
larger society.
</P>
<P>
   Fraternization is a military crime punishable by a maximum of
two years in prison, and a dishonorable discharge for enlisted
personnel and dismissal for officers. While the Army defines
fraternization differently from the other services, the maximum
penalty is the same in all. As a practical matter, though,
fraternization alone is rarely prosecuted; instead, most such cases
are handled with administrative punishment like a letter of
reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Secretary William Cohen said last Monday that he wanted
to establish a clearer, ``more balanced'' approach to both adultery
and fraternization. Cohen, who ordered the Pentagon reviews in June
1997 in the wake of a series of scandals involving sexual conduct,
said he hoped to make a decision on new rules for adultery and
fraternization soon.
</P>
<P>
   But the proposed changes have encountered opposition within the
military, and the resistance could still scuttle the draft
recommendations made by officials who have been conducting the
reviews for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   The Marine Corps has publicly objected to the proposed changes
on adultery, which would treat that offense less severely. And the
Army has repeatedly objected to having to change its rules on
fraternization, although its dissenting has been done behind the
scenes, once in a meeting late last month with Cohen and the
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Henry Shelton.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the
new rules were unnecessary. The service has not had significant
problems with fraternization, they said, and should not be required
to change solely for the sake of having a tougher policy consistent
with the other services.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said the proposed change could cause havoc
among the scores of officer-enlisted couples already involved in
relationships or even married.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we have works,'' one Army officer said. ``And it's worked
for decades.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The military has long defined fraternization as any improper
relationship between superior and subordinate. While the word
itself connotes relationships between men, the growth in the number
of women in the military, who now account for nearly 14 percent of
the nation's 1.4 million troops, means that fraternization these
days most often involves liaisons between the sexes.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, it is regarded as a grave disruption of morale and
discipline, and all the services warn officers to avoid even the
perception of it.
</P>
<P>
   Their rules vary, however, as to what constitutes a violation.
Only the Army allows officers to have personal relationships with
at least some enlisted personnel. Only the Navy prohibits all
relationships between senior enlisted and junior enlisted
personnel. But what is more, enforcement is uneven, with the Air
Force considered most likely to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   These differences have caused confusion, especially since many
bases in the United States and overseas have units from more than
one service. Even where confusion is absent, there is a perception
of inequitable handling.
</P>
<P>
   In one case reviewed by the Pentagon officials who have proposed
the changes, an Air Force lieutenant in San Antonio recently
received an official admonishment and a career-threatening
performance evaluation because she had dated an Army sergeant for
several months, even though they served at different bases, both in
Texas. Under the Army's rules, the sergeant had committed no
violation and so, the officials said, received no punishment.

CAB DRIVER DISPUTE LEAVES 1 DEAD, 2 HURT AT AIRPORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JIM HENDERSON 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A cab driver went on a shooting spree Monday at
Dallas-Fort Worth Airport, killing a fellow driver and wounding two
others as they sat in a sweltering metal shed waiting to be
dispatched.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman was identified as 35-year-old Bile Abdi Farah. He
surrendered to airport police under an overpass near the scene of
the shootings. Airport spokesman Joe Dealey Jr. said Farah is a
legal immigrant from Somalia, and authorities believe the victims
also are Somalian.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Issa, 25, was taken by helicopter to nearby Harris
Methodist HEB Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Abdalla Mead,
31, was shot in the arm and was listed in good condition at
Parkland Hospital in Dallas. Anthony Sugalo, 23, who was wounded in
the back, was in critical condition at &UR;  &LR; Fort Worth's Harris
Methodist Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Dealey said the shooting occurred shortly before noon, when
Farah parked his cab at the central taxi queue near the Hyatt
Regency DFW West and entered the metal shed, where drivers escape
from the sun while awaiting service calls.
</P>
<P>
   Although no motive for the shooting was known late Monday,
Dealey said he believes Farah had a confrontation with the three
victims before shooting them. Mead, wounded in the arm, ran from
the building toward a nearby utilities plant.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect allegedly followed and fired more shots at Mead in
the parking lot, but missed. He then returned to the shed and fired
more shots at the other two men he had wounded earlier, police
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Amhed, who drove up minutes after the shooting began,
said he saw Farah pursue Mead into the parking lot and shoot at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed the wounded guy and put him in my car to try to take
him to the hospital,'' he said, ``but just then a police car showed
up. I have blood in my cab.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said Issa staggered from the building and tried to get
into his cab, but apparently died at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   There was no information available on the type of handgun used,
but airport public safety director Tom Shehan said, ``We think it
was an automatic.''
</P>
<P>
   The central taxi queue is removed from the terminals and no
passengers were endangered, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear if Farah had specifically targeted
the three victims. One driver for Big Tex Cab, Abdirizak Ali, was
in the building when Farah came in and began firing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two people were hit right beside me,'' he told The Associated
Press. ``He was shooting for everybody. And he was trying to shoot
at me, but I ran away.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah had worked for Taxi Dallas for about six months, a company
spokesman said, and had previously worked for several other cab
companies. The spokesman would not speculate on a possible motive.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred in an area where hundreds of cabs line up
for the often long waits between fares. Some drivers said tempers
have been frayed by the lingering heat wave that has sent
temperature above 100 degrees at the airport for 35 straight days
this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Dealey agreed that the heat may have have been a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hot as hell,'' he said. ``When you have 100-plus
temperatures and combine that with tempers and competing taxicab
companies and grudges, there's only so much the airport
(administration) can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Tempers continued to boil over at the scene long after the
victims were removed. Other drivers complained that more than 30
minutes elapsed before the first ambulance arrived, a fact Dealey
disputed.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you are in a situation like this,'' he said, ``even a
very short few minutes can seem like an eternity. That's probably
what happened here.''
</P>
<P>
   The first ambulance was dispatched at 11:41 a.m., just after the
call was received, he said. It left the airport with one victim,
bound for Parkland Hospital, at 11:50, he said. A second ambulance
arrived from Grapevine, a small town just north of the airport, at
noon.

<P>
   WRENTHAM, Mass. _ Ben Coates, a star pro football player for the
New England Patriots, pleaded not guilty in District Court Monday
to allegedly attacking a jealous ex-girlfriend during a
confrontation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Coates, 28, at his home in the Chestnut Ridge
Condominiums, Franklin, Mass., around 10:30 p.m. after the alleged
attack on Jennifer Marshall, 27, the mother of Coates' young
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He was released Sunday night on cash bail of $500, but
prosecutors convinced a judge to raise Coates' bail to $1,000
during the arraignment. The judge also issued a no-abuse order to
Marshall. Coates' lawyer did not contest the move.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who suffered a cut on her arm during the incident
outside Coates' condominium, did not seek a restraining order.

   The 6-foot-5 inch, 245-pound Coates, an All-Pro tight end who is
married with three children, remained silent throughout the hearing
and refused to talk to reporters afterward. A pretrial conference
has been set for Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that at the end of this legal process it will be
clear that Ben has done nothing wrong,'' defense lawyer Peter
Barlow said after the hearing. ``Ben only wants to get back into
the business of playing football. He is a quiet and private person
who likes to remain within the parameters of the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Franklin police report, Marshall and a friend,
Corina Parkinson, 22, of Norwood, drove to Coates' house at around
10:30 p.m. on Sunday and knocked on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was apparently upset because she saw an unfamiliar car
in the driveway, the report states. During the confrontation, the
two shouted and shoved one another.
</P>
<P>
   In their accounts to police, Coates and Marshall blamed one
another for the assault.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement to police, Parkinson said she and her friend
believed the car belonged to Coates' new girlfriend. She said they
wanted to take pictures of the woman and the car.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall told police she became upset when she saw the car in
the driveway and knocked on Coates' front door.  &UR;  &LR; A heated argument
ensued, drawing curious neighbors from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Parkinson say Coates came from the house screaming
at Marshall, then pushed her to the pavement. Marshall told police
that when she pushed him back, Coates slammed her head to the hood
of the car, and threatened to knock her out.
</P>
<P>
   But Coates told police that Marshall initiated the assault. He
told officers she knocked on the front door, then attacked him when
he opened it. Coates said he pushed her away in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said he saw the
incident and backed Coates' account. In an interview Monday, the
neighbor said Marshall initiated the confrontation and pushed
Coates first.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, who said he lives close enough to hear their
screaming matches, said Marshall had gone after Coates before. On
one occasion, the neighbor said, Marshall kicked in the screen on
Coates' front door.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  During the off season, Coates resides in Concord, N.C., with
his wife Yvette and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, who this fall will enter his seventh season with the
Patriots, is the highest-paid tight end in the NFL. His 1997
contract is worth $7.5 million over three years and featured a $3
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Coates broke the NFL tight end record for receptions
with 96, and for the past four season has been in the Pro Bowl,
being selected All Pro in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Don Lowery said the team completely
supports Coates. He said the player looks after the daughter he had
with Marshall, and ``he pays child support.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll, the head coach, would not talk about the incident
in detail, but said Coates' arrest ``does remind us again'' that
players are constantly in the limelight, and they must ``just avoid
the situations (where) that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this can be a distraction for us, but we'll deal
with it as it comes,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The incident was the second in less than a week in which star
players faced assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  On Friday, a Boston clerk-magistrate threw out assault and
battery charges on Willie McGinest and Lawyer Milloy brought by a
23-year-old Boston woman who claimed the players attacked her in a
nightclub. The players claim they were helping the womman to her
feet after she stumbled and fell. The alleged victim did not appear
for a court hearing the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In January, quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe and Max Lane were named in
a lawsuit stemming from an incident during a rock concert at the
Paradise nightclub in Boston last November.
</P>
<P>
   The players were cleared of criminal charges, but a Maynard
woman who was injured claims the players landed on her after diving
from the stage into the crowd.

ASIAN ILLS RESPONSIBLE FOR STEEL-INDUSTRY LAYOFFS IN MEXICO 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SAM DILLON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Despite considerable nervousness about the impact
of the Asian crisis on Mexico and other Latin American countries,
until last week the main effects had been confined to the financial
markets, with only limited repercussions for the broad economy.
</P>
<P>
   So considerable interest has been aroused by the announcement
last week from Altos Hornos de Mexico, the country's largest steel
producer, that falling international demand and the availability of
cheap steel from Asia were forcing the largest layoffs in Mexico
since 1991.
</P>
<P>
   The elimination of 3,000 jobs constitutes ``the first case in
which we can see a very direct effect of the Asian crisis, and that
makes it notable,'' said Abel Beltran del Rio, the top Mexico
analyst at Ciemex-WEFA, a consulting group. Still, he said,
``unless there are serious new devaluations of the Asian
currencies, which we think is unlikely, we expect the Mexican
economy to come through very well.''
</P>
<P>
   Stocks here have dropped 14 percent since the beginning of the
year, and 22 percent in dollar terms, yet some of the worst Mexican
damage associated with the Asian crisis had been seen in plunging
oil prices due to slackening demand. About a third of government
revenue comes from Pemex, the state oil monopoly, and as petroleum
prices have fallen this year, the government has been forced to
make significant cuts in spending, carving $3.7 billion out of a
federal budget around $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Despite those cutbacks, the Mexican economy as a whole has
continued robust growth, at an annual rate of 6.6 percent in the
first quarter, the government says. Noting that strong domestic
consumption is driving the current boom, Ciemex-WEFA has predicted
growth of 5.6 percent for all of 1998. Even if the Asian crisis
were to worsen significantly, Beltran projects that the economy
would grow 4.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the news that Altos Hornos de Mexico, which controls
about a quarter of the $4.3 billion-a-year steel industry, was
embarking on major cost cutting fed the jitters here over the Asian
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican steel producers, which have already seen average prices
fall by 10 percent in recent months, fear that more drastic price
drops are on the horizon later this year. The company, in a
statement this week outlining its cost-cutting plan, predicted that
average steel prices would fall a further 13 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``The worst is not what's happened so far but what we expect to
happen soon,'' said Jose Antonio Gomez Urquiza, executive director
of the National Chamber of the Steel and Iron Industry. He said
that although prices averaged about $300 a ton last year, some
steel from South Korea, Russia and several other countries had
recently been sold in Mexico for as little as $200 a ton. ``And
we've seen some quotes that are even lower than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Some Mexican textile and chemical producers have also complained
in recent weeks of the appearance in this country of very
low-priced Asian imports. But so far, those industries have not
announced layoffs.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Mexican steel industry, which is dominated by five major
producers, has through much of this decade enjoyed considerable
prosperity, following the privatization of three state-owned
companies in 1990, including Altos Hornos de Mexico. The main
producers are operating on the basis of plans to invest $2 billion
in modernization in 1998 and 1999, and those plans so far have not
been scaled back, Gomez said.
</P>
<P>
   The investments are expected to raise Mexican steel production
capacity to 19 million tons from 15 million by the turn of the
century.
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian crisis has raised doubts for two reasons, said
Mauricio Reveco, a Latin American steel analyst with Solomon Smith
Barney. Worldwide demand for steel is dropping as Asian economies
retrench. And even as Mexico builds its own capacity, producers in
Asia, the former Soviet republics and the rest of Latin America are
reacting to the fall in their own countries' demand for steel by
attempting to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of a sudden, you have Asia becoming a steel exporter,
Latin America becoming an exporter, Eastern Europe becoming an
exporter,'' Reveco said. ``So where is all this steel going to
go?''
</P>
<P>
   The mounting surplus could affect Mexico more severely than the
other big Latin American producers, Brazil and Argentina, because
those countries are situated farther from the Asian producers,
making transportation costs higher and shielding them somewhat from
Asian imports.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our industry has enjoyed a very good period since the
privatizations in 1990, with a lot of investments in modernization
and good prices,'' said Miguel Elenes Inchaurregui, associate
editor of Acero Steel, a Mexican magazine that reports on the
industry. ``But now we fear that the cycle is going to move
downward. We expect a lot more jobs to be lost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican steel industry currently employs a total of 60,000
workers. Altos Hornos de Mexico alone had 19,000 workers at the end
of 1997, a spokesman, Luis Arias Ibarrondo, said.
</P>
<P>
   The 3,000 jobs the company said it would eliminate are the most
extensive employment cuts in the industry since the same company
cut 12,000 jobs in 1991. Although all Mexican steel producers will
be squeezed by the falling worldwide prices, Altos Hornos de Mexico
may be feeling the pain more acutely than other producers because
of its debt of around $1.8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales last year were $1.5 billion and are
projected to be $1.4 billion in 1998, Reveco said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the jobs will be lost at foundries at Monclova, a desert
city of 180,000 in the state of Coahuila, which borders Texas.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ The scene at 5 a.m. in the Miami International Airport
cargo area hasn't changed much over the years. Refrigerated trucks
with logos of companies like Atlantic Bouquet, CFX (``The Cut
Flower Experts'') and Continental Farms still rumble through the
security gates, back up to the loading docks and fill their
trailers with boxes of roses, lilies, chrysanthemums, baby's
breath, bird of paradise and dozens of other kinds of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make their way along Northwest 25th Street to the
swath of industrial parks five miles away that is the hub of
Miami's flower-distribution business. By 7 a.m., the flower
companies' sales reps are hitting the phones, scrambling to find
buyers for any inventory that hasn't already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all the hubbub, though, one thing is very different than
it once was _ and as a result, U.S. shoppers can expect to find a
lot more flowers in a lot more outlets before too long. Those
Atlantic Bouquet, CFX and Continental Farms trucks, as well as rigs
with a half-dozen other names splashed across their sides, now all
belong to a single company, USA Floral Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation craze that has swept through industry after
industry during the last few years _ from insurance and banking to
publishing and railroads _ has percolated down to an unlikely
corner of the U.S. marketplace: flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And leading the pack is USA Floral, which aspires to be the
undisputed giant of the $14 billion flower trade. In the last year,
it has snapped up 14 mom-and-pop distributors, wholesalers and
bouquet makers for a total cost of $152 million. It owns companies
in 22 states and Canada and says it will soon expand into Europe
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, USA Floral announced plans to purchase eight
more floral businesses around the country for $17.4 million in cash
and stock. Those include Channel Islands Floral, a bouquet maker in
California; Floramark, a Denver-based bouquet maker; and Evergreen
Wholesale Florist in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Few people will notice USA Floral's growing market presence
because it is letting the companies that it acquires keep their
names, largely because of the brand loyalty of many of their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But already, its revenues have shot up to a projected $561
million this year, from $184 million in 1997, the company says, and
it confidently predicts that sales will soar to $1 billion next
year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how big USA Floral wants to be, Robert Poirier, its
chairman and chief executive, responds with a question of his own:
``How big is the floral industry?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small part of floral consumption over all,'' he said.
``There is a tremendous amount of business that is left on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody _ least of all a lot of investors _ shares
Poirier's enthusiasm, however. The company went public last October
at $13 a share, and its stock surged to a peak of $23.875 in
February. But it has sunk since then, dropping as low as $15.375 in
mid-June before recovering a bit. Analysts blame a lack of investor
enthusiasm for consolidation companies. (It closed Monday at
$15.75.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the risks of the so-called roll-up strategy have
become evident, with analysts saying that some companies have grown
too quickly, failed to integrate operations, relied too much on a
few large customers and used large acquisitions to mask serious
operating problems.
</P>
<P>
   None of that fazes Poirier, who says the current price still
represents a premium from the $13 offering.
</P>
<P>
   Poirier, a 23-year veteran of the flower industry, is overseeing
USA Floral's expansion with the help of a pioneer in the relatively
new field of consolidating small, fragmented industries, Jonathan
Ledecky.
</P>
<P>
   Ledecky, who is the nonexecutive chairman of the company and its
largest shareholder with a stake of more than 8 percent, founded
U.S. Office Products Co. in 1995 and built it into a $2.8 billion
giant by buying hundreds of independent stationery stores and
furniture and office-product suppliers that were struggling to
survive against Office Depot and Staples. And last year, he formed
Consolidated Capital Corp. to string together businesses in
similarly dispersed industries.
</P>
<P>
   Poirier said he was following Ledecky's strategy of buying
high-quality companies at a modest premium and letting them
continue as independent operators with their old names and
suppliers intact. ``This is a video replay of U.S. Office
Products,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But the similarity may be what has jaded investors. And Poirier
is also quick to point out the ways in which his business model
differs from that of U.S. Office Products. His focus on buying only
floral companies and moving quickly to consolidate operations has
helped USA Floral escape some of the criticisms facing U.S. Office
Products these days. And one significant difference _ the use of
the purchase method of accounting versus pooling to record
acquisitions _ should keep federal regulators at bay. It may also
stave off steep stock price declines like those experienced by U.S.
Office Products, whose shares have plunged as much as 42 percent
since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   While some other flower companies are also growing, USA Floral
is a standout. Its most formidable competitor is probably Dole Food
Co., the $4.3 billion California conglomerate, whose flower sales
surged from nothing to $100 million this year when it bought the
largest wholesaler in Florida along with its production farms in
South America. (Such well-known companies as 1-800-Flowers or
Florists' Transworld Delivery Inc., known as FTD, are not direct
competitors because they are essentially marketing operations and
retail florist groups.)
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for USA Floral's upbeat outlook is the
enormous room that it sees for the growth of the entire flower
market, which is split almost evenly between the $6 billion
fresh-flower business and the $8 billion industry in potted plants
and vases. Only about 25 percent of Americans buy flowers
regularly, compared with 60 percent of Europeans, and USA Floral is
confident it can get the numbers up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is in a grocery store two to three times
a week,'' Poirier said. ``I'd like people to start thinking that if
they haven't got flowers, then there's something missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers are a diverse business. Imagine the stems of the
industry spreading throughout the nation, creating a wild
arrangement of largely family-owned businesses, including roughly
9,700 domestic growers, 1,000 wholesalers, 27,000 retail florists
and 23,000 supermarket floral operations. The industry has its tap
roots in Latin America, and the pot, so to speak, is centered
around the Miami airport, where approximately 100 importers handle
roughly 70 percent of all flowers consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   USA Floral isn't the only company with grand ambitions, of
course. Dole's purchases last month gave it a foothold in the
flower business, and it hopes that its presence in supermarket
produce departments will give it a marketing edge to increase the
revenues of its floral companies. (USA Floral does not own any
farms, but it has exclusive agreements with several farms it deals
with.)
</P>
<P>
   Several Miami companies are also forming alliances and
considering mergers in order to make sure they are big enough to
compete. And a smaller, Los Angeles-based public company, Sun Cut
Floral Network, was formed earlier this year after it was acquired
by a former medical technology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not certain where all of it is going, but the trend is
probably unstoppable at this point,'' said Alvaro Varela ,
president of Agriflora , a Miami importer. Varela said his company
had spurned a takeover bid from USA Floral because ``the group is
so big already we don't know where we would fit.'' Instead, he
said, Agriflora plans to merge with some other local distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Moran, the executive vice president and chief executive
officer of the Society of American Florists, said the flower
industry had long resisted the big-is-better mentality so prevalent
in other sectors of the economy. Previous efforts to forge national
floral empires have failed ``because the business is really driven
by relationships and outside people misjudge those relationships,''
he said. But things have changed. ``There's definitely a mania
going on,'' he said. ``Everybody's concerned that if they're not
part of a strategic relationship'' they will not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, meshing operations in the flower trade _ where
maintaining the freshness of one of the world's most perishable
products is the key and where ``keep it moving'' is the mantra _
won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of 24 hours, flowers are harvested on farms in
Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica; shipped to Miami; X-rayed as they
pass through 33-degree refrigerated coolers and then examined by
U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors, all under the watchful
eyes of security cameras; picked up by distributors; warehoused;
and finally put on trucks bound for florists', Stop &AMP; Shops,
Kroger's stores and Wal-Marts all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an industry that lends itself to cookie-cutter
production. At one Miami bouquet company owned by USA Floral, each
worker assembles a single bouquet. At another, women stand in front
of conveyor belts, dropping set numbers of particular flowers into
each passing bouquet. Neither company plans to change its
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USA Floral believes it can save money by consolidating
back-office operations like accounting, finance, insurance and
employee benefits. For example, it says, it recently cut costs by
more than $700,000 by combining the hazard insurance policies of 16
of its companies. It also saved almost $500,000 by channeling its
telephone business to a single long-distance company. And it plans
to fold its 10 Miami companies into six locations by year's end.
Task forces of executives from several of the companies are
exploring such other economy moves as adoption of a single computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes its heft will also allow it to distribute
more flowers at lower cost and save on transportation, flower
handling and storage. Poirer wants to create a string of regional
distributors in cities like Atlanta and Dallas to put flowers in
customers' hands more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, USA Floral hopes to do joint marketing and
merchandising with retailers. Today, the industry spends less than
$100 million a year on flower promotions, according to Moran of the
Society of American Florists. ``For a $14 billion industry, that's
not going to move the needle much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal is to make flowers so ubiquitous that
Americans _ who now mostly buy them on impulse or as infrequent
gifts _ will get into the habit of picking up bouquets once or
twice a week. To achieve that, the industry will have to reach
people like Mary Radford, a marketing executive in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When she lived in New York in the early 1990s, Ms. Radford
bought flowers all the time at a local corner grocery store, she
says. And she was an even more avid consumer when she lived in
Europe in the late 1980s. ``In Paris, flowers are all over the
place,'' she said. ``There are a lot of little florists' shops all
over the city, and they were cheap enough to justify the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But she hasn't bought a single bouquet since she moved to
Washington two years ago. ``I don't think about it,'' she said,
``because they're not in front of me all the time and I have the
perception that they are more expensive.''

THIS FRAZIER SHOW IS NOT MUST-SEE TV  
 LITTLE-LEAGUE SHOCKER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walt Frazier thesaurizes so pestiferously on New York
Knicks radio games that Peter Roget must wail lachrymosely in
lexicography heaven. Evidently, no producer has forcefully
persuaded Frazier that his silly wordplay hurts his credibility and
overwhelms the insight that his partisans say he possesses.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clyde will now analyze Knicks games on TV. Is this bumbling
and fumbling by the MSG Network? Moving and grooving without
pertinacity?
</P>
<P>
   ``We understand the skepticism,'' said MSG executive producer
Mike McCarthy, who characterizes Frazier as entertaining and
candid.
</P>
<P>
   By shifting Frazier away from WFAN, MSG can reunite Marv Albert,
rehired to call 50 games on radio, with John Andariese, his former
TV sidekick. (Gus Johnson will call the other 32 games on the radio
with Andariese.) On TV, Frazier will be back with Mike Breen, his
former radio mate, with whom Andariese worked last season.
</P>
<P>
   There is logic to reteaming Albert and Andariese, and elevating
Albert's comfort level. And Andariese does not view a return to
radio as a demotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone else had worked with Marv, I'd be jealous,'' he
said, adding that he sensed it was Albert's preference to work with
him.
</P>
<P>
   But Art Kaminsky, Albert's agent, said, ``Marv told them he'd be
pleased to work with whomever they wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, even if Albert and Andariese light up WFAN, losing
Andariese to radio diminishes the TV product. And who's to say
Frazier would not have improved beside Albert, whose ability to
mine the best from his partners is well known?
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy, hoping to capitalize on Frazier's strong points, seems
to be setting up a Clyde boot camp. ``He has a lot of adjustments
to make,'' McCarthy said. ``But he knows if this doesn't work out,
we can switch him in a heartbeat. He knows we won't be patient. If
he can't do this quickly, he'll go back.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy said past efforts to tame Frazier's shtick did not
compare to the new plan. ``This is going to be intense,'' he said.
Besides subduing his ``verbalizing,'' the biggest adjustment for
the former Knicks superstar will be in taking off ``the star
costume and become part of the reporting community,'' McCarthy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frazier would not have been made the Knicks' TV analyst if
another option MSG was believed to have pursued _ bringing in Doc
Rivers _ had worked out. But Rivers is committed to call games for
TNT and the San Antonio Spurs.
</P>
<P>
   So, on a tether as short as Mel Rojas' in the Mets' bullpen,
Frazier must prove that he's more than shtick, more than a lot of
``hooping and swooping.''
</P>
<P>
   Having made the switch, McCarthy said he is not planning a
flip-flop of the the newly reconstituted teams after the 1998-99
season, to put Albert and Andariese back on TV again.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not in contemplation at all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   SMALL PROBLEM: There is a chilling moment in ABC News' ``Peter
Jennings Reporting: The American Game'' (Thursday, 9:30-11 p.m.)
when a Little League father, outraged by his son's perceived
laziness, threatens him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeremy, listen to me,'' Chris McAfee says. ``I'm going to kick
you, I don't care, you didn't even want to bend down, Jeremy,
Jeremy, I'm on camera with a microphone, but I'm going to get you
tonight because you're letting me down, brother. ... I'll get you,
buddy. Cry about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Jennings documentary is not an expose of out-of-control
youth league parents, but a fly-on-the-dugout-wall look at two
months in the life of the Little League of Hagerstown, Md., from
May to July 1997.
</P>
<P>
   And what a terrific program, relating tales about the star
player; the only girl; the talented catcher with an awful attitude;
the successful coach who admits to being sexist; the mixed-race boy
who seeks an escape from racism by playing in the Little League,
and a look back at the 1959 integration of the town's Little
Leagues.
</P>
<P>
   But the scene with McAfee resonates. ``We were shocked,'' said
Marty Smith, the producer. McAfee then amplified his disciplinary
style in an interview with Jennings. ``I thought there'd be a
denial, and he'd waffle,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the scene's power almost offered a compelling rationale not
to show it.
</P>
<P>
   What about the impact on the youngster? ``It was an ongoing
concern,'' Smith said, ``but it's better for the community to know
what's going on. More likely than not, it has a restraining effect.
We told the league officials about what we heard. He was banned
this season, and his kid made the All-Star team.''
</P>
<P>
   AIRWAVES: The ABC crew at the U.S. 500 Sunday in Brooklyn,
Mich., did not know the extent of the injuries that resulted when a
wheel flew into the grandstand until the race ended, when Robin
Roberts, in New York, reported the three deaths and six injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Only one distant camera showed the carnage. ``If we had a more
graphic look, we probably wouldn't have shown it, out of decency,''
said Mark Mandel, an ABC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``Real Sports'' (Tuesday night at 10) excels in a piercing
report on state-sponsored use of anabolic steroids by East Germany
to boost athletes' performances in the 1970s and 1980s, and a
sensitive report on what some groups are doing to save thoroughbred
horses from slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's decision last week to shift Isiah Thomas from game
analysis to the ``NBA Showtime'' studio was absolutely right.
Thomas' insights as a player, union activist and team executive
were always best suited for studio work.

N.Y. STATE PROBES CORRUPTION IN BROADWAY TICKET SALES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The state attorney general's office is close to
wrapping up an investigation of what officials say are rampant
kickbacks and price-gouging practices involving the biggest
theaters on Broadway and the most powerful entertainment and sports
venues in the city, officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   One target is the Roundabout Theater, whose ``Cabaret,''
temporarily closed because of the construction accident in Times
Square, has become one of the most coveted tickets in years.
Roundabout general manager Ellen Richard said the theater has been
cooperating with the attorney general's office since it was asked
to turn over records.
</P>
<P>
   The Roundabout was named as a subject of the investigation
Monday in the Daily Variety.
</P>
<P>
   But David Corvette, a spokesman for the office of Attorney
General Dennis Vacco, said that similar requests for information
had been made to more than a dozen other theaters and entertainment
companies. He said the investigation goes far beyond the Roundabout
to what investigators believe is rampant corruption that is
inflating ticket prices for entertainment and sports events. The
investigation includes many of the most recognized names in the
theater and entertainment industry, Corvette said, but declined to
name them.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was greeted with skepticism by many people
involved in the theater and ticket industries, who said some degree
of price inflation for coveted tickets had always been a part of
the entertainment business. They added that campaigns against
ticket scalping or price gouging have long been popular ploys for
politicians in election years.
</P>
<P>
   The most common form of corruption is what is called ice, in
which box offices overcharge ticket brokers for tickets to choice
events, adding costs that are then passed along to consumers, many
of them out-of-towners intent on getting tickets to events that
sold out long ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think that ice is rampant in the industry, and that it's a
major reason people have to pay so much to go to Broadway or
concerts these days,'' Corvette said. The practices being
investigated would affect consumers who buy tickets through brokers
rather than those who buy them directly from a box office. But, he
said, the attorney general's office believed that the ingrained
price gouging over time had the effects of inflating ticket prices
across the board.
</P>
<P>
   Targets of the investigation, he said, include ``the most
prominent Broadway venues along with some of the most prominent
concert and entertainment venues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   He said the attorney general's office is taking depositions in
connection with its investigation and is preparing to file lawsuits
or take other legal steps. The department's investigation should be
completed ``within the next couple of months,'' Corvette said.
</P>
<P>
   One official of a company that deals in theater tickets also
argued that ice, ticket scalping or other practices had long been
part of the entertainment business. He said the investigation had
more to do with politics than with lower prices. Vacco, a
Republican, is running for re-election in November.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no doubt ice exists,'' said the official who spoke on
condition of anonymity. ``It does exist, it always has existed and
it always will exist. But I think you have about as much chance of
stomping it out as you have of outlawing prostitution. We see these
kind of investigations all the time, particularly in election
years, but I don't think it's likely to change anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Richard of the Roundabout said, ``I have no knowledge of
anything happening here, but if someone in our box office is
selling tickets, I would really like to find out about it and see
them prosecuted. We're a not-for-profit theater. Someone making
money off our tickets is offensive to me.''
</P>
<P>
   But an official with the attorney general's office said the
abuse being investigated at the Roundabout appeared to be more the
theater's common practice of selling tickets to brokers at prices
above those allowed by law _ meaning not more than $5 or 10 percent
above the ticket price _ rather than the actions of one rogue
individual.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office said it believed that the practice
is endemic in the entertainment industry, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office has taken action in other
investigations related to ticket pricing. Joseph Nekola, the former
manager of the Jones Beach Theater, pleaded guilty in June to
second-degree grand larceny and third-degree computer tampering in
the theft of more than 8,000 tickets for the theater's 1996 summer
concert series. In April, Janet Rosenblatt and Gerald Nahay, owners
of the Manhattan theater company Tickets on Request, were charged
with selling tickets to sports events and concerts at rates as high
as 830 percent above the face value on the tickets.
</P>
<P>
   The office has also sought information from concertgoers about
where they got their tickets and how much they paid.
</P>
<P>
   No action has been taken against any of the big-name
entertainment companies and theaters said to be the subject of the
current inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Corvette denied that the two-year-old investigation had more to
do with publicity than law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because this sort of thing has gone on for years does not
make it right or justify the impact it has on the exorbitant prices
for tickets that consumers have to pay,'' he said. ``If we can put
a dent in that, we've accomplished something.''

IN DIVING, AMERICANS ARE MAKING A COMEBACK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif.)  (lb) 
 By FRANK LITSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST MEADOW, N.Y. _ Until the 1980s, the world's best divers
usually came from the United States and its college and club
systems. Then the Chinese discovered and developed the sport, the
Russians made a resurgence, the great American champion Greg
Louganis retired and American diving struggled.
</P>
<P>
   Now the Americans seem to be making a small comeback, although
when the Goodwill Games diving competition ended Monday night,
China and Russia had won the most medals. After eight of the 10
events, China had 10 medals (four gold), Russia six (three gold),
the United States three (one gold) and the rest of the world five.
</P>
<P>
   The best diver here was Dmitri Sautin, a Russian who won the
men's 3-meter springboard on Sunday and was favored off the
10-meter platform Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But the Americans made a strong impression Sunday night when
20-year-old Laura Wilkinson, a University of Texas junior from
Houston, won the women's platform title. Wilkinson had won seven
U.S. championships, but never a big international competition. And
this one was big. The field included the world champion (Olena
Zhupina of Ukraine) and runner-up (Cai Yuyan of China).
</P>
<P>
   Here, every contender except Wilkinson made at least one major
error _ an overrotation here, an underrotation there, a failure to
keep the knees straight or the legs together. Wilkinson made no big
mistakes. And when she needed a solid last dive to overtake Cai,
she made it, a back 1{ somersault with 2{ twists, that drew scores
of 8.0 from all seven judges.
</P>
<P>
   Starting the ninth and last round, Wilkinson trailed Cai. Then
Cai, only 16 but more experienced than Wilkinson, barely finished a
3{ somersault pike. The door was open for Wilkinson, who dived
next. She said her nervousness disappeared, and she nailed her
dive. But she said that for her and for the American team, this was
only one competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to keep working on everything,'' she said. ``And since
the other teams are so good, we've had to work twice as hard to be
able to compete with them. I think we're making progress. I don't
know if it was U.S. diving slipping so much as the Chinese and
Russians getting better.''
</P>
<P>
   Li Hongping of Mission Viejo, Calif., a former Chinese champion
and one of the three coaches of this American team, was cheered by
Wilkinson's victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very significant,'' he said, ``because it shows our
divers are as competent as anyone else. This builds confidence in
her and in the whole diving program in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult to compete with someone who is training
more, like the Chinese and the Russians. We have to be mentally
tougher than anyone and have a more positive attitude. I'm seeing
that. It happened with Laura, and that's why she won a gold medal,
so this is a very good step.''

CONGRESS PAYS TRIBUTE TO SLAIN OFFICERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Monday opened an emotional, two-day
tribute to the police officers slain while trying to protect
lawmakers, their staffs and the public from a deranged shooter who
unleashed his violence in the marbled hallways of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate passed resolutions honoring
Capitol Police Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut
as heroes of the bloody Friday afternoon shootout with Russell
Weston Jr., who was charged in federal court Monday with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who was shot at point-blank range by Gibson, remains in
serious condition at a local hospital. He has been charged with the
murder of one of the federal officers, but other federal charges
are pending against him and he could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave its approval for an extraordinary memorial service
to be held at 3 p.m., EDT, Tuesday in the Capitol Rotunda, where
the two 18-year veterans will lie in state as President Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and others pay homage to their sacrifice.
</P>
<P>
   Such services are usually reserved for presidents or members of
Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said it
was only fitting that the two men who paid the ultimate price while
performing their duties be honored under the center dome of the
building where they worked every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, amid those grand statues of heroes past, we will
honor two of our own to whom heroism was simple duty,'' Lott said
during a Senate tribute to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those two ... this open Capitol, with wide-eyed kids
learning their nation's history, with strangers from abroad awed by
its grandeur, with Americans of all creeds and races and regions
celebrating their common faith in God and in one another, this
Capitol itself will be their enduring monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott called the violence that unfolded Friday afternoon ``a
tragedy for the nation.'' But for the people who work on Capitol
Hill, he likened it to ``a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress prepared for its special tribute Tuesday, flags
continued to fly at half-staff over federal buildings, and tourists
and members brought more flowers to the east steps of the Capitol
in honor not only of Chestnut and Gibson, but of law enforcement
personnel all across the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who serve and protect, we owe you our gratitude,''
read one card.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., also honored all the
Capitol Police in his remarks during a House tribute. ``We
sometimes take them for granted,'' he said. ``They're the salt of
the Earth. They're the reason our democracy can live.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., to attend a forum on Social Security,
Clinton also paid his respects again by asking the crowd to join in
a moment of silent prayer for the two officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke with Chestnut's widow by phone Sunday. He
called Gibson's wife from New Mexico on Monday to offer condolences
and to tell her that the Army had cleared the way for her husband
to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Although speeches and tributes to Chestnut and Gibson dominated
congressional proceedings Monday, the Senate did return to
legislative business for part of the afternoon session. On the
House side, however, the chamber remained in recess through much of
the afternoon until a formal tribute in the evening was convened.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several resolutions honoring their memories and
service, the House and Senate also authorized the federal
government to pay the costs of the officers' funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, 58, was an 18-year veteran of the Capitol Police force
and a 20-year veteran of the Air Force. He will be buried Friday at
Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be Thursday for Gibson, 42, also an 18-year police
veteran. Police officials said discussions were under way about the
possibility of burying the two officers together.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was assigned to guard House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, and is credited with firing the shots that downed Weston
while taking fire himself. DeLay said Gibson's actions prevented
Weston from shooting anyone else after he ran into DeLay's suite of
offices. Weston had shot Chestnut after rushing through a ground
floor entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I went everywhere together,'' DeLay said during a
House tribute. ``He knew that someday it was likely that he'd have
to throw his body in front of me or my staff,'' DeLay continued,
his voice cracking with emotion. ``You never think it's going to
happen. But it happened on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston was still being treated at a Washington hospital Monday
for gunshot wounds to the chest, arm and leg. His condition has
improved enough that doctors said they believe he will be able to
stand trial. But federal authorities in Washington, and in Montana
and Illinois where Gibson has lived, acknowledged that he has a
history of mental illness, a fact that could be used to prevent a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Weston is being represented for the moment by Washington lawyer
A.J. Kramer, who was appointed by the court. Kramer told reporters
that he spoke with his client Monday morning. He said Weston was
``not in good shape'' physically, but he refused to comment on his
mental condition.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's father, meanwhile, apologized again Monday for his
son's actions, and blamed himself for getting angry after his son
shot 14 cats last week at their home in Valmeyer, Ill. Weston said
he ordered his 41-year-old son to leave. The younger man jumped
into a pickup and then apparently drove straight to Washington
carrying with him a pistol owned by his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel so bad about it,'' Russell Weston Sr. said in
interviews with several television networks. ``I feel so bad for
the people that he killed. I apologize to the nation.''

THIS BO KNOWS GLORY DAYS ARE BEHIND HIM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE STEVENS  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bo Kimble isn't a star. He has lost a step and is past his
prime. The player known for his deadly jump shot does not average
35 points per night, as he did in college. Now, Kimble is just
happy to get on the court and play with the young bucks.
</P>
<P>
   He admits that.
</P>
<P>
   And that honesty with himself is what makes Kimble special at
age 31. Unlike aging hoopsters who cling to their highlighted
pasts, he accepts his present situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not going to make it back to the NBA,'' he said.
``I've stopped holding my breath on that one. At this point, I'm
playing because that's what I love to do. It's not about money. I
want to play as long as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks, Kimble has been one of the oldest
players in the Fila Summer Pro League at The Pyramid. He led his
team in scoring, but had obvious differences from his teammates.
While most of the players in the league are embarking on
professional careers, Kimble has been out of the NBA for four
years, a longer time than he spent in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   His place in basketball now contrasts his place in 1990, when
the Clippers made him the eighth selection in the draft. In the
1989-90 college season, the senior shooting guard from Loyola
Marymount led the nation in scoring, averaging 35.3 points per
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the NBA, he played in 96 games in two seasons with the
Clippers. After they released him in 1992, he had a stint with the
New York Knicks. Since then, he has played in France, Portugal,
Taiwan and on the Harlem Globetrotters, among other teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, he played for the Continental Basketball
Association's Yakima Sun Kings and made $1,200 per week. This
upcoming season, he expects to play overseas.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of small towns in the CBA, so the fan support is
really good,'' Kimble said. ``You can have a really good image at
home to them.''
</P>
<P>
   His image used to be that good in Los Angeles, when he played at
LMU. Kimble and teammate Hank Gathers helped bring LMU's program
out of obscurity. In their junior and senior seasons, LMU took its
run-and-gun style to the NCAA Tournament, attracting a great deal
of attention.
</P>
<P>
   But in their senior season, in the WCAC championship, the
unthinkable happened, stunning Kimble and LMU.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers collapsed during the game and died.
</P>
<P>
   The death affected college basketball in general. Kimble was
forced to reevaluate his priorities. Today, the incident still is
with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm talking about him every day,'' Kimble said. ``There's just
always some reminder I see every day of him. When I think of Hank,
I only think of the great things. It's similar to being in denial
... Hank could be a little selfish, a little self-centered. He was
used to getting his way. When I think of him, I never think of that
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While he does not forget Gathers, Kimble is now having fun
again. His teammates at the summer league acknowledged that and
respect his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's aggressive that's the best thing about his game,'' said
Marlon Garnett, 23, who played last season in Turkey. ``To be a
great shooter, you have to be aggressive, to shoot it when you
should ... He's a little older and maybe lost a step. But he's
still a legend.''
</P>
<P>
   Danny Prince, 24, who graduated from UC Santa Barbara in 1996,
pointed out something else. ``He may be getting on in age,'' Prince
said. ``But he's got it. You can see guys who are 30, 31 or 32 out
here who don't sprint, have no degree, no IRA, and are throwing up
air balls. He's not like those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimble said he plans to play ``until he can't move.'' Living in
Los Angeles, he is embarking on a new endeavor. He is opening
Jamaican restaurants in Philadelphia and Baltimore. And after
basketball, he has a plan, albeit vague.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to go into broadcasting, acting, promoting clubs or
the restaurant business,'' he said. ``You know, I'd like to stick
with the fun stuff.''

STOCKS BUOYED BY AMEX EARNINGS DATA; DOW UP 90.88 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SHARON R. KING   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An earnings report that was stronger than expected
lifted stocks out of the doldrums Monday as most major market
indexes closed higher.
</P>
<P>
   But many analysts were not impressed by the rally, which pushed
the Dow Jones industrial average up 1.02 percent. And the gains in
the stock market did little to mask a growing bearish sentiment on
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   After gaining just 4.38 points Friday, the Dow Jones industrial
average roared back past 9,000 Monday, rising 90.88 points, to
9,028.24. The rebound, led by strong gains in American Express came
after the Dow fell more than 400 points last week.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks began gaining ground after American Express reported
second-quarter earnings that topped analysts' forecasts, helped by
heavy increases in the use of its charge cards and sales of mutual
fund shares.
</P>
<P>
   American Express closed at 112 13/16, up 5} points, or 5.4
percent, contributing nearly 24 points to the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 6.47 points, to 1,147.27.
And the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index gained 2.27 points,
to 1,933.26. Microsoft, Ericsson and Intel were among the leading
gainers.
</P>
<P>
   Small company shares, however, continued to falter Monday. The
Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks fell 5.42 points, or
1.24 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts expressed concerns about the limited breadth of the
rally, where gains were concentrated among a small group of large
companies. And some cautioned that things could get worse for
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predictably, after the big drop we had investors went back
into the same big names,'' said Larry Rice, chief investment
officer at Josephthal &AMP; Co. ``The correction wasn't deep enough,
and the rally wasn't strong enough'' to be sustained, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley Dean
Witter, warned investors Monday that ``we may have entered a
cyclical bear market in the U.S. which could see the market go down
20 percent to 30 percent over a period of months or quarters.''
</P>
<P>
   And he cited Asia's financial crisis as a factor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Asian economies are much worse than most people recognize,
and they should continue to deteriorate,'' Biggs wrote. In
addition, ``Japan's election of Keizo Obuchi appears to be a
negative development for Japan, Asia, and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggs advised clients to reduce holdings of stocks because of
Asia's woes. He recommended investors put 12 percent of their
portfolio in large-capitalization U.S. stocks and 13 percent in
large-cap European stocks, down from 13 percent and 14 percent,
respectively. Investors should shift the money into cash or
short-term securities, he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Asian stock markers were lower Monday, as investors in the
region expressed concern that Japan's incoming prime minister,
Obuchi, would not take quick action to spur growth in the Japanese
economy, which is still seen as a vital engine for the Pacific
Rim's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index fell 2.55 percent to a
one-month low. Stock markets in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand
fell 2 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, commodity prices were weaker, as investor expressed
similar concerns about Japan's fiscal health.
</P>
<P>
   Copper fell more than 1 percent, backing away from its highest
price in more than two months, amid expectations that Japan's new
government will not revive the economy of the world's
second-largest copper consumer. Rising supplies, at a time of weak
demand in Asia, also hurt copper prices Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the market's sold off in the past it has always been a
good time to buy stocks,'' said Richard Cripps, chief market
strategist at Legg Mason Inc. in Baltimore.
</P>
<P>
   But ``earnings numbers are coming down,'' he said. ``There's no
major driver to move equity prices higher.''

CRESSE STILL HURT BY DODGERS' DECISION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After the reeling Los Angeles Dodgers had scored an extra-inning
victory over the Anaheim Angels on June 25 at Dodger Stadium, Mark
Cresse came across Reggie Smith in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm gone,'' the Dodgers' batting coach told the
Dodgers' bullpen coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time, I remember thinking to myself, ``I just can't
believe they would fire someone the caliber of Reggie Smith,'''
relates Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   A moment later, the Dodgers' new manager, Glenn Hoffman, told
Cresse, ``Before you shower, I need to talk to you in my office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My heart sank to my knees right then,'' says Cresse. ``I knew
right then it was going to be my turn to get the bad news. I walked
into Hoffman's office, and there were Charlie Blaney (Dodgers'
director of minor league operations), Ralph Avila (Dodger scout),
Tom Lasorda and Hoffman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat in a chair in the middle of the room. Hoffman said,
`Mark, we need to make some changes to get this team turned
around.' My head dropped, and I guess I looked pretty agonized. I
was in total shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I finally looked up, I saw Tom Lasorda smiling. `Beach
(Cresse's nickname), relax, we're not firing you,' he said. `We
want you to manage our San Bernadino team.' Tommy just kept
smiling, as though all my prayers had just been answered.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might have thought going to San Bernardino would be a great
move for me, but I didn't. I felt about as low as a human being can
feel. I had given 25 years of sweat, blood, tears, and hard work to
the Dodger organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never said no to anyone. When the community affairs people
needed someone to make an appearance, I always made myself
available. I was a problem-solver for every department's dilemma.
I've always felt that if you give 100 percent at your job, work as
hard as you can and keep your nose clean, you'll never be let go.
But I was wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a month now since Mark Cresse stopped
drawing a paycheck from an organization he had joined in 1974 and
had served for the past 22 seasons as its bullpen coach, the
longest tenure of any coach in Dodger history.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a month now since Mark Cresse was told his
well-regarded services coordinating the Dodgers' pre-game drills
and bullpen activities no longer were needed by the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   It has been more than a month now since Mark Cresse heard those
unwanted words from Glenn Hoffman that would dramatically change
his life.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cresse insists he's not bitter, doesn't despise Glenn
Hoffman or Tom Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Glenn did what he felt was best for the team, and I can live
with that,'' Cresse says. ``Actually, I agree with Tom Lasorda's
decision to give Glenn the power to pick his own coaches. Such
authority might not have been good for Mark Cresse, but I think the
manager should be able to bring in the coaches he wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Mark Cresse admits he remains in a state of shock.
</P>
<P>
   ``There had been some rumors going around before the coaching
firings, and a lot of us were on edge,'' says Cresse. ``Joey
Amalfitano (Dodgers' third base coach) had gone through things like
this as a coach with the Chicago Cubs and Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   ``But when the Dodgers made the changes in their manager and
general manager, I thought to myself, `Wow, I guess I'm lucky. I'm
gonna be safe.' After all, I've always been Tommy's right-hand man.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I first saw Tommy after he became the GM, he put his arm
around me and we hugged. He asked me a few things about the team,
and I told him. I thought everything was cool. But I guess it
wasn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Befitting a workaholic, Mark Cresse still has remained busy even
though he's no longer pitching batting practice, hitting fungoes,
or typing up scouting reports on a daily basis for the Dodgers
pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   He now spends his days alternating among the four sites
Huntington Beach, Aliso Viejo, Irvine and Villa Park of the
baseball schools that bear his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I've gone from holding two full-time jobs to
holding just one,'' he says. ``But I'm still putting in 12 hour
days. The kids ask me all the time what happened to me with the
Dodgers. I don't sugarcoat anything to them. I just tell them the
truth. I just tell them I got fired.''
</P>
<P>
   Why was a man who was celebrated for his extraordinary work
ethic fired by the Dodgers?
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have no idea,'' says Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   Had he been on bad terms with Glenn Hoffman?
</P>
<P>
   ``Not at all,'' says Cresse. ``We worked together in recent
years during the winter workouts at Dodger Stadium. He'd be in
charge of the minor leaguers, and I'd be in charge of the major
leaguers. We got along fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Had he sided with Fred Claire against Tom Lasorda?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, ever got involved in office politics,'' says Cresse.
</P>
<P>
   What Mark Cresse finds even more bizarre about his ouster is
that no one has replaced him in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really floors me is that I got replaced by a guy (John
Shelby) who sits in the dugout and positions the outfielders
defensively,'' says Cresse. ``I still think what I did in the
bullpen was important. But I guess some people see it
differently.''
</P>
<P>
   Cresse quickly declined the Dodgers' San Bernadino offer.
</P>
<P>
   ``A minor league manager busts his hump for years to be a major
league coach,'' says Cresse. ``I've already been a major league
coach for 22 years. I think I've proved that I can do the job. And
I also felt that if an organization didn't think I was good enough
to work for it at one level, then why would I want to work for it
at another level?''
</P>
<P>
   Cresse and his wife Jean Ann, long-time residents of College
Park East in Seal Beach, are planning to relocate near Palm
Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just put in a offer for a home in La Quinta,'' says Cresse,
whose son, Brad now touring Italy with a U.S. National team hit 29
home runs the past season at LSU. ``You can say the Cresses are now
down-sizing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Cresse already has been contacted by two big league teams,
and hopes to be back in the majors by next summer.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, he stays busy with his baseball school, which
had a clinic at Dodger Stadium on July 14 before the Dodgers game
with the San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``We bussed about 300 kids up to the stadium, and they spent the
afternoon listening to people like Mickey Hatcher and Mike Scioscia
and Joey Amalfitano talk about baseball,'' says Cresse. ``Tom
Lasorda also spoke to them.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the first time Mark Cresse had returned to Dodger
Stadium since he had been shown the door, and he admits it felt
strange.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still watch all the Dodger games I can on television,'' says
Cresse. ``I still have a lot of friends on that team I root for.
But I'm still crushed and hurt by what happened to me. I think
people usually get fired for good reasons. I still wish I knew why
I was fired.''

ADVERTISING: WOLF GROUP ACQUIRES SHOP AFTER SHOP TO MEET TWIN
GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Toronto, Ohio, N.C., N.Y.)   (bl)  
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who is Larry Wolf, to paraphrase the title of a
rather obscure Dustin Hoffman movie from 1971, and why is Madison
Avenue saying all those things about him?
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is the soft-spoken, low-key chairman and chief executive of
Wolf Group Integrated Communications Ltd., a privately held agency
company based in Toronto that has been growing rapidly through a
skein of ambitious acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   The American-born Wolf _ described by The Toronto Globe &AMP; Mail
as perhaps ``the most successful unknown advertising man in
Canada'' _ has been snapping up shops on both sides of the border
with the twin goals of becoming a top-20 agency company in billings
and going public.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd like to leave behind is another great agency brand,''
Wolf, 58, said in an interview during a recent visit to the midtown
Manhattan office of Partners &AMP; Shevack, a midsized shop gobbled up
by Wolf Group last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's so exciting about being in marketing communications
today is the incredible fluidity and volatility,'' he added.
``We're looking at a lot of opportunities in various stages,''
including a potential acquisition on the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase of Partners &AMP; Shevack more than doubled Wolf
Group's billings to $400 million-plus from $177.3 million in 1997.
Wolf said he wanted to more than double billings again, reaching $1
billion ``in two or three years.''
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of Wolf Group is emblematic of a subtheme in
the consolidation trend that is remaking the agency industry: the
rise of holding companies smaller than such giants as Omnicom
Group, WPP Group PLC and the Interpublic Group of Companies. The
second-tier tiny titans include, in addition to Wolf Group, Snyder
Communications, which acquired Arnold Communications and Barry Blau
&AMP; Partners, and CKS Group, which acquired McKinney &AMP; Silver and
Site Specific Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had not heard of Wolf Group, I'll be honest with you, and
I'm an advertising junkie,'' said Brett Shevack, chief executive at
Partners &AMP; Shevack. He joined Wolf and Bob Barocci, chief operating
officer at Wolf Group, for the interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``But being acquired by Wolf,'' Shevack said, ``gives us the
opportunity to get in the ground floor of something very dynamic,
to become part of an engine for growth with great firepower.''
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition of Partners &AMP; Shevack gave Wolf Group its first
outpost in downstate New York after serving the upstate region
through offices in Buffalo and Rochester. Others offices are in
Cleveland and Toronto, with service offices in Columbus, Ohio, and
Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolf Group client roster includes such familiar names as
Aamco Transmissions, Alberto-Culver Co., Canandaigua Wine Co.,
Continental General Tire, Eastman Kodak Co., the Fisher-Price unit
of Mattel Inc., Haagen-Dazs Co. unit of Diageo PLC, Pfizer Inc. and
Smith Corona Corp.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The best-known work from Wolf Group may be the series of
commercials created by the Cleveland office, formerly known as
Meldrum &AMP; Fewsmith Communications, that used special effects to
depict Fred Astaire dancing with the Dirt Devil line of vacuums
made by Royal Appliance Manufacturing Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope to expand and develop our ability to serve our clients
in even more depth than now,'' Wolf said, adding that being based
in Canada was a benefit because ``we're so spread out
geographically with a small population that you have to learn how
to do a lot more with a lot less.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And while niche marketing makes a great deal of sense in the
States,'' he added, ``there you can niche yourself down to
negligibility. That demands a holistic, integrated marketing
approach in which advertising is just one way to win customers and
keep business, in tandem with public relations, loyalty programs,
direct marketing, package design and Web sites.''
</P>
<P>
   Barocci, who jokingly described himself as ``the silent
partner'' because of his judicious participation in the interview,
said that a strength of Wolf Group was its structure ``as a law
firm with managing partners, key people like Brett spending the day
looking at every possible way to build a client's brands, not on a
plane to Beijing to visit an office there.''
</P>
<P>
   He and Wolf said they were concentrating their buyout efforts
among entrepreneurial agency principals who want to remain active
in advertising rather than cash out.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not interested in retirement planning as the primary
objective or our new partners,'' Wolf said. ``We want people
excited about building something with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Can Wolf Group thrive in a shrinking ad world, or will the
acquirer someday become the acquired?
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is not whether Wolf Group is the size of Omnicom
or Interpublic,'' Barocci said, ``but whether our resources can
help clients grow their business.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said: ``The point of purchase is the moment of truth when
you make or lose the sale. What happens at that moment is critical.
And the consumer doesn't know how big your agency is.''

 &HT;    Campsites, old mines being checked in search for Rudolph
 &HT;    By Kathy Scruggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANDREWS, N.C._ As the search for Birmingham bombing suspect Eric
Robert Rudolph dragged on in the soggy Western North Carolina
mountains, lab techinicians are analyzing old canned goods and
other evidence removed from caves and campsites, but have yet to
link them to the fugtive, a federal official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that looks llike a campsite or garbage we would
recover that and take it to the lab and process it,'' said Jack
Killorin, head of the Atlanta officie of the U.S. Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. ``We don't have any positive results
on any of that testing.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI on Monday appealed for the help of anyone with knowledge
of old caves and mines in the area and reiterated their commitment
to solving the two-year-old Centennial Olympic Park bombing.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Enderson, inspector in charge of the Southeast Bomb Task
Force, urged Rudolph to turn himself in during a Monday press
briefing so ``he can tell his side of the story.''
</P>
<P>
   Enderson said they are sending up additional helicopters and
airplanes to support the 200 federal, state and local agents
slogging through the rugged terrain three weeks after the fugitive
resurfaced at the home of an elderly health food store owner.
Rudolph later took a pickup truck and six-months worth of food and
other supplies from 71-year-old George Nordmann.
</P>
<P>
   Nordmann, who first talked with the 31-year-old carpenter on
July 7, waited until July 11 to report the encounter. His truck was
found July 13 and at the time federal agents figured they were
closing in on their suspect, with only 15 hours separting them.
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph has continued to elude the reinvigorated manhunt, as
agents methodically search a 30-square-mile area by grids in the
Nantahala Forest in Macon County, N.C. Their search has taken them
into old silver mines in neighboring Swain County, just over a
mountain ridge from Rudolph's family's old homeplace.
</P>
<P>
   But experts on caves and mines in western North Carolina said
there are virtually no long-term, subterranean hiding places for
Rudolph near Nantahala. Steve Maynard, who has gone caving around
the Nantahala Gorge, said the caves in that part of the state end
after a few hundred feet. ``In the Nantahala Gorge, there are small
caves,'' Maynard said. ``But there are no networks. It's not like
you'd find in Tennessee or Kentucky. There are caves in Kentucky
where you can go for hundreds of miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Maynard said the caves he has explored are damp, and often
there's just room to crawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be a comfortable place to be for a long time,''
Maynard said. ``You come out cold and chilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all the mining done in western North Carolina occurs at
the surface for crushed stone and granite, said Fred Allen,
executive director for the North Carolina Aggregates Association, a
mining lobbyist group. There once were underground mines as
prospectors searched for gold, silver, mica and other minerals, but
those are few and were dug a ``long, long, long time ago.''

GREENS HOPE FOR PLACE IN THE SUN WHEN GERMANS VOTE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ When Germans choose a chancellor in September, Joschka
Fischer will not be even close to winning the job. But that does
not mean he'll be unhappy.
</P>
<P>
   What counts for Fischer, the head of the environmentalist Green
Party, are the votes that could make his party a kingmaker and give
it a place in a Cabinet led by a bigger party. All he needs to
achieve that is to ensure that the Greens _ now in opposition _
make no colossal blunders.
</P>
<P>
   And therein lies the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that we will be in the government'' after the
Sept. 27 vote, Fischer, 50, said in a recent interview in the
coffee shop of parliament in Bonn. Then he paused for only the
briefest of seconds before adding, ``Unless we make a big
mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent months the party has seemed to specialize in big
mistakes, particularly those relating to what most Germans hold as
a cherished right to drive very fast, consume corresponding amounts
of gasoline and take vacations in fuel-guzzling jet planes.
</P>
<P>
   Some Greens have demanded curbs on such activities. As a result,
opinion surveys have shown the party dipping and rising erratically
above and below the point of disaster.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond the party's seesawing fortunes, the performance of
the Greens in the election _ Germany's most important in decades _
highlights a quirk of the political system that gives small parties
like Fischer's disproportionate influence in the forming of
coalitions.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of this system is the magic number of 5 per cent.
To win a full place in parliament with the right to form a caucus
and head committees, political parties must win at least 5 percent
of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   As Germany heads for what is being depicted as the end of
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 16-year era, the rule is held as dearly as
it was when it was devised in the aftermath of World War II to
forge consensus politics in a land whose Nazi extremism had just
devastated Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the United States, consensus is embedded in society, like a
skeleton,'' Fischer said. ``In Germany it's like the carapace of a
lobster: consensus is the outer shell.''
</P>
<P>
   In practical terms, the system means that neither Kohl's
Christian Democrats nor the main opposition party, the Social
Democrats led by Gerhard Schroeder, can assume that they will
govern alone in the same way as the Republicans or the Democrats in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian Democrats currently govern with the small Free
Democrats. The Social Democrats lean toward a coalition with
Fischer's Greens _ in German political parlance, a Red-Green
coalition.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-election banter depicts Kohl as a spent force and
Schroeder as the essence of German renewal. In a recent opinion
survey among 602 members of the business and political elite, 70
percent said they believed that Schroeder would win the election,
even though 59 percent said they preferred Kohl.
</P>
<P>
   And even though Schroeder consistently tops the opinion surveys
as the most popular single politician in Germany, the system
presses him toward a coalition with the very party _ the Greens _
whose support for the conservation and even the taxation of energy
are proving increasingly irritating to him.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, his criticism has inspired one Green Party member, Heide
Ruehle, to accuse Schroeder of torpedoing the Greens' electoral
chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``As before, on the evening of Sept. 27 every option is
imaginable,'' said the newsmagazine Der Spiegel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In some ways, the election relates not so much to the titans as
to the minions: the Greens, the Free Democrats and the former
Communists, now the Party of Democratic Socialism.
</P>
<P>
   The former Communists are in the current parliament under a
separate rule permitting representation _ without the right to form
a caucus _ for small parties that win overwhelming majorities in at
least three constituencies, even though they slip below the 5
percent hurdle nationally.
</P>
<P>
   If the Greens or the Free Democrats dip below the 5 percent
barrier, the big parties with with they are associated will suffer.
If the Party of Democratic Socialism improves its showing outside
eastern Germany _ where it is expected to win a fifth of the vote,
compared with close to zero in the west _ that, too, will upset the
arithmetic of power in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every vote for the PDS is a vote taken away from the Red-Green
coalition,'' Fischer said. If there is one source of hope for him,
though, it lies in the sense that whether Schroeder wins the
election or not, Kohl will lose it because he has been in power for
so long. ``People have had enough of Kohl,'' Fischer said.

LANDANO IS ACQUITTED IN 2ND TRIAL FOR 1976 MURDER OF POLICE
OFFICER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERSEY CITY, N.J. _ Vincent Landano, who paid dearly for a crime
he steadfastly denied committing for 22 years, won the battle of
his life on Monday when a jury here acquitted him in his second
trial for the 1976 murder of a Newark, N.J., police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Landano had served 13 years of a life sentence for the killing,
was freed after a judge ruled the state had suppressed evidence at
the first trial, and lived for nine more years under constant
law-enforcement surveillance as prosecutors continued to pursue
him.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, he taught himself law and attracted a loyal
following of people who believed that he was framed for the murder
of Officer John Snow. Among them were a lawyer who devoted
thousands of hours to Landano's case for free and a sprightly woman
who met him on a visit to prison and married him.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I ever asked was for 12 jurors to listen to the facts,''
said Landano after the verdict, as he stood on the courthouse steps
amid a crowd of jubilant supporters _ including one woman who had
served on the jury that initially convicted him and said she had
regretted it ever since.
</P>
<P>
   The conclusion of Landano's long roller coaster ride through the
justice system passed swiftly in comparison with his fight for
vindication. The trial in Superior Court lasted three weeks. The
jury of 10 women and two men deliberated just under five hours.
When the forewoman softly pronounced the words ``not guilty,'' the
graying 58-year-old Landano thrust his fists in the air and
shouted, ``All right!''
</P>
<P>
   An instant later, the trial judge, Shirley Tolentino, told him
he was free to go.
</P>
<P>
   Landano did not tarry. With his arms wrapped around his wife,
Camille, he proclaimed his first worry-free plan. ``Right now,'' he
said, grinning, ``all I want to do is get as far from this building
as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Gardner, an assistant Hudson County prosecutor, said the
Snow murder will not be pursued further. ``This matter, for all
intents and purposes, is closed,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said he accomplished what he set out to do. ``We reached a
verdict which brings closure to this case,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It did not bring closure to the family of the murdered Snow,
whose daughter broke down and wept in the courtroom as the verdict
was announced. She had said she remains convinced that Landano is
her father's killer.
</P>
<P>
   Landano was an unemployed construction worker with a heroin
habit and a three-year stint at Attica State Prison in New York for
grand larceny, when he was charged with shooting Snow in the neck
during a robbery of the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service in Kearny,
N.J., on Aug. 13, 1976.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of his arrest, two other men were already in
custody, both members of a motorcycle gang called ``The Breed''
that specialized in armed robberies. They cooperated with the
state, naming Landano not only as their accomplice in the heist but
as the gunman. Snow, who was on duty at the time, was in Kearny
unofficially to deliver $46,000 in cash to the Hi-Way management.
</P>
<P>
   From the first, Landano protested his innocence. He said he had
been set up by a childhood friend, Victor Forni, who was described
by gang members as the brains of the outfit and the one who figured
out the plans for their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Forni, in fact, was charged and pleaded guilty to conspiracy in
the Hi-Way robbery. But that only happened later _ after he lost a
two-year battle against extradition from New York to New Jersey. In
the interim, his old friend Landano, who said he was not even in
New Jersey at the time of the robbery, was tried, convicted and
sent to jail.
</P>
<P>
   In prison, he told his story to Neil Mullin, a lawyer from
Montclair, N.J., who eventually became consumed with the Landano
case, devoting countless unpaid hours and nearly 20 years to
overturning the conviction. In 1989, he convinced Judge H. Lee
Sarokin of U.S. District Court in Newark that the state possessed
undisclosed evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In an unprecedented raid, federal marshals, acting on Sarokin's
orders, scoured the files of police departments and the
prosecutor's office for all information related to the Snow murder.
Based on what was found _ including evidence that some of the
witnesses were pressured by the police to identify Landano as the
gunman _ the judge said the state had ``systematically'' withheld
evidence, and he ordered Landano released from state prison.
</P>
<P>
   The state fought back. The case ricocheted for another seven
years through various courts. By then, however, Landano's fight to
clear his name had acquired another foot soldier.
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Lepore-Kaneko was a juror in the first murder trial in
1978. She said she went along reluctantly with the others in their
guilty verdict. ``I thought maybe they had understood things I
didn't,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But reading Sarokin's decision 11 years later, Mrs.
Lepore-Kaneko decided her courtroom misgivings might have some
basis after all. She contacted Landano and followed him from
hearing to hearing. She flew back from Osaka, Japan, where she now
lives with her husband, for the second trial.
</P>
<P>
   When the verdict was read, Mrs. Lepore-Kaneko began to weep and
tremble. ``So relieved! So relieved!'' she gasped. ``The
intensity!''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the second trial, the star witness was the one Breed gang
member who agreed to testify again on behalf of the state _ Allen
Roller, who had been convicted of actually robbing the Hi-Way Check
Cashing Service and served eight years in prison. Forni, whom the
defense claimed framed Landano, was subpoenaed by the state and
brought to Jersey City. He refused to testify and remains in the
Hudson County Jail on contempt charges.
</P>
<P>
   As he has before, Roller named Landano as the gunman. But on
many other issues, he contradicted his earlier statements. Paul
Casteleiro, Landano's trial lawyer, called him a ``misfit'' and a
``liar.''
</P>
<P>
   Casteleiro, who called no witnesses for the defense, also sought
to discredit the state's main piece of evidence, a blue denim hat
found on the seat of the getaway car splattered with Snow's blood.
The hat may well be Landano's, he said, but it was stolen and
planted in the car by the Breed gang as part of their carefully
planned crime.
</P>
<P>
   Gardner, the prosecutor, portrayed the Hi-Way Check Cashing
robbers as a gang bumblers who forgot to bring a bag for the money
and then got lost in their getaway car as they careened away from
the scene. Framing Landano, he argued in his summation, was beyond
their talents.
</P>
<P>
   The jury, however, simply did not believe either the state's hat
story or Roller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They kept pushing the hat, the hat, the hat,'' Frieda Smith,
one of the jurors, said in a telephone interview after the verdict.
``But that didn't make him the killer.'' There was also general
disagreement in the jury room, she said, that Roller lacked
credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody was thinking the same thing,'' Ms. Smith said.
``There were a lot of `ifs.'''

SWISS ACQUISITION FURTHER CONSOLIDATES THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn.)   (EDS: Previously skedded as SWISS-RE-LIFE)  
(js) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Furthering a consolidation that has recently accelerated in the
reinsurance industry, Swiss Reinsurance Co. said Monday that it had
agreed to acquire the Life Re Corp. for $95 a share, or about $1.8
billion, in cash.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase by Swiss Re, the world's second-largest reinsurance
company behind Munich Reinsurance, is the third deal in the
industry in little more than a month. Last week Gerling AG, the
German insurer, bought Constitution Reinsurance Corp. from Exor
Group SA, an investment company controlled by the Agnelli family of
Italy, for $700 million. And in June Berkshire Hathaway Corp., the
holding company run by Warren Buffett, bought General Re Corp., one
of the world's largest reinsurers, for just under $22 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the trend would almost certainly continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies just have too much capital,'' said Cathy
Seifert, who follows the reinsurance industry for Standard &AMP; Poor's
Corp. ``And the best way to redeploy that capital is through
acquisitions. Also, the financial services business is globalizing,
and within the insurance sector, reinsurance is perhaps the most
global business there is.''
</P>
<P>
   Colin Devine, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said European
companies are likely to be interested in additional U.S.
properties. ``From a valuation perspective, European insurance
company stocks trade at about double the multiples of the stocks in
this country,'' he said. ``For many international companies, that
makes the American reinsurance sector very attractive right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Life Re, based in Stamford, Conn., sells traditional life and
administrative reinsurance throughout the United States. Last year,
Life Re had a net income of $49.6 million and revenue of $645.8
million.
</P>
<P>
   Reinsurance companies buy policies from other insurers, helping
to spread risk. In effect, reinsurers promise to cover much of the
claims of their clients _ other insurance companies _ for a
relatively small portion of the premiums collected from
corporations and individuals. And they agree to pay if the
insurance companies suffer huge losses. But huge losses are rare
and often the reinsurers have little to pay out. As such, the
business can be extremely profitable. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The $95-a-share price for Life Re represents a premium of 6.3
percent over the company's $89-a-share closing price Friday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Shares of Life Re jumped after the deal
was announced, and closed at $91.3125 Monday, up $2.3125.
</P>
<P>
   Based in Zurich, Swiss Re maintains more than 70 offices in 30
countries. Last year, the company had after-tax income of about
$1.5 billion on insurance revenue of $11.9 billion. At the end of
1997, the company had 7,500 employees.
</P>

   The deal ``further develops our strategy to expand our life and

 &HT;    Unbearable heat in Texas will stay put _ for now
 &HT;    By Anne Rochell
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ It's the kind of heat that makes the sky go white, that
makes people who are forced to be outside seek shelter in even a
postage-sized bit of shade. And there is no end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   After 22 days of temperatures above 100 degrees, Monday's Dallas
Morning News had a grim forcast for the week: It pictured five
boxes with a blistering sun in each. No clouds. No rain. And,
again, temperatures above 100 every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a rain dance or something,'' said Shelia Hill, who sat
on a bench under a shade tree outside the Bank One building in
downtown Dallas Monday, taking a cigarette break. ``I had to go buy
another air conditioner, because my old one wasn't strong enough.
Now, I just close myself off in my bedroom, and I got rid of my
kids. They're at my sister's. She's got air conditioner forever. I
wish I could bottle it and bring it home.''
</P>
<P>
   All over town, folks are doing what they can to stave off
misery. Paul Lacey and his friends do yard work in the early
morning around south Dallas, and then come home and fill up the
cooler with cold drinks. ''We've definitely been struggling,'' he
said. ''Usually we just stay in the house, but my air conditioner
doesn't work real well. Right now, it's cooler out there than it is
in here. But at least we don't have a shortage of water.''
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Fort Worth, water main breaks have prompted the
city to order water restrictions, such as not watering lawns.
</P>
<P>
   More than 94 people have died in the Texas heat wave. State
officials are trying to help those without air-conditioning or
fans, and the local energy company has a phone number set up for
people to call to get an air conditioner donated.
</P>
<P>
   But then there's that touch of Texas defiance through it all.
Some people are wondering what all the fuss is about.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm doing fine,'' said Azell Cooks, who was sitting in the
shade of his porch in south Dallas. Retired, he was doing a little
carpentry, building a wooden box. ''It's all a mind-over-matter
thing. Naturally it's hot, but if you dwell on it, it will seem
hotter.''
</P>
<P>
   ''People in Dallas are used to 100-degree heat,'' said Jan
Gifford, who works in marketing at the Dallas Public Library's main
branch. ''You just learn not to go out unless you have to.'' Hill
said her last electric bill was $333. She called TU Electric.
''They said `send what you can' and not to worry about it, just to
keep my unit running,'' she said. ''I tell you, it is so cool in
that Bank One building, if I could sleep there, I would.''

 &HT;    King taps church roots, celebrity donors
 &HT;    By Kimberly H. Byrd
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ By kicking off the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference's 41st annual convention in the church, Martin Luther
King III is setting the tone for an organization that is striving
to rebound as a spiritually grounded powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The church is) the only thing we can build from,'' King said
Monday afternoon after a youth awards banquet at the convention's
headquarters, the Omni Shoreham Hotel. ``That is our foundation.''
</P>
<P>
   Already, his vision for empowerment, equality and unity is
unfolding.
</P>
<P>
   His team _ old-school civil rights workers and volunteer
advisers such as Jerome Edmondson, the first black franchise owner
of a Denny's restaurant _ have tapped Hollywood celebrities to
pitch in financially and mentor youths in the name of SCLC. They
have contacted Bill Gates' office and asked the Microsoft
co-founder to help meet the SCLC's computer needs. They are
rounding up professional athletes to serve as role models.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why is it important for us to support SCLC?'' asked actor
Thomas Ford (''New York Undercover'' and ``Martin'') during
Monday's banquet. ``As long as there is oppression, as long as
there is racism, it's important that we have an SCLC.''
</P>
<P>
   Ford told the young people that their forefathers had fought
many a battle so that life would be better for them. ``Young folks,
it is time for us to do some re-defining,'' he said. ``Today is our
day. We have a job to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Ford turned to the adults, describing them as mirrors for
tomorrow's leaders. And that's why, he said, ``We have to love one
another honestly. We must embrace one another honestly. We must
support one another honestly.'' SCLC has been in the nation's
capital since Saturday for a five-day convention that started with
the installation of King as the fourth president. The convention
ends Wednesday after a health forum.
</P>
<P>
   SCLC was organized in 1957 by King's father and other ministers
as a direct-action, protest arm of the civil rights struggle. In
recent years, it has had trouble raising money and defining its
role.
</P>
<P>
   As SCLC works to cement its mission of equality, empowerment and
unity, some have wondered about its validity and its necessity.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address Sunday night, King, 40, cleared that
up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turn on CNN, ABC, CBS or NBC. Turn on `Nightline' or get
on-line,'' King said. ``Until there are no longer barbaric acts
like the murder (of a black man) in Jasper, Texas, or racial
burnings in Jackson, Miss., until there is no discrimination from
Wall Street to 125th Street in Harlem, until there is no
discrimination from Beverly Hills to Compton in L.A., until there
is no discrimination in the board room and until there is equality
in the classroom, there will always be a need for the SCLC
movement.''
</P>
<P>
   In a seminar Monday afternoon, Les Brown, an author and public
speaker, urged members to clearly define the organization's
mission, assess and determine an appropriate way to meet the needs
of the community, and join hands with other organizations that have
similar goals.

TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT IS EXPELLED BY REVIEW BOARD 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A court-appointed review board expelled Ron Carey,
the Teamsters president, from the union Monday, apparently ending
the career of a labor leader who once seemed destined to clean up
one of the United States' largest but most troubled unions.
</P>
<P>
   The review board concluded that Carey breached his fiduciary
duty by failing to stop an illegal scheme that siphoned more than
$750,000 in union funds into his 1996 re-election campaign. The
board said that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that
Carey approved or knew about the scheme, but the board chastised
him for failing to ferret out or inquire further about fraudulent
activity that was going on right in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision expels for life a figure who was one of the
nation's best-known, most charismatic union leaders, a man who won
widespread public support for his leadership in the Teamsters'
three-week strike against United Parcel Service.
</P>
<P>
   Carey was first elected president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1991 as a Mr. Clean, vowing to
eliminate corruption in a union long known as the nation's most
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign fraud _ in which three Carey campaign
aides have pleaded guilty _ the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters donated more than $750,000 to liberal groups, and in
return, traditional donors to those groups contributed $221,000 to
the Carey campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carey had a duty to inquire into the unusual proposed
transactions, and he failed to exercise it,'' the Independent
Review Board wrote. ``A fair inference to be drawn from all the
facts is that Carey closed his eyes because he knew or suspected
that those contributions were to generate a personal benefit for
him, i.e., benefits to his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, insisted that the decision was
wrong, and vowed to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fit of regulatory overzealousness,'' Weingarten said,
``the Independent Review Board found that Ron Carey did not have
actual knowledge of an illegal fund-raising scheme and then imposed
severe sanctions upon him solely on the basis of his failure to
prevent misconduct that he knew nothing about. Under this
reasoning, every bank president who has been unable to stop a
teller from embezzling money can be tossed out of his job and
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The review board was set up as part of a 1989 consent decree
that involved the federal government dropping a civil racketeering
suit, in which it charged that the Teamsters had a ``devil's pact''
with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Before the board's decision takes effect, it must be confirmed
by Judge David Edelstein of U.S. District Court in New York, who
has been highly critical of Carey in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, after uncovering the campaign fraud, a federal
election monitor overturned Carey's 52-percent-to-48-percent
victory over James P. Hoffa in December 1996. In November another
monitor, Kenneth Conboy, barred Carey from running for re-election,
and days later, Carey took a leave of absence. Conboy found that
Carey had apparently approved the embezzlement scheme _ a finding
that clashes with Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Carey is under investigation by a federal grand jury in New
York, but several lawyers said Monday that an indictment became
less likely when the review board failed to conclude that Carey
approved or knew about the fraudulent scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Judge Frederick Lacey, the chairman of the
three-member board, issued a separate concurring decision saying
that he, unlike the two other board members, believed that Carey
knew about the scheme. Lacey relied heavily on a statement that
Carey's campaign manager, Jere Nash, had said he once made to
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Nash had testified that he once told Carey that if the Teamsters
president approved a large donation to Citizen Action, a
progressive grass-roots group, it would ``help Martin Davis in the
fund raising that he is doing for our campaign.'' Davis was the
campaign's chief fund-raiser and handled its direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Carey told the board under oath that he had no memory of that
conversation with Nash.
</P>
<P>
   While not finding guilty knowledge, the two other board members,
William Webster, the former head of the FBI and CIA, and Grant
Crandall, a mine workers' attorney, said they often thought Carey
was not telling the truth. They wrote that Carey ``was less than
credible'' when he denied remembering anything about close to $1
million in political contributions that the Teamsters made and that
he approved, including a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action.
</P>
<P>
   All three board members took Carey to task for a management
style in which, when on the road campaigning, he asked his
secretary for minimum details about such large contributions and
refused to return calls to senior aides who opposed such
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, Webster and Crandall wrote, ``While the
information provided to Carey was not sufficient to establish
Carey's knowledge of the nature of the scheme, it was sufficient to
impose on Carey a fiduciary duty to inquire further about any
relation or tie between Carey's own campaign fund raising and the
IBT's payment to an advocacy group like Citizen Action.''
</P>
<P>
   With Carey barred for life from the union, Hoffa is the
front-runner in the new race for the presidency of the
1.4-million-member union. Ballots are scheduled to be mailed out in
September and counted on Oct. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday, Hoffa said, ``Today's Independent
Review Board decision banning Ron Carey from the Teamsters for life
is a small step toward returning honest, competent and above all
democratically elected leadership to the Teamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Ron Carey will trouble our union no more, but dozens
of his political cronies continue to hold office illegitimately at
the Teamster headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the review board also expelled Bill Hamilton,
who had already resigned as the union's director of government
affairs, a post in which he oversaw the Teamsters' lobbying and
political donations. Hamilton has been indicted on six counts for
participating in the siphoning scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The board found that Hamilton knew about the campaign fraud and
had worked closely with Nash in implementing it, by, for example,
writing numerous memos seeking to gain speedy approval of the
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's lawyer, Robert Gage, said, ``Bill has done nothing
wrong and we strongly disagree with the board's decision.''

LEWINSKY MEETS WITH PROSECUTORS IN POSSIBLE PRELUDE TO IMMUNITY
DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOHN BRODER and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors met for five hours at an undisclosed
location in New York on Monday with Monica Lewinsky, the woman at
the heart of the White House sex and perjury inquiry, in a possible
prelude to an immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a development fraught with danger for the president, several
lawyers from the office of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
interviewed Ms. Lewinsky in New York in an effort to gauge her
credibility as a witness and secure her grand jury testimony. Starr
has insisted that his attorneys meet face to face with Ms. Lewinsky
before offering her immunity from prosecution in exchange for her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors neared a deal with Ms. Lewinsky, the pressure on
President Clinton intensified on two other fronts on Monday as
Starr's investigation moved inexorably toward a denouement.
</P>
<P>
   A divided federal appeals court rejected the president's
invocation of lawyer-client privilege to bar the grand jury
testimony of his closest aide, Bruce Lindsey, setting the stage for
a Supreme Court confrontation or Lindsey's imminent return to the
grand jury. The court said that a president cannot hide criminal
behavior behind the shield of lawyer-client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's private lawyers continued their negotiations with
Starr over terms of compliance with an unprecedented presidential
subpoena. Little progress was made on Monday, according to lawyers
involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's meeting with
prosecutors indicated that the session had moved the two sides
considerably closer to an agreement that would lead to Ms.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. In proposed testimony submitted
earlier this year, Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged having had a sexual
relationship with the president but denied that he or anyone else
had tried to persuade her to lie about it under oath. Ms. Lewinsky
repeated those assertions on Monday, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is moving quickly to secure the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky
and Clinton _ the two central parties in the matter _ at virtually
the same time as the fact-gathering phase of his investigation
nears a conclusion. Clinton's lawyers have agreements with many of
the witnesses to share information about grand jury appearances. By
taking Clinton's and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony simultaneously, Starr
may be seeking to prevent their coordinating their accounts,
according to lawyers involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the president was heightened by a Tuesday
deadline to respond to a subpoena delivered last week for his
testimony in the Lewinsky matter. His lawyers continued their
negotiations with Starr to find a means to respond to prosecutors'
questions without the spectacle of a president for the first time
appearing personally before a criminal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the inquiry said that Starr would not
attempt to enforce Tuesday's deadline as long as talks were
underway with the president's lawyers. David Kendall, one of
Clinton's private attorneys, said that he was working with the
independent counsel's office ``to devise a way for the president to
provide information for the OIC's investigation, consistently with
his constitutional role and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that deadline is unimportant, because both sides are seeking a
compromise. Clinton is willing to testify if the questioning is
limited to the Lewinsky matter and does not become a broad fishing
expedition into unrelated topics, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also adamant about not being forced to appear at the
federal court house, the adviser said. The president is willing to
provide written answers to prosecutors' questions or to submit to a
videotaped session.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's testimony _ at some time and in some manner
_ is now inevitable, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is now put in the position that if he doesn't
testify he's got to have some really overwhelming reasons, and
there are damn few of them,'' the adviser said. ``He has said in so
many words that he is prepared to cooperate under certain
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here dealt the president a
further legal setback on Monday, ruling that his conversations with
Lindsey, deputy White House counsel and a longtime confidant of the
President's, were not protected by lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching decision, issued by a divided three-judge
panel, said ``it could be contrary to tradition, common
understanding and our governmental system'' to shield Lindsey from
appearing before a federal grand jury investigating serious
criminal charges, including witness tampering, perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an executive branch attorney is called before a federal
grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes within the
executive branch, reason and experience, duty and tradition dictate
that the attorney shall provide that evidence,'' the court wrote.
``Their duty is not to defend clients against criminal charges and
it is not to protect wrongdoers from public exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, said that the president
and his legal advisers will decide whether to appeal after they
have thoroughly studied the 60-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals
has decided that, unlike every other attorney and client in this
country, government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the
right to have confidential communications. The practical result of
the court's decision is that the president and all other government
officials will be less likely to receive full and frank advice
about their official obligations and duties from government
attorneys.''

IAAF SUSPENDS 2 U.S. ATHLETES FOR POSSIBLE DRUG OFFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., W.Va.)   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The international drug scandal in sports widened from cycling's
Tour de France to track and field Monday when the sport's world
governing body announced that two top American athletes, sprinter
Dennis Mitchell and 1996 Olympic shot put champion Randy Barnes,
had been suspended for possible doping offenses.
</P>
<P>
   However, the U.S. Track and Field Federation said it would not
enforce the suspensions, calling the allegations unproven. The
national federation also accused the world governing body of
contravening the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, which was enacted by
Congress and which entitles American athletes to due process before
they are declared ineligible to compete.
</P>
<P>
   This apparently means that Mitchell and Barnes remain eligible
to compete in the United States but not internationally. Neither
athlete returned calls Monday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 meters, tested
above the acceptable 6:1 ratio of testosterone, the male sex
hormone, to epitestosterone, a related chemical, according to
Giorgio Reineri, a spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic
Federation, track and field's world-governing body. Anything above
6:1 is considered suspicious of using testosterone as a
muscle-building steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the world-record holder in the shot put, tested positive
for a prohibited substance with steroid-like qualities, Reineri
said in a telephone interview from France. The Associated Press
identified the substance as androstenedione, a banned nutritional
supplement. Because he previously was suspended for drug use,
Barnes faces a potential lifetime ban from competition, while
Mitchell's career could be suspended for two years.
</P>
<P>
   Both Mitchell and Barnes were given random, out-of-competition
drug tests in the United States on April 1, Reineri said. The
spokesman said he believed that only the first of two samples,
called the A and B sample that each urine specimen is divided into,
had been tested for each athlete. U.S. law, however, calls for both
samples to be tested and for athletes to be given a fair hearing
before they are suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outraged that the IAAF knowingly breached our
confidentiality rules, which were put in place to protect those
ultimately determined to be innocent,'' Craig Masback, president of
the U.S. track federation, said in a statement.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The suspensions were announced on the same day that the
International Olympic Committee called for a world conference next
January to reappraise its campaign against what is believed to be
the extensive use of banned performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's actions followed controversial remarks reportedly made
Sunday by International Olympic Committee president Juan Antonio
Samaranch, who was quoted in the Spanish newspaper El Mundo as
calling for ``drastically'' reducing the number of banned
substances. He was also quoted as saying that he did not consider
it doping if an athlete used a performance-enhancing drug that was
not believed to be harmful to that athlete's health.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's remarks elicited pointed responses of support and
criticism Monday from the worldwide Olympic community. Steve Ovett
of Britain, the 1980 Olympic champion at 800 meters, said it
appeared that Samaranch was ready to ``throw in the towel'' on drug
testing.
</P>
<P>
   Others, such as Jaques Rogge of Belgium, a surgeon who is vice
president of the IOC medical commission, said it was difficult, if
not impossible, to differentiate between substances that are
harmful to an athlete's health and those that are not.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say, some Olympic officials wondered, that steroids
are harmful if taken in regulated doses under careful monitoring by
a doctor? And what about substances that aren't
performance-enhancing but are considered harmful? Should they be
banned?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz noted
Samaranch's strong anti-drug stance and wondered whether he had
been accurately quoted.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schultz said, he agreed that a review of the
IOC's drug-testing policies was necessary. There are no uniform
standards or application of drug penalties among various
Olympic-related sports.
</P>
<P>
   And a sense of frustration has grown over the inability to
develop tests for such substances as EPO, a synthetic hormone that
increases aerobic capacity and is at the center of the Tour de
France scandal, and human growth hormone, which has steroid-like
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a morass out there that needs to be reviewed to
determine what is performance-enhancing and what is not,'' Schultz
said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think there's any question that the drug
gurus who are trying to beat the system are ahead of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC issued a statement seeking to clarify Samaranch's
remarks. It said that he sought a ``a clear definition of doping''
at the 1999 world conference and that he had been referring to
codeine, which has been removed from the banned list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight against doping must continue in a spirit of
heightened unity,'' the IOC statement said. ``The IOC president
noted that the IOC's determination was greater than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the USOC was also looking to host a worldwide
meeting on the drug issue in late 1999 or early 2000. Primo
Nebiolo, the president of track's world governing body, backed
Samaranch's call for a world conference in January of 1999 at IOC
headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of doping affects the whole of the sports movement
and needs to be resolved quickly and effectively after years of
indecision and ineffectual actions,'' Nebiolo told reporters in
Lausanne.
</P>
<P>
   Nebiolo said that the drug scandal at the Tour de France
``destroys the image of one of the great symbolic sporting
events,'' and added that doping is ``harmful for the athletes and
can kill a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Festina, the world's top cycling team, has been suspended from
the Tour de France, and a Dutch team also faces possible expulsion.
</P>
<P>
   And now U.S. track and field, already reeling from public
indifference and suspected widespread drug use, has to deal with
the international suspension of two of its most prominent stars.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is particularly embarrassing for Mitchell, 32, of
Gainesville, Fla., who is chairman of the track federation's
athletes advisory committee, which has taken a vociferous anti-drug
stance. However, the science on t/e ratio testing is murky and the
USOC questioned the efficacy of such testing last year during the
Mary Decker Slaney case. Her suspension by the IAAF was overturned
by the U.S. track federation and is now headed toward arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 32, of Charleston, W.Va., set the world outdoor shot put
record at 75 feet, 10 1/4 inches in 1990, but was suspended in 1991
and 1992 after testing positive for the banned substance
methyl-testosterone. He returned to win a gold medal at the 1996
Summer Games in Atlanta.

POP REVIEW: HIP-HOP WITH A MESSAGE INSTEAD OF JUST A BOAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JON PARELES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ The third annual Smokin' Grooves tour, which
came to the PNC Bank Arts Center here Sunday night, might as well
have been called the Hip-Hop Holdouts tour. It assembled groups
that insist, against the commercial tide, that hip-hop isn't
exclusively about ``playas'' who brag about their wealth, their
women, their brand-name possessions and their unsavory pasts while
borrowing the melodies of pop hits.
</P>
<P>
   For three of the groups on the bill _ Public Enemy, Gang Starr
and Wyclef Jean's Refugee Camp _ hip-hop is still a way to address
social issues, using the beat to carry messages. ``It might feel
good, it might sound a little somethin'/But damn the game if it
don't mean nothing,'' Chuck D. intones in ``He Got Game,'' the
title track from Public Enemy's current album. The other
headliners, Cypress Hill and Busta Rhymes with the Flipmode Squad,
also stand outside the ``playa'' realm. Cypress Hill sticks to its
narrow obsessions with marijuana and guns, and Busta Rhymes
single-mindedly incites a party.
</P>
<P>
   For all the groups, hip-hop isn't just a star trip; it's a
display of camaraderie, an employment program and an opportunity
for empire-building. While rock groups may talk about community,
they keep their stage shows clear of nonmusicians; hip-hop groups
perform amid friends, hangers-on and affiliated talent, bringing
the neighborhood to the stage in what can look like near-chaos. The
image of block-party fraternity _ nearly all the participants were
male _ is as important as what the rappers say.
</P>
<P>
   Public Enemy, the headliners, has reunited after drug
rehabilitation for Flavor Flav, Chuck D.'s partner and the group's
comic relief. The set also had a guest rap from Professor Griff,
who had been dismissed from Public Enemy in 1989 after declaring
that Jews were responsible for ``the majority of wickedness that
goes on across the globe.'' His thankless job here was to follow
the pro-marijuana raps of Cypress Hill with the admonition, ``We
can't stay high forever.''
</P>
<P>
   With Security of the First World, its dancing drill team, Public
Enemy has long been one of hip-hop's most capable live acts; Chuck
D. strides around the stage, Flavor Flav strikes jokey poses, and
the disk jockey Terminator X oversees booming rhythm tracks. The
set depended on past glories, from the late 1980s and early '90s,
when Public Enemy articulated rage and resistance in music that
bristled with sonic irritants and language so dense it begged to be
decoded. In more recent songs Chuck D. has grown didactic, as if he
no longer trusted his listeners to make an effort to understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He Got Game'' gives in to the Puff Daddy style of pop hip-hop;
the song appropriates Buffalo Springfield's ``For What It's
Worth.'' But the older material _ ``Bring the Noise,'' ``911 Is a
Joke,'' ``Fight the Power,'' ``Can't Truss It'' _ was a reminder of
how many remarkable songs Public Enemy contributed to hip-hop.
</P>

<P>
   Cypress Hill reunited B-Real, its lead rapper, with D.J. Muggs
and Sen Dog, and it also relied on older songs. Unfortunately its
material has grown threadbare: tales of pot smoking, paranoia and
gunplay delivered in B-Real's nagging singsong voice. Back in 1991,
Cypress Hill managed to push titillating hot buttons with songs
like ``Hand on the Pump,'' but it soon reduced them to a formula,
with diminishing returns. Two songs from the band's fourth album,
due in October, were largely unintelligible; one taunted, one
leered. B-Real had to exhort the crowd to stand up, something Busta
Rhymes never had to mention.
</P>
<P>
   Rhymes was as much a cheerleader as a rapper: bounding across
the stage, constantly touting his five-member Flipmode Squad and
getting the crowd to shout along with the party chants of songs
like ``Woo-hah!'' Gang Starr had more serious intentions; its
rapper, Guru, paid tribute to Chuck D. and preached self-respect.
Where Gang Starr's albums use a light, slightly jazz-tinged
backups, onstage Gang Starr harked back to rap's old school, with
deep, basic beats from D.J. Premier. Gang Starr also had guests,
including Freddie Foxx and MOP.
</P>
<P>
   Jean's set had diverse intentions: showing off his skills as
singer, guitarist and rapper; mixing Caribbean and American music,
and plugging his associates Pras Michel (of the Fugees), John Forte
and Canibus. True to rap's demotic ideals, Jean made his entrance
like a street-level fan: he clambered up on stage and wrestled with
a security man like a stage crasher.
</P>
<P>
   For many concertgoers, myself included, the opening acts,
Black-Eyed Peas and Mya, were sacrificed to a 75-minute wait for
what turned out to be a nonexistent security check. The Arts Center
has presented previous Smokin' Grooves shows; by now, it ought to
be better organized.

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. _ Optimistically, Dorothy Edouart recites her
mantra. ``I haven't won yet, but I've got the letters saying I won,
and I'll be getting my winnings very soon,'' she says outside the
airy dining room of the retirement center where she lives. ``All I
have to do is send in my entries and my checks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Edouart, an 88-year-old widow, has played magazine
sweepstakes and similar promotions passionately for years. In a
54-day period in 1995, she wrote 148 checks to 56 contests,
according to her check register. Her family estimates that in five
years she spent $60,000 on magazines she never read and merchandise
she never used, without winning a dime.
</P>
<P>
   To continue playing, Mrs. Edouart moved here from Rhode Island
to escape her children's objections. Now, she is suing her son for
the right to sell the family's estate, saying she needs more money
for sweepstakes. The family is seeking to have her declared
incompetent.
</P>
<P>
   Across the country, people are fooled every day into believing
they have won sweepstakes and other contests, misled by
attention-grabbing graphics and official-sounding language.
</P>
<P>
   Most people understand that these pitches are come-ons to buy
magazines and other products. ``We just throw them away,'' Lucille
Corwin said of the sweepstakes entry forms that fill her mailbox at
Sun City Center, a Florida retirement community.
</P>
<P>
   But from big cities to small villages, the mailboxes that fill
fastest are those that belong to the elderly. And all too often the
people who believe the sophisticated pitches and spend large sums
they cannot afford on hundreds of magazine subscriptions or on
other goods they do not want are elderly, too.
</P>
<P>
   An examination of the sweepstakes business by The New York Times
provides a look at the inner workings of an industry that has grown
dramatically, offering bigger and bigger prizes to millions of
households to persuade people to buy everything from magazines to
videos to flower bulbs.
</P>
<P>
   As the stakes and competition have risen, so has the
sophistication and, in some cases, critics argue, deception.
Marketing experts and copywriters at the brand-name sweepstakes
operations, like Reader's Digest and American Family Publishers,
use increasingly sensational language and graphics to make their
sweepstakes stand out.
</P>
<P>
   And increasingly, authorities say, fraudulent copycats and
telemarketers are using the techniques of legitimate sweepstakes,
and lists of their contestants, to prey on people they know are
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's virtually impossible to distinguish the legitimate
sweepstakes from the frauds,'' said Michael T. Kogut, an assistant
attorney general in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   But recently even the well-known legitimate sweepstakes have
come under scrutiny because of concern that they promise too much.
Among the elderly who prove vulnerable, some are lonely and seeking
excitement. Others do not understand the rules printed in small
type.
</P>
<P>
   And many take literally what they read when they open envelopes
marked ``Registered Documents Enclosed'' and ``Personal and
Confidential'' and inside find Sports Illustrated announcing that
they have won $833,337, or Publishers Clearing House congratulating
them on ``your selection to be a Guaranteed Cash Prize Winner with
a timely response.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Folks who are in their 70s, 80s and 90s grew up in an era
where, if something was official or appeared to have something to
do with the government, it must be OK,'' said William E. Arnold,
director of the gerontology program at Arizona State University,
who is studying the effects of sweepstakes on the elderly. ``Even
looking at some of the legitimate mailings, there is enough stuff
in there that makes it sound official that they don't read the fine
print.''

<P>
   ENORMOUS STAKES: SWEEPSTAKES MEAN MORE SUBSCRIPTIONS  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The legitimate sweepstakes industry has mushroomed from a single
contest at Reader's Digest magazine in 1962 to hundreds of contests
a year. More than 400 million of the most sophisticated packages in
the direct-mail business are sent to households in the United
States each year by the two largest sweepstakes companies, American
Family Publishers and Publishers Clearing House.
</P>
<P>
   For the magazine industry, the stakes are enormous.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly one-third of all new magazine subscriptions are generated
through sweepstakes, industry experts say. They are worth hundreds
of millions of dollars to magazines because publishers can charge
advertisers more as subscriptions increase.
</P>
<P>
   The business is profitable for the sweepstakes operators because
they keep about half of the subscription money they collect and
sell other merchandise through their contests.
</P>
<P>
   The power of sweepstakes is evident in carefully guarded
industry statistics. A sweepstakes mailing for magazine
subscriptions is four to five times more likely to generate an
order than a mailing without a prize or contest, said Larry Stone,
a former senior official at Publishers Clearing House and Reader's
Digest and a rare insider willing to describe how the industry
works.
</P>
<P>
   From the size and color of the type to the texture of the paper
and the number of pages, every element of a sweepstakes package is
designed to persuade readers to play the sweepstakes _ and to order
magazines or other products. Representatives of the sweepstakes
companies say their mailings are designed only to provide people
with the fantasy of winning and comply with laws that require
mailings to make clear that no purchase is necessary and that
entries that include orders have no more chance of winning than
those that do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a very long history of making disclosures in our
copy beyond what has been required by law,'' said Michael Brizel,
an executive at Reader's Digest, a unit of The Reader's Digest
Association. ``We think that the people we mail to clearly
understand the difference between buying these high-quality
products and entering the sweepstakes.''
</P>
<P>
   But an increasing number of state officials, who share
regulation of the sweepstakes industry with the federal government,
say some sweepstakes mailings have crossed the line from persuasion
to deception. Trying to make everyone believe he or she is a
winner, these officials argue, flouts the law. After years of
isolated action, state authorities have opened an offensive with
the potential to change the way the sweepstakes industry operates.
</P>
<P>
   In March, 32 states and the District of Columbia reached an
agreement with American Family Publishers, which is owned jointly
by a unit of Time Inc. and an investment group associated with the
Pritzker family of Chicago. The company paid $2.25 million to the
states and agreed to stop telling people they were winners, unless
they had actually won, and to emphasize in mailings that no
purchase was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   But Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, South Carolina and West
Virginia went further and sued American Family Publishers, accusing
it of deceptive practices and seeking restitution for customers.
Also named as defendants were Dick Clark and Ed McMahon, who
promote the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   Those five states also are cooperating as they expand scrutiny
of other companies. Gary L. Betz, special counsel to the Florida
attorney general, said his office is investigating Publishers
Clearing House, the other big sweepstakes company, and scrutinizing
recent mailings by Reader's Digest and Time.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Clearing House, based in Port Washington, N.Y., is a
limited partnership with a majority held by trusts and charities
connected to its founder, the Mertz family.
</P>
<P>
   American Family Publishers also faces 26 class-action civil
suits and 11 suits brought by individuals seeking millions of
dollars in restitution.
</P>
<P>
   In January, a former circulation executive at Time Inc., Susan
Caughman, became chief executive of American Family Enterprises,
the parent company of American Family Publishers. Her first goal,
she said, was to negotiate the settlement with the states.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm committed to making it as clear as possible that we are
honest and we are proud of what we do as a contest,'' Ms. Caughman
said. ``It should help distance us from the fraudulent operators
who are abusing our good name.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's redesigned mailings are toned down, but they
continue to relegate to small print the odds of winning the $10
million prize _ 150 million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Still, those odds are better than the chance of winning the $1
million prize in Reader's Digest's 1998 President's Prize: 600
million to 1.
</P>
<P>
   Some people in the industry expressed concern that the problems
of American Family Publishers have harmed other companies. Tighter
restrictions are likely to spread throughout the industry. Also,
consumers often have difficulty telling one sweepstakes from
another, so bad publicity for one threatens all.
</P>
<P>
   ``They squeezed the golden goose, and everybody is going to get
hurt,'' said Stone, the former publishing company executive.
``Nobody can tell these companies apart.''
</P>
<P>
   Legislation introduced in June in the Senate would expand the
federal government's role in regulating sweepstakes mailings. The
bill would require key disclaimers to be printed in large type,
restrain other language and allow the Postal Service to destroy
mail that does not comply. A hearing on the bill is scheduled for
Sept. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a lot of Americans, I get these things in the mail, and
they are so realistic that consumers are misled into believing they
have won a big prize,'' Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo.,
who wrote the bill, said in an interview.

</P>
<P>
   SEDUCTIVE BAIT: ENTRY MAILINGS BECOME A SCIENCE
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, sweepstakes are the victims of their own success.
The Reader's Digest sweepstakes helped it become the
largest-circulation magazine in the world. Other magazines followed
suit. Next came the so-called stamp sheets assembled by Publishers
Clearing House and American Family Publishers, offering discount
subscriptions to 300 or more magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Publishers Clearing House and American Family Publishers will
not release revenue figures. But Dan Capell, editor of Capell's
Circulation Report, said the two operations generate about 30
percent of all new magazine subscriptions each year.
</P>
<P>
   Designing a sweepstakes package is a science. Marketing and
promotions experts develop the central pitch. Copywriters and
graphic artists come up with words and images to convey the
message.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Stone and other insiders said, lawyers haggle over the
details to keep the package within the law. But the goal is always
the same _ to sell products by entertaining and involving the
person receiving the mailing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is to involve people through the stamps, seals and
stickers known in the trade as action devices. Over the years, the
industry has discovered that the more gimmicks in a mailing, the
better the response.
</P>
<P>
   The envelope may have an official-looking message. The most
recent mailing from American Family Publishers, for example, has a
bright orange card on the envelope back that says, ``ATTENTION.
UNAWARDED PRIZE DEPOSIT PRE-AUTHORIZATION FORM.''
</P>
<P>
   Inside, almost all mailings include several pages with numerous
action devices. The newest American Family Publishers mailing
requires people to detach the pre-authorization form, detach an
entry form that resembles a check and affix a gold seal to the
completed form before mailing the entry.
</P>
<P>
   Stone and other experts said the motive is simple. The more that
people have to do in a mailing, the better chance they think they
have of winning.
</P>
<P>
   Mailings often begin by blaring the news, ``You are a winner.''
Then comes a description of the contest and an urgent request at
the end to send in the response form.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's basic persuasion communication,'' said Arnold of Arizona
State University. ``You hit them in the beginning with the bold
print, and you close with a statement that you need to send this
and, by the way, if you buy some things it might help. They also
work on reciprocity. You buy something from us, and we'll reward
you.''
</P>
<P>
   David Sayer, executive director of advertising at Publishers
Clearinghouse, compared the gimmicks and language to a department
store's ``sale'' sign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do find that the sweepstakes get them in the store, and
once we get them in, we like to involve them,'' he said. ``But we
take care to write them clearly and believe that there should be no
confusion whatsoever for anyone who reads them carefully.''
</P>
<P>
   A successful sweepstakes generates subscription orders from 10
percent of the recipients, industry experts say. The entries with
orders are called ``the pull.'' When a mailing is sent to 50
million households, a 10 percent pull translates into $50 million
or more in revenue. A much larger group _ about 30 percent _
returns the entry form without ordering.
</P>
<P>
   Sweepstakes officials would not disclose their results, but Ms.
Caughman of American Family Publishers said a 10 percent pull would
be bad from a mailing to proven customers, and good from a mailing
to people who had not bought before.
</P>
<P>
   Regulations require that all entries have an equal chance of
winning. But subtle distinctions sometimes reinforce the
misconception that you have a better chance if you order something.
</P>
<P>
   A blatant example was used this year by American Family
Publishers. Entries with magazine orders went into an envelope
addressed to contest headquarters in Tampa, Fla. People who were
not ordering anything were instructed to mail their entries to a
post office box in Waycross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the entries wound up in Tampa, but the illusion was that
you had a better chance by mailing it directly to the sweepstakes
headquarters,'' said James Lyons, an investigator with the Florida
Attorney General's office.
</P>
<P>
   The basic accusation by the states against American Family
Publishers is that its entry forms have evolved into sophisticated
shams that violate state laws against deceptive sales practices.
</P>
<P>
   For example, an American Family Publishers mailing in January
declared to millions of recipients: ``IT'S DOWN TO A 2-PERSON RACE
FOR $11,000,000. YOU AND ONE OTHER PERSON. WERE ISSUED THE WINNING
NUMBER. WHOEVER RETURNS IT FIRST WINS IT ALL!''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Caughman, the American Family Publishers chief executive,
said the company voluntarily withdrew that mailing in February and
stopped routing entries without orders to Georgia. She said other
practices are under review.
</P>
<P>
   But practices decried by the attorneys general were featured in
recent sweepstakes mailings by Sports Illustrated and Time, both
published by Time Inc., one of the partners in American Family
Publishers.
</P>
<P>
   A promotion in March for Sports Illustrated, for example, was
mailed in an official-looking brown envelope with the words
``Registered Documents Enclosed'' on the front. Inside was a manila
folder, stamped in red ``Keep This Document in a Safe Place.''
</P>
<P>
   The accompanying letter blared the good news, ``OUR SWEEPSTAKES
RESULTS ARE FINAL: (the recipient's name) HAS WON A CASH PRIZE OF
$833,377.00!'' It went on, ``A BANK CHECK FOR $833,337.00 IS ON ITS
WAY TO (the recipient's address)!'' Finally, it said, ``A BANK
CHECK FOR $833,337.00 IN CASH WILL BE SENT TO YOU VIA CERTIFIED
MAIL IF YOU RESPOND NOW!''
</P>
<P>
   The caveats came in small type. The first, just above the
headline about winning, said, ``If you have and return the Grand
Prize winning entry in time, we will officially announce that.''
The back of the manila folder, in small print under the heading
``Official Rules,'' disclosed that the actual deadline was a year
away, March 31, 1999. And the odds of winning the grand prize
turned out to be 1 in 120 million.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc., said the
solicitation was not misleading. ``We have no interest in deceiving
either existing or potential customers,'' he said. ``We run our
sweepstakes honestly and ethically.''

   TRUE BELIEVERS: FOR SOME, PASTIME BECOMES OBSESSION
</P>
<P>
   Kelli Carson's grandfather committed suicide. Mrs. Carson, who
lives near Seattle, described the events leading to his death on
condition that his name not be used, because some relatives
objected to the publicity. Law-enforcement authorities confirmed
the details.
</P>
<P>
   ``After his wife went into the nursing home with Alzheimer's, my
grandfather started playing for something to do when he was
alone,'' Mrs. Carson said. ``It just went from something he did to
occupy his time to an obsession. He truly believed that each time
he sent in his form he would be the $10 million winner, as long as
he bought something.''
</P>
<P>
   At one point, the family discovered the retired building
contractor's garage was filled with pallets of merchandise and
magazines. They sold the goods at a garage sale. Less than a year
later, the garage was full again.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives met many times to discuss the problem. The only answer
seemed to be to go to court to have the grandfather declared
incompetent. The relatives could not bring themselves to do it.

<P>
   ``He was the hardest working person all of his life,'' Mrs.
Carson said. ``He saved and saved. He was never frivolous. And he
was in complete control, except he was just brainwashed by these
sweepstakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Dec. 8, Mrs. Carson said, her grandfather was found dead in
his truck from carbon monoxide poisoning. Going through his papers,
the family determined that he had spent more than $100,000 on
sweepstakes and similar contests. His bank account had been closed,
and his utilities were about to be shut off.
</P>
<P>
   Some elderly people have become so convinced they are winners
that they have flown to American Family Publishers headquarters in
Tampa to try to collect their prizes. Jeanne Meyer, a spokeswoman
for the company, said only a fraction of recipients misunderstand
the mailings and fewer go to Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   A different story was told by former employees of Time Customer
Service, the subsidiary of Time Warner that handles calls from
customers of American Family Publishers in Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed in Tampa last week, Anne E. Curran, the
customer service manager for the sweepstakes account until she
resigned in April, said she had to deal with so many disgruntled
people who thought they had won that she feared for her safety.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individuals Curran met with who had traveled to Tampa to
claim prizes they believed they had won in the AFP sweepstakes were
often very angry or very depressed upon learning that they had not
won and had traveled to Tampa for nothing,'' said the suit. ``As a
consequence, Curran began to experience emotional distress and fear
for her personal safety.''
</P>
<P>
   Without specifying the number, the suit said more people started
traveling to Tampa to collect their prizes in recent months. So
many went that they were given the code name ``visitors'' and Ms.
Curran was instructed to keep cash in a fund ``specifically set up
to silence them,'' the suit said.
</P>
<P>
   Time Customer Service filed its own suit against Ms. Curran,
contending that she misappropriated company electronic mail and
demanded money not to disclose it. The Time suit did not address
Ms. Curran's accusations.
</P>
<P>
   Another former employee of Time Customer Service, Kim Venezia,
said that during her three years with the company many callers
believed they had won. ``During the sweeps season, from October to
March, I was handling 200 to 300 calls a day, and over half of them
were people who thought they had won,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not just illiterate people. And it's not just the
elderly. I talked to all sorts of people who thought they had
won.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst times, she said, were when a cab would pull up to the
building's employee entrance while she and other workers were
taking a cigarette break.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it,'' she said. ``Here comes gramps with a briefcase
or a box with all his sweepstakes entries. Security stopped them.
The two supervisors for mail and telephones would flip a coin to
see who would have to go tell this person they didn't win.''
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Edouart fervently believes that sweepstakes riches are
just around the corner.
</P>
<P>
   A trim, well-spoken woman, Mrs. Edouart had been living
comfortably with her family in Jamestown, R.I., in a house that she
had bought and put in a trust. The trust required the family to
care for her until her death, at which time the house would go to
her heirs. But several months ago she moved to a retirement center
in Vero Beach on Florida's Atlantic Coast to escape the objections
of her son and other relatives to her sweepstakes playing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just do it to make a little money,'' Mrs. Edouart said in an
interview recently. ``That's the only reason. I just need to get
enough money to take care of myself. It doesn't hurt anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mrs. Edouart's son discovered that she was spending $2,000 a
month on magazines she never read and merchandise she did not need
in response to sweepstakes mailings, said her daughter-in-law,
Susan Zwick.
</P>
<P>
   ``She spent 12 hours a day at her desk writing checks and
filling out entry forms _ and this is a woman with arthritis,'' Ms.
Zwick said.
</P>
<P>
   Her family's objections escalated in heated disputes. ``She
would say, `It's my money and I can do with it what I want,''' Ms.
Zwick said. ``We'd say that we were afraid she was being taken
advantage of. And she'd say, `Now you think I'm stupid and old and
being taken advantage of.'''
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Florida, Mrs. Edouart filed suit to remove the
Jamestown house from the trust. Mrs. Edouart said that she needed
more money for the sweepstakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my winnings I won't be able to collect because I don't
have enough money to send them the $25 fee.''
</P>

to defraud the elderly. (Will run Tuesday for Wednesday papers.)

HENRI ZIEGLER, 91, A PIONEER IN EUROPEAN AVIATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Henri Ziegler, a trained pilot and commander of the Free
French Air Force in World War II who helped start some of Europe's
most ambitious postwar aviation projects, including the Concorde
supersonic jetliner and the Airbus civilian airliner program, died
at a nursing home in Paris July 23. He was 91.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler, once denounced as a traitor by a French government
minister for suggesting that France should abandon its splendid
isolation and cooperate with other European governments to produce
jetliners, lived to see Airbus Industrie, the consortium that he
founded and ran from 1970 to 1975, emerge as a vigorous challenger
to Boeing Co. as a premier supplier of planes to the world's
airlines.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus has clawed its way from a fragile alliance of British and
French aircraft manufacturers in the early 1970s, to dominance of
roughly one-half of the orders placed around the world this year
for civilian aircraft. But when Ziegler first hinted in 1969 that
without a dramatic overhaul, Europe's atomized aircraft industries
would fail to keep step with aircraft industries in the United
States and the Soviet Union, he faced fierce resistance from the
party of the go-it-alones in France.
</P>
<P>
   ``My views raised hell,'' he was later quoted by The Times of
London as saying. ``My minister called me into his office and said,
`You are a traitor to your country.'''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, French Prime Minister Lionel Jospin lauded ``the
memory of one of those who was at the origin of the technological
and economic success of the European aeronautic and space
industries.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Nov. 18, 1906, in Limoge, Ziegler earned degrees in
management and aeronautical engineering, then entered the French
air force, where he rose quickly to become, in 1938, deputy
director of the air force test flight center. One year later, as
World War II engulfed Europe, he left for the United States as part
of a procurement mission to purchase badly needed aircraft and
parts for the French air force.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of France, Ziegler returned to his occupied
homeland to help organize the anti-German resistance. In 1944, he
smuggled himself to Britain where, under the nom de guerre Colonel
Vernon, he first commanded the ragtag Free French air force, then
served as chief of staff of the French resistance fighting under
Gen. Charles de Gaulle to liberate France from the Germans.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he served briefly in Washington and London as
military liaison, then joined the French national airline, Air
France, in 1946. Two years later, Ziegler was named chairman, a job
he held until 1954.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler held various cabinet-level posts in the 1950s, but he is
best remembered for his role in building the French and European
aircraft industry. In 1968, he was appointed to run Sud-Aviation, a
leading aircraft manufacturer in the south of France, and charged
with reorganizing the badly splintered aircraft industry.
Sud-Aviation was later absorbed by the larger Societe Nationale
Industrielle Aerospatiale, or SNIA, which in 1984, as the core of
the French aerospace industry, was renamed Aerospatiale SA.
</P>
<P>
   During his tenure at Sud-Aviation and SNIA, Ziegler championed
the ambitious project to join British aircraft builders to jointly
develop a supersonic civilian jetliner, the Concorde, which entered
regular service, flying at twice the speed of sound, in January
1976. Ziegler later published a memoir of the project titled ``The
Great Adventure of the Concorde.''
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1960s, Britain and France were casting about for
further ways to unite the forces of their fragmented aircraft
industries in a bid to challenge the dominance of the United
States, which at the time produced 85 percent of the world's
commercial aircraft. Contacts between British Aircraft Corp. and
Hawker Siddeley Aviation with French and German aircraft
manufacturers led to the first design studies for a new range of
civilian jetliners, beginning with a twin-engine wide-body
airliner, which was started in October 1972, as the Airbus 300B.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970, Ziegler had been named to head a consortium of
companies to build the plane, and against the bitter resistance of
a part of the French bureaucracy he championed the idea of a
unified management and sales organization. He stayed at Airbus
until 1975, laying the groundwork for the later enlargement of the
consortium by the addition of British and Spanish companies.
</P>
<P>
   If Airbus is Ziegler's greatest legacy, the supersonic Concorde
may have been his greatest commercial disappointment. Together with
his British counterpart, Sir George Edwards, chairman of British
Aircraft, he vigorously lobbied U.S. political leaders and airline
officials, and at least six U.S. airlines originally took options
to purchase 31 Concordes.
</P>
<P>
   In 1971, President Richard Nixon toured a Concorde that had
carried French President Georges Pompidou to a meeting of the two
leaders and expressed enthusiasm. To further promote the Concorde,
Ziegler publicly urged a joint European-American project for an
even larger supersonic plane for the 1980s. But Boeing, joined by
environmental organizations that objected to its noise, fought the
Concorde. Thus, the decision in 1973 by Trans World Airlines and
Pan American World Airways, then the largest U.S. carriers, to
cancel their orders was a major setback. Other U.S. airlines soon
followed suit, and the Concorde's entry into the crucial U.S.
market was effectively blocked.
</P>
<P>
   But aircraft industry experts say the Concorde's shortcomings,
and most notably the failure to win the backing of a wide coalition
of European governments for its construction, ultimately inspired
Ziegler to fight for a broad-based manufacturing alliance to assure
the success of the Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Ziegler is survived by four children. A son, Bernard Ziegler,
served as senior vice president for engineering at Airbus Industrie
until his retirement last year.

CLINTON OPEN TO SOCIAL SECURITY `OPTIONS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. _ Amid many questions and no answers about
saving Social Security, President Clinton said Monday he would be
open to ``options'' such as the private investment of some of the
fund's money.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the president signaled his willingness to
consider letting Americans invest their Social Security savings in
stocks and bonds as some Republicans and moderate Democrats have
advocated.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, members of Congress and experts fielded questions from
New Mexicans at the third of four national debates on Social
Security reform. The session focused on privatization and its risks
and whether the individual or the government should control the
investments.
</P>
<P>
   In January, Clinton proposed a series of forums around the
nation to be capped by a session at the White House in December.
The forums are sponsored by the American Association of Retired
Persons, the Concord Coalition and Americans Discuss Social
Security.
</P>
<P>
   Early next year, Clinton will appoint a bipartisan commission
that will submit recommendations to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton expressed the same uncertainty voiced by the
majority of Americans about what should be done to save Social
Security from its expected bankruptcy in 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would do, the president said, ``I don't know. I
don't know what I would do, but I am open to the idea that if we
can get a higher rate of return in some fashion than we have been
getting in the past while being fair to everyone ... we ought to be
open to those options.''
</P>
<P>
   Gene Sperling, Clinton's economic adviser, said the president
was signaling his willingness to explore the investment issue.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the employer and employee pay 6.2 percent each into
the Social Security fund as a payroll tax. The money is invested in
government Treasury notes and returns are guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls released this weekend show Americans favor
private investment. A USA Today poll published Monday showed
two-thirds of those surveyed supported allowing individuals to
invest their Social Security funds but 59 percent opposed giving
the government the power to make the investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper poll also showed an overwhelming majority opposed
the traditional methods of prolonging the life of the nation's
retirement fund. It found 85 percent opposed cuts in benefits, 70
percent opposed raising the retirement age and 62 percent opposed
hiking payroll taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The USA Today poll and an AARP survey of New Mexicans found
citizens have stronger feelings about what should not be done than
what should be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here in New Mexico, according to a new AARP survey,
hold views similar to the rest of the country: They know Social
Security is important and they know it needs real changes. Yet,
there's no consensus, in New Mexico or elsewhere, on what those
changes should be,'' said Horace Deets, AARP executive director.
</P>
<P>
   More than 44 million Americans receive Social Security benefits.
One-third of the beneficiaries, however, are not retirees but
receive benefits from spousal life insurance or disability.
</P>
<P>
   The trust fund will be unable to meet all guaranteed benefits
beginning in 2030 as the 76 million baby boomers fully enter
retirement age. The number of elderly people will double while the
number of tax-paying workers will dwindle to two people paying
payroll tax for every one person drawing benefits.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of experts also disagreed on the issue of privatization.
Some argued the risk was too great to allow individual investments
while others argued the government may be too inept to make
collective investment decisions.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Clinton joked that ``you may leave here more
confused than when you came in.''
</P>
<P>
   Several proposals have been introduced in Congress. Two
bipartisan proposals call for reducing the current 12.4 percent
Social Security payroll tax and allowing citizens to set up
individual investment accounts with the savings. It would retain
the Social Security Trust Fund as a guaranteed benefit.
</P>
<P>
   Some conservatives have called for the complete privatization of
the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was joined at the forum by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee; Sen. Jeff Bingaman,
D-N.M.; Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.; and Rep. Xavier Becerra, D-Calif. &QL;

 By SETH SCHIESEL and LAURA M. HOLSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp., which dominates the local telephone
business from Maine to Virginia, has agreed to acquire GTE Corp.,
the nation's largest independent local and long-distance company,
for $52.8 billion in stock, executives close to the negotiations
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The companies plan to announce the deal and lay out the
financial details Tuesday morning, the executives said. The board
of each company approved the acquisition Monday night, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, GTE's chief executive, Charles Lee, 58,
will become chairman and co-chief executive of the merged
companies, while Bell Atlantic's chief executive, Ivan Seidenberg,
51, will become co-chief executive and president. The executives
close to the negotiations said that Seidenberg, who was scheduled
to take over from Raymond Smith as chairman of Bell Atlantic on
Jan. 1, would become sole chief executive and chairman of the
merged companies after 2002.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will be based in New York, according to people
close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by federal regulators, a deal between Bell Atlantic,
based in New York, and GTE, based in Stamford, Conn., would be the
latest in a torrent of multibillion-dollar mergers in the
telecommunications industry. Companies of all description are
engaged in a scramble for scale as they try to offer bundles of
voice, video and data services to customers around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic's acquisition of GTE would mean little in the
short run for most of the companies' residential customers. But the
companies are likely to assert that their combined financial muscle
will allow them to accelerate the deployment of expensive
high-speed Internet services and to compete in local phone markets
dominated by other Bells.
</P>
<P>
   By acquiring GTE, Bell Atlantic would secure its place as the
nation's largest local phone company, serving more than 62 million
customers. At Bell Atlantic's current size, the pending $62 billion
combination of SBC Communications, known to many of its customers
as Pacific Bell or Southwestern Bell, and Ameritech Corp., the
Midwest's dominant phone company, threatens to push Bell Atlantic
to the No. 2 position.
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts and executives say they expect the global
telecommunications market, now more than $500 billion annually, to
be dominated in a few years by a handful of international giants.
Each of the big U.S. phone companies wants to be one of them, even
if that means joining forces with a rival.
</P>
<P>
   Just last year, Bell Atlantic acquired Nynex Corp., which
provided local phone service in New York and New England, for $26
billion. With more than 21 million local telephone customers in 28
states, mainly in the Sun Belt and Midwest, GTE would greatly
expand Bell Atlantic's presence outside the Northeast and would
give it a toe-hold in the long distance and data networking
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company would have about 255,000 employees. Bell
Atlantic and GTE are not expected to announce layoffs as part of
their merger announcement, although it is unlikely that all current
employees could be assured of remaining in their present jobs. One
rationale for many mergers is the savings realized by eliminating
redundant workers or transferring employees to new posts.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies will no doubt describe their deal as a merger
of equals, but in some ways it represents a downsizing of ambition
for GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, GTE tried to acquire MCI Communications Corp., the
nation's No. 2 long-distance carrier, for $28 billion. But Lee,
GTE's chairman, was outmaneuvered and outbid by Bernard Ebbers,
chairman of Worldcom Inc., who won MCI with a $37 billion offer.
</P>
<P>
   A merger between Bell Atlantic and GTE would pose thorny
questions for the federal regulators who would review such a deal.
As one of the Baby Bells that emerged from AT&AMP;T Corp. in 1984, Bell
Atlantic operates under a broad range of regulatory restrictions
while GTE, an ``independent'' phone company that was never part of
AT&AMP;T, enjoys much more freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The Telecommunications Act of 1996, which aimed to open
communications markets to competition, prohibits the Bells from
selling long-distance service until they can demonstrate that they
have opened their local networks to potential competitors.
</P>
<P>
   While no Bell has yet passed that test, GTE, which is bigger
than three of the five Bells, has already been allowed to offer
long-distance services in the local markets it serves. It has
already won more than 2.2 million long-distance customers.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators will probably approve the deal but force the merged
companies to operate under the two existing sets of rules: one for
Bell Atlantic's traditional region and another for the areas where
GTE had offered service.
</P>
<P>
   That would mean that most current GTE customers would be able to
continue getting both long-distance and local phone service from
the merged companies, while current Bell Atlantic customers would
still have to use a separate long-distance company.
</P>
<P>
   A precedent for such a structure emerged earlier this year after
SBC agreed to acquire Southern New England Telecommunications
Corp., Connecticut's main local phone company, for $4.4 billion in
stock. Like GTE, SNET is allowed to sell long-distance service.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department approved that deal, allowing Connecticut
customers to use SBC for long-distance service even though SBC is
not allowed to sell long-distance calls in its home region.
</P>
<P>
   One potential complication is that GTE offers combined service
in parts of some states that are currently dominated by Bell
Atlantic, including Pennsylvania and Virginia. Some of the rules
that keep the Bells out of the $80 billion long-distance market in
the United States do so on a state-by-state basis.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, federal regulators could have as many as three options:
allow Bell Atlantic to keep selling long-distance service to former
GTE customers even in Bell Atlantic's traditional states; force
GTE's current long-distance customers in Bell Atlantic states to
give up the service; or have Bell Atlantic sell the GTE properties
in its traditional states.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   With the regulatory process and financial transactions, the deal
will probably take more than a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially troublesome regulatory issue is that GTE
owns BBN Technologies, one of the nation's biggest carriers of
Internet traffic. The same rules that prevent Bell Atlantic from
supplying long-distance services within its region also apply to
long-distance data networks.
</P>
<P>
   BBN carries Internet data all over the country, including within
Bell Atlantic's Northeastern region. Bell Atlantic has asked the
Federal Communications Commission for a regulatory waiver that
would allow the company to build a long-distance data network, but
it appears unlikely that the commission will approve the
application, mostly because advanced technology would allow Bell
Atlantic to use the data system for voice calls.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the regulatory uncertainties, the drive to
consolidate is so strong in the telecommunications industry that
GTE was also approached about a possible merger by BellSouth Corp.,
according to people close to those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appears that Bell Atlantic did not have to come up
with billions of additional dollars to woo GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, GTE's shareholders will get 1.22 Bell
Atlantic shares for each GTE share. Based on Bell Atlantic's
closing price of $45 Monday, that works out to $54.90 for each
share of GTE. GTE's shares closed Monday at $55.75, down 2 3/16.
Bell Atlantic shareholders are expected to hold 57 percent of the
merged company, said a person close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One reason GTE was interested in doing this merger, people close
to the talks said, was because of the recent string of high-level
defections, a result of the company moving its headquarters from
Stamford to Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, J. Michael Kelly, GTE's chief financial officer,
left to become America Online's chief financial officer. In April,
GTE's chief planning and development officer, Dan Cohrs, left to
join Global Crossing, an undersea cable company. And last October,
Lewis Wilks, an executive who supervised new ventures designed to
take GTE beyond its core local-phone service business, joined Qwest
Communications International, the startup long distance company.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with GTE's loss of its MCI deal to WorldCom, and
the impending acquisition of Ameritech by SBC, put GTE in a
situation where it needed to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said that intensive discussions
between the two chief executives started in late June and that they
worked out the major points of the merger themselves, with bankers
being brought in two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, these people said, Bell Atlantic's Seidenberg
said repeatedly that he did not want bankers involved in the talks
because he feared leaks. Bell Atlantic was advised by Merrill Lynch
and the Bear Stearns Cos. GTE was advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

   MIAMI _ The scene at 5 a.m. in the Miami International Airport
cargo area hasn't changed much over the years. Refrigerated trucks
with logos of companies like Atlantic Bouquet, CFX (``The Cut
Flower Experts'') and Continental Farms still rumble through the
security gates, back up to the loading docks and fill their
trailers with boxes of roses, lilies, chrysanthemums, baby's
breath, bird of paradise and dozens of other kinds of flowers.
</P>
<P>
   Then they make their way along Northwest 25th Street to the
swath of industrial parks five miles away that is the hub of
Miami's flower-distribution business. By 7 a.m., the flower
companies' sales reps are hitting the phones, scrambling to find
buyers for any inventory that hasn't already been sold.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath all the hubbub, though, one thing is very different than
it once was _ and as a result, U.S. shoppers can expect to find a
lot more flowers in a lot more outlets before too long. Those
Atlantic Bouquet, CFX and Continental Farms trucks, as well as rigs
with a half-dozen other names splashed across their sides, now all
belong to a single company, USA Floral Products Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation craze that has swept through industry after
industry during the last few years _ from insurance and banking to
publishing and railroads _ has percolated down to an unlikely
corner of the U.S. marketplace: flowers.
</P>
<P>
   And leading the pack is USA Floral, which aspires to be the
undisputed giant of the $14 billion flower trade. In the last year,
it has snapped up 14 mom-and-pop distributors, wholesalers and
bouquet makers for a total cost of $152 million. It owns companies
in 22 states and Canada and says it will soon expand into Europe
and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Just this month, USA Floral announced plans to purchase eight
more floral businesses around the country for $17.4 million in cash
and stock. Those include Channel Islands Floral, a bouquet maker in
California; Floramark, a Denver-based bouquet maker; and Evergreen
Wholesale Florist in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Few people will notice USA Floral's growing market presence
because it is letting the companies that it acquires keep their
names, largely because of the brand loyalty of many of their
customers.
</P>
<P>
   But already, its revenues have shot up to a projected $561
million this year, from $184 million in 1997, the company says, and
it confidently predicts that sales will soar to $1 billion next
year.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how big USA Floral wants to be, Robert Poirier, its
chairman and chief executive, responds with a question of his own:
``How big is the floral industry?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a small part of floral consumption over all,'' he said.
``There is a tremendous amount of business that is left on the
table.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody _ least of all a lot of investors _ shares
Poirier's enthusiasm, however. The company went public last October
at $13 a share, and its stock surged to a peak of $23.875 in
February. But it has sunk since then, dropping as low as $15.375 in
mid-June before recovering a bit. Analysts blame a lack of investor
enthusiasm for consolidation companies. (It closed Monday at
$15.75.)
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the risks of the so-called roll-up strategy have
become evident, with analysts saying that some companies have grown
too quickly, failed to integrate operations, relied too much on a
few large customers and used large acquisitions to mask serious
operating problems.
</P>
<P>
   None of that fazes Poirier, who says the current price still
represents a premium from the $13 offering.
</P>
<P>
   Poirier, a 23-year veteran of the flower industry, is overseeing
USA Floral's expansion with the help of a pioneer in the relatively
new field of consolidating small, fragmented industries, Jonathan
Ledecky.
</P>
<P>
   Ledecky, who is the nonexecutive chairman of the company and its
largest shareholder with a stake of more than 8 percent, founded
U.S. Office Products Co. in 1995 and built it into a $2.8 billion
giant by buying hundreds of independent stationery stores and
furniture and office-product suppliers that were struggling to
survive against Office Depot and Staples. And last year, he formed
Consolidated Capital Corp. to string together businesses in
similarly dispersed industries.
</P>
<P>
   Poirier said he was following Ledecky's strategy of buying
high-quality companies at a modest premium and letting them
continue as independent operators with their old names and
suppliers intact. ``This is a video replay of U.S. Office
Products,'' he said.
</P>

<P>
   (MORE) nn
</P>
<P>
   But the similarity may be what has jaded investors. And Poirier
is also quick to point out the ways in which his business model
differs from that of U.S. Office Products. His focus on buying only
floral companies and moving quickly to consolidate operations has
helped USA Floral escape some of the criticisms facing U.S. Office
Products these days. And one significant difference _ the use of
the purchase method of accounting versus pooling to record
acquisitions _ should keep federal regulators at bay. It may also
stave off steep stock price declines like those experienced by U.S.
Office Products, whose shares have plunged as much as 42 percent
since June 1.
</P>
<P>
   While some other flower companies are also growing, USA Floral
is a standout. Its most formidable competitor is probably Dole Food
Co., the $4.3 billion California conglomerate, whose flower sales
surged from nothing to $100 million this year when it bought the
largest wholesaler in Florida along with its production farms in
South America. (Such well-known companies as 1-800-Flowers or
Florists' Transworld Delivery Inc., known as FTD, are not direct
competitors because they are essentially marketing operations and
retail florist groups.)
</P>
<P>
   But the main reason for USA Floral's upbeat outlook is the
enormous room that it sees for the growth of the entire flower
market, which is split almost evenly between the $6 billion
fresh-flower business and the $8 billion industry in potted plants
and vases. Only about 25 percent of Americans buy flowers
regularly, compared with 60 percent of Europeans, and USA Floral is
confident it can get the numbers up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average American is in a grocery store two to three times
a week,'' Poirier said. ``I'd like people to start thinking that if
they haven't got flowers, then there's something missing.''
</P>
<P>
   Flowers are a diverse business. Imagine the stems of the
industry spreading throughout the nation, creating a wild
arrangement of largely family-owned businesses, including roughly
9,700 domestic growers, 1,000 wholesalers, 27,000 retail florists
and 23,000 supermarket floral operations. The industry has its tap
roots in Latin America, and the pot, so to speak, is centered
around the Miami airport, where approximately 100 importers handle
roughly 70 percent of all flowers consumed in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   USA Floral isn't the only company with grand ambitions, of
course. Dole's purchases last month gave it a foothold in the
flower business, and it hopes that its presence in supermarket
produce departments will give it a marketing edge to increase the
revenues of its floral companies. (USA Floral does not own any
farms, but it has exclusive agreements with several farms it deals
with.)
</P>
<P>
   Several Miami companies are also forming alliances and
considering mergers in order to make sure they are big enough to
compete. And a smaller, Los Angeles-based public company, Sun Cut
Floral Network, was formed earlier this year after it was acquired
by a former medical technology company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not certain where all of it is going, but the trend is
probably unstoppable at this point,'' said Alvaro Varela ,
president of Agriflora , a Miami importer. Varela said his company
had spurned a takeover bid from USA Floral because ``the group is
so big already we don't know where we would fit.'' Instead, he
said, Agriflora plans to merge with some other local distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Moran, the executive vice president and chief executive
officer of the Society of American Florists, said the flower
industry had long resisted the big-is-better mentality so prevalent
in other sectors of the economy. Previous efforts to forge national
floral empires have failed ``because the business is really driven
by relationships and outside people misjudge those relationships,''
he said. But things have changed. ``There's definitely a mania
going on,'' he said. ``Everybody's concerned that if they're not
part of a strategic relationship'' they will not survive.
</P>
<P>
   Still, meshing operations in the flower trade _ where
maintaining the freshness of one of the world's most perishable
products is the key and where ``keep it moving'' is the mantra _
won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Within the space of 24 hours, flowers are harvested on farms in
Ecuador, Colombia and Costa Rica; shipped to Miami; X-rayed as they
pass through 33-degree refrigerated coolers and then examined by
U.S. Department of Agriculture inspectors, all under the watchful
eyes of security cameras; picked up by distributors; warehoused;
and finally put on trucks bound for florists', Stop &AMP; Shops,
Kroger's stores and Wal-Marts all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   It is not an industry that lends itself to cookie-cutter
production. At one Miami bouquet company owned by USA Floral, each
worker assembles a single bouquet. At another, women stand in front
of conveyor belts, dropping set numbers of particular flowers into
each passing bouquet. Neither company plans to change its
procedures.
</P>
<P>
   Still, USA Floral believes it can save money by consolidating
back-office operations like accounting, finance, insurance and
employee benefits. For example, it says, it recently cut costs by
more than $700,000 by combining the hazard insurance policies of 16
of its companies. It also saved almost $500,000 by channeling its
telephone business to a single long-distance company. And it plans
to fold its 10 Miami companies into six locations by year's end.
Task forces of executives from several of the companies are
exploring such other economy moves as adoption of a single computer
system.
</P>
<P>
   The company believes its heft will also allow it to distribute
more flowers at lower cost and save on transportation, flower
handling and storage. Poirer wants to create a string of regional
distributors in cities like Atlanta and Dallas to put flowers in
customers' hands more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Down the road, USA Floral hopes to do joint marketing and
merchandising with retailers. Today, the industry spends less than
$100 million a year on flower promotions, according to Moran of the
Society of American Florists. ``For a $14 billion industry, that's
not going to move the needle much,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate goal is to make flowers so ubiquitous that
Americans _ who now mostly buy them on impulse or as infrequent
gifts _ will get into the habit of picking up bouquets once or
twice a week. To achieve that, the industry will have to reach
people like Mary Radford, a marketing executive in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   When she lived in New York in the early 1990s, Ms. Radford
bought flowers all the time at a local corner grocery store, she
says. And she was an even more avid consumer when she lived in
Europe in the late 1980s. ``In Paris, flowers are all over the
place,'' she said. ``There are a lot of little florists' shops all
over the city, and they were cheap enough to justify the cost.''
</P>
<P>
   But she hasn't bought a single bouquet since she moved to
Washington two years ago. ``I don't think about it,'' she said,
``because they're not in front of me all the time and I have the
perception that they are more expensive.''

CONGRESS PAYS TRIBUTE TO SLAIN OFFICERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Eds.: Sub to clarify Gibson being buried at Arlington; minor
editing throughout) 
 
By GREG McDONALD 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congress on Monday opened an emotional, two-day
tribute to the police officers slain while trying to protect
lawmakers, their staffs and the public from a deranged shooter who
unleashed his violence in the marbled hallways of the U.S. Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Both the House and the Senate passed resolutions honoring
Capitol Police Detective John Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut
as heroes of the bloody Friday afternoon shootout with Russell
Weston Jr., who was charged in federal court Monday with murder.
</P>
<P>
   Weston, who was shot at point-blank range by Gibson, remains in
serious condition at a hospital. He has been charged with the
murder of one of the federal officers, but other federal charges
are pending against him and he could face the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Congress gave its approval for an extraordinary memorial service
to be held at 3 p.m., EDT, Tuesday in the Capitol Rotunda, where
the two 18-year veterans will lie in state as President Clinton,
Vice President Al Gore and others pay homage.
</P>
<P>
   Such services are usually reserved for presidents or members of
Congress. But Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., said it
was only fitting that the two men who paid the ultimate price while
performing their duties be honored under the center dome of the
building where they worked every day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow, amid those grand statues of heroes past, we will
honor two of our own to whom heroism was simple duty,'' Lott said
during a Senate tribute to the officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``For those two ... this open Capitol, with wide-eyed kids
learning their nation's history, with strangers from abroad awed by
its grandeur, with Americans of all creeds and races and regions
celebrating their common faith in God and in one another, this
Capitol itself will be their enduring monument.''
</P>
<P>
   Lott called the violence that unfolded Friday ``a tragedy for
the nation.'' But for the people who work on Capitol Hill, he
likened it to ``a death in the family.''
</P>
<P>
   As Congress prepared for its special tribute Tuesday, flags
continued to fly at half-staff over federal buildings, and tourists
brought more flowers to the east steps of the Capitol in honor not
only of Chestnut and Gibson but of law-enforcement personnel across
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``To those who serve and protect, we owe you our gratitude,''
read one card.
</P>
<P>
   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., also honored all the
Capitol Police in his remarks during a House tribute. ``We
sometimes take them for granted,'' he said. ``They're the salt of
the Earth. They're the reason our democracy can live.''
</P>
<P>
   In Albuquerque, N.M., to attend a forum on Social Security,
Clinton paid his respects again by asking the crowd to join in a
moment of silent prayer for the two officers and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The president spoke with Chestnut's widow by phone Sunday. He
called Gibson's widow from New Mexico on Monday to offer
condolences.
</P>
<P>
   Although speeches and tributes to Chestnut and Gibson dominated
congressional proceedings Monday, the Senate did return to
legislative business for part of the afternoon session. On the
House side, however, the chamber remained in recess through much of
the afternoon until a formal tribute in the evening was convened.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to several resolutions honoring their memories and
service, the House and Senate also authorized the federal
government to pay the costs of the officers' funerals.
</P>
<P>
   Chestnut, 58, was a 20-year veteran of the Air Force. He will be
buried Friday at Arlington National Cemetery with full military
honors.
</P>
<P>
   After a request from lawmakers, the Army also cleared the way
for Gibson, 42, to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson was assigned to guard House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, and is credited with firing the shots that downed Weston
while taking fire himself. DeLay said Gibson's actions prevented
Weston from shooting anyone else after he ran into DeLay's suite of
offices. Weston had shot Chestnut after rushing through a ground
floor entry.
</P>
<P>
   ``John and I went everywhere together,'' DeLay said during a
House tribute. ``He knew that someday it was likely that he'd have
to throw his body in front of me or my staff,'' DeLay continued,
his voice cracking with emotion. ``You never think it's going to
happen. But it happened on Friday.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston was being treated Monday at a Washington hospital for
gunshot wounds to the chest, arm and leg. His condition has
improved enough that doctors said they believe he will be able to
stand trial. But federal authorities in the capital, and in Montana
and Illinois where Gibson has lived, acknowledged that he has a
history of mental illness, a fact that could be used to prevent a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   Weston is being represented by Washington lawyer A.J. Kramer,
who was appointed by the court. Kramer told reporters that he spoke
with his client Monday morning. He said Weston was ``not in good
shape'' physically, but he refused to comment on his mental
condition.

EX-CONVICT YOUTH SEIZED IN POLICE SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MICHAEL COOPER 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A 17-year-old ex-convict accused of shooting a police
officer was captured during an armed standoff on Staten Island
Monday morning, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani cited the suspect's
criminal record as yet another example of why the state's parole
system needs to be overhauled.
</P>
<P>
   The Sunday night shooting of Police Officer Gerard Carter, who
was in critical condition Monday in a Staten Island hospital, came
three days before the state assembly is expected to break a
legislative logjam that has prevented the passage of a law that
would sharply curtail the use of parole in New York state.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor said that the shooting highlighted the failure
of the parole system and described the suspect, Shatiek Johnson, as
a parolee, Johnson was not, in fact, technically on parole.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was freed in April after serving two-thirds of a
three-year sentence for a manslaughter conviction in 1996. During
his imprisonment, he had been denied parole, but the authorities
were forced to let him go in April because state guidelines require
doing so when a prisoner serves two-thirds of his sentence and does
not commit major infractions in prison.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson had been an adult, he would still be in prison under
the terms of the law the legislature is considering this week,
known as Jenna's law after a young woman who was killed by a
parolee. ``Jenna's law'' would not have applied to Johnson,
however, because he was tried and convicted as a juvenile.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after his conditional release _ in which he was still
under parole supervision, while technically not on parole _ Johnson
was arrested for fare-beating in Times Square. On July 16, the
police said, they believe Johnson was involved in the shooting
death of a 20-year-old man at another Staten Island housing
project.
</P>
<P>
   It was against that backdrop at 9:30 p.m. Sunday that he
encountered Carter _ a 28-year-old father of one with five years on
the force. Carter was on patrol in the West Brighton Houses,
looking for Johnson to question him in the July 16 killing.
</P>
<P>
   When Carter and his partner, Officer Eric Storch, spotted
Johnson from their marked police van, they thought they recognized
him from a wanted poster, the police said. They drove around the
corner, looked at his picture and returned to the courtyard where
they had spotted him, the police said. Without a word being
exchanged, the young man walked up to the windshield, pulled out a
gun and fired, striking the officer in the head, police officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Storch returned fire, but did not hit the assailant, the police
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor, who has long pushed for the abolition of parole, used
the case to assail the system and questioned why Johnson was not
taken back into custody in June when he was arrested for
fare-beating in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason,'' he said, ``even though he was on parole for
manslaughter and he indicated within two months of being released
on parole that he was still totally disrespectful of the laws, he
was not violated on parole.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Grant, a spokesman for the division of parole, said that a
fare-beating charge by itself was not considered sufficiently
serious to require sending Johnson back to prison. Nonetheless,
after the fare-beating arrest, the division issued a warrant for
Johnson's arrest after he stopped seeing his parole supervisor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Johnson was taken into custody Monday morning after a night in
which the police cast a massive dragnet throughout Staten Island.
Helicopters hovered overhead, dogs searched shrubbery, police vans
blocked off streets, officers stopped young men in the streets and
others combed the West Brighton Houses, where the shooting took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Teams of officers also went through the area acting on old
arrest warrants in the hopes of culling information about Johnson's
whereabouts. They even went to people not known to have any
connection with Johnson in the hopes that someone would know
something. This tactic led to his capture.
</P>
<P>
   A team of officers with the Emergency Services Unit, an elite
squad that performs rescues and executes search warrants, went to
apartment 2A at 820 Henderson Ave. at 3:30 a.m. to serve an
outstanding warrant on a man found guilty of driving with a
suspended license. When the officers arrived, the man was out and
two young women said they were there alone, but the officers saw
Johnson in a back room.
</P>
<P>
   Officer Christopher DeLevan, carrying a bulletproof shield,
walked into the back room with Officer Steve Blihar. At that point,
the police said, Johnson drew a .45-caliber handgun and pointed it
at the officers, but one of the women who lives in the apartment
was in the line of fire, so the officers did not shoot.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Blihar spun his partner to the side, so that the shield
covered them, and they charged Johnson, forcing him into a closet.
</P>
<P>
   For hours, they tried to talk Johnson out of the closet. Sgt.
Jack Cambria acted as the negotiator, trying to coax the suspect
out with promises of cigarettes and water. At 5:30 a.m. they struck
a deal: they would open the door and Johnson would walk out
backward with his empty hands raised.
</P>
<P>
   When they opened the door, the police said, Johnson was facing
the officers with a gun in his hand and pulled the trigger, but the
weapon did not fire. The officers again held their fire, pushing
Johnson back into the closet with their bulletproof shields. They
later found that Johnson had apparently dropped his ammunition clip
before firing.
</P>
<P>
   First Deputy Commissioner Patrick E. Keller _ who is commanding
the Police Department in the absence of Commissioner Howard Safir,
who is on vacation _ praised the officers for their bravery and
their restraint.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twice they had a gun pointed at them which was believed to be
fully loaded and they held their fire,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the officers cut a hole in the bottom of the closet
door and convinced Johnson to pass his gun out. He complied, and
was arrested at 8:30 a.m. The occupants of the apartment _ Tara
Hall, 17, and Tasha Hall, 20 _ were arrested on charges of aiding a
fugitive.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson was arrested on charges of attempted murder and assault
for the shooting of Gerard and on charges of first-degree murder in
the death of Eric Trotman, the man who shot at a nearby project on
July 16.
</P>
<P>
   Political pronouncements followed fast on the heels of the
arrest.
</P>
<P>
   It came as the Democratic-led state assembly prepared to return
to Albany Wednesday for a one-day special session in which they
plan to pass Jenna's law, the bill supported by Gov. George Pataki
that would eliminate parole for first-rime felony offenders.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican-controlled Senate passed the measure in May, and
Pataki has said he would sign the bill into law. Among other
things, the bill would require inmates to serve 85 percent of their
maximum sentence, up from the 66 percent they are currently
required to serve.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said that the shooting of Gerard showed that the state
should go further in ending parole. ``It never should have
happened,'' he said, ``because a long time ago we should have done
away with parole for all offenses, not the kind of watered-down
version the state Legislature is now talking about, and for
juveniles.''
</P>
<P>
   And Pataki issued a statement saying that the case illustrated
the need for the legislature to pass another bill he is pushing,
the Juvenile Justice Reform Act, which, he said, ``was designed to
prevent such outrageously lenient sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's earlier conviction for manslaughter stemmed from an
incident on March 25, 1996, when he was 15. Johnson and an
accomplice, Kinte Carter, who was then 17, were convicted of
beating a 38-year-old homeless man to death after a dispute over
$10, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The beating took place outside Papa Joe's Liquors, in the same
West Brighton neighborhood where Johnson lived and where Carter was
shot. Johnson and Carter got into a fight with the homeless man,
Richard Martin, and beat him severely.
</P>
<P>
   Martin died the next day, and his death was initially attributed
to natural causes. A week and a half later, when the results of an
autopsy showed that his spleen had been ruptured and his ribs
fractured, the police began an investigation. They arrested the two
youths and both were indicted on manslaughter charges.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter _ the most
serious charge against him _ and was given a one- to three-year
sentence, which he served at the Harmen Valley Secure Center, a
youth facility. Carter, who was viewed as the aggressor, was
sentenced to two to six years.
</P>
<P>
   When Johnson came up for parole on Feb. 19, 1997, the board
turned him down, writing: ``It is the opinion of the board that
your release is incompatible with the interest of society. The
severity of your offense, manslaughter one, in which you and your
codefendant beat your victim to death, militates against your
discretionary release.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 10, 1998, when he served two-thirds of his sentence, he
was freed, as is mandated by law.

IRAQ MAY HAVE ABILITY TO MAKE NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AGENCY REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BARBARA CROSSETTE and JUDITH MILLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seven years after Iraq pledged to dismantle its nuclear weapons
program, international inspectors still suspect that Iraq may be
hiding the documents, equipment, and material needed to make an
atomic weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The International Atomic Energy Agency, in a report Monday to
the United Nations Security Council, said that it has found no
evidence that Iraq has nuclear weapons. But the agency said that
Iraq's failure to account for key nuclear equipment and technical
blueprints leaves open the possibility that it has hidden the
necessary expertise and material for future use.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. and foreign intelligence officials have also become
increasingly concerned about Baghdad's nuclear capabilities,
including the inability of inspectors to confirm that Iraq
destroyed a furnace that can melt uranium into the spheres forming
the core of a nuclear bomb. Iraq maintains that it has destroyed
the furnace, but a foreign intelligence official said the
international inspectors were pressing Iraq to document that
assertion during their latest mission, which ended July 3.
</P>
<P>
   The agency, the United Nations' nuclear monitoring arm, must
tell the Security Council that it is satisfied with Iraq's
disclosures about its nuclear program as a condition of lifting
sanctions imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. official said that he did not believe Iraq has a ``bomb
in the closet.'' But he said he was disturbed by the inspectors'
inability to get answers about Iraq's nuclear expertise and offers
of assistance from countries with sophisticated nuclear energy
programs.
</P>
<P>
   In their report, the international inspectors criticized Iraq
for its lack of full transparency about the secret nuclear program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Indeed it is prudent to assume that Iraq has retained
documentation of its clandestine nuclear program, specimens of
important components, and possibly amounts of non-enriched
uranium,'' the agency said in its report.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said that ``there remains in Iraq a considerable
intellectual resource in the form of the cadre of well-educated,
highly experienced personnel who were employed in Iraq's
clandestine nuclear program.''
</P>
<P>
   The report is likely to create problems for those members of the
Security Council who were expecting to begin lifting the sanctions
step by step. An embargo on Iraq oil sales will be lifted only when
inspectors certify that Baghdad has fully dismantled its nuclear,
biological and chemical weapons programs and long-range missile
systems. Iraq hoped its nuclear program would the first to pass
that test.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report said they agency would continue to look into reports
that Iraq received an offer of assistance from a foreign nuclear
expert. This appears to be a reference to A.Q. Kahn, the father of
Pakistan's nuclear program, who has denied he offered any such
help.
</P>
<P>
   It also criticizes Iraq for not providing the agency with
drawings of a weapon design, experimental test data, and other
documents related to its nuclear program, and in particular, its
use of centrifuges to produce weapons grade uranium and what is
called a vacuum induction furnace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Iraq did have a program to be able to make these furnaces
indigenously,'' said David Albright, president of the independent
Institute for Science and International Security. ``This is an
essential component in making a bomb,'' he added, ``but of equal
concern is Iraq's unwillingness to give the inspectors unfettered
access to the Iraqi nuclear experts.''
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Albright, a leading private expert on the Iraqi nuclear
program, said he was ``disappointed'' with the latest agency
report. Albright, who has been critical of the agency in the past,
said: ``Iraq still refuses to provide a lot of information about
how close it came to developing nuclear weapons. So the report
doesn't raise the alarm sufficiently about Iraq's nuclear
capabilities.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Clinton administration official, who spoke on condition
of anonymity, agreed, but said he was pleased that the report did
not appear to endorse the desire of some members of the Security
Council to hear that Iraq has answered the major outstanding
questions about its program. Therefore, the official added, it will
be hard for the Security Council to give Iraq a clean bill of
health and close the nuclear file when it considers the report this
week.
</P>
<P>
   The agency action team responsible for inspecting Iraq visited
Iraq most recently between June 29th and July 3. It was led by Gary
Dillon, a British citizen and longtime agency official who is
expected to brief the Security Council on his trip Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Security Council decides during its next sanctions review
in October that Iraqi inspections can move to long-term monitoring
from hands-on disarmament and destruction of material, the report
said, a range of intrusive inspection techniques will have to be
used. These include unannounced inspections of any site, aerial
surveillance photography and an almost total environmental
monitoring of air, water, soil and vegetation.
</P>
<P>
   Spelling out these measures now may in part be intended to meet
concerns of independent arms control experts who charge that the
agency has not in the past been rigorous enough in Iraq and cannot
be counted on to be as intrusive in the future as the U.N. Special
Commission, which is inspecting and destroying biological and
chemical weapons systems and missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq, however, is already quibbling over the terms of long-term
monitoring, the report reveals.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis will not allow the agency planes to use the Rashid
air base near Baghdad, where the inspectors have their
headquarters. The inspectors will have to continue to use the
Habanniya base, an isolated wreck of a military installation more
than an hour's drive from the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the Iraqis told agency representatives this month,
that if there will be a comprehensive environmental detection
program, the intrusive inspections should be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   The Iraqis also demanded access to raw data collected in
surveillance, ``in particular the data collected through aerial
radiation surveys,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq's hopes that not only the nuclear file but also inspection
programs for biological, chemical and missile system might be
shifted to a new level this year seem to be dimming on all fronts.
Richard Butler, executive chairman of the Special Commission, will
go to Iraq this weekend to gauge Iraqi progress in non-nuclear
areas.
</P>
<P>
   The finding of the nerve gas VX by American weapons experts
examining missile shell fragments recently raises challenges to
Iraqi declarations that the gas had never been ``weaponized'' or
stored in a stable form.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq is also refusing to give Butler documents and other
material on an extensive biological program.
</P>
<P>
   In almost all these areas, including nuclear weapons. Iraq
denied the existence of anything more than research work until
President Saddam Hussein's son-in-law, Hussein Kamal, director of
the arms programs, defected to Jordan in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Iraq _ which claimed to find mountains of
incriminating documents in a chicken farm belonging to Kamal _ has
blamed him for concealing the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Kamal was killed when he went back to Iraq several months later,
apparently persuaded that he would be forgiven by the regime. Some
experts have suggested that his flight was staged. Others believe
that Kamal expected to start a new life abroad, apparently with a
great deal of Iraq's budget and his father-in-law's money, but was
disappointed when he sank into oblivion in Amman, and made a fatal
decision to chance a return.

COMMENTARY: IN BRAZIL, POLITICS IS THE ECOSYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNA, Brazil _ It's not often you get to walk through one of the
world's greatest rain forests at treetop level. It's not everywhere
you can look one of the rarest monkeys on earth, the golden-headed
lion tamarin, in the eye as he jumps from tree to tree. It's not
your average Sunday when you share a path with a caravan of
leaf-cutter ants carting away chunks of leaves to their anthill the
size of a pitcher's mound. It's not often you see termite nests as
big as pumpkins, hanging from rubber trees dripping with natural
latex. It is not every forest where a single hectare of land
contains as many as 450 different tree species, all wrestling for
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   No, Virginia, this is not the Rainforest Cafe. This is the real
deal. It is an eco-tourist park in Brazil's spectacular Atlantic
rain forest. The eco-park was built last year by rock climbers who
used bows and arrows to shoot ropes over the 100-foot-high trees
and then wove the ropes and netting together to create a treetop
canopy walkway, with connecting tree houses. The walkway winds
through the top of the rain forest and above cascading waterfalls.
Though the ropes and planks sway as you walk, the view is worth
every careful step.
</P>
<P>
   The canopy walk is located outside the town of Una, in
northeastern Brazil, where the Atlantic Rain Forest once covered
the entire coast. Today only 5 percent has survived loggers and
slash-and-burn farmers. I toured the Una area forest with
Conservation International, which, using grants from Budweiser and
Ford, is trying to help save what's left of one of the great
ecosystems on the planet by creating a tourist industry here that
will pay better than logging.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not a travel column. This is a column about the
unusual coalition that formed to make this canopy walkway possible.
</P>
<P>
   First there is Keith Alger, who runs an environmental
organization near Una with 15 Brazilian scientists. Alger, an
American political scientist married to a Brazilian monkey
specialist, came here originally with the very American
environmentalist view that he would save the rain forest by helping
educate Brazilians about its ecological significance. He learned,
however, that as long as he couldn't provide jobs for the loggers
who would be put out of business by keeping the rain forest
pristine, he was talking to himself. Says Alger: ``They would tell
me that they want to save the rain forest, but their jobs were also
endangered species. If I wanted to save the rain forest, I had to
help deliver jobs for them.''
</P>
<P>
   So Alger became an environmental entrepreneur. With one hand he
and his Brazilian team fought the loggers in a seven-year battle
that ended two months ago with the Brazilian government finally
banning all logging in this rain forest. With the other hand he
worked with the mayor of Una, himself a logger, to create jobs _
through eco-tourism projects like the canopy walk (which is near a
five-star hotel that now employs 600 people), by increasing farming
within the rain forest with crops like cocoa and coffee that can be
harvested in the shade of the trees, and by helping the local
government line up farm loans and computer equipment.
</P>
<P>
   This effort led him to George St. Laurent, an American
entrepreneur-turned-environmentalist who opened a factory in Bahia
state, where Una is located. His company, Vitech, manufactures
personal computers for the Brazilian market in an old cocoa
factory. St. Laurent got tax incentives from the governor of Bahia
to open his high-tech factory here. But he told the governor that
he needed more than tax breaks if he was going to attract computer
engineers from Sao Paulo and Silicon Valley to move to Bahia. ``I
told him we need a nice environment,'' said St. Laurent. ``I told
him computer engineers can live anywhere. They want a high quality
of life and places they can go on weekends. If they happen to live
next to one of the most exciting biodiversity systems, they would
rather be part of it than watch it destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, this brought around the mayor of Una, Dejair
Birschner. The mayor clearly understands now that the rain forest
has to be protected, even though it has put him out of business.
But practically, he has hundreds of people out of work, and loggers
are threatening him personally. ``Some 40 percent of our people
live in wooden shacks,'' said the mayor, ``and since the cocoa
industry collapsed, things have gotten really bad here. I don't
blame Keith for telling us the truth _ that logging was not
sustainable. But if people can't eat, they will cut trees, and no
one can stop them. We will have to produce jobs ourselves. But
Keith will have to play his part too.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right. The only way to save the rain forest today is with
this sort of collaboration: environmentalists who can create jobs,
high-tech entrepreneurs ready to use their enormous leverage in
today's world to promote the environment, groups like Conservation
International that can get corporate sponsors to kick in, and local
officials ready to adapt. Without more coalitions like this, the
only rain forest your kids will ever see will indeed be the
Rainforest Cafe.

CAPITOL SHOOTING EXPOSES CRACKS IN MENTAL-HEALTH CARE SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mont., N.Y., Va.)  (Eds: See also CAPITOL-SHOOTING-RDP) 
(js) 
 By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Russell Weston Jr., the suspect in the fatal shootings
of two police officers in the nation's Capitol, may have chosen an
unusually public place to explode. But his history of mental
illness has much in common with other delusional mentally ill
people who become violent, illustrating both the cracks in the
nation's mental-health system and its difficulty in mandating
treatment even for those it knows could become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's illness was well-known to family and mental health
officials. But because of the closing of state mental hospitals
across the country and the failure to build a promised network of
local clinics, the treatment of choice for him, as for the vast
majority of mental patients, was the honor system: counting on him
to give himself the often unpleasant antipsychotic drugs prescribed
for his paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   With Weston, the problem was compounded by living in rural areas
where psychiatric treatment and monitoring are extremely limited.
He also traveled between two states, Montana and Illinois,
encouraging at least one to solve his long-term care by sending him
back to the other.
</P>
<P>
   When Weston became violent, the reasons behind his behavior were
typical of the small group of mentally ill people who become
violent, recent research shows. He was not taking his medication,
he may have been using other drugs, and he had paranoid delusions _
in his case that the government was out to get him, using satellite
dishes aimed at his cabin or assigning Navy Seals and CIA
operatives to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and president of the
Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va. , said ``Mr. Weston is
an absolutely textbook case of what some of us have been saying for
years'' _ the dangers inherent in leaving untreated someone with
paranoid schizophrenia who does not understand he is ill.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that there are about 100,000 people with
schizophrenia nationwide who are not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is preventable, Torrey said, given the development
of powerful drugs that can stabilize patients with severe mental
illnesses. In the 1960s states began to close mental hospitals
because the drugs offered a more humane _ and less expensive _ way
to treat the mentally ill in their communities. That approach,
however, required a network of community clinics to make sure
patients took the drugs, and those clinics were not built.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many people with schizophrenia, manic-depression
and severe depression stop taking their drugs and regress. Each
year some are held in jails or prisons because of the bizarre
behavior that results.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey's advocacy group seeks to improve treatment of the
seriously mentally ill and to change laws that make it difficult to
commit mental patients against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems exist throughout most of the country. In
Westchester County, N.Y., in June, Michael Laudor, a Yale Law
School graduate who had won book and movie deals for the story of
his successful battle against schizophrenia, was charged with
stabbing his fiance to death. His medications had become
ineffective, friends said, but he had not been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The mental-health net is especially weak in rural areas, where
the nearest psychiatrist may be 100 miles away and there is often
an aversion to government spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, where Weston lived in a cabin over much of the past
20 years, ``It is so hard to get psychiatric treatment you usually
have to get arrested to get treatment,'' said Wesley Alcorn, a
member of the state board of the National Alliance for the Mentally
Ill, a group made up of relatives and friends of mentally ill
people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, under Montana law, for a person to be committed to the
state hospital at Warm Springs, he must pose an imminent threat to
himself or others, ``which is usually interpreted to mean he must
be pointing a gun at himself or someone else,'' Alcorn said. Many
people with mental disorders are simply put in the local jail, he
said.

LEWINSKY CASE CLOSES IN ON CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica S. Lewinsky, the former White House intern,
ended six months of silence Monday and met with prosecutors for
independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr, in a move that may foreshadow
a grand jury showdown between Lewinsky and President Clinton as the
investigation into their relationship seems near its end.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's meeting came on the same day that Clinton's defense
was dealt yet another severe setback. The U.S. Court of Appeals
ruled late Monday afternoon that Clinton's closest confidant, White
House deputy counsel Bruce Lindsey, is not protected by
attorney-client privilege and must honor a subpoena to testify
before a federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton and his lawyers, the options grow scarcer by the
day. Lewinsky's meeting with prosecutors marked the first time
since January that Lewinsky, accompanied by her newly hired legal
team, talked personally and directly to the prosecutors who will
decide her legal fate. To that end, it also signaled a possible
breakthrough in Starr's efforts to either grant her immunity or
seek her criminal indictment. By Monday night, no decision was
apparent.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of Lewinsky's meeting with prosecutors was
particularly notable, coming just days after it became publicly
known that Clinton has been subpoenaed by Starr to appear before
the grand jury. Under the terms of the subpoena, Clinton would be
expected to appear for testimony Tuesday, but aides said that will
not happen as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton and Lewinsky have denied under oath that they
engaged in a sexual relationship with each other. But Lewinsky was
captured on hours of secret tape recordings discussing sexual
encounters with the president. Starr is specifically investigating
whether Clinton committed perjury in his denial and whether he
pressured Lewinsky to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day Monday, Clinton's personal attorney, David
Kendall, negotiated with Starr's office over the guidelines and
venue for any presidential. Meanwhile, White House officials and
lawyers continued to indicate that Clinton would fight the subpoena
before the Supreme Court rather than appear in person before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Clinton insisted that any testimony
be videotaped at the White House, with his lawyer present, and
shown later to the grand jurors. Witnesses usually answer
prosecutors' questions in front of the grand jury with no lawyer
present.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Office of Independent Counsel as we
have in the past to devise a way for the president to provide
information for the OIC's investigation consistent with his
constitutional role and responsibility,'' Kendall said in a
statement Monday. It was his first public acknowledgement that
negotiations were under way over whether and how the president may
comply with the subpoena.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of a presidential subpoena is a controversial and
murky one. Never in the nation's history has a president been
subpoenaed to testify before a grand jury in a criminal case, and
constitutional scholars are split on the legality of such a step.
In 1974, President Nixon was ordered by the Supreme Court to turn
over his White House tapes, but his own testimony was never
compelled.
</P>
<P>
   On the Lindsey decision, three appellate judges _ two of them
Clinton appointees _ issued the highly anticipated ruling that
could bring Lindsey, Clinton's closest adviser on the thorniest of
legal, personal and political issues, before the grand jury in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
   ``A government attorney may not invoke the attorney-client
privilege in response to grand jury questions seeking information
relating to the possible commission of a federal crime,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thus, Lindsay's advice on political, strategic or policy
issues, valuable as it may have been, would not be shielded from
disclosure by the attorney-client privilege,'' the judges said.
</P>
<P>
   The judges also noted that it is the duty of government lawyers
``to defend clients against criminal charges and it is not to
protect wrongdoers from public exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said Monday they were reviewing the ruling
and contemplating an appeal to either the full panel of appellate
judges or the Supreme Court. The last time the White House appealed
an appellate ruling, on the order that Secret Service agents were
compelled to testify, the administration immediately lost its bid
for relief before any higher court.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials also complained that Monday's Court of
Appeals ruling could have long-term implications, chilling the
relationships between public officials and their government legal
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals has decided
that, unlike every other attorney and client in this country,
government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the right to
have confidential communications,'' said Charles F.C. Ruff, the
White House legal counsel, in a written statement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government officials and lawyers need to have frank and candid
conversations,'' Ruff said. ``The attorney-client privilege serves
the public interest by fostering fully informed and more accurate
decision-making because officials are more likely to seek legal
advice and attorneys to provide that advice. Without the privilege,
frank and candid exchange of information and advice will be
chilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's meeting with prosecutors, held at an undisclosed
location outside of Washington, seemed indicative of a dramatic
shift in legal strategy by either Starr or Lewinsky or both of
them. When William Ginsburg of Los Angeles worked as Lewinsky's
lawyer, he refused to have his client talk directly to Starr's
prosecutors until she was given full immunity. The two sides
haggled over an immunity deal that was never reached and their
relationship deteriorated into an angry, silent stalemate.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, widespread press reports indicated that Lewinsky, in
a written proffer, had agreed to testify before the grand jury that
she and Clinton had a sexual relationship. But she declined to
testify to the potentially more serious allegation, that Clinton
had pressured her to lie about the affair under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In June, Lewinsky fired Ginsburg and hired two prominent
Washington criminal defense attorneys, Plato Cacheris and Jacob
Stein, each of whom have personal ties to Starr or to lawyers in
his office.
</P>
<P>
   Starr now founds himself with three options in his dealing with
Lewinksy: indict her for perjury in hopes that she will become more
cooperative in the face of criminal charges; grant her sweeping
immunity if she will detail her relationship with Clinton; or
subpoena her before the grand jury under a more restricted form of
immunity.
</P>
<P>
   With Washington engulfed in speculation about the legal
manueverings of the Starr investigation, Clinton went about his
presidential business. Monday he attended a forum on Social
Security in Albuquerque. He is planning to speak at the memorial
service Tueday afternoon for John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, the
two Capitol Police officers slain in Friday's rampage.

 BOSTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge committed Weston to the Warm Springs hospital for 53
days in 1996, apparently after Weston made a threat against
President Clinton and was interviewed by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   After being placed on medication, he was released on Dec. 2,
1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no longer a threat to
himself or others,'' according to a spokesman for Gov. Marc
Racicot. A hospital employee drove him to his cabin in nearby
Rimini, the spokesman said, and made arrangements for him to
receive further treatment at a mental health center in Waterloo,
Ill., near his parents' rural home outside Valmeyer in southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn described this as ``Greyhound therapy,'' a way to save
Montana money by buying Weston a one-way bus ticket for a trip out
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents and
sister, April Callahan, said that he returned to Illinois with
three medications (whose names they did not remember) and that he
stopped taking them about a week later, despite his family's
protests. While his family described their growing concern over his
paranoid delusions, they also seemed to understand little about how
to seek help for him, or what treatment was available.
</P>
<P>
   The only community mental health clinic in Waterloo is Human
Support Services, a state-funded center. A spokesman for the
clinic, Rob Singer, refused to say on Monday whether Weston had
been a client there after his return from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said people like Weston would be less likely to fall
through the cracks if states like Montana and Illionois used
existing laws that provide for involuntary outpatient treatment.
Such laws allow states to force a patient to take his medication if
he fails to show up for appointments at a local clinic or stops
taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a shooting like that attributed to Weston is
particularly difficult because the relationship between mental
illness and violence is very sensitive, and many experts have been
cautious about publicizing new research suggesting that in certain
situations the emotionally disturbed are more violent than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Such situations occur when mentally ill persons have strong
paranoid symptoms that someone is out to get them or hear a voice
telling them to kill, said Bruce Link, a professor at Columbia
University School of Public Health. Another is when a patient fails
to show up for treatment or is off his medication, said Jeffrey
Sawnson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a MacArthur Foundation study found that mental
patients are no more violent than others unless they are abusing
drugs or alcohol. And Swanson said it is important to remember that
the mentally ill are responsible for only about 4 percent of
overall violence, making mental illness a smaller risk factor for
violence than being young, male or poor. But in a sign of how the
experts disagree on the subject, Torrey stressed that mentally ill
people commit 1,000 homicides a year.

PATRIOTS PLAYER PLEADS INNOCENT TO ASSAULTING EX-GIRLFRIEND 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   WRENTHAM, Mass. _ Ben Coates, a star pro football player for the
New England Patriots, pleaded not guilty in District Court Monday
to allegedly attacking a jealous ex-girlfriend during a
confrontation Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Coates, 28, at his home in the Chestnut Ridge
Condominiums, Franklin, Mass., around 10:30 p.m. after the alleged
attack on Jennifer Marshall, 27, the mother of Coates' young
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   He was released Sunday night on cash bail of $500, but
prosecutors convinced a judge to raise Coates' bail to $1,000
during the arraignment. The judge also issued a no-abuse order to
Marshall. Coates' lawyer did not contest the move.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall, who suffered a cut on her arm during the incident
outside Coates' condominium, did not seek a restraining order.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-5 inch, 245-pound Coates, an All-Pro tight end who is
married with three children, remained silent throughout the hearing
and refused to talk to reporters afterward. A pretrial conference
has been set for Aug. 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am certain that at the end of this legal process it will be
clear that Ben has done nothing wrong,'' defense lawyer Peter
Barlow said after the hearing. ``Ben only wants to get back into
the business of playing football. He is a quiet and private person
who likes to remain within the parameters of the playing field.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Franklin police report, Marshall and a friend,
Corina Parkinson, 22, of Norwood, drove to Coates' house at around
10:30 p.m. on Sunday and knocked on the door.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall was apparently upset because she saw an unfamiliar car
in the driveway, the report states. During the confrontation, the
two shouted and shoved one another.
</P>
<P>
   In their accounts to police, Coates and Marshall blamed one
another for the assault.
</P>
<P>
   In her statement to police, Parkinson said she and her friend
believed the car belonged to Coates' new girlfriend. She said they
wanted to take pictures of the woman and the car.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall told police she became upset when she saw the car in
the driveway and knocked on Coates' front door.  &UR;  &LR; A heated argument
ensued, drawing curious neighbors from their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall and Parkinson say Coates came from the house screaming
at Marshall, then pushed her to the pavement. Marshall told police
that when she pushed him back, Coates slammed her head to the hood
of the car, and threatened to knock her out.
</P>
<P>
   But Coates told police that Marshall initiated the assault. He
told officers she knocked on the front door, then attacked him when
he opened it. Coates said he pushed her away in self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   One neighbor, who did not want to be identified, said he saw the
incident and backed Coates' account. In an interview Monday, the
neighbor said Marshall initiated the confrontation and pushed
Coates first.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor, who said he lives close enough to hear their
screaming matches, said Marshall had gone after Coates before. On
one occasion, the neighbor said, Marshall kicked in the screen on
Coates' front door.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  During the off season, Coates resides in Concord, N.C., with
his wife Yvette and three daughters.
</P>
<P>
   Coates, who this fall will enter his seventh season with the
Patriots, is the highest-paid tight end in the NFL. His 1997
contract is worth $7.5 million over three years and featured a $3
million signing bonus.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 Coates broke the NFL tight end record for receptions
with 96, and for the past four season has been in the Pro Bowl,
being selected All Pro in the last two.
</P>
<P>
   Patriots vice president Don Lowery said the team completely
supports Coates. He said the player looks after the daughter he had
with Marshall, and ``he pays child support.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll, the head coach, would not talk about the incident
in detail, but said Coates' arrest ``does remind us again'' that
players are constantly in the limelight, and they must ``just avoid
the situations (where) that can happen.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, this can be a distraction for us, but we'll deal
with it as it comes,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The incident was the second in less than a week in which star
players faced assault charges.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  On Friday, a Boston clerk-magistrate threw out assault and
battery charges on Willie McGinest and Lawyer Milloy brought by a
23-year-old Boston woman who claimed the players attacked her in a
nightclub. The players claim they were helping the womman to her
feet after she stumbled and fell. The alleged victim did not appear
for a court hearing the next day.
</P>
<P>
   In January, quarterbacks Drew Bledsoe and Max Lane were named in
a lawsuit stemming from an incident during a rock concert at the
Paradise nightclub in Boston last November.
</P>
<P>
   The players were cleared of criminal charges, but a Maynard
woman who was injured claims the players landed on her after diving
from the stage into the crowd.

NEGOTIATORS IN GM STRIKE PRESS ON AS ARBITRATION NEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By KEITH BRADSHER with NICHOLE CHRISTIAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. _ Negotiators, seeking to resolve strikes at two
General Motors parts factories here, continued to put in long hours
Monday, as union officials, in particular, had an incentive to
settle before an arbitration ruling on the strikes' legality that
could come as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Talks continued at both struck factories, at a suburban Flint
hotel and at three other factories where the United Automobile
Workers union has also threatened strikes. People involved in the
bargaining said that an overall agreement was close, but cautioned
that it was impossible to predict when the last details would be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The strikes here have forced GM to close most of its North
American factories and lay off close to 200,000 workers. But
Monday, using replacement parts from outside suppliers GM reopened
two of its 29 assembly plants, a sport utility vehicle factory in
Silao, Mexico, and a Chevrolet Corvette factory in Bowling Green,
Ky.
</P>
<P>
   UAW officials criticized these moves and warned that workers in
Bowling Green might not cooperate. But Billy Jackson, the president
of the UAW local in Bowling Green, said that only one worker there
was involved in the installation of replacement parts _ gas pedals
that would normally come from a struck factory here and are now
being purchased from another company. The worker did not reject the
parts because GM could try to dismiss him in retaliation, Jackson
said.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of negotiations here picked up speed rather
suddenly on Saturday evening, at the end of four days of legal
arguments before an arbitrator, Thomas Roberts. A person briefed on
the arbitration said the UAW had filed several procedural motions
on Saturday, mainly seeking more time to respond to the
documentation that GM's lawyers had presented. Roberts turned down
all the motions and indicated that he would rule as soon as
Wednesday, said the person, who insisted on anonymity.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The UAW has little to gain from a ruling and much to lose, and
has been eager for a settlement since Saturday evening. A
settlement before Wednesday would be likely to include GM's
withdrawal of the grievance in arbitration, which would forestall a
precedent-setting ruling on the strikes' legality.
</P>
<P>
   The UAW's national contract with GM, which runs through
September 1999, allows local strikes only over increases in
assembly line speed, subcontracting disputes and health and safety
issues. The UAW has cited all these issues here, and has also
demanded that GM invest more money here and guarantee that jobs be
preserved. Those are the same demands that the union has made in
more than a dozen other local strikes over the last five years.
</P>
<P>
   A battalion of outside labor lawyers hired by GM argued before
the arbitrator last week that the UAW was really emphasizing only
the investment issues and was therefore in violation of the
national agreement. The UAW denied this. But if the union loses the
arbitration, it would face a pending federal lawsuit in which GM
has demanded that workers be forced to return to their jobs. GM,
having suffered heavy losses during the strike, has also sought to
have financial penalties imposed on the union, but labor lawyers
give it little chance of collecting damages.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of settling the strikes here only to face walkouts
elsewhere, GM is demanding that the UAW reach agreements at as many
factories as possible, and not just at the two struck here. The
other three factories where intensive bargaining is under way are
parts factories in Indianapolis and Dayton, Ohio, and a car
assembly plant here. The UAW had tried to keep threats of local
strikes alive to discourage GM from trying to sell or close the
factories.
</P>
<P>
   Nicholas Lobaccaro, an auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, estimated
that the strike had already cost GM at least $3.2 billion in
after-tax losses in the second and third quarters. But he added
that GM might be able to shave the final loss to $1.8 billion if it
settled now and ran a lot of overtime in its factories to refill
its dealerships quickly.
</P>
<P>
   GM executives have been hinting that they might stop production
of some money-losing models after the strikes, reduce the work
force more rapidly through attrition and perhaps close or sell a
few small factories. But such actions might have been inevitable
regardless of the strikes, and the potential gains of up to $500
million cannot fairly be offset against the cost of the strike,
Lobaccaro said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole idea this restructuring has something to do with the
strike is just giving Wall Street something to chew on as it looks
at the bill'' for the strike, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While UAW leaders are eager for an end to the strike, and while
GM executives would like to stem the company's losses, many
strikers are less enthusiastic about returning to work soon after
nearly two months of showing up only once a week for two-hour
stints on the picket lines. With cool, crisp weather here, many of
the strikers have been taking summer vacations, after five years of
working six or seven days a week to keep up with an unusually
strong auto market. While the workers' strike benefits are only
$150 a week, most have ample savings from their years of extensive
overtime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Give me a couple more weeks as long as this weather holds
out,'' said Jeff Irish, a 43-year-old heavy equipment repairman,
who has spent much of the last two months camping and sailing but
was in Flint on Monday morning picketing an auto body parts
factory.

 UNDATED: traditional states. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the regulatory process and financial transactions, the deal
will probably take more than a year to complete.
</P>
<P>
   Another potentially troublesome regulatory issue is that GTE
owns BBN Technologies, one of the nation's biggest carriers of
Internet traffic. The same rules that prevent Bell Atlantic from
supplying long-distance services within its region also apply to
long-distance data networks.
</P>
<P>
   BBN carries Internet data all over the country, including within
Bell Atlantic's Northeastern region. Bell Atlantic has asked the
Federal Communications Commission for a regulatory waiver that
would allow the company to build a long-distance data network, but
it appears unlikely that the commission will approve the
application, mostly because advanced technology would allow Bell
Atlantic to use the data system for voice calls.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the regulatory uncertainties, the drive to
consolidate is so strong in the telecommunications industry that
GTE was also approached about a possible merger by BellSouth Corp.,
according to people close to those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it appears that Bell Atlantic did not have to come up
with billions of additional dollars to woo GTE.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the deal, GTE's shareholders will get 1.22 Bell
Atlantic shares for each GTE share. Based on Bell Atlantic's
closing price of $45 Monday, that works out to $54.90 for each
share of GTE. GTE's shares closed Monday at $55.75, down 2 3/16.
Bell Atlantic shareholders are expected to hold 57 percent of the
merged company, said a person close to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   One reason GTE was interested in doing this merger, people close
to the talks said, was because of the recent string of high-level
defections, a result of the company moving its headquarters from
Stamford to Irving, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, J. Michael Kelly, GTE's chief financial officer,
left to become America Online's chief financial officer. In April,
GTE's chief planning and development officer, Dan Cohrs, left to
join Global Crossing, an undersea cable company. And last October,
Lewis Wilks, an executive who supervised new ventures designed to
take GTE beyond its core local-phone service business, joined Qwest
Communications International, the startup long distance company.
</P>
<P>
   That, combined with GTE's loss of its MCI deal to WorldCom, and
the impending acquisition of Ameritech by SBC, put GTE in a
situation where it needed to act fast.
</P>
<P>
   People close to the talks said that intensive discussions
between the two chief executives started in late June and that they
worked out the major points of the merger themselves, with bankers
being brought in two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, these people said, Bell Atlantic's Seidenberg
said repeatedly that he did not want bankers involved in the talks
because he feared leaks. Bell Atlantic was advised by Merrill Lynch
and the Bear Stearns Cos. GTE was advised by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co.

 &HT;    Ohio governor seeks to close private prison after six escape
 &HT;    By Tim Miller
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ Gov. George Voinovich wants to close the only
private prison in Ohio in the wake of a weekend escape that saw six
dangerous criminals slip through one fence, over another and make
their way into the city of Youngstown.
</P>
<P>
   In a strongly worded letter to state Attorney General Betty
Montgomery, Voinovich called the incident ``a very serious matter
impacting the health and safety of citizens in Youngstown and the
surrounding areas.''
</P>
<P>
   He asked Montgomery's office to research what can be done to
shut down the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center. The
medium-security prison is operated by the Nashville-based
Corrections Corp. of America to take prisoners from Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate officials did not return calls Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As of Monday afternoon, five of the six inmates were back in
custody. A massive search was continuing for the remaining escapee.
</P>
<P>
   The escape _ coming on the heels of two inmate murders, 13
stabbings and reports of violence against staff since the prison
opened in May 1997 _ intensified the already sharp political debate
in the capitol about the privatization of public services.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats seeking statewide office and those who make up the
minority in the General Assembly sharply criticized Republicans who
have pushed for privatization.
</P>
<P>
   ``Privatization simply does not work and Ohio should put an end
to putting profits before public safety,'' said Lee Fisher, the
Democratic candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Buerck, press secretary for Republican gubernatorial
candidate Bob Taft, said Taft agrees with Voinovich's decision. He
added, ``We should not rule out private prisons, but should
determine if this is a problem with one company or with the
concept.''
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Rhine McLin, D-Dayton, chairwoman of the Correctional
Institution Inspection Committee, also applauded Voinovich's move
to try to close the prison, but said if that proves difficult due
to legalities, other steps must be taken.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prison operates under a contract between the city of
Youngstown and Washington, D.C., so there may be legal concerns
that may take some time to resolve,'' McLin said. ``But we can
immediately increase the rules and regulations, and we should do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison was built by CCA to handle the overflow from public
prisons in the nation's capitol. It houses about 1,500 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   McLin said she may convene her committee as soon as next
Tuesday. She and other members of the committee tried to tour the
prison in April after continued reports of violence, but were
stopped at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps if CCA had been more cooperative in working with us
and other local and state officials, they could have avoided these
very serious problems,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the items McLin wants to discuss is increased staff
training, tighter security and perhaps having the state take over
the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now you have a situation where the experience of the
inmates is much greater than the experience of the staff and that
poses a very serious problem,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The General Assembly did approve a bill in March increasing some
of the regulations on the CCA prison and requiring that the company
pay the costs for any unusual incidents, such as the weekend
breakout.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the anger expressed by government officials centered on
CCA's apparent violation of past promises and difficulty in
reaching company officials following the escape.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is classified as a medium security prison and the
company is under a federal court order to remove prisoners
classified as more dangerous. Four of the six escapees were
convicted murderers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This prison has had a disturbing history of problems including
being dishonest wZh the mayor of Youngstown and other local
officials and apparently violating a federal court order,'' said
Mike Dawson, Voinovich's press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Davey, communications director for Attorney General
Montgomery, said the office is considering ways to get ``legally
involved in this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are united (with the governor) in our displeasure with
what's gone on at the private prison, and the office will take a
hard look at the concept of private prisons,'' Davey said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why Montgomery had not actively supported legislative
attempts to tighten regulations on the prison, he said Montgomery
has a ``great respect for the legislative process'' and wanted to
let it work its course. But, he added, ``when the experiment in
northeast Ohio clearly has gone awry and the public is at danger,
it becomes clearly appropriate for the attorney general to adopt a
more aggressive role.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve Fought, press secretary for Democrat Mary Boyle, who is
opposing Voinovich for a U.S. Senate seat in November, said the
administration is acting correctly, but too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Sen. Rhine McLin was denied access to the prison, that
should have been a red flag that something was terribly amiss,''
Fought said. ``But nobody in the Voinovich administration was
listening.''
</P>
<P>
   Peter Wray, communications director for the Ohio Civil Service
Employees Union, which represents most of the employees as Ohio's
public prisons, said the problems in Youngstown should force the
state to halt plans for its own private prisons in northern Ohio,
near Grafton and Conneaut. Those facilities will hold Ohio
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should shut the process down now,'' Wray said. ``Making
money first and security second is a very bad idea.''

 &HT;    Prison privitization started out as good idea, ended up being
nightmare
 &HT;    By Tom Beyerlein
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ It seemed like a great deal at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Youngstown would sell a decrepit old manufacturing site on 100
acres of land to Corrections Corp. of America for $1 and give the
Nashville-based company a 10-year, 75 percent property tax
abatement worth more than $9 million.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange, CCA would build a privately run prison on the
former brownfield site and provide 350 good-paying jobs and an
annual payroll of $20 million to the economically distressed city.
</P>
<P>
   But the deal quickly went sour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost immediately, there were reports of assaults in the
facility and our guys _ the police _ couldn't get in there to
investigate,'' Youngstown Law Director Robert Bush Jr. said Monday.
There have been at least 13 stabbings, including two homicides,
since the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center opened in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since its inception, we've had nothing but problems, from the
assaults to the stabbings to the homicides,'' said Mayor George
McKelvey. ``Now the straw that definitely broke the camel's back is
the escape of six prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The six inmates from Washington, D.C. _ four of them serving
time for homicide _ escaped Saturday. All but one had been rounded
up by Monday.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said they will ask a federal judge this week to
order a ban on new prisoners, the continued lockdown of existing
prisoners, reclassification of all inmates' security levels and
removal of any inmates classified above medium-security.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Youngstown school board on Wednesday plans to ask
the city council to invalidate the tax abatement on the grounds
that CCA defaulted on its contract with the city by housing more
than 1,500 inmates and by accepting maximum-security inmates at the
medium-security prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``My phrase is, 'Don't tax my little house, tax the Big
House,''' said attorney Martin Hughes III, who is representing the
school board.
</P>
<P>
   CCA officials didn't return phone calls. But in a Monday news
release on another matter, the company said it is the industry
leader in private prisons with 64,946 beds in 79 facilities in the
U.S. and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In its annual report, CCA said it operates in 19 states and the
District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the United Kingdom and
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   In the report, company officials said they expect strong growth
in prison privatization. The company's net income grew from $5.6
million in 1993 to $53.9 million in 1997, according to the annual
report.
</P>
<P>
   Most CCA facilities were built and are owned by government
entities and are operated by CCA under contract. But the Youngstown
prison, Ohio's only private prison, was built by CCA to house
inmates from Washington, D.C. According to the report, the capacity
is 2,016, although there was a 1,500-inmate limit in the tax
abatement agreement.
</P>
<P>
   McKelvey said CCA officials told him in January there were no
maximum-security inmates at the prison, but ``in June or July, they
'discovered' 166 of them and moved them out. I call that a
credibility gap as wide as the Mississippi.''
</P>
<P>
   Prison inmates have a lawsuit against CCA pending in federal
court, raising concerns about safety and health care. The city of
Youngstown joined the inmates in asking U.S. District Judge Sam
Bell of Akron to order reclassification of the inmates' security
levels. Bell ordered the reclassification, and city officials said
CCA removed more than 160 inmates to other states.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, D.C., officials have acknowledged that the
Youngstown prison had received some of D.C.'s most incorrigible
inmates.

 BOSTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge committed Weston to the Warm Springs hospital for 53
days in 1996, apparently after Weston made a threat against
President Clinton and was interviewed by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   After being placed on medication, he was released on Dec. 2,
1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no longer a threat to
himself or others,'' according to a spokesman for Gov. Marc
Racicot. A hospital employee drove him to his cabin in nearby
Rimini, the spokesman said, and made arrangements for him to
receive further treatment at a mental health center in Waterloo,
Ill., near his parents' rural home outside Valmeyer in southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn described this as ``Greyhound therapy,'' a way to save
Montana money by buying Weston a one-way bus ticket for a trip out
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents and
sister, April Callahan, said that he returned to Illinois with
three medications (whose names they did not remember) and that he
stopped taking them about a week later, despite his family's
protests. While his family described their growing concern over his
paranoid delusions, they also seemed to understand little about how
to seek help for him, or what treatment was available.
</P>
<P>
   The only community mental health clinic in Waterloo is Human
Support Services, a state-funded center. A spokesman for the
clinic, Rob Singer, refused to say on Monday whether Weston had
been a client there after his return from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said people like Weston would be less likely to fall
through the cracks if states like Montana and Illionois used
existing laws that provide for involuntary outpatient treatment.
Such laws allow states to force a patient to take his medication if
he fails to show up for appointments at a local clinic or stops
taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a shooting like that attributed to Weston is
particularly difficult because the relationship between mental
illness and violence is very sensitive, and many experts have been
cautious about publicizing new research suggesting that in certain
situations the emotionally disturbed are more violent than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Such situations occur when mentally ill persons have strong
paranoid symptoms that someone is out to get them or hear a voice
telling them to kill, said Bruce Link, a professor at Columbia
University School of Public Health. Another is when a patient fails
to show up for treatment or is off his medication, said Jeffrey
Sawnson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a MacArthur Foundation study found that mental
patients are no more violent than others unless they are abusing
drugs or alcohol. And Swanson said it is important to remember that
the mentally ill are responsible for only about 4 percent of
overall violence, making mental illness a smaller risk factor for
violence than being young, male or poor. But in a sign of how the
experts disagree on the subject, Torrey stressed that mentally ill
people commit 1,000 homicides a year.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With the nation preparing to pay extraordinary
tribute on Tuesday in the Capitol's Great Rotunda to the two police
officers killed on Friday in a House corridor shootout, the father
of the suspect expressed his sorrow for the violent rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I apologize to the nation for the grief and the trauma that he
has caused,'' an agonized Russell Weston Sr., the father of the
suspect, Russell Weston Jr., said in a television interview. ``I'm
so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The elder Weston, 66, said he had ``always had to walk a tight
line'' with his son, in whom paranoid schizophrenia had been
diagnosed. The father said that he had wanted to try to control his
son but that he also had compassion for him because of his internal
torment.
</P>
<P>
   The 41-year-old son, known as Rusty, lies sedated and
ankle-cuffed to his bed in D.C. General Hospital, where he is
recovering from gunshot wounds he received, officials say, after he
blasted his way into the Capitol, leaving the two police officers
dead in a shootout after they tried to stop him.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged in federal court Monday with murder (the federal
courts were not open over the weekend), but no hearing date was
set, because of uncertainty over his physical condition.
</P>
<P>
   There is also some question about Rusty Weston's current
lucidity. His lawyer, A.J. Kramer, the chief public defender in the
District of Columbia, who was appointed Monday by the court, said
he and an associate had met with Weston for 45 minutes. But the
lawyer declined to provide any details about their conversation
other than to acknowledge that it was a dialogue and that Weston
was shackled to the bed.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said that Weston understood he was a prisoner
and that he was being medicated to calm him. They said he remained
in danger of heart problems and blood clots, and they credited Sen.
Bill Frist of Tennessee, who is a heart surgeon, with saving his
life. Frist treated Weston at the scene on Friday and rode with him
to the hospital in an ambulance, pumping air into his lungs and
applying pressure to his thigh to stop the flow of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Frist said Monday that he was unaware at the time that Weston
was the suspect. ``I didn't think about it until we were
three-quarters over on the ambulance ride,'' he told reporters.
``Again, from a physician's standpoint, you are not a judge, you
are not a jury, you are a physician.''
</P>
<P>
   The aftershocks of Weston's shooting rampage were evident
everywhere on Capitol Hill Monday as members of Congress and their
staffs returned to the building for the first time since they were
evacuated on Friday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Many wore black ribbons pinned to their lapels and laid bouquets
of flowers on the steps leading up to the Great Rotunda, where the
bodies of the two officers, Detective John Gibson, 42, and Officer
Jacob Chestnut, 58, of the Capitol Police, will lie in flag-draped
coffins on Tuesday for a special memorial service.
</P>
<P>
   Congress is calling the service a ``congressional tribute'' to
distinguish it from the 27 times in the nation's history that the
bodies of national leaders have lain in state in the Rotunda. The
tradition began in 1852 to honor Henry Clay, the former speaker of
the House, and was upheld most recently in 1989 to honor Rep.
Claude Pepper of Florida.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The makeshift shrine on the steps has accumulated flowers, flags
and notes, a copy of the Policeman's Prayer to St. Michael (``When
we lay down our night sticks, enroll us in your Heavenly Force''),
and a boom box that played Verdi's ``Requiem.'' Propped up in the
middle was the life-size figure of Jesus with two toy lambs placed
there daily by a regular visitor to the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Among the thousands of tourists at the Capitol on Monday was Ed
Kortefay, 43, of Lincoln, Neb., who said that he and his family had
long planned their vacation here for this week, and that the
shootings put the Capitol on ``the priority list of things to
see.'' Kortefay, who supervises a group home for troubled youths,
said he had little sympathy for the Weston family, despite their
apology.
</P>
<P>
   ``They feel obligated to relieve themselves of the guilt,'' he
said. He described Rusty Weston as ``a classic loner nutcase.''
</P>
<P>
   A few questioned why the police officers were not wearing their
bulletproof vests, even while acknowledging that vests would not
have protected Chestnut, who was shot in the head.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Trent Lott of Mississippi, the Republican leader, said
Monday that his security guard, who had not worn his bulletproof
vest in the past, was wearing it Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Lott also said that the shooting had given new urgency to plans
for a $125 million underground visitors center that would act as an
extra level of security.
</P>
<P>
   Congress had considered such a visitors center in 1991 but
rejected it as too costly. Back then, it would have cost $71
million. Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia, now the speaker but then
the minority whip, had called the visitors' center ``madness,''
saying, ``The American people should be able to come in the front
door of Congress, not the basement.''
</P>
<P>
   Eleanor Holmes Norton, the delegate from the District of
Columbia and a Democrat, complained at the time that such a center
might increase traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Their tone changed in 1995, when some members of Congress
proposed that the project be paid for with private donations, which
have since mounted to about $25 million. Already $2.5 million has
been spent on maps and architectural renderings of a three-level
underground orientation center, with shops and a restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we need another study,'' Lott told reporters
Monday. ``I think we need to get this done.'' Asked if the project
might be scaled back so that it would cost less, Lott said, ``If
we're going to do it, let's do it right.''

PATRIOTS SEE NO `DOUBLE-STANDARD' IN COATES CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SMITHFIELD, R.I. _ In the wake of tight end Ben Coates's arrest
Sunday night on assault charges and subsequent innocent plea in the
case, there will be no immediate ramifications regarding his status
with the Patriots, a team spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Coates' case is being compared with the case involving former
New England running back David Meggett, who was charged with sexual
assault in February. The charge was later dropped, but Meggett was
released at the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Don Lowery, the Patriots' vice president of development
and community affairs, was incensed that many were accusing the
Patriots of a ``double-standard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no double-standard,'' said Lowery. ``The Dave Meggett
case has nothing to do with what's happening to Ben. Nothing
whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowery said Coates has the team's complete support.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tight end acknowledged he has four children, three
with his wife and one with the alleged victim, Jennifer Marshall,
27, of Norton, Mass., and said, ``he pays child support.''
</P>
<P>
   The team also believes Coates is innocent of any wrongdoing,
which was echoed Monday by Coates's agent, Mike George.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, they'll find that Ben is not guilty. We're hoping
the charges will just be dropped, because we don't believe there's
a case.'' said George.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the Patriots have certainly made a statement
regarding their stand on abusive acts against women. They renounced
Christian Peter, a fifth-round pick in 1996, when they found out
about his long list of offenses against women. Meggett's release
seemed to follow the same pattern after the Toronto incident. But
now the team is saying that's not the reason they cut the kick
returner.
</P>
<P>
   ``David was released for a multitude of reasons,'' said Lowery.
``The incident in Toronto was of great concern, but it was not the
sole reason why he was released. David was released because of the
injury he sustained, for football concerns about his productivity,
and high salary cap number.''
</P>
<P>
   Owner Bob Kraft's wife, Myra, is the president of the Rose
Foundation, which raises funds for battered women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ben is the one who made the call to the police,'' said Lowery.
``He asked the woman to leave. She came back and he told her to get
off of his property.''
</P>
<P>
   Teammates appeared unfazed by the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Ted Johnson said he didn't notice Coates was missing
from practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously it didn't have that big of an effect on me,'' said
Johnson. ``I don't think it's that big of a deal because the
details haven't surfaced. Until we know what really went on, I'm
sure none of his teammates are going to pass judgment on him. I
don't think it'll be a distraction at all. I'm sure he'll deal with
it as best he can. Whatever problems we have off the field, I'm
sure we'll deal with it. We have a job to do on the field.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be a big deal if the Patriots have to start the season
without Coates, a four-time Pro Bowler, and with rookie Rod
Rutledge, Lovett Purnell, and Scott Dragos. Coates is Drew
Bledsoe's favorite receiver and is a vital part of the Patriots'
offense, perhaps second only to Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   Under league rules, the Patriots have notified the NFL office
about the alleged assault case, as they did with Meggett. In all
assault cases, the league requires that the player undergo
psychological evaluation. Lowery said that the league will likely
require the evaluation sometime next week. If Coates is convicted,
he would face a fine and possible suspension by the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates opportunities for young guys,'' said coach Pete
Carroll. ``We have to go about it in that manner. Rod Rutledge was
working with the first squad (Monday). It does open opportunities
for us to see other guys.''

ALBRIGHT REBUKES CHINESE ON ARREST OF DISSIDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PHILIP SHENON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines _ Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
protested to the Chinese foreign minister Monday over the arrest of
several political dissidents since President Clinton's visit to
China, a development that other administration officials said had
alarmed and embarrassed the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made quite clear that arresting people is not the way that
we see follow-through,'' Albright said at a news conference here
after meeting with Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan. ``So I can assure
you that the subject was raised.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright also called a special news conference to denounce
Burma's leaders for their treatment of the leading Burmese
dissident.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups say at least 15 democratic activists in
China have been detained since Clinton's meeting in Beijing last
month with president Jian Xemin. While some of the dissidents were
released within days, others remain jailed and appear likely to
face long prison sentences.
</P>
<P>
   One of the dissidents, Zhu Zhengming, 35, was released on Sunday
after 17 days of detention in the eastern city of Hangzhou, but he
said his freedom was still restricted by police. ``The police told
me I shouldn't meet certain people,'' Zhu said in an interview with
Reuters. ``I shouldn't say certain things and shouldn't do certain
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The detentions have dismayed senior Clinton administration
officials, who had portrayed the president's nine-day visit to
China as having advanced the issue of human rights there. Clinton
was allowed to make broadcasts on Chinese television and radio to
call for greater political freedom in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the major successes of the president's trip was to
raise human rights issues publicly in China,'' said Albright, who
is in the Philippines to attend an annual meeting of foreign
ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and other
countries with an interest in the region. ``I did raise our
concerns about some of the recent arrests.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials traveling with the secretary of
state, speaking on condition of anonymity, said she had protested
forcefully to the Chinese delegation led here by Tang.
</P>
<P>
   ``They couldn't miss the point,'' a senior official said, adding
that the arrests ``go in the opposite direction that we're looking
for _ that has an impact on the overall relationship.'' Another
U.S. official said Albright expressed concern to the Chinese
foreign minister ``about these recent steps backward in the human
rights situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Several Chinese dissidents are reported to have been arrested in
the last week alone. Human rights groups said that at least four
people were taken into custody Friday night in southern Hunan
Province.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday police arrested Zhang Shanguang, a prominent
dissident who had already spent seven years in jail, for trying to
organize a group of laid-off workers. Last Tuesday a Chinese court
sentenced a dissident, Fan Yiping, to three years in prison for
helping a fellow activist escape from China.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her criticism of the Chinese, Albright said she and Tang
``talked about the successes of the summit'' between the American
and Chinese leaders, ``which I think were great in terms of working
towards developing a strategic partnership with China.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And she noted the administration's pleasure in last week's
refusal by the House of Representatives to block Clinton's granting
of so-called normal trade relations status to China, formerly known
as most-favored-nations status.
</P>
<P>
   Albright said the vote ``signals the increasing acceptance of
the fact that having a relationship with China in trade does not in
any way change our stress on the importance of the human rights
agenda.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever her criticism of Beijing, it paled by comparison to her
attack Monday on the government of Burma, which is a member of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations and has found itself the
target of growing criticism by its neighbors over its human rights
record.
</P>
<P>
   Albright called a special news conference Monday to denounce the
Burmese junta for its treatment of the nation's most prominent
dissident, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Aung San Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize for her
campaign to bring democracy to Burma, was reported Monday to be in
the fourth day of a standoff with the military, which stopped her
car outside the capital, Yangon (formerly Rangoon), as she tried to
drive to a meeting with opposition colleagues. News reports say she
has refused to budge from the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are gravely concerned about the health and safety of Aung
San Suu Kyi and will hold the Burmese authorities directly
responsible for insuring her health and welfare,'' Albright said.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech earlier in the day to Asian foreign ministers,
Albright warned that Burma is in danger of social collapse. ``This
is a moment of truth and of urgency for Burma and for all of us
concerned about its fate,'' she said.

DEAL MAY GIVE BAY AREA 4 POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BECHTEL   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a move to would make it one of the state's largest power
companies, Calpine Corp. said yesterday that it and a unit of
Bechtel Group would spend $1 billion to build four new electric
generating plants in the Bay Area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; San Jose-based Calpine and Bechtel Enterprises, an affiliate
of the privately held San Francisco construction giant, plan to
build, own and operate the plants in a 50-50 partnership. The two
would split financing costs and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The four plants, with a total output of 2,000 megawatts, would
join eight other power plants that are in the development stage,
according to the California Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine and Bechtel said the first plant would be a 535- to
800-megawatt facility at the Dow Chemical facility in Pittsburg
(Contra Costa County), which Calpine announced that it was buying
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine also hopes to build a plant to help power San Francisco,
said Ron Walter, the company's senior vice president of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, PG&AMP;E announced that it was shutting down its
aging Hunters Point facility, which had become the target of
environmentalists and community groups who complained of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   However, Walter stressed that a plant need not be built within
San Francisco in order to help power the city.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in power plant construction is being fueled by at least
two factors. Energy deregulation in California, which began March
31, opened up the electricity market in the state, creating new
opportunities for companies to build power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the newly deregulated market comes at a time when many
of the existing power plants owned by the once-dominant utility
companies are aging and out of date.
</P>

DEAL MAY GIVE BAY AREA 4 POWER PLANTS 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - BECHTEL   By Kenneth Howe  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
In a move to would make it one of the state's largest power
companies, Calpine Corp. said yesterday that it and a unit of
Bechtel Group would spend $1 billion to build four new electric
generating plants in the Bay Area.
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; San Jose-based Calpine and Bechtel Enterprises, an affiliate
of the privately held San Francisco construction giant, plan to
build, own and operate the plants in a 50-50 partnership. The two
would split financing costs and revenues.
</P>
<P>
   The four plants, with a total output of 2,000 megawatts, would
join eight other power plants that are in the development stage,
according to the California Energy Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine and Bechtel said the first plant would be a 535- to
800-megawatt facility at the Dow Chemical facility in Pittsburg
(Contra Costa County), which Calpine announced that it was buying
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Calpine also hopes to build a plant to help power San Francisco,
said Ron Walter, the company's senior vice president of business
development.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, PG&AMP;E announced that it was shutting down its
aging Hunters Point facility, which had become the target of
environmentalists and community groups who complained of pollution.
</P>
<P>
   However, Walter stressed that a plant need not be built within
San Francisco in order to help power the city.
</P>
<P>
   The boom in power plant construction is being fueled by at least
two factors. Energy deregulation in California, which began March
31, opened up the electricity market in the state, creating new
opportunities for companies to build power plants.
</P>
<P>
   Secondly, the newly deregulated market comes at a time when many
of the existing power plants owned by the once-dominant utility
companies are aging and out of date.
</P>
<P>
   The latest major utility-owned power plant was built in 1972,
Walter said.
</P>
<P>
   New power plants often are controversial because they raise
concerns about pollution. However, Calpine and Bechtel stressed

</P>
<P>

GROUP WANTS PESTICIDE COMPANIES TO END TESTING ON HUMANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   (af)  
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Pesticide companies have conducted tests of
pesticides on humans and told the government that they expect to do
more, saying the tests may provide more reliable data than animal
tests and might justify less stringent rules on pesticides.
</P>
<P>
   However, an environmental organization Monday called on the
Environmental Protection Agency to impose a moratorium on human
experiments for purposes of pesticide regulation and to set
explicit new guidelines for any such research.
</P>
<P>
   The Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit organization based
in Washington that advocates tighter controls on pesticides,
discovered last week that documents about the little-known tests
were being circulated by the industry and the EPA, and described
them in a report issued Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The human experiments have raised scientific and ethical
concerns at a time when stricter regulation of some pesticides is
being contested by the industry. But a senior official of the EPA
said Monday that the agency questioned human testing of pesticides
and would review the matter.
</P>
<P>
   A senior aide to the EPA administrator, Carol M. Browner, who
spoke on condition of anonymity, said, ``We are very concerned
about the possibility of increased human testing as a way to
potentially avoid some of the protections that the Food Quality
Protection Act establishes.'' The 1996 law overhauled the system of
pesticide regulation.
</P>
<P>
   For decades, most pesticides were tested on laboratory animals
to determine how much exposure might trigger health problems in
people. The tests, conducted by the manufacturers, are used by the
EPA to set limits on the use of chemicals on crops, around the
home, or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Because regulators cannot be sure that the highly toxic
chemicals affect people in the same way they do animals, they first
use the animal tests to estimate safe doses and then use an extra
margin of safety, called an uncertainty factor, to make the legal
limits 10 times stricter.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid the uncertainty factor, industry officials have told
the EPA, the companies are increasingly likely to use humans for
tests of some chemicals.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of three tests conducted in England last year, for
example, adult volunteers were given small doses of the pesticide
dichlorvos to see how much it reduced their blood levels of
cholinesterase, an enzyme that affects brain and nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   Amvac Chemical Corp., the California manufacturer of the
chemical, has asked the EPA to consider the new data in its reviews
on the continued use of the pesticide.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday, Amvac said its experiments had
been conducted in a licensed laboratory in Cheshire, England, on
fully informed volunteers and had been reviewed by a medical ethics
committee. The company said there were no ethical reasons why
similar tests could not be conducted in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA is conducting a comprehensive review of the class of
chemicals known as organophosphates, which includes dichlorvos. The
agency is considering tightening the limits on the organophosphates
under provisions of the Food Quality Protection Act.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published in June that made recommendations to the
agency for implementing the new pesticide law, an industry
coalition said that human testing would probably be limited
``almost exclusively'' to short-term studies measuring whether
certain organophosphates inhibit cholinesterase in the blood.

STARR'S TEAM MEETS WITH LEWINSKY, PRESSES CLINTON TO TESTIFY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Escalating the pace of the investigation into an
alleged presidential affair and cover-up, prosecutors met Monday
for the first time in six months with former White House intern
Monica Lewinsky and pressed President Clinton to appear before a
federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a federal appeals court handed independent counsel
Kenneth Starr a major victory by ordering presidential confidant
Bruce Lindsey to cooperate with the grand jury investigation into
the alleged Clinton-Lewinsky affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling and Lewinsky's daylong meeting with Starr's deputies
were a setback for Clinton, and intensified pressure on his legal
team to reach agreement with Starr on how the president will
provide information to grand jurors without having to trek to the
courthouse.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is using the grand jury to examine whether Clinton or any
of his associates lied, urged others to lie or otherwise tried to
cover up alleged White House sexual encounters between the
president and Lewinsky and one other woman, Kathleen Willey.
</P>
<P>
   Both Clinton, 52, and Lewinsky, 25, have denied under oath
engaging in sex. Clinton has said he never told anyone to lie. The
president, who acknowledged meeting privately with Willey, denied
any inappropriate behavior.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations led earlier this year by her former attorney,
William Ginsburg, Lewinsky reportedly agreed to testify that she
and Clinton engaged in sex. That testimony would have been part of
a deal to avoid prosecution. At the same time, she declined to
offer anything regarding a cover-up attempt, which prompted Starr
to reject her offer of testimony-for-immunity.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Lewinsky has hired a new legal team, and
negotiations resumed with Starr, which sources said led to Monday's
meeting in New York. It was Lewinsky's first face-to-face session
with prosecutors since they confronted her six months ago after the
FBI secretly tape recorded her talking to a friend, Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   There was no indication late Monday that an immunity deal had
been worked out for Lewinsky. Starr spokesman Charles Bakaly did
not respond to requests for information about the meeting.
Lewinsky's lawyers, who were traveling, could not be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Late Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Washington upheld a
lower court ruling compelling Lindsey _ a longtime Clinton friend,
confidant and adviser on various scandals _ to answer all of
Starr's questions before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The three-judge appeals panel rejected the Clinton
administration argument that requiring Lindsey, who serves as
deputy White House counsel, to divulge his conversations with the
president would violate the long-recognized confidentiality of the
attorney-client relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``A government attorney may not invoke the attorney-client
privilege in response to grand jury questions seeking information
relating to the possible commission of a federal crime,'' said the
ruling by Appeals Judges Judith Rogers and David Tatel, who were
appointed by Clinton, and Raymond Randolph, an appointee of former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The duty of government lawyers, such as Lindsey and other White
House attorneys, ``is not to defend clients against criminal
charges, and it is not to protect wrong-doers from public
exposure,'' the judges said. ``Lindsey's advice on political,
strategic or policy issues, valuable as it may have been, would not
be shielded from disclosure by the attorney-client privilege.''
</P>
<P>
   White House counsel Charles F.C. Ruff issued a statement saying
that the president's legal team would review the opinion before
deciding whether to appeal. If Ruff and Clinton choose to fight the
decision, they could seek a review by all 11 members of the Court
of Appeals or could appeal directly to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals has decided that
unlike every other attorney and client in this country, government
attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the right to have
confidential communications,'' Ruff said, adding that frank and
candid conversations between public officials and government
lawyers ``will be chilled'' if the ruling is allowed to stand.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Clinton's private attorney David Kendall confirmed
that he was negotiating with Starr ``to devise a way for the
president to provide information for the investigation, consistent
with his constitutional role and responsibilities.'' Kendall added
that it ``would not be appropriate to comment further.''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury is to meet Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, and
Clinton's subpoena reportedly indicates he must show up this week
to testify. The date of his appearance could be pushed back while
Kendall and Starr resolve their differences over how Clinton
presents his information to the panel.
</P>
<P>
   The president reportedly is holding out for testifying on
videotape or closed-circuit television with his attorneys present
during questioning by Starr and his deputies. Starr is balking at
allowing anyone from Clinton's legal team to attend the interview,
sources said. Normally, witnesses' lawyers are barred from grand
jury rooms.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton refuses to testify, a constitutional crisis could be
triggered over the question of separation of powers or whether the
federal courts can compel a sitting president to testify in
criminal proceedings in which he could be a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   A decision to fight Starr's subpoena could be politically
harmful to Clinton in light of his promise early in the scandal to
answer questions about his relationship with Lewinsky. Since then,
the president has refused to discuss the relationship and, for the
most part, Starr's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three days, Clinton has ignored reporters who
raised questions about his subpoena and whether he plans to
testify.

SLEAZY PRACTICE OF SLAMMING MAKING GAINS IN CALIFORNIA  
 BY JONATHAN MARSHALL  

</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - SLAMMING   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
California's telephone industry regulators are discovering that the
price of consumer protection is eternal vigilance.
<TEXT>
<P>
   After nearly wiping out the problem of ``slamming'' _ the
improper switching of long distance service without a customer's
consent _ investigators at the California Public Utilities
Commission are alarmed by a sharp rise in new cases this year.
</P>
<P>
   In one ongoing investigation, they have learned that former
employees of a Georgia company, which allegedly slammed 90,000
California customers several years ago, are now running another
firm that has drawn complaints of slamming and ``cramming'' _ the
placing of unauthorized charges on phone bills.
</P>
<P>
   At the national level, the number of slamming complaints is
soaring. The Federal Communications Commission last year received
20,475 written complaints about slamming, up 134 percent over the
total in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   But California bucked that trend until recently through vigorous
regulatory enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The number of customer complaints about long-distance slamming
recorded by Pacific Bell ran about 20,000 a month in 1996 but fell
to a low of 5,022 this January.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cut slamming 80 percent through a novel approach: We
enforced existing laws,'' said Larry McNeely, deputy director of
the PUC's Consumer Services Division. ``We put every available
investigator on this and took the financial incentives and rewards
away from slammers. This was a frontal assault.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides yanking the operating authority of slammers in
California, the PUC slapped large fines on major violators and
worked closely with local district attorney's offices to arrange
further penalties for slammers and financial settlements for their
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal is to make the slammers disgorge any profits,''
McNeely said. ``That's where the DA's have been so helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   Since January, however, the lure of a fast buck has once again
invigorated slammers. The number of consumer slamming complaints
doubled to 10,166 in June, Pacific Bell said in its latest report
to the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the commission has only three investigators
assigned to utilities cases, involving electric as well as phone
company issues. It recently got budget authority for four more
enforcement positions but has not yet filled them.
</P>
<P>
   PUC investigators are particularly concerned about Georgia-based
America's Tele-Network Corp., which operates in about 30 states and
at its peak had about 10,000 California customers.
</P>
<P>
   In late March, the PUC opened a formal investigation of ATN
based on consumer complaints and the discovery that the company's
president and controller used to work for Sonic Communications, one
of the biggest slammers in California history.
</P>
<P>
   In one seven-month period in 1994, Sonic, also based in Georgia,
switched nearly 97,000 Californians to its long-distance service
from other carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Sonic sent out tens of thousands of $10 checks, which contained
tiny, light-gray print authorizing the service switch when the
checks were endorsed. In some cases Sonic allegedly switched
customers without any semblance of authorization.
</P>
<P>
   When Sonic began doing business in late 1993, the PUC's only
investigators were in the transportation division. The commission
was unprepared to deal with allegations of widespread
telecommunications fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem was totally out of control before anyone realized
it,'' McNeely recalled.
</P>
<P>
   The PUC, working with state attorneys general in Georgia,
Illinois, New York and Texas, shut Sonic down in 1995 and arranged
a $1.2 million settlement for California customers. The company
subsequently declared bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the PUC took the belated step of revoking Sonic's
operating authority _ even though the company has been defunct for
some time.
</P>
<P>
   PUC investigators were thus shocked to discover early this year
that Sonic's former information systems manager is now head of ATN
and that Sonic's controller is now ATN's controller. The launch of
ATN was funded in part with a personal loan from Sonic's founder.
Neither had disclosed their ties to Sonic when applying for
operating authority to the PUC.
</P>
<P>
   PUC investigators also heard from numerous consumers that they
had signed up with ATN under false pretenses. Many customers were
people who responded to newspaper ads placed by ATN, promising to
pay up to $600 a week for helping to market its service.
</P>
<P>
   Marlys Chamberlain, a Stockton retiree, wanted something to do
in her spare time and answered an ad last September. The ATN
representative promised her free long-distance service and a free
800 number as part of the job, if she switched service. She
willingly agreed.
</P>
<P>
   After several weeks of hearing nothing more about the job, she
began to worry about being scammed. ``That was kind of dumb of me,
but I didn't spend any money,'' Chamberlain recalled thinking at
the time.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got her next monthly phone bill. It included a $10
service charge from ATN, a $10 charge for 800 service, a $4 charge
for calling-card service and several other charges, including a
long-distance call she never made. ``My husband had a big old
fit,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Chamberlain, a former employee at the Department of Consumer
Affairs in Sacramento, complained to Pacific Bell, the FCC, PUC and
anyone else she could think of. Eventually ATN returned her money,
but other consumers interviewed by the PUC weren't so lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ATN's attorney, Charles Helein, said the company is negotiating
a settlement with the PUC, without admitting guilt, rather than
waging an expensive battle to fight the charges. ``The best defense
in the world won't get you much down the road with regulators,'' he
said. ``They don't want to hear the facts.''
</P>
<P>
   Helein, who previously represented Sonic, said that Sonic was
innocent of slamming but was convicted in the press ``before they
could open their mouth.''
</P>
<P>
   He also said the ATN employment ads that brought some customers
to it were genuine, not come-ons.
</P>
<P>
   And he said it's not illegal to put unauthorized charges on a
customer's bill for services they never ordered. Eager
telemarketers frequently get carried away and misunderstand a
customer's grunt as approval, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a highly competitive market with commissions, you can
expect there will be a lot of Wild Bill Hickocks out there shooting
from all sides,'' he said. ``I'm not trying to justify that
practice, but ... there's no law against it.''
</P>
<P>
   PUC investigators said ATN's alleged slamming was hard to trace
because the company resells long-distance service from WorldCom, so
orders show up under WorldCom's name. AT&AMP;T recently curbed its
marketing efforts after its anonymous resellers generated a rash of
slamming complaints against the company.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed the Consumer
Anti-Slamming Act, which imposes fines of $40,000 to $150,000
against offenders. A similar bill is now before the House
telecommunications subcommittee.

SEATTLE SEX SITE WANTS TO BE FIRST TO GO PUBLIC  
 BY JON SWARTZ 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - IPO   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
   The next big Internet IPO is generating a buzz in the investment
community _ but not because of a breakthrough technology or
marketing plan.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet Entertainment Group, the money-making online company
best known for marketing the sex video of actress Pamela Anderson
and rocker Tommy Lee, says it plans a stock offering in six months.
If successful, it would be the first U.S. adult-entertainment Web
site to go public, as well as one of the only public online
companies turning a profit.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  In addition to porn, IEG sells psychic services, vitamin
supplements and golf equipment via the Internet. It plans to use
its IPO proceeds to buy other porn sites and distribute its content
over televisions equipped with Internet set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to be the Viacom of new media,'' company CEO Seth
Warshavsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Warshavsky, 25, said his 100-person Seattle company _ one of the
biggest and best-known online pornographers _ is sifting through
audits and talking to prospective underwriters &UR;  &LR; in preparation for
an IPO.
</P>
<P>
   Smut sites are among the most financially lucrative _ and
technologically advanced _ on the World Wide Web. They are pioneers
in real-time video, electronic commerce transactions and graphic
design.
</P>
<P>
   But none in the United States has gone public because of the
stigma attached to their content. A continued strong Internet IPO
market, however, could improve the climate for IEG and others to be
publicly traded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make a lot of money by selling sin, and that could be
enticing to investors,'' said Tom Taulli, market analyst for IPO
Monitor in Calabasas (Los Angeles County). ``IEG is creating
another Playboy. Sex sells, but even more on the Internet, where
you can order porn from your personal computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Web sites, which give away their content in hopes of
generating a big enough viewer base to sell advertising, IEG is
charging subscribers $24.95 monthly to gawk at thousands of
pornographic photos, video clips and live cybercasts. It also sells
ads for sex-related products and services.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The business model, aided by low overhead costs, has made IEG
one of the most profitable ventures online. The Seattle-based
company said it anticipates earnings of at least $15 million on
sales of $40 million this year. Warshavsky said he hopes to raise
at least $40 million to $50 million in an offering.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Inc., by comparison, has reported earnings of $15 million
on sales of $96 million over the past three quarters. The Santa
Clara-based company, which provides an Internet search engine, chat
rooms, news and shopping services, has a market valuation of $8.9
billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt that other online porn services will follow
if IEG is successful,'' said Mark Tiarra, CEO of Tiarra Corp., an
adult Web site in Midland Park, N.J., that is entertaining ideas of
an initial public offering. ``They are the bellwether of our
industry, and the Net IPO market is hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Market momentum is expected to pick up steam later this year,
with the highly anticipated IPOs of GeoCities, which provides free
e-mail and Web design tools, and eBay, an online auctioneer.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; But industry observers say an IEG offering is not a certainty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough to gauge IEG's prospects,'' Taulli said. ``It's six
months away, and its services are narrow, unlike a Yahoo. Besides,
would they be able to attract a strong underwriter for such a
company?''
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely, say investment bankers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you just look at the numbers, the answer is sure,'' said
Jim Feuille, head of investment banking at Volpe Brown Whelan &AMP; Co.
in San Francisco. ``However, underwriters do not base their
business decisions strictly on that criteria. Underwrit ing a
company (like IEG) would be a very controversial move in terms of
image. It will spark some interesting debates.''

SPORTS COLUMN: THE WOMAN BEHIND THE FOUDY LEGACY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)  (js) 
 By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ The choice was reaching people or saving
lives. Julie Foudy decided there is too big a world out there to
confine herself to a single residency. She junked medical school,
choosing the life of an explorer over one as a healer.
</P>
<P>
   With the Stanford Medical School administrators calling again to
ask whether she'd ever show up, Foudy finally admitted the answer
was no. She had interviewed several doctors, including the Olympic
softball star, Dr. Dot Richardson. They all spoke of medicine as a
calling, not as a career. Mark Adams, the traveling physician for
the U.S. women's soccer team said: ``Foudy, let me put it to you
this way. I've lived on a golf course for the last five years, and
I haven't played once.''
</P>
<P>
   So much for science. Foudy was too good a midfielder, too much a
free spirit, and a game that barely registers on the global sports
economy had already opened the doors to some remarkably remote
places.
</P>
<P>
   She invaded a traditional male sanctum this summer as a
well-received ESPN analyst for the men's World Cup. She made it to
China last year, long before Bill Clinton. She took herself to the
village of Sialkot, Pakistan, at the foot of the Himalayas on a
one-woman mission to better understand Third World labor.
</P>
<P>
   She won an Olympic gold medal before 80,000 people in Atlanta
and went around the world twice in one year and now looks forward
to the world coming to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most encouraging and exciting thing about the World Cup is
the impact it's going to have, and not just here,'' Foudy said
before the U.S. women's national soccer team played China _ the
team it beat in the Olympic final two years ago _ for the gold
medal last night in the Goodwill Games at Mitchel Field.
</P>
<P>
   Foudy is 27 and knows this frequent-flier life cannot last
forever, no matter how sympathetic her husband, Ian Sawyers, has
been back home in Laguna Niguel, Calif. The women's World Cup will
be in the United States next summer, but then there is the matter
of the 2000 Olympics in Sydney, Australia. She's planning on going
because women's soccer is on the move, and Foudy believes there is
no turning back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much that can be accomplished by women in this
sport,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   If out of the next World Cup comes a U.S. women's pro league,
that would be splendid, but when Foudy speaks of ``impact,'' she is
not necessarily talking about an expanding job market. Having
toured the world with the U.S. team since she was 17, she knows
that gender equity is a soccer concept that doesn't play beyond our
suburban grass roots. Women's soccer is the establishment turned
upside down, Americans colonizing the Old World with revolutionary
feminist ideas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone plays soccer here,'' Foudy said. ``Girls are
encouraged. But you travel abroad, and the game is considered a
man's world in so many cultures. A girl is considered a freak if
she plays. We've been in Spain, and jumped into a men's game and
been looked at like we were crazy. Places in Europe, Africa,
they're so far behind.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Five years ago, the Brazil women got no funding, and we beat
them routinely. Now, they're competitive. It's not just for
opportunities in soccer. It's what we can do for girls everywhere
with the World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   She has earned the right, building something of a track record,
to express her transcendent point of view. In March of last year,
on her way home from a tournament in Australia, Foudy took a detour
deep into Pakistan. She wanted to see for herself how Reebok, the
company she had contractually agreed to represent, treated the
people making its soccer balls.
</P>
<P>
   To better monitor child labor, Foudy spoke with village
families, to workers in the factory Reebok built. She found out
they were earning about $2.25 a day plus benefits, that while
conditions might have been better, there are many places where they
are much, much worse. At least she took the time to do what Michael
Jordan and countless others have not. She went ahead and told
people that she believed it was all right to buy the balls, then
got back to the business of selling her sport.
</P>
<P>
   League or no league, there is no pot of gold at the end of the
soccer rainbow for the U.S. women precedent-setters, for Foudy and
the goal scorers, Mia Hamm and Michelle Akers. They made a world
power out of a country whose men made it a soccer laughingstock.
There is a moral in there somewhere. A legacy. When Reebok last
year named a soccer shoe for Foudy, that's what they called it. The
Foudy Legacy.

OFFICIALS UNITE ON SWEEPING EDUCATION PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KATE ZERNIKE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In their first unified attempt at addressing the
state's teaching crisis, top legislative leaders and Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci joined the commissioner of education Monday
in proposing what would be the nation's most comprehensive and
rigorous program to attract, train, and retain top-notch teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan envisions a series of scholarships, incentives, and
new programs from middle school to retirement, all aimed at
elevating a profession dragged down in recent decades by a lack of
respect and low starting salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Standing at the foot of the grand staircase of the State House,
the leaders sought to change public sentiment by asking people to
recall those whom House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran called ``gems''
_ the teachers who have inspired achievement beyond expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This plan is about the dignity and nobility of teaching,''
said Commissioner of Education David P. Driscoll. ``We need to
return to a time when teaching was a very, very important aspect of
our society. ... This issue is as important as there is for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan plucks the most successful programs from across the
country and combines them with proposals made in the weeks since
the state announced that 59 percent of prospective teachers did not
pass a basic literacy and skills test. It includes Senate President
Thomas F. Birmingham's proposal to offer $20,000 signing bonuses
and Cellucci's plan to test existing teachers and fire those who
fail.
</P>
<P>
   While some states now include some of the elements of what was
proposed Monday, no state includes them all.
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll said the plan would cost between $5 million and $10
million, $5 million of that a onetime expense to set up the
endowment for signing bonuses. Finneran said the money would come
from the $1 billion state surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because it is so ambitious, the plan ran into a wall of
skepticism as soon as it was announced. But Finneran, Driscoll,
Cellucci, and Birmingham responded with almost belligerent
optimism, insisting the Legislature has the money and the will to
spend it _ especially since education has shot to the top of the
public's list of concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the last three weeks I think we have observed a sea change
in the decibel level of the rhetoric which has characterized this
debate ... away from recrimination, toward constructive
proposals,'' Birmingham said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there was some jockeying Monday as each hinted that his
own aspect of the plan was most significant _ especially Cellucci,
who is running for his first full term as governor. Yet while the
leaders admitted they might disagree as the details of the plan are
worked out, they said Monday's announcement was significant because
it brought them together to agree on the need to do something.
</P>
<P>
   The support of Finneran, Birmingham, and Cellucci at the State
House and Driscoll at the Board of Education is likely to improve
the plan's chances of becoming reality in some form.
</P>
<P>
   ``As one of several people who expressed their immense
frustration with what has become the fiasco of public education, I
am encouraged that out of the various sparks that were struck over
the last three to six weeks we now have a very public, collective
desire and determination to move forward,'' said Finneran, whose
previous statements on the teacher testing debacle had been limited
to a speech in which he called the teachers who failed idiots _ a
remark he retracted as ``impolitic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They can count me in on the conceptual parts, and I'll try to
do my best to fill in the substantive framework.''
</P>
<P>
   Driscoll, the chief author of the plan, said he would make
specific proposals to the Board of Education on Sept. 15. Some
parts would require only board approval, while others would need
the Legislature's vote. With only this week left in the year's
session, those elements requiring legislative approval would be
considered in January.
</P>
<P>
   In the plan, there is something for everyone to like, and
something for every politician to take credit for.
</P>
<P>
   The plan reaches as far back as middle schools, to set up Future
Teachers of America clubs, and in high schools it would offer
college scholarships to students who plan to go into teaching. In
colleges, it would expand a current program to forgive the student
loans of top performers who go into teaching.
</P>
<P>
   It sets up what Birmingham called an ``elite'' corps of new
teachers attracted by $20,000 signing bonuses. By 2003, it would
establish a corps of 1,000 ``master teachers'' among the ranks of
existing teachers. These would train new teachers, who would be
considered ``apprentices.''
</P>
<P>
   The master teachers would be paid to become certified by the
National Board for Professional Teaching Standards, a Detroit-based
group that puts teachers through a yearlong series of hurdles to
earn special certification. Teachers who go through the program pay
$2,000 and continue to teach but also take a series of tests and
are observed teaching during that year.
</P>
<P>
   The plan also would make it easier for those in mid-career in
other professions to shift their talents to teaching without having
to take teacher education courses, a common deterrent to would-be
educators.
</P>
<P>
   For all teachers, it would toughen the recertification procedure
from what it is now. (In essence, teachers have to attend courses
to get recertified every five years, but do not have to sit through
evaluations or any tests.) A new procedure, Cellucci and Driscoll
said, would include a test of how well teachers know their
subjects.
</P>
<P>
   But even aside from the sheer difficulty of steering such an
expansive plan through the Legislature, there are other hurdles.
</P>
<P>
   National board certification, for master teachers, takes time
and money. Only 911 teachers nationwide have completed the process
in the 11 years since the board was founded. Led by Republicans,
Congress recently slashed the national board's federal funding,
complaining that it was taking too long to certify too few.
</P>
<P>
   And unions are resistant to teacher testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't hear teacher bashing today, which is an
improvement,'' said Kathy Kelley, president of the Massachusetts
Federation of Teachers. ``But ultimately, I think we're also going
to have to do something about salaries.''
</P>
<P>
   But to questions of how long the plan would take to reach its
goals, and how realistic it is, Driscoll retorted: ``How long is it
going to take us in Massachusetts to commit ourselves to the
nobility of teaching?''

DEL MONTE RETURNS TO THE TRADING FLOOR 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DEL MONTE   By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Del Monte Foods, one of nation's most venerable brands, is about to
re-emerge as a publicly traded company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The San Francisco-based king of canned fruits and vegetables is
expected to price its shares as early as this afternoon. And after
a 19-year intermission, Del Monte shares could resume trading on
the New York Stock Exchange tomorrow under the ticker symbol DLM.
</P>
<P>
   The company should raise close to $250million if it sells 14.7
million shares at the preliminary estimated price of $16 to $18 per
share. Current owners, namely Texas Pacific Group of Houston and
San Francisco, plan to sell an additional 4.4million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte has gone through several ownership changes in recent
years. Texas Pacific, which specializes in buying private companies
and tuning them up for sale to the public, acquired Del Monte 16
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1979, Del Monte was acquired by R.J. Reynolds, merged into
RJR Nabisco, sold to leveraged buyout specialists Kohlberg Kravis
Roberts, passed on to a group led by Merrill Lynch and then sold to
Texas Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Del Monte shed its fresh fruit and international
operations along with several product lines including puddings and
fruit punch. ``Del Monte has one of the most familiar brand names
in the world but it hasn't been able to do a lot with it,'' said
one stock broker.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Pacific has been out to change that as it did with
Beringer Wine Estates. It bought the Napa Valley vintner from
Nestle USA less than two years ago and took it public last October.
</P>
<P>
   With two Dole Food veterans at the helm _ CEO Richard Wolford
and Chief Operating Officer Wesley Smith _ Del Monte has refocused
its operations in several ways:
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; New products and promotions &LR; . Del Monte nearly quadrupled its
consumer promotions budget to $46 million from $12million and added
higher profit margin products like Orchard Select premium bottled
fruits and Fruit Smoothie Blenders flavored drinks.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Broader markets &LR; . It expanded in high-growth distribution
channels like supercenter and club stores such as PriceCostco.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Strategic acquisitions &LR; . Last November, Del Monte bought
Contadina's line of canned products for $197 million, consolidating
its position as the leader in the processed foods business. It also
ranks No. 1 in canned fruits with 41 percent market share and
canned vegetables with a 20 percent market share.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Cost cutting &LR; . Del Monte said in January that it would cut
1,000 jobs and close two of its six California plants, including an
80-year-old San Jose cannery and a 70-year-old Stockton facility.
</P>
<P>
   Del Monte is growing nicely but it is not yet a big moneymaker.
It lost $56 million on $1.4 billion sales in 1997. The company has
a heavy $1.2 billion debt load. And the prospectus tells investors
not to expect dividends for ``the foreseeable future.''
</P>
<P>
   But since 1891, the company has built one of the best-known
brands in business. It also has a well-known group of underwriters
led by Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, Robertson Stephens, Bear
Stearns, BT Alex Brown and Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette.

WEB ADDRESS SELLS FOR $3.35 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - ALTA VISTA   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Compaq Computer Corp. has agreed to pay a San Jose man $3.35
million for the Web address  www.altavista.com , which is believed
to be a record amount paid for a domain name, according to a source
close to the deal.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The transaction settles a well-known two-year dispute between
Compaq, which owns the popular Alta Vista search engine, and Jack
Marshall, who owns the Alta Vista Web site name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this is the largest known figure for a domain name
transaction,'' said Edwin Hayward, who runs  &LR; www.igoldrush.com &LR; , a
Web site that tracks such purchases.
</P>
<P>
   The buying and selling of Web site addresses _ or domain names _
has become fairly common on the Web, but most fetch price tags in
the tens of thousands of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Speculators buy popular names such as  &LR; www.mcdonalds.com &LR;  or
 &LR; www.television.com &LR;  for $100 and then sell those addresses to
corporations for much higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   The practice has been somewhat curbed by a 1996 court ruling
that prevents cyber-squatters from buying trademarked names, but
generic names are still fair game.
</P>
<P>
   The Alta Vista name, however, was not trademarked when
electrical engineer Jack Marshall bought cyber-rights to it in
January 1994 for his Campbell startup, AltaVista Technology.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Marshall sold $49.95 software that let users build
multimedia postcards that could be displayed on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1995, Digital Equipment Corp. _ which now is owned
by Compaq _ launched a search engine called Alta Vista. Because it
didn't own the Alta Vista address, Web surfers had to find it at
 &LR; www.altavista.digital.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   But that address confused Web surfers, and many looking for the
Alta Vista search engine ended up on Marshall's site, overloading
his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We noticed it immediately,'' Marshall said. ``So we put a link
on our page to the search engine and frantically did a bunch of
things with our servers to keep the thing running.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he had to upgrade his computers to handle the
half-million visitors per day, the increased traffic allowed
Marshall to lure big advertisers to his site as well.
</P>
<P>
   Digital Equipment Corp. offered to buy the Alta Vista trademark
from Marshall. He agreed to sell the trademark, but kept the right
to use it on software packages and his Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But by Halloween 1996, Digital Equipment Corp. decided it wanted
more _ and it sued Marshall for the rights to  &LR; www.altavista.com &LR; 
on grounds that Marshall had violated the previous agreement by
failing to disclose that his site was not the Alta Vista search
engine.
</P>
<P>
   In March 1997, a federal judge in Boston required Marshall to
change his logo, which was similar to Digital's Alta Vista logo,
and to add a disclaimer to his site. But he didn't rule on the
domain name itself.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said settlement negotiations were stalled until Compaq
bought Digital Equipment Corp. for $9 billion in January.
</P>
<P>
   The discussions came to a head Friday during a six-hour
deal-making session in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Sources close to the negotiations said Marshall won $3.35
million plus a permanent link from the Alta Vista search engine to
his new Web site _  &LR; www.photoloft.com &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   On August 31, Marshall will shut down his old site and turn the
name over to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
   Marshall said his agreement with Compaq prevents him from
commenting on the details of the settlement. Compaq officials were
not available for comment.
</P>
<P>
   In all the frenzy of wrapping up the project, Marshall, 37,
barely made it home in time to witness the birth of his second son
at 5:21 a.m. Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to appear in bad faith by not coming out to
Boston,'' he said. ``But I'm just so happy I came back before the
baby arrived. It would have been terrible if I'd missed it.''

IT'S ALL UP TO THE PATRIOTS, NOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL MCDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is not Wil Cordero. This is not David Meggett. This is Ben
Coates, who pleaded innocent Monday to domestic abuse charges. This
is not just another player you can toss out the window, trying to
make yourself so politically correct.
</P>
<P>
   This is a Hall of Fame-bound football player. Without him in the
lineup, the Patriots' Super Bowl chances disappear.
</P>
<P>
   Coates is the best pass catcher the Patriots have ever had, and
he is the key to quarterback Drew Bledsoe's success. Without his
All-Pro tight end, Bledsoe is not Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   So the question today, and for the rest of the season, is: What
face will the Patriots put on?
</P>
<P>
   Will they follow the road paved by Christian Peter and Meggett,
or will they suddenly forget the standards they appeared to have
set for their team when they dispatched both Peter and Meggett on
short notice.
</P>
<P>
   Peter, to refresh the memory, was a fifth-round draft choice out
of Nebraska two years ago. Peter had a history of trouble at
Nebraska. Two days after he was picked, and Peter's off-field
activity was criticized in the media, the Patriots dumped him in a
hiccup. Of course, the hypocrisy came in the announcement with his
release, that they really didn't have all the details of his
background, and if they had, they wouldn't have drafted him. The
truth is, they knew everything he did, but didn't consider what the
fallout would be in the local media. When it hit, they ran away
from him like he was contaminated.
</P>
<P>
   Meggett was considered the best offensive player the Patriots
had at the end of last season. He was hurt going into their final
playoff game in Pittsburgh, and then suffered a broken foot on the
first play of the game.
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, he was arrested and charged with sexual
assault and robbery in Toronto. The Patriots claimed they would
wait until he had his day in court before they decided his future.
Meggett has yet to get to court, but they still released him at the
end of May, putting out the word that it had more to do with his
off-field activity than it did with his playing. The assault charge
already has been dismissed, and robbery charge may also be dropped.
</P>
<P>
   Coates is a lot like Meggett. Very productive on and off the
field, but he means more than ever to the Patriots this year,
because of the events of the recent past.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of last season, the Patriots have lost Curtis
Martin, Keith Byars, Sam Gash, and Meggett, the four major
backfield contributors the last two seasons. Those four, plus
Coates, carried the load the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Coates has caught 361 passes from Bledsoe in the regular season
the last five years, and holds the Patriots' all-time season record
with 96 catches in 1994. Everyone who has watched the Patriots play
the last five years knows that when Bledsoe is in trouble, or needs
a big play, he is going to look to Coates. The opposition knows it
as well. And even if they have two players surrounding Coates,
Bledsoe believes in him so much the ball is going to be thrown in
Big Ben's direction. The offense this year, with no running game,
would be nothing without Coates.
</P>
<P>
   So Bob Kraft has his biggest spin job to date. How does he keep
Coates on the field, and say he is any different than Meggett, when
they both have recently had similar alleged violent episodes off
the field?
</P>
<P>
   Where will the standard fall? Will it be the same treatment for
Coates as it was for Peter and Meggett, or will some hypocritical
excuse be made to keep Coates on the field?
</P>
<P>
   And then there is another problem.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates may become a test case _ so to speak _ for the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few months back, at the annual league meetings,
commissioner Paul Tagliabue announced a new Violent Crime Policy,
which gives him the right, by his own ruling, to take action
against any employee of the NFL involved in violence off the field.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy went into effect July 1. It puts what Coates
allegedly did Sunday night right in Tagliabue's lap. Threat of
physical violence and domestic violence are both covered. Under
this policy, Tagliabue has the right to fine or suspend a player.
Automatically, because he was arrested and charged, Coates has to
enter an NFL-sponsored counseling program. If he pleads guilty, or
is found guilty, he can face further punishment from Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft, in a short period of time, has become one of the most
powerful owners in the NFL. He carries a lot of clout with
Tagliabue. The commissioner has placed Kraft on the all- important
television committee, and then gave him the most important
ownership assignment in the league, chairman of the finance
committee.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft will make it a tough call for Tagliabue if he pleads for
leniency, in view of the commissioner's statements this past March
on getting tough with players involved in violent crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, if I owned the Patriots, he'd be playing, unless the
courts decide he has to be put away. I wrote the same thing about
Cordero and the Red Sox. I'd bring Meggett back in a heartbeat if
he was healthy. Just because they are athletes, and in the
spotlight, they should not be held to a different set of rules than
the average person in the workplace.

   PHOENIX _ The blood had yet to dry when I got there. Two boys
playing nearby pointed it out to me. By then, investigators had
left the scene and neighborhood children ran around the parking lot
pulling behind them tails of yellow plastic tape with the words
``Crime Scene: Do Not Cross'' printed on it.
</P>
<P>
   A few of them wrapped it around their waists. One made it into a
headband, the words bending around his forehead like an electronic
ticker tape.
</P>
<P>
   The boys showed me the spot where the officer came to rest. The
patch of blood on the asphalt was as large as a dinner plate, and
shiny, like jelly spread on chocolate cake.
</P>
<P>
   I'd heard about the shooting on the car radio on my way to work.
It had happened overnight. It was January 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Officer Robert Fike pulled into a dark parking
lot behind a convenience store at 11th Street and Indian School
Road. The glaring cone of light from his patrol car's spotlight
caught 21-year-old Matthew Millburn shooting up cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Millburn financed his drug habit with the occasional armed
robbery. When the officer got out of his car and approached the
young man, Millburn pulled a pistol, pointed it at the policeman's
face, and fired.
</P>
<P>
   Fike was 43. &QL; 
1st cop's blood &QL; 
It was the first stain of cop's blood I saw on the streets of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there, staring at it, not knowing what to do, when an
elderly couple approached.
</P>
<P>
   The man carried a bucket half filled with topsoil, The woman
held a gardening shovel. When they got to the place where the blood
had not yet dried, the woman made the sign of the cross and prayed
silently. She dipped her spade into the bucket and sprinkled dirt
on the shiny patch of pavement until it was covered.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   When I see TV news coverage today showing the flag-draped
caskets of Detective John M. Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut
of the Capitol police, killed in a shootout Friday in Washington,
D.C., I'll be thinking of Officer Fike.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be thinking of Leonard Kolodziej, too, a Phoenix policeman
shot dead by a sniper in 1991. Officer Kolodziej had patrolled my
neighborhood. He once stopped by our house to make sure everything
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be thinking of Bob Martin, the 57-year-old state Department
of Public Safety officer killed in 1995 on Arizona 87. I'll be
thinking of Maricopa County sheriff's Deputy Vernon Marconnet, and
DPS officer Ed Rebel, and Phoenix Officer Kenneth Collings, and
corrections officer Brent Lumley.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   All of them died in the line of duty. None of them got what
Chestnut and Gibson are getting. &QL; 
High-level attention &QL; 
The president, vice president and the leaders of Congress didn't
attend their memorial services. They didn't make the national news
or rest for a time in the Capitol Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Chestnut and Gibson don't deserve the attention;
it's that the others don't deserve anything less.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, that wouldn't be practical. If each fallen
law-enforcement officer were treated the same, the president and
vice president would have attended more than 90 funerals so far
this year. That's how many cops have died on the job in America
since January.
</P>
<P>
   We could fill the Rotunda with caskets.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the nation remembers Chestnut and Gibson, I'm
remembering Fike, Kolodziej, Marconnet, Rebel, Collings, Lumley and
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their friends in local law enforcement believe people in
my business don't give a damn about the ones who die. They figure
we're more interested in screw-ups than heroes.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's name-calling; we say it's calling 'em as we see
'em.
</P>
<P>
   It won't change.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the things we call them, though, the best name we have
for cops is peace officers. At least for today, forget the rest.
</P>
<P>
   And rest in peace, officers. &QL;

TIMES SQUARE IS OPENED TO TRAFFIC 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Times Square was reopened to traffic at dawn on
Monday, but optimism at the pace of work on the damaged scaffolding
at the Conde Nast building gave way to renewed safety concerns in
the afternoon when gusty winds apparently sent a 15-foot-long
aluminum pipe falling more than 400 feet to the roof of a theater
next door.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured, and there appeared to be little, if any,
damage to the theater's parapet, officials said. The pipe was kept
from falling farther from the construction site _ and possibly
causing serious damage _ by the nylon protective netting that
workers are busily draping around the scaffolding tower, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nets, to the extent that they're in place, are doing what
they're supposed to do,'' said Richard Kieler, senior vice
president at Tishman Realty and Construction, the construction
manager at the project.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, both the city and the company that erected the
scaffolding said they had called in forensic engineers to determine
the cause of the fatal collapse at the Conde Nast building on 43rd
Street last Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the area around the city's most famous intersection
returned to normal beginning at 5:45 a.m., when the police reopened
Broadway, Seventh Avenue and the streets to the west, and taxis and
trucks again streamed through Times Square. With that, its short
life as a pedestrian's paradise came to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   At 2 p.m., Bryant Park was reopened to lunching office workers,
as well as to cleanup crews, which found a week's worth of leaves
to rake up.
</P>
<P>
   There were other minor but noticeable improvements: Pedestrians
were allowed to walk along 42nd Street as far west as the Avenue of
the Americas, meaning about a dozen businesses could reopen, if to
less-than-brisk sales. And most of 43rd Street between Fifth and
the Avenue of the Americas was opened to delivery trucks,
customers, employees and residents but not to through traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But the Avenue of the Americas remained closed to vehicles from
34th to 46th Streets, said Deputy Chief Michael Fox of the Police
Department.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome Hauer, director of the mayor's Office of Emergency
Management, said that the Avenue of the Americas, 42nd and 44th
Streets would be reopened to all traffic as soon as the nylon
protective netting has been draped around the scaffolding as far
down as the ninth floor. That could happen sometime on Tuesday, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that the timetable could be extended once again,
especially in light of the fall of the length of aluminum pipe.
</P>
<P>
   The safety netting, which consists of 12-foot-wide,
300-foot-long sheets, is being unrolled and fastened to the
scaffolding and additional supports by three-person crews working
around the clock from a metal bucket dangling from a crane.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, workers finished the first of two sections of
netting, from the top of the scaffolding to about the 21st floor.
On Monday, they were attaching the second section. But at about
2:20 p.m., while a crew was suspended over the scaffolding's north
side, a 15-foot pipe brace fell over its east side. The crew was
immediately raised aloft to the roof and work ceased for about two
hours. Kieler said that a gust of wind appeared to have dislodged
the 20-pound pipe from the scaffolding.
</P>
<P>
   It fell inside the netting, he said, before bouncing away from
the tower where the netting had not yet been installed. The pipe
landed with a bang on a parapet on the roof of the Henry Miller
Theater, which has been refashioned the Kit Kat Club for the
revival of ``Cabaret.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to reporters minutes later, Hauer said the incident
underscored the danger present in dismantling the scaffolding,
which he has likened to an outsized game of ``pick-up sticks.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it seems at times that things are going very slowly,
but that is very calculated,'' he said. ``Had those workers been
anywhere near where that beam fell, we could've had loss of life.''
</P>
<P>
   To ensure against that, he said, 43rd Street itself between
Avenue of the Americas and Broadway may not be reopened for weeks.

NO GUARANTEE THAT FOREIGN WORKERS BILL WILL BECOME LAW  
 TOM ABATE/DIGITAL BAY 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - DIGITAL BAY   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
The White House hasn't signaled whether it will endorse last week's
House-Senate ``compromise'' on a controversial bill to increase the
number of foreigners who can work in the United States under
temporary H-1B visas.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the high-tech lobby cheered the deal, there's no
guarantee it will overcome an administration threat to veto the
H-1B bill unless it contained ``protections'' to ensure that
Americans weren't displaced by workers from abroad.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Lamar Smith, R-Texas, wrote such protections into
his original H-1B bill in the House, requiring that companies
``attest'' that no American was laid off to employ a foreigner.
</P>
<P>
   But when the high-tech lobby balked, Republican leaders
pressured Smith to water down the ``attestation'' provision. As a
result, in the compromise bill, only firms whose staffs were more
than 15 percent H-1B workers would have to swear they weren't
dumping any Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of higher H-1B limits _ notably organized labor and
some professional engineering associations _ say Smith caved,
because only a handful of employment agencies that specialize in
hiring out H-1B workers will have to attest to anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a compromise, it's a victory for high-tech,'' said
Norman Matloff, a University of California at Davis professor and
H-1B opponent.
</P>
<P>
   He contends the compromise bill is really the industry-backed
Senate version authored by Senator Spencer Abraham, R-Mich., with a
15 percent attestation tacked on.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is whether the 15 percent is enough of a fig
leaf to hide the fact that the compromise bill is essentially the
same legislation that President Clinton threatened to veto.
</P>
<P>
   Sources say White House economic advisor Gene Sperling, who'll
make the recommendation to Clinton, hasn't seen the actual
compromise language _ because Abraham's staff is still drafting it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, you can be sure tech leaders will be pressuring the
White House to approve the Smith-Abraham agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this stage it would be hard for the president to disappoint
high tech,'' one Republican Senate staffer said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Hollowed ground? &LR;  After Lockheed Missiles &AMP; Space Co. said
last month it would cut some 2,000 heads from its 9,500-person Bay
Area workforce, a Lockheed veteran drew me aside to com plain that
the gray-haired were the first to be shown the door _ robbing the
firm of its institutional memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not ageism but economics,'' the source said, requesting
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are being retired based on their cost,'' he added.
``They happen to be the oldest and most experienced people. Many
projects are showing gaps in engineering knowledge as a result.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Lockheed spokesman Dave Waller confirmed that employees 55
and older have received letters offering voluntary early
retirement. But no group _ neither older workers nor new hires _
have been singled out for layoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Waller disputed any notion that the company was shedding its top
brains, saying Lockheed reserves the right to deny early retirement
to older workers with essential skills.
</P>
<P>
   But my source said Lockheed has been thinning its senior ranks
for years. The latest letters are just more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks the results of this ``brain drain'' are evident in
troubled programs like the Theater High Altitude Area Defense
(THAAD), which is supposed to protect troops in the field by
shooting down enemy missiles. But the system has been highly
criticized by the press.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; God on our side? &LR;  The trade publication Government Computer
News recently reported that a software screwup in May made the
Navy's ``smart ship'' go dead in the water.
</P>
<P>
   According to GCN, the missile cruiser USS Yorktown _ called
smart because it uses software to replace 10 percent of its crew _
lost propulsion for 45 minutes because of an error caused by its
Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   The glitch led one civilian engineer to grumble that using the
relatively-new NT instead of the battle-tested Unix to run a
warship ``is similar to hoping that luck will be in our favor''
when the shooting starts.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; So what's new? &LR;  Pacific Bell's voice mail was down _ again _
for much of Saturday and for about 45 minutes yesterday. Spokesman
John Britton said the cause of yesterday's outage was unknown.
Saturday's down time occurred while the company was installing a
software update.

   I'd heard about the shooting on the car radio on my way to work.
It had happened overnight. It was January 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix police Officer Robert Fike pulled into a dark parking
lot behind a convenience store at 11th Street and Indian School
Road. The glaring cone of light from his patrol car's spotlight
caught 21-year-old Matthew Millburn shooting up cocaine.
</P>
<P>
   Millburn financed his drug habit with the occasional armed
robbery. When the officer got out of his car and approached the
young man, Millburn pulled a pistol, pointed it at the policeman's
face, and fired.
</P>
<P>
   Fike was 43. &QL; 
1st cop's blood &QL; 
It was the first stain of cop's blood I saw on the streets of
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   I stood there, staring at it, not knowing what to do, when an
elderly couple approached.
</P>
<P>
   The man carried a bucket half filled with topsoil, The woman
held a gardening shovel. When they got to the place where the blood
had not yet dried, the woman made the sign of the cross and prayed
silently. She dipped her spade into the bucket and sprinkled dirt
on the shiny patch of pavement until it was covered.
</P>
<P>
   Then they turned and walked away.
</P>
<P>
   When I see TV news coverage today showing the flag-draped
caskets of Detective John M. Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut
of the Capitol police, killed in a shootout Friday in Washington,
D.C., I'll be thinking of Officer Fike.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be thinking of Leonard Kolodziej, too, a Phoenix policeman
shot dead by a sniper in 1991. Officer Kolodziej had patrolled my
neighborhood. He once stopped by our house to make sure everything
was OK.
</P>
<P>
   I'll be thinking of Bob Martin, the 57-year-old state Department
of Public Safety officer killed in 1995 on Arizona 87. I'll be
thinking of Maricopa County sheriff's Deputy Vernon Marconnet, and
DPS officer Ed Rebel, and Phoenix Officer Kenneth Collings, and
corrections officer Brent Lumley.
</P>
<P>
   The list goes on.
</P>
<P>
   All of them died in the line of duty. None of them got what
Chestnut and Gibson are getting. &QL; 
High-level attention &QL; 
The president, vice president and the leaders of Congress didn't
attend their memorial services. They didn't make the national news
or rest for a time in the Capitol Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Chestnut and Gibson don't deserve the attention;
it's that the others don't deserve anything less.
</P>
<P>
   These days, however, that wouldn't be practical. If each fallen
law-enforcement officer were treated the same, the president and
vice president would have attended more than 90 funerals so far
this year. That's how many cops have died on the job in America
since January.
</P>
<P>
   We could fill the Rotunda with caskets.
</P>
<P>
   So, while the nation remembers Chestnut and Gibson, I'm
remembering Fike, Kolodziej, Marconnet, Rebel, Collings, Lumley and
the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Some of their friends in local law enforcement believe people in
my business don't give a damn about the ones who die. They figure
we're more interested in screw-ups than heroes.
</P>
<P>
   They say it's name-calling; we say it's callig 'em as we see
'em.
</P>
<P>
   It won't change.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the things we call them, though, the best name we have
for cops is peace officers. At least for today, forget the rest.
</P>
<P>
   And rest in peace, officers. &QL;

ERROR ON STOCK SYMBOL PROVES COSTLY MISTAKE FOR NOVICE

<P>
   SIMI VALLEY, Calif. _ In her rush to invest in an Internet
company, Levina Goodrow took a wrong turn on the information
superhighway.
</P>
<P>
   As the 48-year-old single mom got ready to leave her house one
morning, she heard two investment pundits on television talking
about CitySearch, a firm in Pasadena, 10 miles northeast of
downtown Los Angeles, that provides city arts and entertainment
guides on the Internet. It is not yet publicly traded, but is
planning to do so soon.
</P>
<P>
   Wanting to capitalize on the next hot Internet stock, she picked
up the phone and asked her discount broker to buy CTYS. She didn't
catch the name of the firm, but heard the ticker symbol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had seen how the (stock of) Internet companies shoot way up
and I thought this may be a way to make money,'' said Goodrow, of
Simi Valley northwest of Los Angeles, who started investing two
weeks ago. ``With the little I have in savings, I better do
something with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a tragic case of mistaken identity, Goodrow ended up
buying the wrong stock. Instead of CitySearch, she got Cityscape
Financial Corp. in Elmsford, N.Y., a company going bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Other investors likely made the same mistake. The stock of
Cityscape rose as high as 17 cents July 21 from 5 cents in the
beginning of July, on volume more than 10 times its monthly
average. It closed at 7 cents Monday as interest in the stock
subsided.
</P>
<P>
   ``People don't do their research,'' said Larry Wien, a principal
at Wien Securities in Jersey City, N.J., which handles Cityscape
shares. Interest ``has abated quite a bit since the news came out''
that investors were buying Cityscape, not CitySearch.
</P>
<P>
   Cityscape is not the only company to benefit from stock-market
confusion, just the latest. In June, when AT&AMP;T announced it was
buying Tele-Communications Inc., investors rushed to buy TCII.
Unfortunately, that's the ticker symbol for TCI International, not
Tele-Communications Inc. (TCOMA).
</P>
<P>
   In Goodrow's case, she didn't carefully listen to the TV report
on CitySearch before buying 1,000 shares of CTYS for 14 cents July
21 and another 1,000 shares for 23 cents Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Goodrow asked her discount broker for CTYS, her broker
asked if the stock she wanted was Cityscape Financial. Since she
didn't know the name of the company, she asked the broker if
Cityscape had anything to do with the Internet. The broker didn't
know.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have any other CTYS?'' Goodrow said she asked.
``Will (Nasdaq) ever have any other (company trading under) CTYS?''
</P>
<P>
   No, the broker replied to both questions, according to Goodrow.
So Goodrow bought the stock and recommended it to a friend, who
bought 5,000 shares as well.
</P>
<P>
   While it was the wrong company, Goodrow did get the ticker
symbol right. In June, CitySearch filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to go public under the ticker symbol CTYS.
</P>
<P>
   At the time of the filing, Cityscape was using CTYS, but Nasdaq
can take the symbol of a pink sheet or OTC Bulletin Board company,
where firms are listed with no minimum requirements, and give that
symbol to another company to be listed on the Nasdaq National or
SmallCap markets, according to Nasdaq spokesman Mike Shokouhi.
</P>
<P>
   Cityscape was kicked off the SmallCap Market in May for not
meeting minimum Nasdaq requirements. The mortgage lender is now
listed on the Bulletin Board.
</P>
<P>
   While Nasdaq generally switches over the symbol the day before
the listing, it hastened up the procedure for Cityscape to avoid
further confusion. On Monday, Cityscape started trading under CYYS.
</P>
<P>
   All of which doesn't help Goodrow, who at least is taking her
loss in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've learned a valuable lesson,'' she said.

SANYO BUYS ACCESS TO TECHNOLOGY FROM IBM
</HEADLINE>
  (af)  
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The Sanyo Electric Co., struggling to emerge from the
shadows cast by bigger competitors like Sony and Matsushita, has
bought access to some of the most advanced semiconductor technology
to use in its consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   Under a deal announced Monday with the International Business
Machines Corp., Sanyo gets access to advanced semiconductor
manufacturing processes and is permitted to design chips that
incorporate IBM's copper circuit technology, a breakthrough in
semiconductor manufacturing that greatly reduces energy consumption
and improves performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It gives us access to cutting-edge technology that's needed
for the next generation of consumer devices like digital cameras
and digital decoders for television, things that need more power
than conventional home appliances,'' said Daniel Cox, a spokesman
for Sanyo.
</P>
<P>
   The alliance is also another step in Sanyo's efforts to build a
name for itself in the computer chips business, potentially a much
more lucrative area than consumer electronics.
</P>
<P>
   New consumer electronics, like cellular phones and digital
cameras, derive their capabilities from sophisticated computer
chips inside the devices. ``Many companies know they can't make
huge operating margin from assembled consumer electronics,'' said
Masashi Kubota, an electronics analyst at ING Barings in Tokyo.
``They're facing increased competition from Korean manufacturers
and price-cutting in Japan and know that the place to make money is
in electronic components and semiconductors.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal will give IBM greater presence as a chip supplier in
Japan. ``It's further acceptance of technology that we've developed
and evidence that it's valued by others,'' said Mac Jeffery, a
spokesman for IBM Asia Pacific in Tokyo. ``Plus, a fair amount of
our income is derived from licensing our technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Terms were not disclosed. &QL;
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sanyo's alliance with IBM, like an earlier one between Sony and
Fujitsu, highlights the high cost of developing the new, more
sophisticated chips used in modern consumer electronics. These
chips are home to a combination of transistors and circuits that in
the past would have each resided on separate chips.
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of creating a neighborhood of tiny transistors
atop a postage-stamp-sized silicon wafer is immense, as is the
price. But as the world moves toward increasingly digitalized
consumer electronics, such ``systems on a chip'' become more
important as DVD storage disks replace CD-ROMs and cellular phones
replace desktop phones.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its deal with IBM, Sanyo will have access to IBM's
core library of chip design technology, including methods that
provide superior performance using less energy. It will also be
able to tap IBM's manufacturing technology to produce transistors
with a width of eighteen-hundredths micron and thinner, or less
than five one-hundredths of the width of a human hair.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us access to technology that we otherwise wouldn't
have,'' Cox said.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' ROUTE LEADS THROUGH BOMBING RANGE IN ARIZONA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. _ On a day when desert temperatures burst above 120
degrees, Border Patrol agents stopped a pickup truck and found,
stuffed under a camper shell, 23 dehydrated illegal immigrants on
the verge of heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Heat was not their biggest enemy. The truck, its driver
oblivious to the danger, had crawled across a military bombing zone
called the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range northwest of
Yuma, a site controlled by the U.S. Marine Corps and used by
several armed forces, including those of NATO, to train pilots.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Harrier jets drop bombs of up to 2,000 pounds,
including ``cluster bombs'' that splinter on impact. Many remain
unexploded and can easily be triggered by heat, friction or even
something as delicate as AM radio waves, authorities warn.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the danger is advertised on warning signs in Spanish
and English, that hasn't deterred desperate crossers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four months, no fewer than 612 illegals have been
picked up by the Border Patrol on or near the range, according to
the agency. All were safely rescued, but military and Border Patrol
agents fear the increasing traffic is putting more men, women and
children at risk of being blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting large numbers of alien smuggling loads coming
through that area,'' said Donny Tibbets, Border Patrol
agent-in-charge at the Blythe, Calif., station. ``It's a concern
because we think there's a potential for a . . . significant loss
of life out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, more people have trespassed on the
range because the Border Patrol stepped up enforcement along the
California-Mexico border, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new route that's being used to reach Los Angeles,''
says Rita Vargas, consul at the Mexican Consulate in Calexico,
Calif. ``It shows a high irresponsibility on the part of guides
taking people into this high-risk zone.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no deaths of any illegal immigrants by explosions have
been documented. But the Marines and Border Patrol want to step up
their monitoring of the area and warn would-be trespassers to stay
out.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatality was in 1983, when a 35-year-old California
man, Jimmy Watkins, was killed and his father lost a foot when the
two ignored the no-trespassing signs to scavenge for scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want anybody wandering around out there because
it's very, very dangerous,'' said Capt. Winston Jimenez, spokesman
for the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Military bomber pilots have been training in the Chocolate
Mountains since World War II. In the early '90s, Harrier jet pilots
practiced there for Desert Storm. Today, the range is the Marine
Corps' busiest aerial weapons training site.
</P>
<P>
   Along with explosives, aircraft also drop flares that hold 20
pounds of sodium nitrate and magnesium that burn at more than 1,000
degrees Fahrenheit. The deadly flares float to the ground on
parachutes and can be suddenly activated when the parachute is
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   About four times a year, the Marines ordnance disposal unit in
Yuma sweeps through the training sites to remove unexploded
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the danger of the weaponry is the area's isolation
from sources of help. Although military police patrol the
456,000-acre bombing range and military pilots are warned to fly
over on the lookout for people before dropping munitions, an
injured person could easily die before being found, military
spokesman say.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Border Patrol agents find themselves conducting more and
more rescue missions when illegal immigrants get stranded on the
bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rolon, spokesman for the El Centro, Calif., station, says
the smuggling vehicles, in bad shape and packed with people, will
often break down in the harsh terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once things go bad, the smuggler will often abandon the
group,'' Rolon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On July 2, we brought 18 aliens out of the gunnery range after
their vehicle had broken down and they were out of water,'' Rolon
said.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, a land and air search was launched when a
citizen alerted the Border Patrol to a group of 31 people,
including a pregnant woman and several children, who were stuck on
the northeastern edge of the bombing range. &QL;

TEAMSTERS PRESIDENT IS EXPELLED BY REVIEW BOARD

 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A court-appointed review board expelled Ron Carey,
the Teamsters president, from the union Monday, apparently ending
the career of a labor leader who once seemed destined to clean up
one of the United States' largest but most troubled unions.
</P>
<P>
   The review board concluded that Carey breached his fiduciary
duty by failing to stop an illegal scheme that siphoned more than
$750,000 in union funds into his 1996 re-election campaign. The
board said that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that
Carey approved or knew about the scheme, but the board chastised
him for failing to ferret out or inquire further about fraudulent
activity that was going on right in front of him.
</P>
<P>
   The decision expels from the union for life a figure who was one
of the nation's best-known, most charismatic union leaders, a man
who won widespread public support for his leadership in the
Teamsters' three-week strike against United Parcel Service last
August.
</P>
<P>
   Carey, 62, was first elected president of the International
Brotherhood of Teamsters in 1991 as a Mr. Clean, vowing to
eliminate corruption in a union long known as the nation's most
corrupt.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the campaign fraud _ in which three Carey campaign
aides have pleaded guilty _ the International Brotherhood of
Teamsters donated more than $750,000 to liberal groups, and in
return, traditional donors to those groups contributed $221,000 to
the Carey campaign. Federal law bars union officials from using
union money for their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carey had a duty to inquire into the unusual proposed
transactions, and he failed to exercise it,'' the Independent
Review Board wrote. ``A fair inference to be drawn from all the
facts is that Carey closed his eyes because he knew or suspected
that those contributions were to generate a personal benefit for
him, i.e., benefits to his campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Carey's lawyer, Reid Weingarten, insisted that the decision was
wrong, and vowed to appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a fit of regulatory overzealousness,'' Weingarten said,
``the Independent Review Board found that Ron Carey did not have
actual knowledge of an illegal fund-raising scheme and then imposed
severe sanctions upon him solely on the basis of his failure to
prevent misconduct that he knew nothing about. Under this
reasoning, every bank president who has been unable to stop a
teller from embezzling money can be tossed out of his job and
industry.''
</P>
<P>
   The review board was set up as part of a 1989 consent decree
that involved the federal government dropping a civil racketeering
suit, in which it charged that the Teamsters had a ``devil's pact''
with the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Before the board's decision takes effect, it must be confirmed
by Judge David Edelstein of U.S. District Court in New York, who
has been highly critical of Carey in the past.
</P>
<P>
   Last August, after uncovering the campaign fraud, a federal
election monitor overturned Carey's 52-percent-to-48-percent
victory over James P. Hoffa in December 1996. In November another
monitor, Kenneth Conboy, barred Carey from running for re-election,
and days later, Carey took a leave of absence. Conboy found that
Carey had apparently approved the embezzlement scheme _ a finding
that clashes with Monday's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Carey is under investigation by a federal grand jury in New
York, but several lawyers said Monday that an indictment became
less likely when the review board failed to conclude that Carey
approved or knew about the fraudulent scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Former U.S. Judge Frederick Lacey, the chairman of the
three-member board, issued a separate concurring decision saying
that he, unlike the two other board members, believed that Carey
knew about the scheme. Lacey relied heavily on a statement that
Carey's campaign manager, Jere Nash, had said he once made to
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   Nash had testified that he once told Carey that if the Teamsters
president approved a large donation to Citizen Action, a
progressive grass-roots group, it would ``help Martin Davis in the
fund raising that he is doing for our campaign.'' Davis was the
campaign's chief fund-raiser and handled its direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   Carey told the board under oath that he had no memory of that
conversation with Nash.
</P>
<P>
   While not finding guilty knowledge, the two other board members,
William Webster, the former head of the FBI and CIA, and Grant
Crandall, a mine workers' attorney, said they often thought Carey
was not telling the truth. They wrote that Carey ``was less than
credible'' when he denied remembering anything about close to $1
million in political contributions that the Teamsters made and that
he approved, including a $475,000 donation to Citizen Action.
</P>
<P>
   All three board members took Carey to task for a management
style in which, when on the road campaigning, he asked his
secretary for minimum details about such large contributions and
refused to return calls to senior aides who opposed such
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   In their ruling, Webster and Crandall wrote, ``While the
information provided to Carey was not sufficient to establish
Carey's knowledge of the nature of the scheme, it was sufficient to
impose on Carey a fiduciary duty to inquire further about any
relation or tie between Carey's own campaign fund raising and the
IBT's payment to an advocacy group like Citizen Action.''
</P>
<P>
   With Carey barred for life from the union, Hoffa is the
front-runner in the new race for the presidency of the
1.4-million-member union. Ballots are scheduled to be mailed out in
September and counted on Oct. 14.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In a statement issued Monday, Hoffa said, ``Today's Independent
Review Board decision banning Ron Carey from the Teamsters for life
is a small step toward returning honest, competent and above all
democratically elected leadership to the Teamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Ron Carey will trouble our union no more, but dozens
of his political cronies continue to hold office illegitimately at
the Teamster headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   In its decision, the review board also expelled Bill Hamilton,
who had already resigned as the union's director of government
affairs, a post in which he oversaw the Teamsters' lobbying and
political donations. Hamilton has been indicted on six counts for
participating in the siphoning scheme.
</P>
<P>
   The board found that Hamilton knew about the campaign fraud and
had worked closely with Nash in implementing it, by, for example,
writing numerous memos seeking to gain speedy approval of the
political contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton's lawyer, Robert Gage, said, ``Bill has done nothing
wrong and we strongly disagree with the board's decision.''

Jr., who is investigating the slayings of 14 prostitutes, has

investigators need the invaluable information that only these women

they cannot afford to give the appearance of shielding the
prostitutes, whose very occupations violate the law. ``The most

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' ROUTE LEADS THROUGH BOMBING RANGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By GRACIELA SEVILLA  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   YUMA, Ariz. _ On a day when desert temperatures burst above 120
degrees, Border Patrol agents stopped a pickup truck and found,
stuffed under a camper shell, 23 dehydrated illegal immigrants on
the verge of heatstroke.
</P>
<P>
   Heat was not their biggest enemy. The truck, its driver
oblivious to the danger, had crawled across a military bombing zone
called the Chocolate Mountain Aerial Gunnery Range northwest of
Yuma, a site controlled by the U.S. Marine Corps and used by
several armed forces, including those of NATO, to train pilots.
</P>
<P>
   That's where Harrier jets drop bombs of up to 2,000 pounds,
including ``cluster bombs'' that splinter on impact. Many remain
unexploded and can easily be triggered by heat, friction or even
something as delicate as AM radio waves, authorities warn.
</P>
<P>
   Even though the danger is advertised on warning signs in Spanish
and English, that hasn't deterred desperate crossers.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past four months, no fewer than 612 illegals have been
picked up by the Border Patrol on or near the range, according to
the agency. All were safely rescued, but military and Border Patrol
agents fear the increasing traffic is putting more men, women and
children at risk of being blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting large numbers of alien smuggling loads coming
through that area,'' said Donny Tibbets, Border Patrol
agent-in-charge at the Blythe, Calif., station. ``It's a concern
because we think there's a potential for a . . . significant loss
of life out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the past three years, more people have trespassed on the
range because the Border Patrol stepped up enforcement along the
California-Mexico border, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a new route that's being used to reach Los Angeles,''
says Rita Vargas, consul at the Mexican Consulate in Calexico,
Calif. ``It shows a high irresponsibility on the part of guides
taking people into this high-risk zone.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, no deaths of any illegal immigrants by explosions have
been documented. But the Marines and Border Patrol want to step up
their monitoring of the area and warn would-be trespassers to stay
out.
</P>
<P>
   The last fatality was in 1983, when a 35-year-old California
man, Jimmy Watkins, was killed and his father lost a foot when the
two ignored the no-trespassing signs to scavenge for scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just don't want anybody wandering around out there because
it's very, very dangerous,'' said Capt. Winston Jimenez, spokesman
for the Marine Corps Air Station in Yuma.
</P>
<P>
   Military bomber pilots have been training in the Chocolate
Mountains since World War II. In the early '90s, Harrier jet pilots
practiced there for Desert Storm. Today, the range is the Marine
Corps' busiest aerial weapons training site.
</P>
<P>
   Along with explosives, aircraft also drop flares that hold 20
pounds of sodium nitrate and magnesium that burn at more than 1,000
degrees Fahrenheit. The deadly flares float to the ground on
parachutes and can be suddenly activated when the parachute is
pulled out.
</P>
<P>
   About four times a year, the Marines ordnance disposal unit in
Yuma sweeps through the training sites to remove unexploded
munitions.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the danger of the weaponry is the area's isolation
from sources of help. Although military police patrol the
456,000-acre bombing range and military pilots are warned to fly
over on the lookout for people before dropping munitions, an
injured person could easily die before being found, military
spokesman say.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Border Patrol agents find themselves conducting more and
more rescue missions when illegal immigrants get stranded on the
bombing range.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Rolon, spokesman for the El Centro, Calif., station, says
the smuggling vehicles, in bad shape and packed with people, will
often break down in the harsh terrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once things go bad, the smuggler will often abandon the
group,'' Rolon says.
</P>
<P>
   ``On July 2, we brought 18 aliens out of the gunnery range after
their vehicle had broken down and they were out of water,'' Rolon
said.
</P>
<P>
   A month earlier, a land and air search was launched when a
citizen alerted the Border Patrol to a group of 31 people,
including a pregnant woman and several children, who were stuck on
the northeastern edge of the bombing range. &QL;

 BEIJING: running production. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``It's a push to separate the military buyers from the
sellers,'' said a Western expert in China's military, based in Hong
Kong. ``The domestic military manufacturers are extremely poor at
delivering product on time. The idea is to make them more
efficient.''
</P>
<P>
   Realigning the core businesses among China's 15,000 companies
owned or controlled by the military will also inevitably lead to
deep change involving some of the most lucrative and powerful
positions in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang has said repeatedly that he wants to wean the military off
its secondary income from these companies, and to rely solely on
money from the central government.
</P>
<P>
   Cheung, who works for Kroll, estimates that more than 95 percent
of all Chinese military enterprises are small and medium-sized
companies. It may not be difficult to sell or transfer the bulk of
these companies into civilian hands.
</P>
<P>
   A more critical question is what happens to the 500 to 1,000
large enterprises that generate about three-quarters of the untold
billions of dollars earned by military-owned or controlled
businesses, many of which are being consolidated into
conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
   The largest among them, like China Poly Group, Xinxing Group and
Carrie Enterprises, are already international corporations with
offices around the world, including in the United States. Military
leaders will likely be more reluctant to let go of these jewels
unless they are given a fair price.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Pollack, an expert in China's military at Rand Corp.,
noted that official news accounts of Jiang's announcement last week
were riddled with ambiguities about the scope of the order to
separate military from business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``This warrants some skepticism on the parameters of what Jiang
is undertaking,'' said Pollack. ``Though I think even a few actions
here to curtail some of the friskier business units would resonate
with a cynical public.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the key factors in the transformation of the military and
defense-related industries is the reorganization of the Commission
for Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, also
known as COSTIND.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, with Deng at the helm of China's military, the
commission was run like a personal fiefdom of the family of Marshal
Nie Rongzhen, a veteran of the Long March, the defining experience
for elder leaders of the Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
   Only in 1994, as Jiang began trying to oppose the widespread
nepotism in the defense industry, was Nie's daughter, Nie Li,
forced to retire from the board of the commission. Yet her husband,
Gen. Ding Henggao, remained in charge of the commission until
December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Ding was best known outside China for championing the
development of long-range ballistic missiles and the Long March
series of satellite launching systems. Ding was replaced by another
military leader, Lt. Gen. Cao Gangchuan, a deputy chief of staff in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year, as the commission was reformed, a civilian was
placed in charge: Liu Jibin, a former vice minister of finance with
experience in aeronautics.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, the commission technically answered both to the
State Council, China's Cabinet, and to the Communist Party's
Central Military Commission, probably the single most powerful
organization in China's vast political apparatus. The military
commission often overruled or meddled with decisions by the State
Council, causing innumerable delays.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new reforms, the Commission for Science, Technology
and Industry for National Defense is expected to exercise direct
control over key groups a civilian-run defense industry. That
includes China Aerospace Corp., Aviation Industries Corp., China
North Industries Corp., China National Nuclear Corp. and China
State Shipbuilding Corp.

they cannot afford to give the appearance of shielding the
prostitutes, whose very occupations violate the law. ``The most

<TEXT>
<P>
   WINSTED, Conn. _ Who would want to visit a museum dedicated to
the seemingly arcane topic of tort law?
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it would be hard to blame the people of this old mill
town for seeming a bit skeptical that a proposed museum to honor
some of the most reviled professionals in the country _ trial
lawyers _ was a sure-fire way to transform their downtown into a
mecca for weekend visitors.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to Ralph Nader, this town's most famous native son,
as he details his dream of a Museum of American Tort Law and brings
the same passion that started the consumer movement to the unlikely
cause of making personal injury law into a tourist attraction.
</P>
<P>
   ``There'll be the Pinto with the exploding gas tank, flammable
pajamas, asbestos and breast implants, the whole history of medical
malpractice, and of course the more recent toxic pollution, like
Love Canal,'' Nader said in a telephone interview, sounding like a
carnival barker reeling off a litany of horrors that could rival
the more macabre exhibitions at Madame Tussaud's.
</P>
<P>
   The project manager, Dr. Fred Hyde, remarked that there even
would be a gift shop that would sell ``the tchotchkes of tort
law.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, like models of defective toys, products that were
taken off the market,'' added Hyde, a consultant with degrees in
both medicine and law. ``We don't want to trivialize it, but we
want to have a way to memorialize the visit.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader has taken several steps toward making his vision for a
family outing into reality. He already has the building _ a 19th
century factory that used to make fixtures for coffins _ and he has
raised $1 million of the $5 million he needs for the construction
and startup. That vision, of course, has a distinctly political
edge. He is promoting the museum at a time business groups have
been pushing Congress to pass legislation, known as tort reform,
that would restrict their liabilities and limit damages.
</P>
<P>
   The museum, scheduled to open in late 1999 or early 2000, is
clearly intended to cast a more positive light on the practices
that have resulted in large jury awards to consumers who bought
questionable products (not to mention the lucrative fees for the
lawyers).
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, proponents of tort reform dismiss the whole idea as
little more than propaganda for trial lawyers. ``Mr. Nader should
make sure to have ample parking space for trial lawyers'
his-and-her Learjets,'' mocked Lester Brickman, a professor at
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University, who has
argued that lawyers' contingency fees are too high.
</P>
<P>
   And other critics have wondered aloud about the potential perils
of opening such a museum.
</P>
<P>
   Would it be able to serve hot coffee in a museum cafe for fear
of scalding customers' mouths? Should display cases be built
without sharp corners that could accidentally cut frisky children?
And will lawyers whose work is portrayed in a less-than-flattering
light sue for defamation?
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On the streets of this town in the foothills of the Berkshire
Mountains, residents were a bit puzzled by Nader's idea for a
museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a tort?'' asked Monique Goulet, 20, a clerk at Ivery &AMP;
Dudley Pharmacy on Main Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't they the blue laws?'' suggested Bill Wood, owner of the
nearby Deluxe Package Store.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, tort does not refer to laws regulating moral behavior.
And no, it is not that rich cake. It is a legal term for a wrongful
act that can be the basis of a civil lawsuit, though its exact
place in jurisprudence is very much up for debate.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, who rose to prominence in 1965 with his book ``Unsafe at
Any Speed,'' revealing the design flaws of the Chevrolet Corvair
and other automobiles, said the American tort system was not
adequately appreciated by the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tort law, the law of personal injury, was a major step on the
march to justice,'' explained Nader, a 64-year-old graduate of
Harvard Law School who lives in Washington and spends much of his
time writing books and lecturing. ``There's been a lot of attention
to civil liberties but not to physical integrity _ how our law
protects the physical integrity of human beings from harmful
behavior, unsafe products, toxic chemicals or auto crashes.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Lagassey, a 32-year-old machinist who was born and
reared here, said he appreciated Nader's efforts, though he would
prefer to see the building reopen as a factory.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's too much suing,'' he said. ``What we need is jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   But it seems unlikely that many manufacturing jobs will return
to Winsted, once an independent city but now a section of the town
of Winchester, population 11,000. Years ago, Winsted was a place
that made clocks, knives and woolen clothes. Today is a poor pocket
in tony Litchfield County, a haven for New Yorkers with country
homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nader's father, a Lebanese immigrant who died in 1991, ran a
restaurant here. His mother, Rose, and a sister, Claire, still live
here. Another sister, Laura, an anthropology professor at the
University of California, Berkeley, spends summers here. And the
family is well known for its involvement in local politics.
</P>
<P>
   While some people here wondered who would come to this museum,
its boosters maintain that educational tourism is booming and that
the number of specialty museums has grown rapidly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This country has a lantern museum, a garlic museum, 63 medical
museums and 31 lumber and timber museums, not to mention a museum
on every conceivable sport,'' Nader said. ``But no law museum.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader has solicited design proposals from several prominent
museum design firms. The tort museum was incorporated in
Connecticut earlier this year and has already received pledges of
more than $1 million, said Hyde, with contributions coming from an
all-star cast of trial lawyers as well as figures in the
entertainment industry. The head of the fund-raising committee is a
Knoxville, Tenn., lawyer, J.D. Lee, a pioneer in litigation against
the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to raise $5 million by the end of the year that will
be used to renovate the factory building, establish a Web site and
cover administration costs.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Nader said he hopes to raise another $5 million
so that the museum can lease exhibition space in Washington and
hold conferences in Winsted.
</P>
<P>
   The museum is supposed to be interactive. Nader said that one
area could have re-enactments of famous trials where visitors could
hear the same testimony that actual jurors once heard.
</P>
<P>
   And there will be artifacts, Hyde promised, noting that he
wanted to find a vintage Corvair or an old Pinto fuel tank.
Already, lawyers are calling to donate trial exhibits to the
museum's collection.
</P>
<P>
   Trial lawyers have to capture a jury's interest, and there are
warehouses full of elaborate trial displays across the country,
Hyde said. ``They're like Hollywood,'' he added. ``Like seeing
Spielberg in a courtroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader insisted it would all be riveting. ``Some people try to
make fun of the museum, just by the artifacts, but this museum is
much more than that,'' he said. ``It is a tribute to a major
chapter in American history, the great struggle for health and
justice in the environment, workplace and marketplace.''

PINT-SIZE PCS OFFER WINDOWS PERFORMANCE  
 BY DAVID EINSTEIN 
</HEADLINE>
 CHRON - PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY- NOTEBOOK   c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
If you've been looking for a portable computer that you can carry
around without getting a hernia and buy without refinancing your
house, you're in luck.
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new category of personal computer called the mininotebook
offers Windows 98 performance in a package that's smaller and
lighter than a conventional notebook PC but bigger and more
user-friendly than handheld PCs with their tiny keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  The main contenders in this bantam-weight class include the
Sony 505 ($2,000), the Toshiba Libretto ($1,700), the Hitachi
VisionBook Traveler ($1,650), the Mitsubishi Amity ($1,500) and the
Panasonic CF-M31 ($2,300). All are Windows-based machines, which
means that they will run most applications you can put on a
full-sized notebook or desktop PC.
</P>
<P>
   The Toshiba, Hitachi, Mitsubishi and Panasonic machines measure
about 9 inches by 7 inches _ only three-fifths the size of a
regular notebook. The Sony is bigger, but it's the thinnest of the
bunch. All the units weigh less than 3 pounds _ half the weight of
a regular notebook.
</P>
<P>
   Because you can't alter physics, some trade-offs are necessary
to reduce size. The most important sacrifices are:
</P>
<P>
   _The screen, which measures 7 or 8 inches diagonally in the
mininotebooks (10.4 inches for the Sony), compared with 12 inches
for a typical regular notebook.
</P>
<P>
   _The keyboard, which is about 90 percent the size of a regular
notebook's.
</P>
<P>
   _Mininotebooks have smaller batteries, typically offering less
than two hours between charges.
</P>
<P>
   _There is no CD-ROM drive. An external drive is an option
available for about $300.
</P>
<P>
   There are other minor drawbacks as well. Most mininotebooks have
slower chips than you will find on full-sized models. And they
don't come with modems, though you easily can add a
credit-card-sized modem for exchanging e-mail or surfing the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Inconveniences notwithstanding, mininotebooks are ideal for
business travelers who use their PCs on the road for
correspondence, spreadsheets, e-mail and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that they are under three pounds and are full Windows
systems makes them very attractive to real road warriors,'' said
Tim Bajarin, a Silicon Valley research analyst who closely follows
the notebook market.
</P>
<P>
   Whether mininotebooks will catch on in the mainstream market is
debatable. ``They've got a lot of people going `ooh and ah,' but
whether that translates into `Ooh, here's my credit card' remains
to be seen,'' said Dataquest analyst Mike McGuire.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, mininotebooks soon could be eclipsed by a new
generation of devices that are bigger than handheld computers but
smaller than mininotebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``PC companions,'' these under-2-pound contenders use
Windows CE, the streamlined version of Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Early entries in this new class include the NEC MobilePro 750C
and the Phenom Ultra from LG (formerly Goldstar), both going for
$899.
</P>
<P>
   PC companions look like full-size notebooks that have been cut
in half length-wise. The color screen is about half the height of a
full-size notebook display. The keyboard also is small. But it's
still large enough for touch-typing without getting instant
arthritis.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Most PC companions come with built-in modems. Another big
advantage to these little guys is longer battery life _ up to eight
hours for the NEC.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect PC companions to give you everything you get even
with a mininotebook. You can't add applications, so you have to be
content with Windows CE 2.0, which includes ``pocket'' versions of
Word, Excel, Internet Explorer and Outlook.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's enough to let you do the basic stuff like word
processing, spreadsheets, scheduling and e-mail. Given their
portable size, PC companions could be perfect for students who want
a computer for taking notes in class.
</P>
<P>
   McGuire thinks PC companions have the look of a winner.
``Frankly, we think these are going to out-ship the
ultraportables,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Now that your interest has been piqued, you might want to
hold on for a while longer before snapping up a mininotebook or PC
companion. That's because the next version of Windows CE, version
3.0, is due out soon. It will spawn a generation of more-powerful
mininotebooks and PC companions, and prices on current models will
drop.

 CHRON - COMPUTING Q&AMP;A/PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY   Trashing Hard Drive's Cyberjunk  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 Q:  I was told that to quickly rid my hard drive of the mass of 
 cyberjunk it has accumulated, the way to go is to reformat. If 
 feasible, how do I reformat and then put Windows 95 back onto   my
computer? I have a Pentium 120, a 2.1 gigabyte hard drive   and 32
megs of RAM. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Reformatting indeed will quickly remove your cyberjunk.
Unfortunately, it also will erase everything else on the drive. So
if you decide to do it, make sure to first save every document,
graphic and other piece of information that you want to keep on a
floppy disk or a Zip disk. Also, write down the account numbers,
phone numbers and settings for your online accounts, including
Internet and home banking. You'll also need copies of programs that
you'll want to reload, such as Microsoft Office, Norton Utilities
or America Online.
</P>
<P>
   If your PC came with an emergency recovery CD, you probably can
use it to reformat and reinstall Windows. If not, you'll need two
things: a Windows Startup Disk and a copy of Windows 95 (full
version, not upgrade). To make a Startup Disk, go to
Start/Settings/Control Panel, then double-click Add/Remove
Programs. Tab over to Startup Disk, and follow the instructions.
</P>
<P>
   To reformat your hard drive, start the PC with the Startup Disk
in the floppy drive. Then type c: /s at the prompt and hit Enter.
</P>
<P>
   Before you reformat, make sure to save the driver files and
configuration information for your CD-ROM drive on the Startup Disk
or on a separate floppy. You may need them to get the CD-ROM drive
working again after reformatting. (If the CD-ROM drive doesn't
work, you won't be able to reinstall Windows 95 from its CD).
</P>
<P>
   Consult the documentation that came with the CD-ROM drive, or
contact the manufacturer for information about installing the
CD-ROM drive software. Some companies let you download automatic
installation programs from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I would like to know how to receive and send e-mail while &LR; 
 &LR; traveling in Europe. I want to use my laptop and modem, but I &LR; 
 &LR; don't want to have to make a long-distance call to my Internet &LR; 
 &LR; service provider in the United States. Any suggestions? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; What you need is an ISP that offers ``roaming.'' This
feature lets you connect to your Internet account through foreign
ISPs. Many larger ISPs now offer roaming. To find one, check with &LR; 
www.ipass.com &LR;  or  &LR; www.gric.com &LR; , which are run by companies that
provide roaming services to ISPs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR; Q:  &LR; My Windows 95 desktop is getting cluttered, and I'd like to &LR; 
 &LR; remove some of the icons, especially the ones for programs I no &LR; 
 &LR; longer use. What's the best way to do this, and are there any &LR; 
 &LR; dangers to be aware of? &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; The easiest way to remove an unwanted icon is to
right-click it and choose Delete. However, as we saw in a column a
few months ago, some Microsoft icons can't be deleted this way. For
them, you need a program called Tweak UI, which you can download
for free from Microsoft at  &LR; www.microsoft.com/windows &LR; 
 &LR; /windows95/info/powertoys.htm. &LR;  Tweak UI lets you customize your
desktop, including dumping icons like MSN.
</P>
<P>
   As for possible dangers in removing desktop icons, yes, there is
one. Most icons are ``shortcuts,'' so removing them doesn't affect
the actual program. But the desktop also can contain bona fide
program icons. And if you delete one of those, the program is
trashed.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, you can tell when an icon is a shortcut because it
features a tiny arrow. Also, Windows will display a warning box if
you're about to get rid of a program.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Header Update:  &LR; Last week, I described how users of Netscape
Communicator can eliminate unsightly headers in e-mail messages.
That sparked a barrage of requests from America Online users who
also would like to do away with headers.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, guys, it can't be done. Says an AOL technician: ``We
are sorry, but unfortunately we do not support that ability at this
time. However, we do rely on our members' feedback, and all
comments submitted to us are forwarded to the appropriate
department for consideration.''
</P>
<P>
   If you'd like to register your opinion directly, go the Member
Services in AOL's Members menu. Choose E-mail, then click on Ask
the Staff.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK &QC; 
Don't like your keyboard? Get a new one. There's no hassle
involved. Just plug it in and go. A wide variety of keyboards with
different levels of sensitivity are available starting at under
$25. And ergonomic and wireless keyboards also can be had for under
$60.

THE GIANTS ARE GOOD. JUST DEAL WITH IT. 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ It was a simple kickoff return, one of many
practiced last weekend at the Giants' training camp, but it stirred
the attending fans like nothing else to date at this year's
workouts.
</P>
<P>
   That is because Jason Sehorn, perhaps the team's most popular
player, had caught the kickoff, and with fluid, graceful strides
sprinted up the field behind a developing wedge of blockers.
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later during a punt-return exercise there was more
applause. Tiki Barber, who is also among the team's most popular
players, had caught a punt and dashed down the sideline with it.
</P>
<P>
   These are training camp vignettes. They are meant to be frequent
scenes from a long-running regular-season play. At least the Giants
hope it is a long-running play.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is a risk to having two starters _ not to mention
two of your most valuable players _ running upfield, throwing
themselves into the fury of an opponent's special teams squads,
well, the Giants' coaching staff said it is willing to take that
risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a measured risk, but if you examine it, it's not the
return guy who usually gets hurt on special teams,'' Giants Coach
Jim Fassel said. ``Often, it's somebody getting blindsided chasing
the ball. I think Jason will be very good at avoiding people, and I
wouldn't even consider doing it if Jason wasn't so anxious to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, both Sehorn and Barber returned kicks in college. Both
have all but begged the coaching staff to give them the chance to
return kicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet I want to do it; I asked them last year if I could
play wide receiver, too,'' Sehorn said. ``There's always a chance
you can get hurt anywhere on a football field. If it's going to
happen, it's going to happen. I don't want to hold myself back
because of the risk of injury.''
</P>
<P>
   Barber, meanwhile, said he liked his chances after catching a
punt.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say, `Why would you want to catch a punt with 11 guys
coming at you at full speed?' '' he said. ``But it's easier to make
something happen that way. You can make some moves when 11 guys are
chasing you and you're just getting out their way.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a regular play when they hand you the ball, you've got 11
guys standing there waiting for you. That's harder.''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the velocity of collisions on special teams that tends
to make those moments among the most dangerous during a game. And
Barber, who at 205 pounds is considered a small running back,
missed four games with a knee injury last season and sat out parts
of another three games with other nicks and bruises.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants' coaching staff has made some concessions to the
possibility of injury. For example, the staff still hasn't decided
whether to allow Sehorn to return any kickoffs during the four
exhibition games. At most he will get one or two attempts at it.
But in the regular season, he will get a shot, maybe as often as
once or twice a game.
</P>
<P>
   ``He won't be back there every time,'' said Fassel, who added
that he does not fear the criticism he will hear if Sehorn is
injured on a kickoff return.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, two things forced the Giants to consider Sehorn on
the kickoff team. For one, they were in last place in the National
Football League in kickoff returns last season with a 18.9-yard
average. Also, LeShon Johnson, whom the team signed to help return
kickoffs, was found to have lymphoma and is sitting out the season.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, with an offense that ranked 27th in the league, the
coaching staff looked to the punt- and kickoff-return teams as a
way to score, or at the least to assist the offense with superior
field position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Between kickoffs and punts, you've got about 100 chances to
give the ball to a guy in the open field with major big-play
potential,'' the Giants' special teams coach, Larry Mac Duff, said.
``How important is that?''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, there seems to be no holding Sehorn back. The
topic brings a wide smile to his boyish face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, there's no outcry about me doing this now,'' he said.
``All I hear is everybody in the stands cheering. So if something
happens to me, people have to remember they were cheering.
</P>
<P>
   ``And if I get beat for a touchdown, even better; give me the
ball right away and let me get the points back.''

IAAF SUSPENDS 2 U.S. ATHLETES FOR POSSIBLE DRUG OFFENSES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla., W.Va.)  
 (subs for editing changes, smoothing, throughout)   (bl)  
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another drug scandal rocked international sports Monday when
track and field's world governing body announced that two of
America's top athletes, sprinter Dennis Mitchell and 1996 Olympic
shot-put champion Randy Barnes, had been suspended for possible
doping offenses.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions came with bicycle racing's Tour de France mired
in a doping scandal of its own, and they were announced on the same
day that the International Olympic Committee called for a world
conference next January to reappraise its campaign against what is
believed to be the extensive use by athletes of banned
performance-enhancing substances.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. track and field federation said that it would not
enforce the suspensions of Barnes and Mitchell, calling the
allegations unproved. The federation also accused the world
governing body of violating the Amateur Sports Act of 1978, a
federal law that entitles American athletes to due process before
they are declared ineligible to compete.
</P>
<P>
   That apparently meant that Mitchell and Barnes remained eligible
to compete in the United States but not internationally. Neither
athlete returned calls Monday seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell and Barnes were given random, out-of-competition drug
tests in the United States on April 1, said Giorgio Reineri, a
spokesman for the International Amateur Athletic Federation,
track's world governing body.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell, the 1992 Olympic bronze medalist at 100 meters, tested
above the acceptable 6-1 ratio of testosterone, the male sex
hormone, to epitestosterone, a related chemical, Reineri said by
telephone from France. Anything above 6-1 is considered to indicate
the use of testosterone as a muscle-building steroid.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, the world record-holder in the shot-put, tested positive
for a prohibited substance with steroid-like qualities, Reineri
said. The Associated Press identified the substance as
androstenedione, a banned nutritional supplement. Because he
previously was suspended for drug use, Barnes faces a potential
lifetime ban from competition. Mitchell could be suspended for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   Reineri said he thought that only the first of two samples that
each urine specimen is divided into had been tested for each
athlete. U.S. laws call for both samples to be tested and for
athletes to be given a hearing before they are suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are outraged that the IAAF knowingly breached our
confidentiality rules, which were put in place to protect those
ultimately determined to be innocent,'' Craig Masback, president of
the U.S. track federation, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's suspensions, and the IOC's call for a world conference,
followed controversial remarks reportedly made Sunday by IOC
president Juan Antonio Samaranch. He was quoted in the Spanish
newspaper El Mundo as calling for ``drastically'' reducing the
number of banned substances. He was also quoted as saying that he
did not consider it doping if an athlete used a
performance-enhancing drug that was not believed to be harmful to
the athlete's health.
</P>
<P>
   Samaranch's remarks elicited pointed responses Monday from the
Olympic community. Steve Ovett of Britain, the 1980 Olympic
champion at 800 meters, said it appeared that Samaranch was ready
to ``throw in the towel'' on drug testing.
</P>
<P>
   Jacques Rogge of Belgium, a surgeon who is vice president of the
IOC medical commission, said it was difficult, if not impossible,
to differentiate between substances that are harmful to an
athlete's health and those that are not.
</P>
<P>
   Among the questions being asked by Olympic officials were: Are
steroids harmful if taken in regulated doses under careful
monitoring by a doctor? And should substances that are not
performance-enhancing but are considered harmful be banned?
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Olympic Committee executive director Dick Schultz noted
Samaranch's strong anti-drug stance and wondered whether he had
been accurately quoted.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Schultz said, he agreed that a review of the
IOC's drug-testing policies was necessary. There are no uniform
standards for application of drug penalties among various
Olympic-related sports.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   And a sense of frustration has grown over the inability to
develop tests for such substances as EPO, a synthetic hormone that
increases aerobic capacity and is at the center of the Tour de
France scandal, and human growth hormone, which has steroid-like
qualities.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a morass out there that needs to be reviewed to
determine what is performance-enhancing and what is not,'' Schultz
said in an interview. He added: ``I don't think there's any
question that the drug gurus who are trying to beat the system are
ahead of the police.''
</P>
<P>
   The IOC issued a statement seeking to clarify Samaranch's
remarks. It said that he sought ``a clear definition of doping'' at
the 1999 world conference and that he had been referring to
codeine, which has been removed from the banned list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight against doping must continue in a spirit of
heightened unity,'' the IOC statement said. ``The IOC president
noted that the IOC's determination was greater than ever.''
</P>
<P>
   Schultz said the USOC was also looking to hold a worldwide
meeting on the drug issue in late 1999 or early 2000. Primo
Nebiolo, the president of track's world governing body, backed
Samaranch's call for a world conference in January 1999 at IOC
headquarters in Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem of doping affects the whole of the sports movement
and needs to be resolved quickly and effectively after years of
indecision and ineffectual actions,'' Nebiolo told reporters in
Lausanne, Switzerland. He said that the drug scandal at the Tour de
France ``destroys the image of one of the great symbolic sporting
events'' and added that doping is ``harmful for the athletes and
can kill a sport.''
</P>
<P>
   Festina, the world's top cycling team, has been suspended from
the Tour de France and its coach and team doctor taken into
custody. A Dutch team could also be expelled.
</P>
<P>
   Now U.S. track and field, already reeling from public
indifference and suspected widespread drug use, has to deal with
the international suspension of two of its most prominent stars.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension is particularly embarrassing for Mitchell, 32, of
Gainesville, Fla., who is chairman of the track federation's
athletes advisory committee, which has taken a vocal anti-drug
stance. The science of testosterone-epitestosterone ratio testing
is murky, however, and the USOC questioned its efficacy last year
during Mary Decker Slaney's case. Her suspension by the IAAF was
overturned by the American federation and is headed to arbitration.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes, 32, of Charleston, W.Va., set the world outdoor shot-put
record at 75 feet 10\ inches in 1990, but he was suspended in 1991
and 1992 after testing positive for the banned substance methyl
testosterone. He returned to win a gold medal at the 1996 Summer
Games in Atlanta.

OFFICIALS SAY  
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:Ill, Mont.)  (Eds: See also CAPITOL-SHOOTING-RDP and
CAPITOL-WESTON-MENTALHEALTH) 
(js) 
 By JAMES RISEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Federal law-enforcement officers are investigating
whether Russell Weston Jr. first sought to attack the White House
on Friday morning before shifting his focus to the Capitol,
officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lewis Merletti, the director of the Secret Service,
believes that Weston was ``casing'' the White House for a possible
attempt on President Clinton's life that day, one Secret Service
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are trying to determine whether Weston was
deterred from attacking the White House by its formidable security,
leading him to turn his attention away from Clinton, who had been a
recurring subject of what the authorities describe as his
delusional rantings over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they were still piecing together Weston's
movements in the hours before his attack on the Capitol but that
they had now talked to several witnesses who said they believed
they saw him in Lafayette Park near the White House on Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Among them is John Broder, White House correspondent for The New
York Times, who was interviewed by the Secret Service on Saturday
after informing the agency that a man matching Weston's description
talked to him in Lafayette Park about 9:45 a.m. on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Broder identified the 41-year-old Weston from photographs shown
him by the head of the Washington field office of the Secret
Service and two other Secret Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   In reconstructing his conversation with Weston, Broder said he
was sitting on a bench in Lafayette Park when Weston approached and
began to speak to him, warning that ``the storm clouds of war''
were gathering over Washington. Weston, Broder said, then gestured
toward the White House and added that millions would die ``because
of the people you put in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   Weston was intense and his speech incoherent, Broder said, and
he was carrying a small bag similar to an army ammunition satchel.
But he did not make any specific threats against Clinton or any
other federal official.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's presence near the White House on Friday morning would
suggest that he went there as soon as he arrived in Washington from
his hometown, Valmeyer, Ill., which, his family has said, he left
late Thursday morning. It is about 750 miles from there to
Washington, which would have given him little time for any stops,
particularly since he was traveling in his old Chevrolet pickup. In
any case, officials said they were still conducting a detailed
investigation of his route.
</P>
<P>
   The witnesses who believe they saw Weston in Lafayette Park,
combined with his frequent remarks about Clinton, have convinced
the Secret Service that he came to Washington with the president on
his mind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Paranoid schizophrenia was diagnosed more than a decade ago in
Weston, who suffers from delusions and was briefly
institutionalized in a Montana mental hospital in 1996. Earlier
that year he was interviewed twice by the Secret Service, which had
been alerted by local law-enforcement officials because of comments
he had made about the president. The Secret Service arranged for
him to be examined by a mental health professional, but at the time
he was deemed unlikely to commit violence.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in July 1996, about three months before he was
involuntarily committed to the mental hospital, Weston drove up to
the front security gate of the CIA's headquarters in Langley, Va.,
and said he had information to report. He proceeded to harangue the
agency's security guards for two hours. In that confrontation and
in later letters to the CIA, one as recent as this May, he said he
and Clinton were clones, that Clinton was responsible for the
assassination of President John F. Kennedy and that he himself was
a brigadier general who had invented a time-travel machine. Weston
also sent the agency a job application.
</P>
<P>
   Given the evidence suggesting his insanity, some federal
investigators caution that it will be difficult to determine
whether Weston had any clear motives or a focused target when he
arrived in Washington. Indeed, while investigators look into
whether Clinton was his chief target, some officials say they may
never know what drove him to violence. They note that Weston, still
hospitalized, has not yet been interviewed by investigators, and so
they have not heard his version of events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe,'' one official said, ``he doesn't even know what his
motive was.''

JETS-PACKERS CONNECTION HELPS OUT BOTH TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ They winter a few houses apart in Florida, but
Monday, Ron Wolf and Bill Parcells stood a few feet apart and
appraised the New York Jets on the practice field.
</P>
<P>
   Often, Parcells would ask Wolf's opinion and Wolf would ask
Parcells about a certain player. What was the Packers' general
manager, the architect of the team that defeated Parcells' Patriots
in Super Bowl XXXI, doing at the Jets' training camp?
</P>
<P>
   For the last few years, going back to Parcells' New England
days, Wolf has made an annual visit to see how his good buddy's
team is stacking up. In return, Parcells dispatches one of his
staff (this year it will be the Jets player personnel director Dick
Haley) to DePere, Wis., where the Pack practices.
</P>
<P>
   It has proved to be a symbiotic relationship. Two key Jets
pickups last year came from the Packers. The week before the season
started, the Jets acquired Jerald Sowell on waivers from Green Bay.
Haley had seen Sowell in practice and was impressed, and now Sowell
is competing for the Jets' starting fullback post with Keith Byars.
</P>
<P>
   The other player was Chris Hayes, acquired in a trade for Carl
Greenwood. Hayes immediately became one of the Jets' top three or
four special-teams players. The Packers also acquired tight end
Tyrone Davis, whom the Jets sent as part of an earlier deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that we've got exactly the same football
philosophy,'' Parcells said. ``But I respect his opinion and I'll
ask him what he thinks about a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who does not visit any other National Football League
team, said: ``I have a tremendous respect for Bill. I have trust
for him that most people in this business wouldn't have for one
another.''
</P>
<P>
   That trust, as well as a mutual admiration for the history of
football and an interest in military heroes, has forged a long
friendship.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf, who spent a year as the Jets' assistant general manager
under Dick Steinberg in 1991, said he agreed with the deal with New
England that made Curtis Martin a Jet. ``Any time you can get a
Curtis Martin for a first- and third-round draft pick, you have to
do that,'' he said. ``He's the third- or fourth-best back in the
NFL after Barry Sanders and Terrell Davis.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf noted that ``in visiting with Bill today, he seems fired
up, he seems rejuvenated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm sure he can coach for another four, five or six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   While Wolf played down the likelihood that Monday's visit would
result in a trade _ ``I don't think I'd do that off a one-day
visit'' _ he and Parcells each got the chance to bounce ideas off
someone he respects. And it gave Wolf a rare chance to see a
prospective Packer closer than he would get to any other player on
any other team in the league.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ CURTIS MARTIN remained sidelined for a second day with his
hamstring injury. During practices, he works out with the
conditioning coach, JOHN LOTT, to the side of the field. Then he
joins his teammates on the sideline. Coach BILL PARCELLS still
says: ``He's doing better. It's not much. He'll be back in a short
time.''
</P>
<P>
   _ SCOTT FROST will be tried as a kick returner even as he is
trying to convert to safety after his quarterbacking days at
Nebraska. And DEDRIC WARD, a backup punt returner, is battling ALEX
VAN DYKE as the third wide receiver after KEYSHAWN JOHNSON and
WAYNE CHREBET. . . . Parcells said he is distressed with tight ends
KYLE BRADY and FRED BAXTER. ``Right now, tight end's a little bit
of a mess,'' the coach said. He has made it an open competition
between the incumbent, Brady, and Baxter.
</P>
<P>
   _ MATT O'DWYER, who said he merely finishes his blocks, had one
of his annual tussles with a teammate. The guard and defensive
tackle ERNIE LOGAN exchanged a brief flurry of punches after
O'Dwyer blocked Logan. On Saturday, O'Dwyer sent JASON FERGUSON
headfirst into a massive tire under one of the mobile camera
towers. The players were frozen for a few moments until Ferguson
stirred.
</P>
<P>
   _ Asked about REGGIE WHITE's controversial off-season remarks
about homosexuals and ethnic groups, Packers general manager RON
WOLF said, ``Everybody's entitled to their opinion but sometimes
it's time to shut your mouth.''

EX-L.A. STARS ESTABLISH COURT ORDER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ You didn't have to be a former L.A. collegiate
tennis star to succeed Monday at the Mercedes-Benz Cup. But it
didn't hurt.
</P>
<P>
   USC alum Byron Black and recent UCLA standout Justin Gimelstob,
playing with a virtual home-court advantage, won their respective
first-round matches at the Los Angeles Tennis Center at UCLA.
</P>
<P>
   Black, the tournament's seventh seed, defeated Sjeng Schalken of
the Netherlands 6-4, 7-6 (10-8) in a mid-day match under the
blistering sun. Gimelstob, the up-and-coming 21-year-old, followed
with a 6-4, 6-0 defeat of the Czech Republic's Daniel Vacek.
</P>
<P>
   Black, of Zimbabwe, battled mightily to take the second set from
Schalken but benefited from the immense heat _ both the sun's and
Schalken's. The emotional Dutchman had taken a 2-0 lead in the set,
but Black broke his serve in the third game, clinching it on a
double-fault. Schalken overheated, swatting his hat with his racket
as he headed to his chair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sjeng is a very talented player, but mentally he gets a little
upset, he's unstable. I wanted to try and capitalize on that,''
Black said. ``I didn't want to give him any free points at that
stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men held serve from there on out, but Black had clearly won
the mental advantage and took that edge into the tiebreaker. He
faces Gianluca Pozzi of Italy in the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``I played a loose game in the second game of the second set
(when Schalken broke his serve). I think the key was to break back
immediately, which I did. That really got him down again. That was
key.''
</P>
<P>
   All of which made for a nice opening to Black's latest
homecoming. Though he resides in Zimbabwe, the former Trojan, who
turned pro in 1991, considers Los Angeles a second home.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really feel comfortable here,'' he said, referring to the
site but not necessarily the court, where temperatures hovered near
100 at ground level.
</P>
<P>
   The searing heat only seemed to affect Schalken, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm used to the hot weather,'' Black said, ``but I could feel
the heat draining the energy out of me out there, especially in the
second set. It was coming up from the floor as well. My feet were
getting really hot.''
</P>
<P>
   Gimelstob's greatest concerns had been his temper and his back,
in that order, but he seemed to have control over both in his quick
defeat of Vacek. It took the former Bruin just 1 hour and 1 minute
to win the match.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward Gimelstob said he's more in control of his emotions
now than he was as a tour rookie last year. He's also close to
fully recovered from a herniated disc in his back that knocked him
out of competition for three months earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   And he was more than happy to find his groove on the court where
he was an All-American before joining the pro tour in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to find a place I've had more repetitions on or
a better win-loss percentage,'' Gimelstob said.
</P>
<P>
   In other matches, Pozzi defeated Guillermo Canas of Argentina
6-2, 6-4; Andrew Ilie of Romania defeated Malivai Washington of New
York 6-4, 6-1; Martin Damm of the Czech Republic defeated USC alum
Wayne Black (brother of Byron) 2-6, 7-5, 6-0; Kenneth Carlsen of
Denmark defeated Oscar Burrieza of Spain 7-5, 6-4, and Jan-Michael
Gambill of Spokane, Wash., defeated Steve Campbell of Buffalo,
N.Y., 6-4, 6-4.

DEMOCRATS CAST WARY EYE ON ONE OF THEIR OWN 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DIRK JOHNSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After an unbroken 22-year streak of Republican
governors here in Illinois, some prominent Democrats are lamenting
that Republican views will prevail yet again in this year's race _
even if the Democratic candidate wins.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic nominee, Rep. Glenn Poshard, has faced a storm of
criticism from liberals in his party for a starkly conservative
voting record on social issues like abortion, gun control and
homosexual rights.
</P>
<P>
   Worried that liberal voters might sit out the election or,
worse, cast a ballot for the Republican nominee, George Ryan, some
Democrats have met privately with Poshard, imploring him to reach
out to the party's base.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Carol Ronen, a Chicagoan who sits on the party's
state central committee, met with Poshard and later sent him a
letter urging him to ``reassure progressive voters that you are in
the mainstream _ not the fringe.''
</P>
<P>
   Poshard's opponent, Ryan, the Illinois secretary of state, is
certainly no liberal. He is generally opposed to abortion. During
the 1970s, when he was a member of the state legislature, Ryan was
instrumental in defeating the Equal Rights Amendment.
</P>
<P>
   And Poshard is a liberal on economic matters, a champion of
organized labor and a supporter of efforts to raise the federal
minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
   But Poshard's conservative positions on social issues have given
Ryan a chance to appeal to moderate and liberal voters by casting
the Democrat as an extremist. While Poshard skipped the recent Gay
Pride Parade in Chicago, Ryan had a car in the parade.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan, who has supported some gun control measures, has also run
television advertisements that seek to cast Poshard as a right-wing
extremist on gun issues.
</P>
<P>
   Illinois is a state that tends to elect political moderates as
governor _ candidates who favor gun control and abortion rights,
and take a pro-business approach, like the current governor, Jim
Edgar, and his predecessor, Jim Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   The social conservatism of Poshard, a five-term congressman,
suits the sensibilities of his rural district, which reaches the
tip of southern Illinois, but riles many voters who live in Chicago
and other northern parts of the state.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians in Congress have frequently had a difficult time
winning statewide office in Illinois. One politician who was able
to make that jump between its southern and northern reaches, former
Sen. Paul Simon, said Poshard was ``in the process of growing'' as
he ``becomes exposed to the very different perspectives'' of
northern Illinoisans on issues like gun control.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Simon, who is regarded as something of an archangel among the
state's liberals, said Poshard's stands have typically reflected
the views of ``a rural region dominated by Southern Baptists.''
</P>
<P>
   The former senator, who once represented that very southern
Illinois district, has endorsed Poshard's candidacy. ``Glenn has a
gut commitment to helping people who struggle in our society,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Simon also expressed hope that the nominee would ``shift his
position'' on some social issues, given that he would no longer be
representing a single conservative region but rather a big,
culturally diverse statewide constituency.
</P>
<P>
   Poshard has shown little willingness to abandon long-held
positions on abortion and other issues, however, saying that
principle is more important than popularity.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of Poshard, even those who disagree with the Democrat on
certain issues, say that he is a man of strong convictions and that
he would not govern according to the latest public opinion survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is very much his own man,'' said Don Johnson, the president
of the Illinois AFL-CIO, which played a crucial role in Poshard's
triumph in the Democratic primary.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Johnson, the positions of Poshard on social
issues will not be critical to most voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``When our members are going fishing with a friend, or they're
out having a beer, they're talking about paychecks and pensions,''
he said, not social issues.
</P>
<P>
   The labor leader lauded Poshard's ``value system'' and his
compassion. He told of Poshard's concern for poor children at the
school in southern Illinois where he taught many years ago.
Noticing that many children wore skimpy coats during the cold
winters, Poshard started a drive to collect donated coats for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that was before he ever thought about entering politics,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   It is a side of Poshard that is little-known among many voters.
In recent days, the Democratic candidate has been publicly spurned
by some elected members of his own party.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Larry McKeon, the only openly gay member of the
Illinois Legislature, announced earlier this week that he could not
endorse Poshard, who has been cool to measures that would protect
gay Illinoisians from discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, three Democratic mayors of Chicago's southern
suburbs announced that they could not endorse Poshard because he
has not favored construction of an airport in Peotone, about 50
miles south of the city. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. has also withheld
his endorsement, citing the airport issue, which he believes would
bring development to some struggling towns south of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ronen, whose district is more than two-thirds Democratic,
said she had heard plenty of skepticism about Poshard among her
constituents. She said she remained optimistic that Poshard would
court liberals, but that time was slipping away.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's not doing well in a district that's this strongly
Democratic,'' Ms. Ronen, said, ``that does not auger well.''

ANALYSIS: PHONE MERGERS ARE HEATED GAME OF MUSICAL CHAIRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be a stretch to say that Bell Atlantic Corp. and GTE
Corp., two of the United States' biggest local phone companies,
have agreed to a $52.8 billion merger out of fear. But not much of
a stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The pace of deal-making in the telecommunications industry has
quickened to the point that it resembles a high-stakes version of
the children's game ``duck-duck-goose,'' with multibillion-dollar
corporations desperate to get one of the gargantuan seats that will
allow them to remain at the top tier of communications carriers in
the next millennium.
</P>
<P>
   With competitors old and new joining forces all around them,
Bell Atlantic, with $30.2 billion in revenue last year, and GTE,
with $23.3 billion, simply felt too small to thrive.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like keeping up with the Joneses,'' said one executive
close to the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   It is not difficult to understand the competitive anxiety.
</P>
<P>
   If Bell Atlantic completes its acquisition of GTE and if SBC
Communications Inc. completes its $62 billion acquisition of
Ameritech Corp., the nation's eight largest local phone companies
will have become four since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, if Worldcom Inc. completes its $37 billion
acquisition of MCI Communications Corp., the nation's four largest
long-distance companies will have become three. One of the three,
AT&AMP;T Corp., also plans to acquire the No. 2 cable television
company, Tele-Communications Inc., for $31.8 billion and over the
weekend announced a $10 billion international joint venture with
British Telecommunications PLC, Britain's dominant phone company.
</P>
<P>
   So, as Bell Atlantic continues an advertising campaign featuring
drawings of monsters from the children's book ``Where the Wild
Things Are,'' the metaphor remains apt.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic's top executives, the hardest question to
answer about acquiring GTE may not have been ``Why?'' but ``Why
not?'' After all, Bell Atlantic will actually pay slightly less
than GTE's market value, according to executives close to the
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the two companies' shares trade at roughly comparable
multiples to earnings. (As of Monday's close, Bell Atlantic's
shares were worth 16.5 times estimated 1998 earnings and GTE's
shares were worth a multiple of 18.2.)
</P>
<P>
   That means that acquiring GTE will probably not dilute Bell
Atlantic's shares to a degree that would encourage institutional
investors to mount a huge sell-off of Bell Atlantic stock.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the telecommunications industry, with its high
fixed costs and low incremental costs, fuels corporate
consolidation and partnerships. In deal after deal,
telecommunications executives say they can make their acquisitions
add to earnings by wringing savings out of their combined
companies, even without revenue ``synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   But the big factors behind the flood of telecommunications deals
are not so much financial, at least in the short term, as they are
strategic.
</P>
<P>
   Simply put, almost every big telecommunications company in the
United States is trying to get big enough to offer almost any sort
of communications service to just about anyone anywhere. The fear
in the industry, the fear that lurks behind many of the
multibillion-dollar acquisitions, is: If I don't do it, my
competitors will.
</P>
<P>
   That goes for product plans, geographic expansions and even
acquisitions themselves. People close to the negotiations said
Monday that BellSouth Corp. had expressed interest in GTE. For Bell
Atlantic, seeing GTE go to BellSouth would have been like the
general manager of a sports franchise watching an attractive free
agent join a divisional rival.
</P>
<P>
   A difference is that while professional athletic teams rarely,
if ever, acquire their competitors, Bell Atlantic and BellSouth
could very well pursue a merger of their own at some point.
</P>
<P>
   For Bell Atlantic, GTE brings experience in the long-distance
phone market and in high-speed data systems. Those are areas where
AT&AMP;T, the nation's biggest communications company, excels. Now that
AT&AMP;T is trying to get into the local market through its TCI deal,
Bell Atlantic is stepping up its efforts to go after AT&AMP;T's bread
and butter.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage may well be big international alliances for local
phone companies. Cable and Wireless PLC of Britain has long been
rumored as a potential partner for Bell Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phone companies like SBC and Bell Atlantic have their eyes on
the next round, which is when they ask permission to link to
foreign carriers,'' said Dwight Allen, a telecommunications
consultant for Deloitte &AMP; Touche. ``They are trying to educate the
regulators that what is unthinkably large today might not be
adequate tomorrow.''

 BOSTON: he said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A judge committed Weston to the Warm Springs hospital for 53
days in 1996, apparently after Weston made a threat against
President Clinton and was interviewed by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   After being placed on medication, he was released on Dec. 2,
1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no longer a threat to
himself or others,'' according to a spokesman for Gov. Marc
Racicot. A hospital employee drove him to his cabin in nearby
Rimini, the spokesman said, and made arrangements for him to
receive further treatment at a mental health center in Waterloo,
Ill., near his parents' rural home outside Valmeyer in southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn described this as ``Greyhound therapy,'' a way to save
Montana money by buying Weston a one-way bus ticket for a trip out
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents and
sister, April Callahan, said that he returned to Illinois with
three medications (whose names they did not remember) and that he
stopped taking them about a week later, despite his family's
protests. While his family described their growing concern over his
paranoid delusions, they also seemed to understand little about how
to seek help for him, or what treatment was available.
</P>
<P>
   The only community mental health clinic in Waterloo is Human
Support Services, a state-funded center. A spokesman for the
clinic, Rob Singer, refused to say on Monday whether Weston had
been a client there after his return from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said people like Weston would be less likely to fall
through the cracks if states like Montana and Illionois used
existing laws that provide for involuntary outpatient treatment.
Such laws allow states to force a patient to take his medication if
he fails to show up for appointments at a local clinic or stops
taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a shooting like that attributed to Weston is
particularly difficult because the relationship between mental
illness and violence is very sensitive, and many experts have been
cautious about publicizing new research suggesting that in certain
situations the emotionally disturbed are more violent than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Such situations occur when mentally ill persons have strong
paranoid symptoms that someone is out to get them or hear a voice
telling them to kill, said Bruce Link, a professor at Columbia
University School of Public Health. Another is when a patient fails
to show up for treatment or is off his medication, said Jeffrey
Sawnson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a MacArthur Foundation study found that mental
patients are no more violent than others unless they are abusing
drugs or alcohol. And Swanson said it is important to remember that
the mentally ill are responsible for only about 4 percent of
overall violence, making mental illness a smaller risk factor for
violence than being young, male or poor. But in a sign of how the
experts disagree on the subject, Torrey stressed that mentally ill
people commit 1,000 homicides a year.

SUDDENLY LEWINSKY IS DEALING 
</HEADLINE>
   (With CLINTON-STARR) 
 (sw) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Since January, independent counsel Kenneth Starr
has insisted that prosecutors would not grant immunity to Monica
Lewinsky unless they first met with her and judged her credibility
for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no substitute for looking a witness in the eye,''
Starr has said.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, six months and 10 days after the former White House
intern walked away from Starr's request that she cooperate with his
inquiry on an undercover basis, Starr's prosecutors finally looked
Ms. Lewinsky in the eye, meeting with her for five hours at an
undisclosed location in midtown Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The months-long obstacle to an immunity deal had always been how
the two sides would begin their alliance; Ms. Lewinsky had objected
to meeting before being assured she would get an immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, she changed her mind. Monday's secret meeting was the
idea of Starr's prosecutors. In a phone call last Thursday on Ms.
Lewinsky's 25th birthday, prosecutors invited her to sit down to
discuss the terms of an agreement. After consulting her lawyers,
she accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But both sides decided not to meet in Washington or Los Angeles,
where television reporters routinely follow Ms. Lewinsky's
movements. Although the choice of New York, the nation's media
capital, might seem odd, one lawyer said it was ``a neutral site''
preferred by Ms. Lewinsky because her mother and stepfather live
there.
</P>
<P>
   Late on Monday, both sides said they believe the meeting was a
successful first step toward an immunity deal. There are tentative
plans for another meeting later this week here, two lawyers with
knowledge of the discussion said on Monday night. It could not be
learned whether Starr is insisting that Ms. Lewinsky plead guilty
to a crime.
</P>
<P>
   In past negotiations with Ms. Lewinsky over the terms of a
possible deal for immunity, Starr's prosecutors had insisted that
she take a polygraph test. Two lawyers said that the subject was
not raised on Monday, but it could emerge as an important issue at
subsequent meetings.
</P>
<P>
   In a sworn affidavit given in the Paula Jones sexual misconduct
lawsuit against the president, Ms. Lewinsky said she had not had a
sexual relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   In earlier discussions with prosecutors, Ms. Lewinsky indicated
that she would be willing to testify that the two did have a sexual
relationship, according to lawyers familiar with the initial talks.
</P>
<P>
   Besides affording prosecutors the opportunity to ask questions
of Ms. Lewinsky and begin judging her credibility, the meeting laid
the building blocks for a likely immunity agreement that Ms.
Lewinsky had long sought and that Clinton's lawyers and White House
aides had always feared.
</P>
<P>
   According to two lawyers with knowledge of Monday's discussions,
Ms. Lewinsky told prosecutors nearly the same story that she had
told them in January. She again told them that Clinton did not urge
her to lie about their relationship, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting also sent a powerful message to Clinton and his
lawyers on the eve of the date that prosecutors had summoned him to
testify: Ms. Lewinsky may soon be in a position to testify against
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``He must be sweating now,'' an associate of Ms. Lewinsky's said
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   News of the secret meeting came as a surprise to some of the
president's lawyers and aides. Now that Ms. Lewinsky's testimony
looms as a possibility, several aides went out of their way to say
conciliatory things about her.
</P>
<P>
   ``My own view is Monica is still probably crazy about the
president, and does not want to hurt him,'' one senior adviser
said. ``I feel sorry for her. This has been an excruciating period
of time for her, just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   The terms of an immunity deal for Ms. Lewinsky have been
contentious since January. When she was first confronted by FBI
agents at the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Arlington, Va., on Jan. 16, she
met with lawyers in Starr's office for nearly eight hours. They
asked her to cooperate. She rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   But by the end of January, William Ginsburg, who was then her
lawyer, submitted a ``proffer,'' an outline of what Ms. Lewinsky
would be willing to say, to the prosecutors. Ginsburg had sought to
have a federal judge enforce an immunity agreement that he said the
prosecutors had signed. But the prosecutors convinced the judge
overseeing the grand jury inquiry, Norma Holloway Johnson, that no
agreement had been reached.
</P>
<P>
   An associate of Ms. Lewinsky said on Monday night that she was
pleased with the meeting on Monday and looks forward to cooperating
with Starr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ Here's an idea from a couture house this season: At the
dawning of the new millennium, we'll either be partying (thus
wearing tinsels, pompoms, streamers and confetti) or be victims of
mass destruction (thus wearing clothes shaped by the atom bomb).
There are two clues that the concept isn't from a top couturier,
but from an upstart house, Viktor &AMP; Rolf. The first clue is that
it's difficult to imagine Nan Kempner and Anne Bass in
mushroom-shaped togs. But the second is that it's an idea. And
ideas are something that top couturiers are seemingly waiting until
the millennium to share.
</P>
<P>
   It's difficult to recall a more moribund couture season, and
it's difficult to imagine that anything but the millennium is to
blame. While the rest of the world waits for the millennium bug to
come and eat its computers, the fashion community seems to be
expecting one to release a virus of creativity.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor &AMP; Rolf, designed by Viktor Horsting and Rolf Snoeren,
offered ensembles in their show stuffed with fun things like
balloons, tinsel and confetti, and then they showed some of the
same outfits with all the fun stuff taken out, so that roomy drape
was left over. Those five outfits were called Anticlimax. The rest
of the Paris designers showed all of their outfits with the fun
stuff taken out. They called those outfits couture.
</P>
<P>
   Slowly, the pretense that couture lives up to its mission of
being a laboratory of ideas has been abandoned. But when did it
start being a wasteland?
</P>
<P>
   What has drained the last bit of life from the five-day schedule
is that the designers who were supposed to liven things up _ John
Galliano at Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen at Givenchy _ are
as predictable as those twice their age. The only designer who
wasn't creatively stingy this time around was Jean Paul Gaultier.
While other designers have their eyes on the millennium, Gaultier
had his on the couture crown, and he handily walked away with it
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting at the end of the Yves Saint Laurent runway, Gaultier
looked every bit the obvious successor for the ladies on hand. It
has become tradition to marvel at the beauty of the Saint Laurent
show, even if every perfect ensemble is a familiar friend to those
in the front row, who are often wearing outfits that seem identical
to the ones taking their turn on the runway as part of the new
collection. Every year, when younger and younger fashion editors
arrive in Paris and don't quite understand what the big fuss is
about Saint Laurent, their elders patiently explain how
controversial, how hip, how surprising every Saint Laurent show
once was.
</P>
<P>
   It is expected to have to educate the young about Saint Laurent.
But did anyone ever expect to have to explain to them about Karl
Lagerfeld? It wasn't so long ago that Lagerfeld, at Chanel, defined
the entire season with whatever silhouette and cool new accessory
he had invented. Perhaps he defined the season this time, too, with
a shapeless silhouette, a blank slate of coloration and utterly
noncommittal clothes. It was a quiet, pretty look, skirts open in
the back to reveal starchy slips, pockets placed to give clothes a
soft slump. But it certainly wasn't the look that is going to put
society women back in Chanel suits and fashion editors back in
Chanel shoes, or to tempt strained Asian markets to take out their
credit cards. And it certainly won't start anyone talking.
</P>
<P>
   But the couture seems to have gone back to the days when women
bought it so that they wouldn't be talked about. There was
certainly little risk of that from these runways. The art form that
for years has been written off as a publicity ploy now coyly wants
to be pretty and practical. So, the season was defined by designers
who have made their ladies classically beautiful for years, like
Valentino, Oscar de la Renta at Pierre Balmain, Christian LaCroix
and Saint Laurent, not by those who have injected heat and light
into couture's cloistered corridors.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Once again, what is considered modern is minimalism. This is the
second time that Lagerfeld's Chanel collection has looked to
Japanese designers for inspiration, the first time being a bout
with deconstruction he borrowed to fray Chanel suits years ago. But
the sensibility is familiar today from the ready-to-wear runways of
Donna Karan, who has embraced the Zenlike esthetic for seasons, so
it may seem out of place in couture to clients. The most visible
touches of the atelier's hand were in geometric embroideries that
were subtle decoration.
</P>
<P>
   That abstract decoration was one of the few trends of the
season, showing up at Valentino to give an icy gleam to the
designer's familiar silhouettes, skirts all covering the knees.
Surfaces looked scratched as if by a knife on glass, giving the
wispy dresses edge. Silk piping gave hard corners to another dress
where the top was formed by the intersecting pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the exuberance that has defined Lacroix for years was
buried in black this season, but what couldn't be hidden even in
those tones was the depth of the work, the play of textures in the
simplest black coat or the layers of detail in the easiest mohair
sweater. And when Lacroix worked denim to make a suit of intricate
braiding, or put fringed crochet over a devore velvet flowered
skirt, there was more magic in those two looks than in all of the
couture shows in Paris put together.
</P>
<P>
   At Pierre Balmain, de la Renta was inspired by St. Petersburg.
He produced a gentle collection full of charm, with fur-trimmed
pants cropped at the knee, mandarin-collar dresses with golden
embroidery, tunics over slim trousers and glowing jade gowns edged
in mink.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps what was missing most from the shows was just a sense of
conviction, from the designers, the fashion editors and even the
buyers who attend to look for trends. In the past, couture has
seemed redundant with ready-to-wear, but it has never felt so much
so. There has always been, in the past, a determination in couture
that it make a case for itself. Either designers are convinced that
the case was proved long ago or, as clients add walkers and canes
to their more decorative accessories, designers have accepted the
inevitable end of an era. It is what was always predicted by Pierre
Berge, Saint Laurent's business partner, who presided with his
usual iron fist over the poignantly gentle showing of soft chiffon
dresses, slim velvet columns and tidy tweedy pants suits at Saint
Laurent.
</P>
<P>
   But what seems to be slowing the pace of fashion more than
anything is the fact that designers are watching the millennium
clock. Nearly every designer's news release had some reference to
it.
</P>
<P>
   Designers know that all artists are defined by their century.
Maybe they've done enough to be well represented in museum
exhibitions and retrospectives many years hence. Maybe for them,
the postgame party has already started. So it seemed at Thierry
Mugler, who closed the couture season last Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   There were serious pieces, like a herringbone dress frayed
gently at the edges with a spider-web stole over the top, or
impressive, thick knit tunics over slim skirts. But most of the
collection was made up of clothes decorated in fake gorilla hair
and monkey fur, some modeled by Jerry Hall and her daughter
Elizabeth Scarlett. Maybe the millennium will lead to designers'
creating couture that is inventive, eloquent and full of ideas. Or
maybe it will just lead them to create costumes for the remake of
``Planet of the Apes.''

   BOSTON _ Russell Weston Jr., the suspect in the fatal shootings
of two police officers in the nation's Capitol, may have chosen an
unusually public place to explode. But his history of mental
illness has much in common with other delusional mentally ill
people who become violent, illustrating both the cracks in the
nation's mental-health system and its difficulty in mandating
treatment even for those it knows could become violent.
</P>
<P>
   Weston's illness was well-known to family and mental health
officials. But because of the closing of state mental hospitals
across the country and the failure to build a promised network of
local clinics, the treatment of choice for him, as for the vast
majority of mental patients, was the honor system: counting on him
to give himself the often unpleasant antipsychotic drugs prescribed
for his paranoid schizophrenia.
</P>
<P>
   With Weston, the problem was compounded by living in rural areas
where psychiatric treatment and monitoring are extremely limited.
He also traveled between two states, Montana and Illinois,
encouraging at least one to solve his long-term care by sending him
back to the other.
</P>
<P>
   When Weston became violent, the reasons behind his behavior were
typical of the small group of mentally ill people who become
violent, recent research shows. He was not taking his medication,
he may have been using other drugs, and he had paranoid delusions _
in his case that the government was out to get him, using satellite
dishes aimed at his cabin or assigning Navy Seals and CIA
operatives to pursue him.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. E. Fuller Torrey, a psychiatrist and president of the
Treatment Advocacy Center in Arlington, Va. , said ``Mr. Weston is
an absolutely textbook case of what some of us have been saying for
years'' _ the dangers inherent in leaving untreated someone with
paranoid schizophrenia who does not understand he is ill.
</P>
<P>
   He estimated that there are about 100,000 people with
schizophrenia nationwide who are not being treated.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is preventable, Torrey said, given the development
of powerful drugs that can stabilize patients with severe mental
illnesses. In the 1960s states began to close mental hospitals
because the drugs offered a more humane _ and less expensive _ way
to treat the mentally ill in their communities. That approach,
however, required a network of community clinics to make sure
patients took the drugs, and those clinics were not built.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many people with schizophrenia, manic-depression
and severe depression stop taking their drugs and regress. Every
day 200,000 are held in jails or prisons because of the bizarre
behavior that results.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey's advocacy group seeks to improve treatment of the
seriously mentally ill and to change laws that make it difficult to
commit mental patients against their will.
</P>
<P>
   Such problems exist throughout most of the country. In
Westchester County, N.Y., in June, Michael Laudor, a Yale Law
School graduate who had won book and movie deals for the story of
his successful battle against schizophrenia, was charged with
stabbing his fiance to death. His medications had become
ineffective, friends said, but he had not been hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
   The mental-health net is especially weak in rural areas, where
the nearest psychiatrist may be 100 miles away and there is often
an aversion to government spending.
</P>
<P>
   In Montana, where Weston lived in a cabin over much of the past
20 years, ``It is so hard to get psychiatric treatment you usually
have to get arrested to get treatment,'' said Wesley Alcorn, a
member of the state board of the National Alliance for the Mentally
Ill, a group made up of relatives and friends of mentally ill
people.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, under Montana law, for a person to be committed to the
state hospital at Warm Springs, he must pose an imminent threat to
himself or others, ``which is usually interpreted to mean he must
be pointing a gun at himself or someone else,'' Alcorn said. Many
people with mental disorders are simply put in the local jail, he
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   A judge committed Weston to the Warm Springs hospital for 53
days in 1996, apparently after Weston made a threat against
President Clinton and was interviewed by the Secret Service.
</P>
<P>
   After being placed on medication, he was released on Dec. 2,
1996, because the hospital ``deemed him no longer a threat to
himself or others,'' according to a spokesman for Gov. Marc
Racicot. A hospital employee drove him to his cabin in nearby
Rimini, the spokesman said, and made arrangements for him to
receive further treatment at a mental health center in Waterloo,
Ill., near his parents' rural home outside Valmeyer in southern
Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   Alcorn described this as ``Greyhound therapy,'' a way to save
Montana money by buying Weston a one-way bus ticket for a trip out
of the state.
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews on Sunday, Weston's parents and
sister, April Callahan, said that he returned to Illinois with
three medications (whose names they did not remember) and that he
stopped taking them about a week later, despite his family's
protests. While his family described their growing concern over his
paranoid delusions, they also seemed to understand little about how
to seek help for him, or what treatment was available.
</P>
<P>
   The only community mental health clinic in Waterloo is Human
Support Services, a state-funded center. A spokesman for the
clinic, Rob Singer, refused to say on Monday whether Weston had
been a client there after his return from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Torrey said people like Weston would be less likely to fall
through the cracks if states like Montana and Illionois used
existing laws that provide for involuntary outpatient treatment.
Such laws allow states to force a patient to take his medication if
he fails to show up for appointments at a local clinic or stops
taking his medication.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing a shooting like that attributed to Weston is
particularly difficult because the relationship between mental
illness and violence is very sensitive, and many experts have been
cautious about publicizing new research suggesting that in certain
situations the emotionally disturbed are more violent than other
people.
</P>
<P>
   Such situations occur when mentally ill persons have strong
paranoid symptoms that someone is out to get them or hear a voice
telling them to kill, said Bruce Link, a professor at Columbia
University School of Public Health. Another is when a patient fails
to show up for treatment or is off his medication, said Jeffrey
Sawnson, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Duke University.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, a MacArthur Foundation study found that mental
patients are no more violent than others unless they are abusing
drugs or alcohol. And Swanson said it is important to remember that
the mentally ill are responsible for only about 4 percent of
overall violence, making mental illness a smaller risk factor for
violence than being young, male or poor. But in a sign of how the
experts disagree on the subject, Torrey stressed that mentally ill
people commit 1,000 homicides a year.

SALE OF COLISEUM TO TIME WARNER, RELATED COS. IS EXPECTED

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Metropolitan Transportation Authority is expected
to approve the sale Wednesday of the New York Coliseum, one of the
most treasured and star-crossed development sites in Manhattan, to
Time Warner and Related Cos. for a hotel and residential complex
that will also include a world headquarters and digital television
studio for Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a tentative deal that will go to the MTA
board Wednesday for final approval, real estate executives and
government officials say the Related-Time Warner partnership will
pay about $345 million for the tract on Columbus Circle, at the
southwest corner of Central Park.
</P>
<P>
   Related plans to build a pair of towers that would stand 750
feet over Columbus Circle and instantly create a soaring landmark
for a parcel of real estate that is the gateway to Times Square,
the Upper West Side and the luxury hotels on Central Park South.
</P>
<P>
   The 2.1-million-square-foot project would house Time Warner's
headquarters and broadcast facilities for the Cable News Network
and NY1, as well as a 425-room Mandarin Oriental Hotel, 325
condominiums and a 1,000-seat concert hall for Jazz at Lincoln
Center.
</P>
<P>
   The sale would mark another milestone in a tortuous 14-year
effort to sell the land, and it would conclude a wary political
dance between Gov. George Pataki and the MTA, which owns the land,
and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's administration, which has effective
veto power over any project.
</P>
<P>
   The first attempt to sell the property began during the
administration of Mayor Edward Koch in 1985 and ended nine years
later amid a recession and a flurry of lawsuits and community
opposition. A year ago, the MTA was on the verge of selling the
Coliseum site to Millennium Partners when Giuliani suddenly vowed
that he would block the deal unless it included a live theater or
performance space.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be a tremendous relief to the city, the state and many
New Yorkers to see the disposition of this trophy site finally
settled,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director at
Insignia/Edward S. Gordon, a real estate company. ``The good news
about the years of struggle is that it appears that the winner is
going to create a structure that reflects Columbus Circle's role as
a crossroad of business, entertainment and tourism.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is no guarantee that the proponents of the latest plan
will fare better than previous efforts. The Related proposal does
appear to have the support of some civic groups, including the
Municipal Arts Society, which helped block earlier proposals for
the largely dormant Coliseum site. But some local residents are
vowing to derail what they still consider to be an oversized
project. The Committee for Environmentally Sound Development has
already filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court in Manhattan
challenging the proposed development on environmental grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll proceed with the lawsuit, an injunction, whatever's
necessary,'' Olive Freud, vice president of the committee, said
Monday. ``It's a very sad day. The city's being choked and nobody
seems to care. The only people getting anything out of this are the
developer and the bondholders.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Mayor Randy Levine and the MTA declined comment, as did
Related Cos. chairman Stephen M. Ross, whose Madison Avenue office
provides a spectacular view of the Coliseum site and who, friends
say, has long wanted to own the parcel.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   MTA Chairman Virgil Shaw met Monday afternoon with Giuliani at
City Hall to settle on the winning bidder. The MTA's selection
committee is meeting this morning to review the deal, before making
a formal recommendation to the MTA board Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months city officials and the MTA have worked hard to
keep their top choices from becoming public knowledge, in hopes of
avoiding the kind of delay that occurred a year ago when Giuliani
suddenly blocked the MTA's plan to sell the site to Millennium
after word had filtered out that Millennium was the agency's top
choice.
</P>
<P>
   After months of delays, the city and state required developers
to include a 100,000-square-foot home for Jazz at Lincoln Center.
Bidding by five finalists finally resumed in April, although
Millennium had been negotiating with Jazz at Lincoln Center for two
years to build a new home at a different location.
</P>
<P>
   During the last week, the Related-Time Warner proposal edged out
its four competitors, including Donald Trump, the high bidder, who
threatened a lawsuit if he did not win.
</P>
<P>
   The real competition was between Millennium, which was planning
two luxury hotels, a large ballroom and 450 apartments, and
Related, which had the support of City Hall, mainly because of its
prominent tenant: Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   During the bid negotiations during the last four months,
Benjamin Lambert, the real estate consultant hired by the MTA, used
Trump's bid to force Millennium, Related and another bidder,
Tishman Speyer Properties, to increase their offers.
</P>
<P>
   With Related offering nearly the same contract terms as
Millennium, the MTA negotiators eventually came around to the
city's choice.
</P>
<P>
   In the coming weeks, Time Warner is expected to ask the city for
tax breaks and other incentives, a request that may put the
Giuliani administration in a quandary. The city has provided
similar incentives to many large corporations. But in May 1997,
Giuliani withdrew a tax break worth $50 million for luxury
apartments on the Coliseum site, saying a rebounding real estate
market made the subsidies unnecessary.

GOLF CHANNEL PROVES TO BE A HIT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PATRICK HIPES  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Five months ago, Jack Nicklaus said he
rediscovered his old swing, the swing that helped him to 70 PGA
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Jack's old magic was back not because of extra time put in at
the driving range or a chalk talk with links guru David Leadbetter.
It was because of the Golf Channel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The accuracy of my golf shots have improved greatly because of
it,'' Nicklaus told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. ``It wouldn't
have happened if I had not watched the 1965 Masters tape.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Nicklaus watches the Golf Channel, and he is by no means
alone. After a quiet debut in January of 1995, the 24-hour
all-golf, all-the-time cable network has continually exceeded its
own expectations. Now, after a recent agreement with mini-dish
company Primestar, the Orlando-based company is hoping to reach 25
million subscribers by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The network has hooked millions of fans from PGA Tour pros to
weekend duffers, glued to coverage of everything from the Nike Tour
to documentaries of classic tournaments, like Nicklaus'
self-inspirational '65 Masters victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just started watching it, but my clients are fully
addicted to it,'' said Van Nuys Golf Course pro Wayne Tyni, who
must pry players from the pro-shop television to keep a lesson
time. ``A lot of them, they watch eight or nine hours a day.''
</P>
<P>
   The network, available on 45 cable systems in Southern
California from Anaheim to Victorville, began as the brainchild of
Alabama cable entrepreneur Joseph Gibbs. In August of 1991, he
commissioned a Gallup survey to test the idea. After favorable
feedback, he convinced Arnold Palmer of the potential and the two
became co-founders of the network, which launched in earnest on
Jan. 17, 1995.
</P>
<P>
   At that point, the Golf Channel offered fans of the game
golf-at-all-costs programming. In the first year, starting with the
European Tour's Dubai Desert Classic, the network offered 64
domestic and international events, nightly news, a call-in show,
celebrity interviews and instructional tips.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics scoffed at the lineup, asking aloud who would watch
nonstop action of men walking about in checkered pants. Gibbs, who
raised $9.3 million in start-up cash, never blinked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I absolutely believed it was going to succeed,'' said Gibbs
from his production facility in Orlando. ``The original research
showed 44 million people either enjoyed playing or watching golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to shrewd deals with cable operators and satellite
systems around the country, the Golf Channel quickly picked up
speed. Sponsorship deals with Callaway Golf, Anheuser-Busch and
General Motors legitimized the network, and solid journalism _
strong interviews, reporting and documentary work _ made the
nonevents credible.
</P>
<P>
   By December of 1995 the network had 1.4 million subscribers. A
month later, Gibbs announced the year's advertising revenue doubled
the year before _ with 11 months remaining in the year. When the
Primestar deal was announced last month, the number of subscribers
was at 15.5 million, the network available in Japan and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew it was going to be as big as it is now and even bigger
than it is now,'' he said. ``I anticipate it will continue to
grow.''
</P>
<P>
   The blossoming of the network means more innovative, original
programming will complement an already successful lineup. It also
means golf pros like Van Nuys' Tyni must continue stealing the
remote control from pro-shop TVs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes,'' Tyni said with a chuckle, ``it does more harm
than good.''

   Bell Atlantic Buying GTE for $52.8 Billion in Stock
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic, which dominates the local telephone business from
Maine to Virginia, plans to acquire GTE, the United States' largest
independent local and long-distance communications company, for
$52.8 billion in stock. The companies plan to announce the deal
Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the latest in a torrent of
multibillion-dollar mergers in the telecommunications industry. By
acquiring GTE, Bell Atlantic would become the nation's largest
local phone company, serving more than 62 million customers.
</P>
<P>
   American Express Beats Estimates
</P>
<P>
   American Express reported an 11 percent gain in second-quarter
earnings, mainly because of heavy use of its credit card and record
purchases of mutual funds. The results at the travel and
financial-services company exceeded expectations, and its stock
rose 5.37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The strong earnings at American Express lifted stocks. The Dow
Jones industrial average leaped above 9,000, rising 90.88 points,
to 9,028.24. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index climbed 6.47
points, to 1,147.27, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite
index gained 2.27 points, to 1,933.26.

   Deal Near in Strike at Two GM Plants
</P>
<P>
   Negotiators are putting in long hours trying to resolve strikes

officials, with much to lose and little to gain, had a particularly
strong incentive to settle before an arbitration ruling on the
strikes' legality that could come as soon as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks Slump in Russia
</P>
<P>
   Russian stocks, which fell 17 percent last week, dropped another
9.1 percent, putting prices back to their levels before the
International Monetary Fund pledged to help avert default with more
loans. The market selloff reflected resilient investor doubts about
whether the government can extricate Russia from seemingly
intractable debts.
</P>
<P>
   A Nasdaq Market Maker Is Fined
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities

nation's oldest and largest market making firms, for fraud in
connection with 28 intentional Nasdaq trade reporting violations in
1994. The firm agreed to pay $950,000. Six Troster Singer employees
were sanctioned and fined a total of $100,000.

 &HT;    Starr turns up heat on Clinton
 &HT;    (EDS: Updates throughout.)
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's face-off with independent
counsel Kenneth Starr intensified Monday as Monica Lewinsky met
with Starr's prosecutors for the first time in the six-month
investigation and an appeals court rejected the president's claims
of lawyer-client privilege for one of his closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   These developments came even as Clinton's private attorney
negotiated with Starr's office over the president's looming
testimony before a grand jury investigating whether he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it under
oath. Clinton has denied both allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic development occurred in New York, where
Lewinsky held a secret five-hour meeting with Starr's prosecutors.
Some observers saw it as a possible prelude to a deal that would
grant the former White House intern immunity in return for her
testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with knowledge of the meeting indicated that the two
sides moved much closer to such an agreement, The New York Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations through her then-lawyer earlier this year,
Lewinsky was widely reported to have said that she was prepared to
testify that she had a sexual relationship with Clinton but would
deny that he or anyone else had pressured her to lie about it under
oath. Lewinsky repeated those assertions Monday, The Times said,
citing the unnamed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr reportedly has insisted on a face-to-face meeting with
Lewinsky to gauge her credibility before considering any immunity
deal. With Starr nearing the end of his witness list before the
grand jury, he must decide whether to subpoena her if no immunity
deal can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigators want to weigh Lewinsky's answers against
the mounting evidence they have collected from a long string of
witnesses, most recently Secret Service agents who guarded the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she is telling the truth, you might see her before the
grand jury soon,'' an unnamed source close to the case told Scripps
Howard News Service.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Starr would likely want to debrief her
extensively, which could take several days.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton suffered a potentially
damaging setback when a U.S. appeals court ruled that his
conversations with aide Bruce Lindsey, perhaps the president's
closest confidant, are not shielded by traditional attorney-client
privilege and are fair game for Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A government attorney may not invoke the attorney-client
privilege in response to grand jury questions seeking information
relating to the possible commission of a federal crime,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   As an attorney working for the White House, Lindsey's job ``is
not to defend clients against criminal charges and it is not to
protect wrongdoers from public exposure,'' the judges said in a
2-to-1 ruling that upheld a lower court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has appeared several times before the grand jury, but
reportedly has declined to respond to key questions, asserting
attorney-client privilege designed to protect the confidentiality
of discussions held between individuals and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff issued a statement Monday
assailing the court ruling and saying he is considering whether to
appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals has decided
that, unlike every other attorney and client in this country,
government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the right to
have confidential communications,'' Ruff's statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practical result of the court's decision is that the
president, and all other government officials, will be less likely
to receive full and frank advice about their official obligations
and duties from government attorneys,'' Ruff wrote. ``Without the
privilege, frank and candid exchange of information and advice will
be chilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was made by U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Judith
Rogers, a Clinton appointee, and Judge A. Raymond Randolph, an
appointee of President George Bush, according to The Associated
Press. Judge David Tatel, another Clinton appointee, dissented from
the main part of the decision, warning of the potential for the
sort of ``chilling effect'' to which Ruff alluded.
</P>
<P>
   Against this frenzied backdrop of court activity and immunity
talks, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, negotiated with
Starr's office over whether, and under what terms, the president
might testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's office issued a brief statement confirming that talks
were under way, but offered nothing of substance beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Office of Independent Counsel, as we
have in the past, to devise a way for the president to provide
information for the OIC's investigation, consistent with his
constitutional role and responsibilities'' the statement said. ``It
would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of failed talks with the White House about the
prospect of Clinton coming forward to testify voluntarily, Starr
has subpoenaed the president to appear before the grand jury today.
The White House has yet to publicly respond.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the inquiry said Starr would not enforce
today's deadline as long as negotiations were still on-going The
New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, an unnamed adviser to the president said
the deadline is not crucial because both sides are seeking a
compromise. Clinton is willing to testify if the questioning is
limited to the Lewinsky matter and does not involve a broad fishing
expedition into unrelated topics, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also is adamant about not being forced to appear
at the federal court house, the newspaper said. Clinton is willing
to provide written answers to prosecutors' questions or to submit
to a videotaped interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's testimony has become inevitable, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is now put in the position that if he doesn't
testify he's got to have some really overwhelming reasons, and
there are damn few of them,'' the Times quoted the adviser as
saying. ``He has said in so many words that he is prepared to
cooperate under certain circumstances.''

<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ The woman known as Soft Touch stood barefoot on
the sidewalk by her house in the Central Ward and watched the
customized van glide gently to the curb. At 9 o'clock on a Friday
night, it could mean only one thing _ another ``date.''
</P>
<P>
   But she was off Friday night. She crossed her arms and began to
walk away. She had reached the gate to her tiny yard when a man in
a business suit stepped out of the van and called her name. At the
sound of his voice, she stopped and turned around.
</P>
<P>
   ``That you, Malik?'' she asked the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sure is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, all right,'' she drawled with a nod and a grin.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 10 minutes, Soft Touch, 33, a prostitute who
refused to give her real name, and Malik, a captain in the Essex
County prosecutor's office whose real name is Louis Portella Jr.,
stood on the street doing what they have done almost every night
for the last three months: discuss the unsolved slayings of 14
prostitutes killed in the county since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   The neglected cases, all involving black women, touched a nerve
in Patricia A. Hurt, who became the county's first black female
prosecutor in January. In her first official act, Ms. Hurt made
these murders a high priority of her office and created a task
force to investigate them.
</P>
<P>
   While members of the task force have yet to solve any of the
original 14 killings, their constant presence on the street has led
directly to the arrests of seven men for crimes against prostitutes
that range from an unrelated murder to sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   In making these arrests, members of the task force have tried to
strike a delicate balance between getting close, but not too close,
to the prostitutes. While investigators need the invaluable
information that only these women can provide and sometimes turn a
blind eye to their soliciting, they cannot afford to give the
appearance of shielding the prostitutes, whose very occupations
violate the law.
</P>
<P>
   But even after just four months, the investigators have
succeeded in shedding new light on a world of violence and despair
that continues to exist in Essex County.
</P>
<P>
   The task force, composed of 14 detectives from agencies around
the county, embodies Ms. Hurt's profoundly held belief that
law-enforcement officers must go out of their way to protect
vulnerable segments of society.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, the prostitutes thought we would be bad for
business,'' Ms. Hurt said in a recent interview. ``But we won over
the confidence of a lot of women once they realized that we are
there, in a sense, as their advocates.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Ms. Hurt said that many streetwalkers live in fear of
their lives, she added that her investigators had managed to
convince the women that they were on their side.
</P>
<P>
   Portella, a tall but gentle-looking man who could pass for the
owner of a bowling alley, is the head of the task force. In 22
years with the Newark Police Department, many spent patrolling
streets where prostitutes worked their trade, Portella, 60,
developed a rapport with the women, a rap-and-banter friendliness
that, he said, has won him credibility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most important thing you can give these women is your
word,'' he said. ``And these individuals are the best source of
information in the early hours. Nobody sees it, nobody hears it
quicker than a prostitute out on the street.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   A few short blocks in central Newark form one hub of the
county's prostitution trade. On a recent stormy night, children,
shirtless and thin, spun black umbrellas on their shoulders and old
men sipped at brown-bagged beers beneath the lighted shelter of a
yellow bodega awning. Music, warped by speed, blared from passing
cars. And in the midst of it came the Stroll, as investigators call
it _ the nightly parade of prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   In a typical case developed from working the Stroll, the task
force arrested Bharat Malde, 31, of Roselle, who was indicted on
July 8 on charges that he posed as a police officer and assaulted
or sexually harassed five women after luring them into what he
claimed was his unmarked squad car.
</P>
<P>
   The task force learned of Malde by canvassing central Newark and
talking to prostitutes who knew him from the Stroll. Without the
task force, Portella said, there may never have been a case against
Malde. The women who the task force says were his victims, all
prostitutes, never filed claims with the police.
</P>
<P>
   To make such cases, members of the task force have taught
prostitutes to jot down license plate numbers each time they climb
into a client's car. The task force members have taught the
prostitutes to remember names, identifying features, even unusual
sexual tastes.
</P>
<P>
   In return, the investigators have given assistance where it is
due: a well-placed word to a presiding judge, a couple of dollars
on a quiet Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the wealth of information they have reaped,
investigators acknowledge that maintaining relationships with women
who break the law is a delicate, risky business _ particularly in
light of the discovery in New York City earlier this month that at
least 20 police officers and commanders in Manhattan's Midtown
South Precinct may have protected prostitutes in exchange for free
sex for more than a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Portella adamantly denied that his investigators had anything
but a working relationship with the prostitutes they use as
informers, and he said he was concerned that the developments
across the Hudson could hinder his efforts. ``Any time cops get
into trouble, whether it's with prostitutes or narcotics, it
doesn't help us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what we're doing here is altogether different from what's
going on in New York,'' he said, largely because the prostitutes
involved in his investigations need help.
</P>
<P>
   While his investigators might turn a blind eye to soliciting or
to drug use, Portella said, they have no qualms about arresting a
prostitute who robs a man or breaks more serious laws.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators have chosen to focus on protecting
prostitutes. ``There is no conflict here, because we're never going
to eliminate prostitution,'' said Det. Al Burroughs, who joined the
task force after serving 10 years in the Newark Police Department.
``We're talking about people with nothing _ no education, no job
skills, no family _ except a knowledge of the streets.''
</P>
<P>
   Burroughs maintained that his leniency was beneficial both to
the women and to his own investigative efforts. ``They're the ones
we turn to for information,'' he said. ``Who was in the red car
last night? Who was last seen with Soft Touch? Who was running from
the house on Sherman Avenue?''
</P>
<P>
   Although task force members say that information is easy to come
by on the streets, the investigators face a difficult problem. They
are compelled to build cases for a jury with testimony that comes
from notoriously suspect sources: prostitutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's one thing to understand when you're dealing with
prostitutes as witnesses,'' said Patrick Toscano, Essex County's
first assistant prosecutor. ``When you cast a play in hell, you
can't expect to get angels as actors.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Toscano said he did not believe that the
indictments already returned would be damaged by the reputation of
the witnesses. ``Just because you've prostituted yourself,'' he
said, ``doesn't mean you weren't beaten or raped.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Newark has taken significant steps toward economic revival in
the last nine months, largely because of the New Jersey Performing
Arts Center, a grand glass-shelled structure that opened downtown
last October. The arts center has not only drawn suburbanites, who
once feared Newark, to the city, it has also formed the anchor for
a miniature boom in real estate speculation in recent months and
paved the way for other potentially lucrative tenants to relocate
in Newark.
</P>
<P>
   But by and large, the revival has failed to reach the wooden
frame houses and brick apartment buildings of central Newark, where
prostitutes say they have seen few signs of urban renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Though Newark's rate of serious crime plunged to a 30-year low
in 1997, the talk of Sherman Avenue and its surroundings in the
last three months has been of the prostitute murders, not of
falling crime statistics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm scared every night I go out,'' said a prostitute in a
tattered black dress who gave her name only as Theresa. ``I've been
out here three years, and it's just getting more violent.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, many of these women say they are grateful for the efforts
of the task force.
</P>
<P>
   Outside a lighted bodega window, a prostitute in a dark blue
halter top and cut-off denim shorts, who gave her name only as
Jackie, told Portella and Burroughs about a man she said she
believed was responsible for the murder of a streetwalker whom the
police know only as Yasmeen.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, not one of the 14 prostitutes on Ms. Hurt's original
list, was killed in 1991, investigators say, after stealing $2,700
from a client's pocket so smoothly that she was able to snatch the
big bills and return the singles to his wallet unnoticed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard it was a pimp who did it,'' Jackie said. ``He rides
around in Jheri curls. I think his name is Prince. He be getting
girls to take him out and then I don't see them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The stories one hears on the Stroll are often bound with the
twin threads of violence and strength. And the women who tell them
seem to possess a startling fortitude.
</P>
<P>
   Moments after speaking with Jackie, a third prostitute walked
past the two investigators, and Burroughs, with a rapid sideways
glance, approached her. Giving her name as only Iris, she said had
been kidnapped by a customer in 1990 and taken to his house, where
she was raped.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in all the newspapers,'' Iris said, with a clinical
tone. ``I had to jump out the window and run up on the roof to
hide.'' Emergency workers later found her there, battered but
alive, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie, who had stayed to listen to Iris' tale, said, ``We see
all things.'' She added, ``For myself, I let my clients think I'm
not paying attention. But don't try nothing funny with me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If something happens,'' she said, as the investigators stood
and listened, ``we both going to the hospital. I'm going to take
him out, too.''

MARKET PLACE: BIG NASDAQ PENALTY IN DELAYED TRADE REPORTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cracking down on the Nasdaq stock market's old
cheatin' ways has generated more than $1 billion in penalties from
the well-known market maker Merrill Lynch to Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.'s
market-making subsidiary, Mayer &AMP; Schweitzer. On Monday, the
collection plate went around again, with another million dollars or
so dropped into it.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, the
NASD's regulatory arm, censured and fined Troster Singer Corp., one
of the United States' oldest and largest market-making firms, for
fraud in connection with a series of 28 intentional trade-reporting
violations in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   In settling with the NASD, the firm neither admitted nor denied
the regulator's findings, but it agreed to pay $950,000. Six
Troster Singer employees were sanctioned and fined a total of
$100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The improprieties in the case involved one of the biggest
problems that confronted investors in Nasdaq stocks in the early to
mid-1990s: the intentional late reporting of trades.
</P>
<P>
   NASD rules require that every transaction, and the price at
which it changes hands, be made public within 90 seconds of
execution so that all investors have equal access to information.
Trade reports are the letters and prices that run across TV screens
and electronic ticker tapes at brokerage firms. Knowing what other
investors are paying for a stock is what makes a market fair and
transparent.
</P>
<P>
   Even though NASD rules require the timely reporting of trades,
late reports by market-maker firms were endemic to the Nasdaq
market. They were such a scourge that the Securities and Exchange
Commission cited them in its so-called 21(a) report of two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the result of 18 months of investigation into
questionable Nasdaq market-maker practices, concluded that the NASD
had failed to police its market effectively. It said, for example,
that in a 10-month period in 1994, 3.6 percent of Nasdaq trades
were marked late, compared with 0.9 percent of New York Stock
Exchange trades.
</P>
<P>
   According to the NASD, between April 1994 and October 1994,
Troster Singer traders deliberately withheld information on 28
transactions in Nasdaq stocks. The trades were large and most
involved household names: 100,000 shares of Intel, 30,000 shares of
Oracle, 20,700 shares of Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond, and others. Troster's
customers were large institutions and other market-making firms.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 20, 1994, for example, the NASD said Troster Singer
bought 100,000 shares of Intel at $60.25 from an institutional
customer. Instead of reporting the transaction immediately, the
firm's head trader directed an assistant to hold off. While the
trade remained unreported, the firm sold 101,400 shares of Intel to
other dealers at an average price of $60.4375, almost 19 cents a
share more than it paid for its Intel trade. After it had sold the
shares at the higher price, Troster reported the original
100,000-share trade.
</P>
<P>
   The case against Troster involved one of the larger fines
imposed by NASD regulators and the largest imposed for intentional
late trade reporting. The NASD did not specify how much Troster
Singer benefited financially from the late-trade reporting.
</P>
<P>
   But keeping investors in the dark about such dealings does give
market makers an unfair advantage. For example, if a stock in which
a market maker held a large position was moving down, it might
behoove the firm to delay the reporting of a trade that might drive
the price down further. Better to put off the report until the firm
had covered its position and gotten out of harm's way. The practice
is called ``painting the tape.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Barry Goldsmith, executive vice president for enforcement at the
National Association of Securities Dealers Regulation, said:
``Having timely reporting of trades is extremely important to
ensure the transparency of securities trades and also enables
investors to better assess the quality of their brokers'
executions.'' Furthermore, the NASD says Troster was aware that
trade reports were delayed, yet the conduct continued.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Schiffman, lawyer for Troster Singer, declined to comment
on the case. Troster Singer has been an NASD member since 1948. It
was acquired by Spear, Leeds &AMP; Kellogg, a New York Stock Exchange
specialist firm and trading concern, in 1988. During the months in
which the late trade reports occurred, the firm traded more than
4,000 Nasdaq stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Fined and sanctioned in the case were Lowell Millar, Troster
Singer's head trader; Michael Ling, a trader who supervised other
market makers; John Quigley, assistant to the head trader; Lisa
Bozzi Albanese and Charles Esposito, institutional salespeople, and
Steven Cline, an assistant salesman. None of the employees had a
disciplinary history, and they neither admitted nor denied the
regulator's findings. They are still employed by the firm.

GTE AND BELL ATLANTIC CEOS BET ON POWER-SHARING AND PATIENCE
</HEADLINE>
   (js) 
 By ADAM BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ivan Seidenberg, the chief executive of Bell Atlantic Corp., may
be the most patient executive in corporate America.
</P>
<P>
   Seidenberg started as a cable-splicer's assistant at New York
Telephone out of high school at the age of 19 and rose steadily in
rank to become chairman, only to relinquish that position
temporarily when he merged Nynex Corp. with Bell Atlantic two years
ago, stepping aside so Raymond Smith, Bell Atlantic's chairman,
could hold the top job for a time.
</P>
<P>
   And now Seidenberg, joining the rush to consolidate in the
telecommunications industry with the expected announcement Tuesday
that Bell Atlantic will acquire GTE Corp., has agreed to accept the
second slot again on the organization chart.
</P>
<P>
   The terms of the deal call for Seidenberg, 51, to be president
and co-chief executive of the merged company. Charles Lee, 58 and
is now the chairman of GTE, will be chairman and co-chief
executive. People familiar with terms of the arrangement said Lee
was expected to step aside in 2002, leaving Seidenberg in charge.
</P>
<P>
   Their plan to be co-chief executives is the latest example of
such power-sharing arrangements to grow out of the current rush
throughout corporate America to consolidate. John Stafford, chief
executive of American Home Products, and Robert Shapiro, announced
such an arrangement in June, for example. Sanford Weill, the
chairman of Travelers Group, and John Reed, the chairman of
Citicorp, agreed to share power as part of their planned merger.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Lee and Seidenberg can comfortably share the office of
chief executive in their new company, and whether Seidenberg can
remain patient _ again _ until he takes over, are issues that will
be central to determining whether this latest planned merger will
work.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   For much of Lee's career, however, he has shown a degree of
patience, much like Seidenberg. Lee majored in metallurgical
engineering at Cornell University before attending Harvard Business
School. He then joined the finance department of U.S. Steel, and
moved to similar roles at Penn Central and Columbia Pictures. In
1983, he joined GTE as senior vice president of finance and rose
steadily, becoming chief executive in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   For the first several years under his watch, GTE remained at the
back of the pack in the telecommunications industry, reinforcing
its stodgy reputation as a hodgepodge of local phone businesses.
</P>
<P>
   But patience in a fast-moving industry like telecommunications
is not rewarded for long, and both executives have shown some
uncharacteristic impatience of late to get to the front of the
pack.
</P>
<P>
   Lee, for example, began declaring in 1996 to anyone who would
listen that GTE had decided it would become a growth company. GTE
even hired an actor to portray Gen. George Patton at a meeting with
securities analysts as a sign of the company's resolve. But actions
tend to speak louder than words, and Lee surprised the industry
last fall by joining a bidding war with Worldcom Inc. for MCI
Communications Corp. At the time, he called the bid ``an
opportunity to jump-start our strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   And with Seidenberg's merger of Nynex with Bell Atlantic, and
now with his plan to acquire GTE, the politically agile executive
has demonstrated a more aggressive approach as well, with his eyes
on a long-term reward of being a top player in the
telecommunications industry by the time he turns 55.
</P>
<P>
   The executives certainly have reaped considerable rewards
already, at least financially. In addition to $787, 500 in salary
and a $1.8 million bonus last year, Seidenberg received an
``implementation bonus'' of $3 million, according to Bell
Atlantic's most recent proxy.
</P>
<P>
   Lee earned a salary in 1997 of $1.04 million, a bonus of $1.5
million, and an additional long-term incentive payout of $2.4
million.

 &HT;    Starr turns up heat on Clinton
 &HT;    (EDS: Updates lede to 'first time in six months...' -- use this
version.)
 &HT;    By Bob Deans
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's face-off with independent
counsel Kenneth Starr intensified Monday as Monica Lewinsky met
with Starr's prosecutors for the first time in six months and an
appeals court rejected the president's claims of lawyer-client
privilege for one of his closest aides.
</P>
<P>
   These developments came even as Clinton's private attorney
negotiated with Starr's office over the president's looming
testimony before a grand jury investigating whether he had a sexual
relationship with Lewinsky and then urged her to lie about it under
oath. Clinton has denied both allegations.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic development occurred in New York, where
Lewinsky held a secret five-hour meeting with Starr's prosecutors.
Some observers saw it as a possible prelude to a deal that would
grant the former White House intern immunity in return for her
testimony before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with knowledge of the meeting indicated that the two
sides moved much closer to such an agreement, The New York Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   In negotiations through her then-lawyer earlier this year,
Lewinsky was widely reported to have said that she was prepared to
testify that she had a sexual relationship with Clinton but would
deny that he or anyone else had pressured her to lie about it under
oath. Lewinsky repeated those assertions Monday, The Times said,
citing the unnamed lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Starr reportedly has insisted on a face-to-face meeting with
Lewinsky to gauge her credibility before considering any immunity
deal. With Starr nearing the end of his witness list before the
grand jury, he must decide whether to subpoena her if no immunity
deal can be reached.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's investigators want to weigh Lewinsky's answers against
the mounting evidence they have collected from a long string of
witnesses, most recently Secret Service agents who guarded the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she is telling the truth, you might see her before the
grand jury soon,'' an unnamed source close to the case told Scripps
Howard News Service.
</P>
<P>
   First, though, Starr would likely want to debrief her
extensively, which could take several days.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, meanwhile, Clinton suffered a potentially
damaging setback when a U.S. appeals court ruled that his
conversations with aide Bruce Lindsey, perhaps the president's
closest confidant, are not shielded by traditional attorney-client
privilege and are fair game for Starr's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``A government attorney may not invoke the attorney-client
privilege in response to grand jury questions seeking information
relating to the possible commission of a federal crime,'' the
ruling said.
</P>
<P>
   As an attorney working for the White House, Lindsey's job ``is
not to defend clients against criminal charges and it is not to
protect wrongdoers from public exposure,'' the judges said in a
2-to-1 ruling that upheld a lower court's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey has appeared several times before the grand jury, but
reportedly has declined to respond to key questions, asserting
attorney-client privilege designed to protect the confidentiality
of discussions held between individuals and their lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   White House Counsel Charles Ruff issued a statement Monday
assailing the court ruling and saying he is considering whether to
appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals has decided
that, unlike every other attorney and client in this country,
government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the right to
have confidential communications,'' Ruff's statement read.
</P>
<P>
   ``The practical result of the court's decision is that the
president, and all other government officials, will be less likely
to receive full and frank advice about their official obligations
and duties from government attorneys,'' Ruff wrote. ``Without the
privilege, frank and candid exchange of information and advice will
be chilled.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday's decision was made by U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Judith
Rogers, a Clinton appointee, and Judge A. Raymond Randolph, an
appointee of President George Bush, according to The Associated
Press. Judge David Tatel, another Clinton appointee, dissented from
the main part of the decision, warning of the potential for the
sort of ``chilling effect'' to which Ruff alluded.
</P>
<P>
   Against this frenzied backdrop of court activity and immunity
talks, Clinton's personal lawyer, David Kendall, negotiated with
Starr's office over whether, and under what terms, the president
might testify before the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall's office issued a brief statement confirming that talks
were under way, but offered nothing of substance beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working with the Office of Independent Counsel, as we
have in the past, to devise a way for the president to provide
information for the OIC's investigation, consistent with his
constitutional role and responsibilities'' the statement said. ``It
would not be appropriate to comment further at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of failed talks with the White House about the
prospect of Clinton coming forward to testify voluntarily, Starr
has subpoenaed the president to appear before the grand jury today.
The White House has yet to publicly respond.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the inquiry said Starr would not enforce
today's deadline as long as negotiations were still on-going The
New York Times said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Times, an unnamed adviser to the president said
the deadline is not crucial because both sides are seeking a
compromise. Clinton is willing to testify if the questioning is
limited to the Lewinsky matter and does not involve a broad fishing
expedition into unrelated topics, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   The president also is adamant about not being forced to appear
at the federal court house, the newspaper said. Clinton is willing
to provide written answers to prosecutors' questions or to submit
to a videotaped interview.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's testimony has become inevitable, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is now put in the position that if he doesn't
testify he's got to have some really overwhelming reasons, and
there are damn few of them,'' the Times quoted the adviser as
saying. ``He has said in so many words that he is prepared to
cooperate under certain circumstances.

 &HT;    Two years later: Remembering the woman who died in Olympic park
blast
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DOUGLASVILLE, Ga. _ John Hawthorne Jr. has decided he wants to
make somebody pay for his wife's death, but even more, he wants to
make sure people remember the Alice Hawthorne who died when the
bomb exploded during the 1996 Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Hawthorne and others had a candlelight vigil Monday night at
Charles F. Golden United Methodist Church in Douglasville, where
Alice Hawthorne was born. The 44-year-old Albany businesswoman was
killed by shrapnel from the Centennial Olympic Park bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The widower ``is doing as well as anyone who has lost the love
of their life,'' said lawyer Gilbert H. Deitch, who is representing
Hawthorne in the suit filed this month in Fulton County State Court
on behalf of Hawthorne and Fallon Stubbs, Mrs. Hawthorne's
16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is dealing with the grief every day but going on,'' Deitch
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Hawthorne had gone to the park with Fallon to celebrate
Fallons' 14th birthday when nails and screws from the bomb wounded
them. Mrs. Hawthorne died from a head wound, the only fatality
directly linked to the bomb that injured 111 other people.
</P>
<P>
   A Turkish cameraman, Melih Uzunyol, died of a heart attack while
rushing to the scene. Authorities later ruled his death a homicide.
</P>
<P>
   No one has been arrested in connection with the blast, but
federal law officers consider fugitive Eric Robert Rudolph a
suspect.
</P>
<P>
   They are searching for Rudolph, 31, in western North Carolina.
He has been charged with bombing an abortion clinic in Birmingham.
In addition to the Olympic park bombing, authorities want to
question him about two other bombings in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   In their lawsuit, Hawthorne and Fallon claim that Olympic
organizers and security companies failed to keep the park safe.
They are seeking unspecified damages.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, Deitch said, is an attempt by Hawthorne to ``hold
someone accountable for the death of his wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, 16 other victims of the blast sued for more than
$100 million, but none of the cases has come to trial.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Hawthorne spoke to about 50 people who marked the
first anniversary of the bombing with a wreath-laying ceremony in
Centennial Olympic Park honoring his wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even though it hasn't been easy talking about what happened...
it was important ... to remember Alice,'' Hawthorne said last year.
``We can't let the world forget.''

JUDGE ALLOWS TESTS ON GUN IN GYM BAG OF KIMESES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By DAVID ROHDE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dismissing protests from defense lawyers, a judge
granted law-enforcement officials permission Monday to perform
tests on a .22-caliber pistol and other new evidence found last
week in a gym bag belonging to the suspects in the disappearance of
an Upper East Side widow.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, meanwhile, said they would charge the suspects,
Kenneth Kimes, 23, and his mother, Sante Kimes, 64, with committing
a lesser crime, like forgery, within the next 10 days while they
continue building a murder case against them based on
circumstantial evidence in the disappearance of the widow, Irene
Silverman, 82.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors have said they hope to charge the Kimeses with a
crime before Aug. 6, when they might otherwise be extradited to
Utah to face possible charges for passing a bad check.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Judge Herbert Adlerberg of Manhattan Criminal Court
dismissed complaints from the Kimeses' lawyers that law-enforcement
officials had violated state law and a court order by leaking to
the news media the contents of a gym bag defense lawyers turned
over to investigators on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Dismissing requests from the lawyers that law-enforcement
officials be punished, Adlerberg ruled that investigators could go
forward with examining the bag's contents and performing ballistics
tests on the gun. He said that the defense lawyers _ Mel A. Sachs,
Jose Muniz and Steven Somerstein _ could try to block the contents
of the bag from being used as evidence in any future trial, but
that for now, investigators were free to examine it.
</P>
<P>
   The Kimeses' lawyers protested that the leaks had damaged their
clients' reputations and tainted any indictment a grand jury may
issue against them.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors who spoke on condition of anonymity dismissed the
defense lawyers' complaint, saying they had not leaked the
information and no misconduct had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   The contents of the bag, which the Kimeses had stored at the
Plaza Hotel, could prove damaging to them in murder cases on
opposite sides of the country. According to law enforcement
officials who spoke on condition of anonymity, it contained a
.22-caliber pistol that investigators say may have been used in the
murder of David Kazdin, a former business partner of the Kimeses
who was found with a .22-caliber bullet wound to the head on March
14 in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The bag also contained a deed ceding Mrs. Silverman's Upper East
Side mansion to the Kimeses for less than 10 percent of its market
value, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Silverman's body still missing, prosecutors who are
trying to build a murder case based on circumstantial evidence have
said they would argue that the Kimeses were carrying out a fraud _
such as taking Mrs. Silverman's home and livelihood away from her _
that would necessarily involve her death.

EXCERPTS FROM COURT RULING ON ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (with CLINTON-STARR)  
 (editors: papers limited space may consider selecting excerpts from
this text for use as sidebars with CLINTON-STARR)  
 (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ _ Following are excerpts from the decision today by
a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit on attorney-client privilege in the case of the
independent counsel's subpoena of Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White
House counsel, to testify before the grand jury investigating the
case of Monica Lewinsky. The decision, which was redacted by the
court, was not signed but was supported by Judges A. Raymond
Randolph and Judith Rogers. Judge David Tatel dissented in the main
part of the decision.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DECISION
</P>
<P>
   In these expedited appeals, the principal question is whether an
attorney in the Office of the President, having been called before
a Federal grand jury, may refuse, on the basis of a government
attorney-client privilege, to answer questions about possible
criminal conduct by government officials and others. To state the
question is to suggest the answer, for the Office of the President
is a part of the federal government, consisting of government
employees doing government business, and neither legal authority
nor policy nor experience suggests that a Federal government entity
can maintain the ordinary common law attorney-client privilege to
withhold information relating to a Federal criminal offense. In the
context of Federal criminal investigations and trials, there is no
basis for treating legal advice differently from any other advice
the Office of the President receives in performing its
constitutional functions. The public interest in honest government
and in exposing wrongdoing by government officials, as well as the
tradition and practice, acknowledged by the Office of the President
and by former White House counsel, of government lawyers reporting
evidence of Federal criminal offenses whenever such evidence comes
to them, lead to the conclusion that a government attorney may not
invoke the attorney-client privilege in response to grand jury
questions seeking information relating to the possible commission
of a Federal crime. The extent to which the communications of White
House counsel are privileged against disclosure to a Federal grand
jury depends, therefore, on whether the communications contain
information of possible criminal offenses. Additional protection
may flow from executive privilege (redacted material). ...
</P>
<P>
   Recognizing that a government attorney-client privilege exists
is one thing. Finding that the Office of the President is entitled
to assert it here is quite another. ...
</P>
<P>
   On the record before us, it seems likely that at least some of
the conversations for which Lindsey asserted government
attorney-client privilege did not come within the formulation just
quoted. (redacted material) Both of these subjects arose from the
expanded jurisdiction of the independent counsel, which did not
become public until Jan. 20, 1998. Before then, any legal advice
Lindsey rendered in connection with Jones vs. Clinton, a lawsuit
involving President Clinton in his personal capacity, likely could
not have been covered by government attorney-client privilege. ...
Thus Lindsey's advice on political, strategic, or policy issues,
valuable as it may have been, would not be shielded from disclosure
by the attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   As for conversations after Jan. 20, the Office of the President
must ``present the underlying facts demonstrating the existence of
the privilege'' in order to carry its burden. A blanket assertion
of the privilege will not suffice. ... In response to the
independent counsel's questions, Lindsey invariably asserted
executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. On this record,
it is impossible to determine whether Lindsey believed that both
privileges applied or whether he meant to invoke them on an
``either/or'' basis. As we have said, the district court's
rejection of the executive privilege claim has not been appealed.
With this privilege out of the picture, the Office of the President
had to show that Lindsey's conversations ``concerned the seeking of
legal advice'' and were between President Clinton and Lindsey or
between others in the White House and Lindsey while Lindsey was
``acting in his professional capacity'' as an attorney.
</P>
<P>
   We therefore turn to the question whether an attorney-client
privilege permits a government lawyer to withhold from a grand jury
information relating to the commission of possible crimes by
government officials and others. ... Thus, although the traditional
privilege between attorneys and clients shields private
relationships from inquiry in either civil litigation or criminal
prosecution, competing values arise when the Office of the
President resists demands for information from a Federal grand jury
and the nation's chief law-enforcement officer.
</P>
<P>
   When an executive branch attorney is called before a Federal
grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes within the
executive branch, reason and experience, duty and tradition dictate
that the attorney shall provide that evidence. With respect to
investigations of Federal criminal offenses, and especially
offenses committed by those in government, government attorneys
stand in a far different position from members of the private bar.
Their duty is not to defend clients against criminal charges and it
is not to protect wrongdoers from public exposure. The
constitutional responsibility of the President, and all members of
the executive branch, is to ``take care that the laws be faithfully
executed.'' ...
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Examination of the practice of government attorneys further
supports the conclusion that a government attorney, even one
holding the title deputy White House counsel, may not assert an
attorney-client privilege before a Federal grand jury if
communications with the client contain information pertinent to
possible criminal violations. ...
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, government officials holding top legal positions
have concluded, in light of section 535(b), that White House
lawyers cannot keep evidence of crimes committed by government
officials to themselves. ...
</P>
<P>
   We may assume that if the government attorney-client privilege
does not apply in certain contexts this may chill some
communications between government officials and government lawyers.
Even so, government officials will still enjoy the benefit of fully
confidential communications with their attorneys unless the
communications reveal information relating to possible criminal
wrongdoing. ...
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, nothing prevents government officials who seek
completely confidential communications with attorneys from
consulting personal counsel. The President has retained several
private lawyers, and he is entitled to engage in the completely
confidential communications with those lawyers (Redacted material)
...
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for the eventuality of impeachment proceedings, a
White House counsel in effect serves the President as a political
adviser, albeit one with legal expertise: to wit, Lindsey occupies
a dual position as an assistant to the President and a deputy White
House counsel. Thus, information gathered in preparation for
impeachment proceedings and conversations regarding strategy are
presumably covered by executive, not attorney-client, privilege.
While the need for secrecy might arguably be greater under these
circumstances, the district court's ruling on executive privilege
is not before us. In addition, in responding to the grand jury
investigation and gathering information in preparation for future
developments in accordance with his official duties, White House
counsel may need to interact with the President's private
attorneys, and to that extent other privileges may be implicated.
(Redacted material) ...
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court's recognition in United States vs. Nixon of a
qualified privilege for executive communications severely undercuts
the argument of the Office of the President regarding the scope of
the government attorney-client privilege. A President often has
private conversations with his Vice President or his Cabinet
secretaries or other members of the Administration who are not
lawyers or who are lawyers, but are not providing legal services.
The advice these officials give the President is of vital
importance to the security and prosperity of the nation. ... Yet
upon a proper showing, such conversations must be revealed in
Federal criminal proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Only a certain conceit among those admitted to the bar could
explain why legal advice should be on a higher plane than advice
about policy, or politics, or why a President's conversation with
the most junior lawyer in the White House counsel's office is
deserving of more protection from disclosure in a grand jury
investigation than a President's discussions with his Vice
President or a Cabinet secretary. In short, we do not believe that
lawyers are more important to the operations of government than all
other officials, or that the advice lawyers render is more crucial
to the functioning of the Presidency than the advice coming from
all other quarters. ...
</P>
<P>
   While we conclude that an attorney-client privilege may not be
asserted by Lindsey to avoid responding to the grand jury if he
possesses information relating to possible criminal violations, he
continues to be covered by the executive privilege to the same
extent as the President's other advisers. Our analysis, in addition
to having the advantages mentioned above, avoids the application of
balancing tests to the attorney-client privilege _ a practice
recently criticized by the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, it would be contrary to tradition, common understanding,
and our governmental system for the attorney-client privilege to
attach to White House Counsel in the same manner as private
counsel. When government attorneys learn, through communications
with their clients, of information related to criminal misconduct,
they may not rely on the government attorney- client privilege to
shield such information from disclosure to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   FROM THE DISSENT
</P>
<P>
   This court now holds that for all government attorneys,
including those advising a President, the attorney-client privilege
dissolves in the face of a grand jury subpoena. ... Clients, in
this case Presidents of the United States, will avoid confiding in
their lawyers because they can never know whether the information
they share, no matter how innocent, might some day become
``pertinent to possible criminal violations.'' Rarely will White
House counsel possess cold, hard facts about Presidential
wrongdoing that would create a strong public interest in
disclosure, yet the very possibility that the confidence will be
breached will chill communications. As a result, Presidents may
well shift their trust on all but the most routine legal matters
from White House counsel, who undertake to serve the Presidency, to
private counsel who represent its occupant. ...
</P>
<P>
   I think the court seriously underestimates the independent role
and value of the attorney-client privilege. Unlike the executive
privilege a broad, constitutionally derived privilege that protects
frank debate between President and advisers, the narrower
attorney-client privilege flows not from the Constitution, but from
the common law. The attorney-client privilege does not protect
general policy or political advice even when given by lawyers but
only communications with lawyers ``for the purpose of obtaining
legal assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   A President's need for confidential legal advice may ``know no
parallel in government'' for another reason. ... Since for any
President the line between official and personal can be both
elusive and difficult to discern, I think Presidents need their
official attorney-client privilege to permit frank discussion not
only of innocuous, routine issues, but also sensitive, embarrassing
or even potentially criminal topics. The need for the official
Presidential attorney-client privilege seems particularly strong
after Watergate which, while ushering in a new era of
accountability and openness in the highest echelons of government,
also increased the Presidency's vulnerability. Aggressive press and
Congressional scrutiny, the personalization of politics, and the
enactment of the independent counsel statute, which triggers
appointment of an independent counsel based on no more than the
existence of ``reasonable grounds to believe that further
investigation is warranted,'' have combined to make the Supreme
Court's fear that Presidents have become easy ``target(s),'' truer
than ever. No President can navigate the treacherous waters of
post-Watergate government, make controversial official legal
decisions, decide whether to invoke official privileges, or even
know when he might need private counsel, without confidential legal
advice. Because of the Presidency's enormous responsibilities,
moreover, the nation has compelling reasons to ensure that
Presidents are well defended against false or frivolous accusations
that could interfere with their duties. The nation has equally
compelling reasons for ensuring that Presidents are well advised on
whether charges are serious enough to warrant private counsel. I
doubt that White House counsel can perform any of these functions
without the candor made possible by the attorney-client privilege.
As I said at the outset, weakening the privilege may well cause
Presidents to shift their trust from White House lawyers who have
undertaken to serve the Presidency, to private lawyers who have
not. ...
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, a properly exercised attorney-client privilege may
deny a grand jury access to information, ... but Presidents remain
accountable in other ways, (checks on Presidential action include
impeachment, press scrutiny, congressional oversight, need to
maintain prestige, and concern for historical stature). An
independent counsel, moreover, can always report to Congress that a
President has denied critical information to a grand jury. If the
President continues to exercise his attorney-client privilege in
the face of a Congressional subpoena, and if Congress believes that
the President has committed ``high crimes and misdemeanors,''
Congress can always consider impeachment.

STRANDED PETS RETRIEVED

   (With NY-COLLAPSE)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ After days of panicked pleas from pet owners and
animal lovers, city officials managed on Monday to pluck a
menagerie of beloved pets from apartments near the Conde Nast
building.
</P>
<P>
   The animals were all reported to be in good condition, if a
little dehydrated and famished.
</P>
<P>
   In all, city officials said, emergency personnel rescued a group
worthy of ``The 12 Days of Christmas'': a cockatiel, a guinea pig,
a hamster, two ferrets, 12 cats and a small school of goldfish.
</P>
<P>
   At least four cats had yet to be rescued Monday, said Sunny
Mindel, a spokeswoman for the Mayor's Office of Emergency
Management. Two were in a building on West 43rd Street, which
remained closed. Two others were on West 44th Street, but they
could not be found by firefighters Monday. The firefighters left
ample food and water instead, Ms. Mindel said.
</P>
<P>
   All the rescued animals were treated at the American Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals hospital on the Upper East
Side. A few were later returned to their owners, said Peter Paris,
a spokesman for the society.
</P>
<P>
   There were still discrepancies Monday night about the fate of
all the animals, Paris said. His office had a different tally of
animals rescued (18, but no goldfish), and of cats outstanding
(six, not four).
</P>
<P>
   There were also some questions about the two ferrets, which are
illegal to own. At last report, their owners had entered
negotiations with the city's Health Department to determine the
ferrets' legal status.
</P>
<P>
   But at least they, and all the other animals, were safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were just really amazed that they weren't in more serious
condition,'' Paris said. ``It just defies what we would expect to
see.''

SHARPTON LAWYER ASKS LENIENCY AS JURY WEIGHS DAMAGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. _ Fighting back tears as he delivered his
closing statement Monday, the lawyer for the Rev. Al Sharpton
pleaded with the jurors in the Tawana Brawley defamation case not
to punish Sharpton with a large damage award, which he compared to
a financial death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   After closing statements are completed on Tuesday, the jury is
expected to begin considering how much to award plaintiff Steven
Pagones, the white former prosecutor who won the first phase of the
case July 13. The jury decided then that Pagones was defamed by
Sharpton, C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox when they said he raped
Miss Brawley, a black teen-ager, in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   In his emotional remarks Monday, Sharpton lawyer Michael Hardy
described Sharpton as a brave civil rights warrior and urged that
the jurors not give him ``the financial electric chair.'' But, at
the same time, he appeared to lay the groundwork for rejecting a
heavy award against Sharpton.
</P>
<P>
   An award of millions of dollars against Sharpton, Hardy said,
would prove once again that ``black people in America have no
rights.'' He virtually dared the jury of two blacks and four whites
to make a decision against Sharpton that he said would be based on
race. ``If that is the statement you want to make, make it,'' Hardy
said, ``but the world would then know what a farce of justice this
trial really is.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury also heard Monday from the lawyer for Mason, Stephen
Jackson, and from Maddox, who represents himself. Each tried to
minimize the harm suffered by Pagones. Maddox is to complete his
remarks Tuesday and then Pagones' lawyer will deliver his
summation.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, S. Barrett Hickman of state Supreme Court, is
expected to instruct the jurors Tuesday that they can award
anything from $1 to the full $150 million in damages that Pagones
is seeking.
</P>
<P>
   Only five of the six jurors must agree on each award of damages.
Because the jurors rejected Pagones' assertion that the defendants
acted in conspiracy, each defendant would only be responsible for
the damages assessed against himself.
</P>
<P>
   All three of the defense lawyers tried Monday to walk a careful
line, saying on the one hand that any damages suffered by Pagones
were slight, and on the other challenging the jury's original
verdict that he was defamed. Maddox suggested to the jurors that
``some adjustments'' could be made to Pagones' original victory by
awarding him only a nominal amount.
</P>
<P>
   The defense would clearly claim a small damage award as a
victory. Maddox on Monday compared the damages phase of the case to
the second half of a football game and said the only thing that
mattered was the score at the end.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddox also spent considerable time suggesting that Pagones
suffered no damages. Referring to Pagones' assertions of stomach
pain, insomnia and other anxiety symptoms, Maddox said: ``There was
nothing ever wrong with him. And if there was something wrong with
him, Mason, Maddox and Sharpton had nothing to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   As Maddox had, Jackson also suggested that Pagones had not
suffered. But he also returned to an assertion Mason had made
throughout the trial: that Pagones in fact raped Miss Brawley, even
though a 1988 grand jury report exonerated him and the current
jury's verdict indicated that it considered the rape accusation
false.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson reminded the jurors Monday that Mason had declined in
testimony as recently as last week to retract his assertions of
years ago that Pagones raped, sodomized and kidnapped Miss Brawley.
``The truth is, he wasn't being wrongfully accused,'' Jackson said
of Pagones.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the attention Monday was on Hardy, as he sought to
position Sharpton for a continuing political career no matter which
way the verdict goes. He said the jurors should not impose a harsh
financial penalty that would be aimed at trying to stop Sharpton's
civil rights work. But he also said that Sharpton's work would
continue, no matter what the penalty is.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is to financially perish, let him perish,'' Hardy said.
``But it will not stop him from calling for justice for the next
victim.''

EDITORIAL: KEEPING THE CAPITOL SAFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   When tragedy strikes, it is natural for people to ask themselves
if there was any way it could have been averted. That is even more
true when the awful event takes place at a site as familiar and
freighted with symbolic import as the Capitol in Washington. Since
a gunman opened fire there last week, members of Congress have
offered suggestions for improving security that range from
requiring guards to wear bulletproof vests to building an
underground entrance where the public could be screened for
weapons. Fencing off the Capitol grounds is another often-mentioned
option.
</P>
<P>
   The Capitol has developed a fairly extensive security apparatus
over the years, with additional protections often being added after
a violent incident. Visitors must walk through metal detectors, and
officers from the 1,200-member Capitol police force are everywhere.
Last week the gunman, Russell Weston Jr., was able to get only a
short way into the Capitol before he was brought down by police
gunfire. Nevertheless it would be foolish to dismiss an incident in
which two officers died and gunfire reverberated through the halls
of Congress as proof that the system works. Lawmakers have an
obligation to conduct a thorough inquiry into how safety might be
improved.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the security searches at every door, the Capitol has an
air of openness and accessibility that members of Congress
rightfully treasure. It is impossible to walk past the White
House's tall fences, guard posts and traffic barriers without being
reminded that ours is a society that has learned to worry
constantly about the president's safety. But even though the
Capitol has seen sporadic violence, its crowded corridors,
meandering tourists and open lawns speak of a government of the
people. That is a symbol in itself, and one that should not be
given up lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's shooting has revived talk about creating an
underground entrance for tourists that would serve both as a
security stop-point and orientation center. Such a facility would
not necessarily prevent a disturbed gunman from trying to charge
past metal detectors, and shooting guards or tourists in the
process. But it would put the security clearance procedures well
away from the Capitol interior, where the proximity to members of
Congress and the actual House and Senate may incite a deranged
visitor with a grudge to action.
</P>
<P>
   A visitor center might also be helpful in giving tourists a
useful preparation for what they are going to see. The idea was
first proposed after a bombing incident in 1983, but was eventually
shelved due to objections to its cost. Some Republicans in Congress
are now suggesting that the center be paid for with private
donations. A commemorative coin issue has already raised almost $25
million of the estimated $125 million construction price. But any
idea of collecting the rest from private donors should be dropped
immediately. The United States is certainly capable of coming up
with the money to provide security for the home of its legislature.

DISPUTE BETWEEN JUSTICE DEPT. AND BURTON INTENSIFIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID STOUT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department refused Monday to let a
House committee see two internal memorandums in which the FBI
director and another high-ranking official urged appointment of an
independent counsel to investigate fund-raising abuses in President
Clinton's re-election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The refusal, not surprising in view of previous disagreements
between the department and the House government Reform and
Oversight Committee, intensified a dispute between the department
and Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., who heads the panel.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that he would discuss the refusal with committee
members on Tuesday, and that a contempt citation against Attorney
General Janet Reno was possible.
</P>
<P>
   Reno and Louis Freeh, director of the FBI, will send a letter to
Burton on Tuesday further explaining the department's position,
which was conveyed preliminarily Monday in a letter from an
assistant attorney general, Anthony Sutin.
</P>
<P>
   A Justice Department spokesman, Bert Brandenburg, said Monday
night, ``No prosecutor anywhere should have to hand out a road map
to an investigation and reveal information that could tip off the
guilty and smear the innocent.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton described that reasoning as disingenuous and said his
committee's subpoena was not seeking secret grand jury information
but rather the reasoning of the memorandum writers: Freeh and
Charles La Bella, who has headed the department's campaign-finance
task force. La Bella is leaving to become interim U.S. attorney in
San Diego, and told Reno this month that she had no alternative but
to seek appointment of an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Brandenburg said Sutin offered to meet with committee staff
members ``at their earliest convenience'' to discuss ways to
satisfy their hunger for information without compromising the
department's principles.

DEMOCRATS REJECT GASOLINE TAX INCREASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JENNIFER PRESTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Democrats in the Assembly announced Monday that
they would not support Gov. Christie Whitman's proposed gasoline
tax increase. This prompted the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, to
say that he would not put it up for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   Collins, R-Salem County, said that he would not ask Assembly
Republicans, who face re-election next year, to support the tax
increase unless it received bipartisan support. But he said that he
remained hopeful that some Democrats would change their minds. He
could still schedule the vote before the full Assembly meets on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal would raise the state's 14.5 cent tax on a gallon
of gasoline by 1 cent in 1999, 2 cents in 2000 and an additional 1
cent in 2001 to pay for $1.7 billion in new mass transit and
highway improvement projects over the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Breaking what everyone thought was a done deal, the Assembly
minority leader, Joseph Doria, D-Hudson County, said the Assembly's
32 Democrats decided during a meeting Monday that they would not
vote in favor of the gasoline tax increase because they believed
that the transportation projects could be paid for out of the
state's budget surplus. ``They just felt that there were better
ways to fund it,'' Doria said.
</P>
<P>
   This is the latest skirmish in a long-running battle between
Whitman and lawmakers over her proposed gasoline tax increase. When
Whitman first announced her proposal last spring, she recommended a
5-cent-a-gallon annual increase to pay for transportation projects
and an additional 2-cent-a-gallon increase for her plan to purchase
half of the state's 2 million acres of undeveloped land over the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   But lawmakers balked at using the gasoline tax increase to
purchase open space, and they said that a 5-cent annual increase
for transportation projects was too high.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks ago, Whitman and Republican legislative leaders
reached agreement on a 4-cent-a-gallon increase to be phased in
over three years, and to borrow $1 billion over the next 10 years
for the open-space plan. In a separate bill, the borrowing plan was
approved Monday by the Assembly Appropriations Committee and is
expected to be considered by both the Assembly and the Senate on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said that he would not go along with any gasoline tax
increase unless a ``significant'' number of Democrats joined
Republicans in supporting it. The tax increase was expected to win
approval with bipartisan support in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Whitman said that she was disappointed ``to
learn that such an important issue for all of the residents of New
Jersey has, at least temporarily, been turned into a partisan
squabble.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Republican legislative leaders in the Assembly and in
the Senate called lawmakers back to the State House this Thursday.
They were trying to meet an Aug. 3 deadline that would allow the
state to put a referendum on the November ballot, asking voters if
they approved dedicating all existing and new gasoline tax revenues
for transportation projects.

U.S. TOPS CHINA, 2-0, IN WOMEN'S SOCCER AT GOODWILL GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNIONDALE, N.Y. _ In an intensely played match that saw five
yellow cards and countless hard tackles, a pair of goals by forward
Mia Hamm in the 66th and 87th minutes gave the United States a 2-0
victory over China on Monday night for the women's gold medal in
soccer at the Goodwill Games.
</P>
<P>
   The first goal was set up when Christine Lilly having received a
yellow card one minute earlier, passed the ball through three
defenders to Hamm, who beat the Chinese offside trap. Hamm hit a
right-footed shot into the lower-left corner from 14 yards out. The
second score was all Hamm, as she controlled a deflected pass and
then curled a shot from 35 yards out to clinch the match. Her two
goals gives her 97 in her career, tying her with midfielder
Michelle Akers on the U.S. career scoring list.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd of 11,307, only 693 short of capacity at the Nassau
County Mitchel Athletic Complex, saw the renewal of a rivalry that
dates back to 1987, when the U.S. team made its first of five trips
to China to face the Chinese national team.
</P>
<P>
   China was host for the first women's World Cup in 1991, a
tournament that the United States won, but in which the host
country stumbled in the quarterfinals. The loss was so devastating
that China shut down its women's national team program for two
years.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1995 women's World Cup in Sweden, China and the United
States opened group play with a 3-3 tie that saw the Chinese score
twice in the final 15 minutes. The two teams eventually met again
in the third-place match, with the United States winning, 2-0. A
year later, they met for the gold medal in the 1996 Olympic Games,
where a crowd of 76,481 saw the United States defeat China, 2-1.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the first half Monday night, the U.S. side had
dominated in every way except on the scoreboard. China only got off
one shot, while the Americans peppered Chinese goalkeeper Zhao Yan
with nine shots on goal. Forward Tiffeny Milbrett pushed a shot
wide right in the 32nd minute, while Lilly missed a breakaway shot
five minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   China seriously threatened in the 55th minute when defender Kate
Sobrero took down defender Liu Ailing at the top of the penalty
area, drawing a yellow card for Sobrero and a free kick for China.
Midfielder Sun Wen's shot hit the crossbar and a subsequent header
by forward Zhang Ouying flew over the goal. Ouying nearly tied the
match in the 78th minute when she found herself just inside the
penalty area. But U.S. goalkeeper Briana Scurry came out and cut
off Ouying's angle, forcing her to miss wide. Nine minutes later,
Hamm put it out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   The fate of penalty kicks was much kinder to Norway in the
bronze medal match. Norway, which lost 4-2 on penalty kicks to
China on Saturday, was able to defeat Denmark on Monday night by
the same score after battling to a 1-1 tie in regulation. Much like
Saturday's match, Norway got on the board first, getting a goal
from midfielder Unni Lehn in the 20th minute. The lead stood up
until the 82nd minute when, after a mad scramble in the penalty
area, midfielder Anne Nelson kicked a point-blank shot in for the
equalizer.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson opened up the round of penalty kicks by having her
attempt saved by Norwegian goalkeeper Bente Nordby. After Denmark
missed its fourth kick, defender Henriette Viker clinched the match
by converting her penalty shot.

DISCOVERY TO BUY 50 PERCENT STAKE IN CBS EYE ON PEOPLE CHANNEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL CARTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   CBS, citing ``significant losses,'' announced Monday that it
would cede management of the Eye on People cable channel to
Discovery Communications, which will acquire a 50 percent interest
in what will become a joint venture.
</P>
<P>
   The channel, previously known as ``CBS Eye on People,'' will
drop CBS from its title, although much of the programming will
still be generated by CBS News, both in original productions and in
material taken from the network library, executives associated with
the two companies said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Communications, the operator of numerous other cable
channels including the Discovery Channel, will also supply programs
for Eye on People. The channel will continue to focus on the lives
of famous people.
</P>
<P>
   Don Mitzner, president of CBS Cable, said the decision to seek a
partner for the channel reflected a concern by CBS's corporate
management over what he called the ``cash flow issue'' surrounding
Eye on People. He said the channel had lost ``significant amounts
of money'' since it started up in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
   He did not specify a figure, but several CBS executives said the
network had lost between $50 million and $70 million on the
channel.
</P>
<P>
   The exact amount of CBS's losses is central to the deal because
Discovery Communications has committed to paying all the costs of
the channel until it matches the CBS investment to this point.
Discovery is putting no money up front to secure the 50 percent
interest, Mitzner said.
</P>
<P>
   Discovery Communications, which is largely owned by
Tele-Communications Inc., the largest operator of cable systems,
will try to drive up the distribution of Eye on People, executives
from the company said. The channel is available in only about 11
million homes. Cable channels usually need to reach at least 30
million homes to make a profit.
</P>
<P>
   Mitzner said he hoped Eye on People would be profitable in the
next three to five years.
</P>
<P>
   CBS is also known to be looking for a similar partner for
another cable channel it owns, Telenoticias, a Spanish-language
news channel. Mitzner would not confirm that CBS was looking for
such a deal, but he said that corporate management of CBS is
``trying to maximize cash flow right now.''
</P>
<P>
   He disputed the suggestion that CBS was backing away from cable
investments, citing the decision less than a year ago to pay $1.5
billion for the Nashville Network and Country Music Television.

ALFONZO BOTHERED BY LACK OF OUTPUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ If there was one certainty about the New York Mets'
offense this season, from the front office on down, it was that
Edgardo Alfonzo was headed for stardom.
</P>
<P>
   So now the question arises: What, if anything, is wrong with
Alfonzo this year?
</P>
<P>
   In 85 games, the 24-year-old third baseman is hitting .267 with
six home runs and 47 runs batted in. Not terrible. But not what one
would expect from someone who finished 13th in the voting for
National League most valuable player last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's having a bad year,'' manager Bobby
Valentine said in Chicago last weekend. ``But it doesn't seem to me
he's felt as good playing as he felt last year. Maybe it's just a
nagging looseness.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine was referring to Alfonzo's right shoulder. Alfonzo
strained his right rotator cuff five weeks into the season, then
spent two weeks on the disabled list. He has also had tightness in
his upper legs from time to time. But Alfonzo, who has also had
back problems during his career, insisted on Sunday that he is
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that's bothering me is that I can't be consistent at
home plate,'' Alfonzo said. ``That's all.''
</P>
<P>
   And it is obviously affecting the rest of the Mets' offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year was a tremendous year for me,'' Alfonzo said. ``This
year, I've had more opportunity to play. I have just tried to do my
job and make things happen. But I've been up and down, up and
down.''
</P>
<P>
   And so have the Mets, who open a 10-game homestand when they
play the San Diego Padres on Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Of all the players on the Mets heading into spring training, the
one the team was least concerned about was Alfonzo, who batted .315
in 1997, his first year as an everyday player.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were hoping that Alfonzo, who settled on a one-year
base contract for $1.75 million after he and the Mets could not
agree on a longer deal, could build on his power numbers. That was
about it.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, 102 games into his second season as the regular third
baseman, Alfonzo's power numbers _ he had 10 home runs and 72 RBI
last season _ are on roughly the same pace. His average is way
down, especially against left-handed pitching. In 1997, Alfonzo hit
.378 against lefties. This year, after 71 at-bats, he is batting
.225.
</P>
<P>
   And with runners in scoring position, Alfonzo's average has
dropped from .417 last season to .327 this year.
</P>
<P>
   There are varying theories as to why Alfonzo has struggled in
his second season as a regular. Has he been hurting more than he
has let on? Has he failed to adapt to the adjustments pitchers
(especially lefties) have made to him? Or is he simply pressing
while switching between hitting leadoff and No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   And there is no clear answer, although Valentine quickly brushed
off suggestions of a so-called sophomore jinx.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sophomore jinx is caused by complacency,'' Valentine said.
``I don't think he's been complacent at all.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as hitting coach Tom Robson pointed out, pitchers make
adjustments after a hitter enjoys an outstanding year.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so, when a hitter comes off a good year, he has to make
adjustments, too,'' Robson said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the injuries, Valentine has said that one of his biggest
mistakes of the first half was not insisting that Alfonzo go on a
rehabilitation assignment before he came off the disabled list. The
problem was that Alfonzo refused to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should I have gone down?'' he said again Sunday,
contending that facing minor league pitchers would only have messed
up his swing.
</P>
<P>
   There have been questions, however, about Alfonzo's bat speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days, he has been perfectly sharp,'' Robson said.
``Others, he's just a little bit behind. He just has to get through
it and put together three, four, five weeks in a row.''
</P>
<P>
   If Alfonzo finally does, there is little question what effect it
will have on the rest of the lineup. It is clear that when Alfonzo
gets on base, the Mets' offense responds. Last season, Alfonzo hit
.330 in 406 at-bats in the No. 2 slot. This year, according to the
Elias Sports Bureau, he has batted .243 in 140 at-bats hitting
second, .226 in 106 at-bats leading off.
</P>
<P>
   In three games in Milwaukee last week, Alfonzo went 5 for 15
(.333), drove in four runs, scored a run and stole a base. The Mets
swept the series. On Saturday in Chicago, Alfonzo went 0 for 4.
Sunday, he grounded out with runners on first and second in the
eighth inning in his only at-bat. The Mets lost both games against
the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of consistency indeed seems to be a problem _ especially on
a team that can survive inconsistency from some of its regulars,
but not from Alfonzo. With Alfonzo hot and cold, the Mets' offense
has been thoroughly inconsistent all year long.
</P>
<P>
   That is why Alfonzo went into Valentine's office not long ago
and apologized for his performance this season. Valentine told
Alfonzo to relax. The Mets still feel he is destined for stardom.
</P>
<P>
   When that expectation was mentioned to him, Valentine said:
``What's that mean? That he will make $5 million a year? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   The question is how.
</P>
<P>
   ``By staying healthy,'' Valentine said.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Prosecutors met for five hours at an undisclosed
location in New York on Monday with Monica Lewinsky, the woman at
the heart of the White House sex and perjury inquiry, in a possible
prelude to an immunity deal.
</P>
<P>
   In a development fraught with danger for the president, several
lawyers from the office of Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel,
interviewed Ms. Lewinsky in New York in an effort to gauge her
credibility as a witness and secure her grand jury testimony. Starr
has insisted that his attorneys meet face to face with Ms. Lewinsky
before offering her immunity from prosecution in exchange for her
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   As prosecutors neared a deal with Ms. Lewinsky, the pressure on
President Clinton intensified on two other fronts on Monday as
Starr's investigation moved inexorably toward a denouement.
</P>
<P>
   A divided federal appeals court rejected the president's
invocation of lawyer-client privilege to bar the grand jury
testimony of his closest aide, Bruce Lindsey, setting the stage for
a Supreme Court confrontation or Lindsey's imminent return to the
grand jury. The court said that a president cannot hide criminal
behavior behind the shield of lawyer-client confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton's private lawyers continued their negotiations with
Starr over terms of compliance with an unprecedented presidential
subpoena. Little progress was made on Monday, according to lawyers
involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers with knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's meeting with
prosecutors indicated that the session had moved the two sides
considerably closer to an agreement that would lead to Ms.
Lewinsky's grand jury testimony. In proposed testimony submitted
earlier this year, Ms. Lewinsky acknowledged having had a sexual
relationship with the president but denied that he or anyone else
had tried to persuade her to lie about it under oath. Ms. Lewinsky
repeated those assertions on Monday, the lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is moving quickly to secure the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky
and Clinton _ the two central parties in the matter _ at virtually
the same time as the fact-gathering phase of his investigation
nears a conclusion. Clinton's lawyers have agreements with many of
the witnesses to share information about grand jury appearances. By
taking Clinton's and Ms. Lewinsky's testimony simultaneously, Starr
may be seeking to prevent their coordinating their accounts,
according to lawyers involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure on the president was heightened by a Tuesday
deadline to respond to a subpoena delivered last week for his
testimony in the Lewinsky matter. His lawyers continued their
negotiations with Starr to find a means to respond to prosecutors'
questions without the spectacle of a president for the first time
appearing personally before a criminal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers involved in the inquiry said that Starr would not
attempt to enforce Tuesday's deadline as long as talks were
underway with the president's lawyers. David Kendall, one of
Clinton's private attorneys, said that he was working with the
independent counsel's office ``to devise a way for the president to
provide information for the OIC's investigation, consistently with
his constitutional role and responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   An adviser to the president, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said that deadline is unimportant, because both sides are seeking a
compromise. Clinton is willing to testify if the questioning is
limited to the Lewinsky matter and does not become a broad fishing
expedition into unrelated topics, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is also adamant about not being forced to appear at the
federal court house, the adviser said. The president is willing to
provide written answers to prosecutors' questions or to submit to a
videotaped session.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's testimony _ at some time and in some manner
_ is now inevitable, the adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is now put in the position that if he doesn't
testify he's got to have some really overwhelming reasons, and
there are damn few of them,'' the adviser said. ``He has said in so
many words that he is prepared to cooperate under certain
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals here dealt the president a
further legal setback on Monday, ruling that his conversations with
Lindsey, deputy White House counsel and a longtime confidant of the
president's, were not protected by lawyer-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   The far-reaching decision, issued by a divided three-judge
panel, said ``it could be contrary to tradition, common
understanding and our governmental system'' to shield Lindsey from
appearing before a federal grand jury investigating serious
criminal charges, including witness tampering, perjury and
obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   ``When an executive branch attorney is called before a federal
grand jury to give evidence about alleged crimes within the
executive branch, reason and experience, duty and tradition dictate
that the attorney shall provide that evidence,'' the court wrote.
``Their duty is not to defend clients against criminal charges and
it is not to protect wrongdoers from public exposure.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Ruff, the White House counsel, said that the president
and his legal advisers will decide whether to appeal after they
have thoroughly studied the 60-page opinion.
</P>
<P>
   But, he added, ``We are disappointed that the Court of Appeals
has decided that, unlike every other attorney and client in this
country, government attorneys and their clients do not enjoy the
right to have confidential communications. The practical result of
the court's decision is that the president and all other government
officials will be less likely to receive full and frank advice
about their official obligations and duties from government
attorneys.''

 WASHINGTON: government attorneys.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Clinton was informed of the appeals court decision following a
forum on Social Security in Albuquerque, N.M. Lindsey, who
frequently travels with the president, did not make this trip, and
Barry Toiv, a deputy White House press secretary, said he did not
know if Clinton had spoken with Lindsey on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether Clinton planned to change his schedule on Tuesday,
when he will be in Washington, Toiv said Clinton still plans to
attend and speak at a memorial service at the Capitol on Tuesday
afternoon for the two officers slain by a gunman last week.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton ignored questions about the subpoena shouted at him by
reporters on Monday morning, as he has throughout the last several
days. Asked why the president would not answer any questions about
the subpoena, Toiv said: ``Sometimes the president answers
questions, sometimes he doesn't. But he has answered this question
on a number of occasions and we have answered this question on a
number of occasions.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey's lawyer, William Murphy, said he would have ``no
comment on the opinion at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The president appealed a May decision by U. S. District Judge
Norma Holloway Johnson that said that presidential advisers enjoyed
a qualified privilege for communications with the president but
that government-paid lawyers like Lindsey could not claim a similar
privilege in criminal matters.
</P>
<P>
   Appeals Court Judges Raymond Randolph, appointed by President
Bush in 1990, and Judith Rogers, a 1994 Clinton appointee,
concurred in the lower court ruling.
</P>
<P>
   But David Tatel, appointed by Clinton in 1994, issued a strongly
worded dissent, saying that the sweeping decision by the majority
would chill discussions in the executive branch and force a
president to retain a battery of private lawyers to consult on
sensitive matters that are directly related to the demands of his
office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since for any president the line between official and personal
can be both elusive and difficult to discern,'' Tatel wrote in the
Lindsey case, ``I think presidents need their official
attorney-client privilege to permit frank discussion not only of
innocuous, routine issues, but also sensitive, embarrassing or even
potentially criminal topics.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that ``weakening the privilege may well cause
presidents to shift their trust from White House lawyers who have
undertaken to serve the presidency, to private lawyers who have
not.''
</P>
<P>
   Tatel dissented from an earlier appeals court ruling in the case
of Vincent Foster, a White House lawyer who committed suicide in
1993. Prosecutors wanted access to notes of his conversations with
his lawyers, arguing that the lawyer-client privilege did not
extend after the client's death.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of the appeals court panel ruled that the notes
must be surrendered. The Supreme Court this year sided with Tatel,
saying that the confidential relationship between lawyer and client
existed in perpetuity.

FOR YANKS, WINNING THE SERIES IS THE ONLY THING 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The New York Yankees have already won so many games
with such numbing efficiency that two-game losing streaks qualify
as mild surprises. It is not even August, but the Yankees address
questions about competing in the postseason because the players
realize it is silly to act as if they will not make it. That is
what happens when a team has the chance to break a 92-year-old
record for regular-season victories.
</P>
<P>
   Other things will happen to the Yankees, too. With each victory,
the Yankees are escalating expectations. Simply getting to the
World Series is not an option and the Yankees know that. Winning a
championship is the only option, and no lecture from the principal
owner, George Steinbrenner, is needed to grasp this.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to win,'' Derek Jeter said. ``We could win 150 and
lose 12 and then not win the World Series. What's the point of the
season? We have one goal, the ultimate goal.''
</P>
<P>
   It is why general manager Brian Cashman is still making calls to
the Seattle Mariners to gauge Randy Johnson's status in trade
talks. Cashman spoke to the Mariners late Monday but it is still
uncertain if Johnson is available. It is why the Yankees floated
the possibility of a Chuck Knoblauch for Roberto Alomar deal with
the Orioles earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees bypassed the opportunity to put Johnson in their
rotation and turned Orlando Hernandez into a vicious weapon out of
the bullpen to protect a prospect, would they have sleepless nights
if a trade could have made them more impenetrable? Definitely.
Cashman tinkered with the 73-26 team Monday by designating
infielder Dale Sveum for assignment and potentially eating more
than $1 million in salary, while recalling outfielder/first baseman
Shane Spencer from Class AAA Columbus, reiterating that the general
manager also knows this season must be THE SEASON. Greatness is not
bestowed on teams limited to remarkable regular-season records.
</P>
<P>
   ``Getting in isn't enough,'' Cashman said. ``Winning it is what
it's all about. It's always been that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Raines did not even let a reporter finish a question about
expectations before saying: ``I'm sure we've made it so that we
have to win the World Series or this will be a disappointment. They
don't remember the regular season if you don't go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Raines is correct. When the Yankees won the World Series in
1996, they were not as dominating in the regular season, going
92-70. If the Yankees do not crumble, they will be favored before
the first postseason pitch is tossed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year was the same thing,'' Paul O'Neill said.
``When we got knocked out, it was a major disappointment. I don't
see this season being any different. Going into the postseason,
we're expected to win. But you don't know what's going to happen
with every team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Yankees have some mysteries to solve. The right-hander
Jeff Nelson will be sidelined until late August with a lower-back
injury, and he is an important part of an erratic bullpen. Without
Nelson, the Yankees have only one dependable righty setup reliever
in Ramiro Mendoza. Manager Joe Torre will not feel comfortable
entrusting a tight game to Darren Holmes or Mike Buddie.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want Nelson back and healthy,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   Designated hitter Chili Davis is expected to return from ankle
surgery next month and will try to blend in with a team that has
won 75 percent of its games without him. Davis was signed to be a
full-time DH and his return will mean Darryl Strawberry and his
weak left knee must play the outfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chili Davis,'' Torre said, ``is going to fit in.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre also wants the Yanks to continue displaying the
intangibles that have made them alarmingly productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see us sustain, maintain the energy level and
determination, and we've been pretty good,'' Torre said. ``We
haven't played perfect baseball. That's tough to do on a day-to-day
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   It gets tougher in the postseason. Then the Yankees, who would
win 105 games if they were to go 32-31 the rest of the way, will be
0-0 again. Everything that they won from April through September
will be erased. The Yankees will need 11 victories for a title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not break any records if we don't win it after
that,'' Raines said. ``Who won the World Series? That's what
everyone remembers. Nothing else.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   _ Even though infielder Dale Sveum had a two-year, $1.6 million
contract, he barely contributed while batting .155 in 58 at-bats so
the Yankees admitted their mistake and designated him for
assignment. The Yankees have 10 days to trade Sveum, release him or
try to assign him to the minor leagues. It is unlikely that they
will be able to trade Sveum and more unlikely that the nine-year
veteran will agree to go to the minors. Consequently, the Yankees
will probably wind up paying Sveum about $275,000 for the remainder
of the season and $800,000 for next year.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shane Spencer, the type of right-handed hitter manager Joe
Torre has expressed a need for, will join the Yanks at Anaheim.
Spencer hit .314 with 15 homers and 55 runs batted in at Columbus.

 &HT;    Eugene Schwertner, successful livestock businessman, dead at 78
 &HT;    By Jerry Mahoney
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Eugene Schwertner, who expanded a tiny cattle
auction that he started in Austin in 1946 into one of the country's
biggest livestock businesses, died Monday morning at his home.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner, 78, had been diagnosed with cancer of the liver four
years ago. He died at 3:45 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Services will be at 10 a.m. Wednesday at Austin's Highland Park
Baptist Church.
</P>
<P>
   The founder and chief executive of Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock had
strong roots in Williamson County. Schwertner's business, one of
the top three in its industry, operated on land his grandfather
settled around the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner, who stood 6 feet 4 inches tall, cut an imposing
figure. He ate beef for lunch and dinner most days. Company
mailings are stamped with the message, ``Eat more beef.''
</P>
<P>
   As a cattleman, Schwertner (pronounced swet-ner) helped change
the industry by being among the first to offer cattle by the
truckload to feedlots, making the process more efficient.
Previously, feedlots, where cattle gain weight before going to
packing plants, had to buy cattle one at a time at auction.
</P>
<P>
   As Schwertner's company developed, it could customize shipments
for feedlots.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the guy who designed the wholesale template of the cattle
industry,'' said James Herring, president and chief executive of
Friona Industries LP. The huge Amarillo concern, which operates
five Texas feedlots, buys more than 30,000 head of cattle annually
from Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock.
</P>
<P>
   ``In so doing, he became a powerhouse,'' Herring said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner continued to innovate. Today, the company posts daily
photos of cattle on the company's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he maintained old ways of doing business. For the 52
years he ran Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock, Schwertner needed just a
handshake to seal agreements with customers. The no-contract policy
is all the more noteworthy considering the size of the 80-employee
company, whose revenues are estimated to exceed $150 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to Central Texas after serving four years in the U.S.
Navy Construction Battalion during World War II, Schwertner in 1946
started his cattle auction in what is now Callahan's General Store
southeast of Austin on U.S. 183.
</P>
<P>
   The business was well received by farmers, who were grateful to
have an Austin auction for their cattle. But frequently there were
more sellers than buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to have a market for those farmers,'' Schwertner said
last fall during an interview at the company's two-story, white
stone headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they would sell, we'd buy. We'd keep them if there wasn't a
market for them.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a risky strategy at first. Schwertner, who had no inkling
of how his idea would blossom, started calling feedlots in Texas
and other Southwestern states to see if they would buy the leftover
cattle.
</P>
<P>
   He discovered there was a market for animals that been sorted by
such categories as breed, age and weight, because that enabled
feedlots to fill gaps in their inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Sales sometimes required the young business to truck the cattle
hundreds of miles over two-lane highways, but that strategy of
customizing orders for feedlots and, later, ranchers who were
building their herds, opened a lucrative niche in what is now a $5
billion U.S. cattle industry.
</P>
<P>
   Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock also owns 20,000 acres of land that it
uses for pasture and growing hay.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner had to rely on friends and business associates to
make it through perhaps his biggest crisis.
</P>
<P>
   In 1959, his wife, Gloria, was discovered to have a brain tumor.
The illness required surgery and hospitalization in Austin for a
year, said the couple's son, Jim Schwertner. The elder Schwertner
struggled with running the business and raising Jim, who was 8, and
their 2-year-old daughter, Sherri.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Schwertner had no health insurance to help with the
$100,000 in medical bills stemming from his wife's treatment, Jim
Schwertner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was pretty leveraged, but the banks stood by him and loaned
him the money for the hospital bills,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A family friend and neighbor in Austin's Western Hills area,
Eloise Phillips, cared for the children during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Gloria Schwertner recovered and worked as the company's
bookkeeper. She died two years ago at age 73.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner, who occasionally chewed cigars one bite at a time
rather than smoke them and sometimes sipped Jack Daniels in the
evenings, kept financial details of the business a closely guarded
secret among his family, a few key employees and his bankers.
</P>
<P>
   He said it was profitable from the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   A key part of the company's way of doing business is that it
sells every head of cattle every day, even if it means losing
money. It would cost more in feed to keep the cattle another day
without a guarantee that the prices would go higher.
</P>
<P>
   So firm is that rule that is not uncommon for one of the
company's 25 cattle-hauling rigs to be loaded with unsold animals
and sent out in the early morning darkness before the driver knows
his destination. Once telephone negotiations at the Schwertner
headquarters produce a buyer for that truckload, the driver learns
via cell phone where to deliver the cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We might not like the price, but we sell 'em,'' Schwertner
said last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Innovation and dedication
</P>
<P>
   Conservative in many business practices, Schwertner nonetheless
adopted emerging technologies that could help the company. The
company recently bought a digital camera to take photos for its Web
site (www.cllnet.com).
</P>
<P>
   Years ago, Schwertner began monitoring cattle prices from the
Chicago Board of Trade _ the cattle futures market _ by a satellite
feed. The company uses the price information to help determine up
to the minute how much its buyers should bid for cattle at
auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of Eugene Schwertner's dedication to the
business, Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock became a family operation.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schwertner, 47, is president of Capitol Land &AMP; Livestock.
Daughter Sherri Madden, 41, does accounting work in the office and
her husband, Tom Madden, manages the company's trucking operations.
</P>
<P>
   Schwertner's dedication continued even recently, when
chemotherapy treatments for liver cancer made him physically ill.
He would drive to the Lockhart Auction, one of several area
auctions he owned, and spend hours watching and bidding on cattle.
</P>
<P>
   He relished the serious yet good-natured competition with other
buyers, Jim Schwertner said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For him it was like going to the Austin Country Club and
playing golf,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jim Schwertner and Sherri Madden, Schwertner is
survived by five grandchildren: Jimmy, Jason and Samantha
Schwertner of Austin, and Hunter and Nicole Madden of Georgetown.

EDITORIAL: THE RETURN, ALMOST, OF TIMES SQUARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, July 28:
</P>
<P>
   The blare of traffic is back. Sidewalks along Broadway are full
_ the usual mass of people buying, selling, gawking, pushing, all
at different speeds and in different directions. A small ark of
animals has been rescued from a building on 44th Street, including
12 cats, two illegal ferrets, several goldfish, one cockatiel, a
guinea pig, a gerbil and a hamster. Except for those areas in the
shadow of the Conde Nast tower, where loose scaffolding caused part
of an elevator tower to break away a week ago, crashing into a
residential hotel and killing an elderly woman, Times Square is
almost back to normal.
</P>
<P>
   With most of the city's crossroads reopened, and with the
breakaway scaffolding slowly being secured with what one television
reporter called ``our giant nylon stocking,'' this is a good time
to find out what really happened. Speculation is now focusing on
the possibility that beams holding the scaffolding to the building
on the 21st floor may not have been properly secured by contractors
working on the facade. Workers often remove the beams holding the
elevator shaft while they apply the facade. The question is whether
someone neglected to re-attach the beams or whether they were
somehow wrenched from the building in the accident.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers and insurance companies are now circling the site,
undoubtedly setting the stage for a number of lawsuits. The U.S.
Department of Commerce, meanwhile, is investigating whether some of
the bolts used in the scaffolding are counterfeit. And the U.S.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration is looking at safety
issues.
</P>
<P>
   However, the primary responsibility for discovering causes of
the accident, and making sure that construction can safely proceed,
lies with New York City. City officials announced plans Monday to
hire an outside company that specializes in figuring out the causes
of construction accidents. That is a good start, but the city must
make certain that the report is finished quickly and used to help
prevent any similar accidents in this high-density city. At another
hour and on a busier street, this accident could have taken a far
greater toll on human life.

   NEW YORK _ When the scaffolding at 4 Times Square gave way last
Tuesday, showering tons of orange-painted steel onto the streets
below, Gerard Suarez had a view most people would envy, until they
thought about it for a second.
</P>
<P>
   Suarez, a 51-year-old veteran ironworker with perpetually
windburned eyes, was ABOVE the top of the building.

   For about an hour that morning, he and a lone welder had
crouched in a crook formed by two pieces of steel within the frame
of a giant billboard jutting from the skyscraper's roof. In other
words, they were about 53 floors up in a 48-story building, where
the nervous welder hunched over a minor repair with Suarez, part of
the safety crew for the ironworkers, along to steady him.
</P>
<P>
   If not for a few of the words Suarez uses to describe what
happened next, a listener would be hard pressed to tell from his
clipped cadence and affectless tone that it was anything more than
another day on a skyscraper. ``So I was sitting on top, waiting for
this guy to get that done,'' he says, ``and all of a sudden I see
this guy Jerry running.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard Jerry yell to the guys on the scaffold, `Hey, get out
of there. The thing is giving.' And when he said that, I heard a
crunch. I ran over to the other side of the beam, and I'm watching
it, and I didn't believe it.'' Asked what went through his mind,
Suarez pauses for several seconds. He says finally and
matter-of-factly: ``It's like your heart just wants to stop.''
</P>
<P>
   But besides his unparalleled view that morning, Suarez had
something else no one had: a camera.
</P>
<P>
   For at least the last 25 years of his 31-year career, he has
been known among his co-workers as the Picture Guy. He takes
pictures of the first columns as a building begins to rise. As it
rises, slowly, floor by floor, he takes pictures of what he sees on
its way up: gargoyles, birds' nests, intricate stone work,
forgotten spaces revealed by morning light behind broken windows,
the details of a city all but concealed from the street.
</P>
<P>
   For his co-workers, especially the veterans, for whom memories
of hundreds of jobs can begin to blur, he snaps work shots or poses
buddies across beams, smiling. At the end of a job, he hands out
copies to workers who are retiring. ``I really like to take
pictures of the old-timers,'' he said. ``I say, `Come on, let me
take a picture of you before you kick the bucket on us.' They love
it.''
</P>
<P>
   On the taller buildings _ like 4 Times Square, the Citicorp
Building, 7 Hanover Square in lower Manhattan _ he concentrates on
roofs, which he says are a woefully underappreciated facet of New
York architecture, one he has observed more than most. He has shot
the top of the Fraunces Tavern building on Pearl Street and Grand
Central Terminal and St. Patrick's Cathedral.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I look at things for a long, long time, and when I
was looking at Saint Paddy's I saw the design, like the sign of the
cross, so I tried to get it from different angles,'' said Suarez,
who was raised in a Catholic family in Ridgewood, Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the collapse, he almost forgot he had tucked a
camera into his denim work jacket _ he once carried nice 35
millimeter cameras, but after one was stolen and another broken, he
downgraded reluctantly to disposables. When he remembered his tiny
cardboard Fun Saver 35 Kodak seconds later, he sat down on the beam
and with little to do except watch and pray that no one had been
killed below, he began to snap away. (Four of his pictures of the
collapse and repair efforts have appeared in The New York Times.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the course of a two-hour interview late last week after a
long day back on the building, Suarez was often slightly nervous
and reticent about discussing his life. But when the subject turned
to his pictures, he grew almost sheepishly poetic. ``There are
certain things I look for,'' he said at one point. ``I love the
lines of the tops of the buildings, the shapes of the buildings.''
And then later: ``There are certain things I wait for _ a certain
shape, the lighting, maybe a good shadow, a big load of beams
coming up.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his life and work, he will allow that ironwork has sometimes
made for a difficult life. He joined Local 40 of the ironworkers'
union at age 20, even though his father, a union electrician,
considered such work unnecessarily daredevilish. By the time he was
married and his first son came along, he said, he was already
living the nomadic, modern-day-cowboy existence of an ironworker:
``booming out,'' sometimes for months at a time, to find work. He
helped place steel beams and bolt them up in Dallas, Atlanta and
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   When he moved his family _ two sons and two daughters, now
grown, and his wife, Rita, a nurse _ to Peterborough, N.H., for a
more tranquil life, he found that he was rarely able to enjoy it.
He and Rita were divorced several years ago after 19 years of
marriage. Suarez married again three years ago; his wife, Eva, is a
beautician, and they live on Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, nobody ever expects to get divorced,'' he said.
``It's a tough life. It breaks up a marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   He admits it didn't help when he would sometimes tell his wife
how he got some of his better pictures. ``One time in Vermont,
Castleton, I shinnied out to the end of a pole that stuck out over
a gorge. I held on with one hand and took the picture with the
other,'' he said. ``I've done crazy things. But I have some
pictures you wouldn't believe.''
