<HEADLINE> Expenditures Increased in Saudi New Budget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has decided
to increase expenditures by 15 billion Riyals (about 4 billion
U.S. dollars) in its 1998 budget, bringing the total expenses to
196 billion Riyals (52.27 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the Kuwaiti News Agency, the Saudi cabinet Monday
endorsed the budget for the new fiscal year starting from January
1 at a meeting chaired by Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
The new budget includes a deficit of 18 billion Riyals (4.8
billion dollars), 1.12 billion Riyals (300 million dollars) more
than that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The new budget has allocated 18.98 (5.06 billion dollars) for
social security and aid as well as new projects including schools,
colleges, water ventures, dams, sewage and electrical networks.
But the spending plan did not disclose the country's defense
expenditures which is believed to be a major item in the budget.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi government has hoped to have a revenue of 178 billion
Riyals (47.4 billion dollars) in 1998, compared to the expected
163.88 Riyals (43.7 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that the 1998 budget mirrors the optimism of
the Saudi government about better economic performances in the
coming year, especially in its oil industry.
</P>
<P>
The oil-rich Gulf kingdom has achieved an average of 3.8
percent growth rate of economy in the last three consecutive years
with a peak of 4.3 percent in 1996. Continued growth is also
expected for this year.

<HEADLINE> Rabbani for Peaceful Settlement of Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The ousted Afghan President,
Burhanuddin Rabbani, stressed on Tuesday that the Afghan issue
could not be solved through military means.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a press conference in Peshawar, capital of the North
West Frontier Province, Rabbani said that the military options
have to be given up for the amicable settlement of the Afghan
issue.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who is currently on a visit to Pakistan at the
invitation of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, said that "peace in
Afghanistan can only be brought through negotiations between the
warring factions."
</P>
<P>
he welcomed the peace initiatives taken by the Pakistani
government for the peaceful settlement of the Afghan imbroglio.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani described his visit to Pakistan as "highly successful."
</P>
<P>
"The trip would help remove misunderstandings between the
Northern Alliance and Pakistan," Rabbani was quoted by the
Associated Press of Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani said that his talks with Sharif were satisfactory and
expressed his confidence that these would yield positive results.
</P>
<P>
"I am on a peace mission in order to put an end to the ongoing
war in Afghanistan and to create an atmosphere that could help
establish a government acceptable to all the people of that
country," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a first step, he proposed a permanent ceasefire between
Taliban and the Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani, who is the leader of the anti-Taliban Northern
Alliance, said that he had already expressed his willingness to
hold negotiations with Taliban leaders and added that now the ball
was in the court of Taliban.
</P>
<P>
"Let's see and wait for Taliban reaction over the peace
efforts", he added.
</P>
<P>
Rabbani also said that "we are totally against foreign
interference in the internal affairs of Afghanistan."
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question, Rabbani said, "we have launched our
peace efforts and hoped that Taliban would response positively."
</P>
<P>
He denied any difference in the ranks of the Northern Alliance,
saying that there is complete agreement among the members of the
alliance on basic policies.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence at 28-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
surged to a 28-year high in December as the consumers were
heartened by the robust U.S. economy for their financial outlook.
</P>
<P>
The New York-based Conference Board reported today that its
index of consumer confidence jumped to 134.5 this month, a 6-point
rise from a revised 128.1 in November. The figure, the highest
since 1969, was well above the expectations of economists.
</P>
<P>
Economists regard consumer sentiment as an important factor in
tracing market trends, because consumer spending accounts for
two-thirds of the country's overall economic activity.
</P>
<P>
"The strength of the U.S. economy, especially the labor market,
continues to lift consumers' spirits and bolster their
expectations," said Lynn Franco, associate director of the Board's
Consumer Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The Consumer Confidence Survey is based on a representative
sample of 5,000 U.S. households.
</P>
<P>
Many people said labor market conditions are favorable, which
continue to be a primary driving force in consumers' positive
assessment of current economy. More than 40 percent of
respondents rate jobs as plentiful, up from 36.4 percent in
November.
</P>
<P>
The present situation index, designed by the research group
to measure consumers' current assessment of the economy, surged
from 156.8 to 161.7, its highest level since 1969. The
expectation's index, which attempts to measure consumers' level
of confidence in the future, rose to 116.4 from 108.9.

<HEADLINE> Murders Down in 10 Largest U.S. Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Murders in the 10 largest
cities in the United States are down nearly 10 percent overall
from 1996, which saw 4,600 people slain, local media reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Leading the way are New York and Los Angeles, the two largest
cities in the country, the news reports said.
</P>
<P>
Homicides also were down in Chicago, New Orleans, Dallas,
Houston, Baltimore, San Francisco and Newark in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
However, Denver, Detroit and Nashville saw a sudden rise in
slayings, but statistics by Federal Bureau of Investigation show
serious crime has been decreasing nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Homicides sank to a 30-year low in New York, and plummeted 20
percent in Los Angeles this year to the lowest level since 1977.
There were 566 homicides in the city as of December 14, 143 fewer
than for all of 1996. The city hasn't had fewer than 600 homicides
since 1977, when 574 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
As of Sunday, New York City's death toll stood at 756, down
from 961 a year ago and the lowest level since 1967. New York's
homicide total peaked in 1992 with 2,262 killings.
</P>
<P>
Dallas and Houston reported murder rates that have dropped by
more than half from 1991.
</P>
<P>
Other cities with lower numbers than last year were Chicago,
Newark, Minneapolis, Baltimore, New Orleans, Memphis, and San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Detroit was the only city in the top ten to show an increase of
killings over 1996. The nation's 10th-largest city reversed a
five-year decline in homicides this year with the death toll
rising to 454 after 428 murders in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nashville already has a record 112 homicides, compared with 89
in 1996. Homicides were also up in Denver, with 76 murders up to
Sunday this year compared with 68 through December 28 last year.

<HEADLINE> BT Woos Customers With International Calls Discounts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom today announced
price cuts of 15 per cent for international calls made by many
business customers, in the latest bid to stem the erosion of
overseas call customers.
</P>
<P>
A new tariff package will be launched on January 1,1998, giving
15 per cent discounts on existing prices paid by companies for
calls to 10 nominated destinations.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, called BT Key Countries, applies to businesses
paying between 1000 pounds (1600 U.S. dollars) and 10000 pounds
(16000 U.S. dollars) a quarter for calls, though BT said numbers
eligible to take part were "commercially confidential".
</P>
<P>
The reductions would cut the lowest possible price of a call to
the U.S. to 11.5p (18.4 U.S. cents) a minute, compared with a
standard tariff price of 20.1p (32.2 U.S. cents).
</P>
<P>
The move means BT has in effect abandoned quoting a standard
tariff price for corporate customers after losing business to new
rivals such as Colt and Esprit.
</P>
<P>
BT has been increasingly concerned at price comparison made by
competitors against its standard tariff, which excludes the many
discount packages.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Assuced of Arms Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria today accused the military
junta in Sierre Leone of breaching the peace accord by bringing
fighter aircraft into S.Leone.
</P>
<P>
Citing intelligence from Sierra Leone, defense spokesman
Godwin Ugbo said the junta is also developing air fields in some
villages to accommodate the fighters.
</P>
<P>
As the main airport in Lungi is held by the west African
peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG, the junta has turned to the
villages near Guinea to build air fields, Ugbo said.
</P>
<P>
The arms expansion, backed by former Sierra Leonean President
Joseph S. Momo and Ukraine, is aimed at attacks agaisnt the
peacekeepers, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
But he did not say when, how and how many fighter planes have been
brought into Sierra Leone, which is under arms embargo ordered by west
African countries and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The junta seized power in a coup last May and ECOMOG has been
enforcing the embargo and economic sactions against the troubled
country.
</P>
<P>
While condemning the junta for breaching the peace accord signed in
Conakry, Guinea last October, Ugbo said, "We are still appealing the
junta to follow the peace plan."
</P>
<P>
Under the Conakry peace accord, disarmament of combatants in Sierra
Leone should begin this month and the junta will return power to
ousted president Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by april next year.
</P>
<P>
However, the junta refused to disarm the national army on the
ground that it is the legitimate armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The former rebel group, the Revolutionary United Front which allied
to the junta army, also refused to put down their weapons, saying they
are part of the national army.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Kabbah hunter militia known as Kamajors did so with the
claim that they are also legitimate civil defense group.
</P>
<P>
Under the circumstances, Ugbo said the plan to restore president
Kabbah by April next year has been derailed.  Eenditem

BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Visiting an exhibition on
urban planning of Beijing today, senior Chinese leader Li Ruihuan
said that urban planning is of great importance and needs
intensified management.
</P>
<P>
Li, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's

in the Chinese capital city.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, also member of the Standing Committee of the

said the population and land use in Beijing must be put under strict
control and can not be expanded at will.
</P>
<P>
Accompanied by Jia Qinglin, mayor of Beijing and other local
officials, Li noted that the city's downtown area must be
protected well, and the density and height of buildings must be
limited.

<HEADLINE> Company Failures In Britain at 7-Year Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Business failures have fallen
to their lowest level for seven years, according to th annual
insolvency survey by Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, the financial information
company.
</P>
<P>
Total liquidations and bankruptcies dropped by almost 5000 to
36368. The number has been falling steadily since reaching a peak
of 62767 in 1992, at the height of the last recession.
</P>
<P>
This year's 11.5 per cent fall in the business failure rate is
the biggest since 1994, when the number of insolvencies declined
by 22 per cent, and the second-biggest this decade.
</P>
<P>
The fall in the quarterly rate accelerated during the year,
moving down from 10300 in the first quarter to 7980 in the final
three months.
</P>
<P>
Although every region of the UK experienced a fall in business
failures, some areas of the country saw sharper drops than others.
</P>
<P>
Philip Mellor, senior analyst at Dun &AMP; Bradstreet, attributed
the decline in business failures to the steady growth in the
British economy coupled with tougher restrictions on borrowing
imposed by banks.
</P>
<P>
Mellor said: "Provided there is no substantial downturn in the
economy, the country's annual tally of business casualties will be
back to pre-recessionary levels by the millennium."

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Ruling Party Protests Polling Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Xu Jianmei, Wang Jinyu)
</P>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The ruling Kenya African
National Union (KANU) said today it is "extremely unhappy" about
chaos amid Monday's polling, saying it offered the opposition
advantages and left thousands of KANU supporters unable to vote.
</P>
<P>
However, the party said it does not suggest another elections,
claiming its leader, incumbent President Daniel arap Moi, 73, and
in power since 1978, will surely win his final five-year term in
the country's second multi-party poll.
</P>
<P>
"We are winning," KANU National Executive Officer Geoffery
Kathurima told a crowded press conference.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of thousands of Kenyans had to cast their ballots
today after poor organization and bad weather forced an
unexpected one-day extension of the voting which was due to end
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Transport difficulties caused by bad weather, mixed ballot
papers, missing electors' names from registers, lack of ballot
papers and other technical problems caused delays, chaos and
tension nationwide in the elections.
</P>
<P>
"This was an obvious scheme by the Electoral Commission (EC)
to rig the elections in favor the opposition," said Kathurima,
charging the EC "should take full responsibility for these
irregularities".
</P>
<P>
A number of polling stations in KANU's traditional strongholds
in Rift Valley Province and parts of western and eastern
provinces failed to open until 3:00 p.m. on Monday, denying KANU
supporters' sufficient time, he said.
</P>
<P>
Two KANU supporters were killed with another two seriously
injured in the region on the day, he added.
</P>
<P>
As many as 2,000 voters in Sotik and 10,000 in Funyula
constituencies, which are power-bases of KANU, were not able to
vote "for lack of presidential ballot papers," he said.
</P>
<P>
KANU "has been targeted by elements in the Electoral
Commission in concerted with other interested parties," he
accused.
</P>
<P>
President Moi, in line with suggestions by both KANU and
opposition lawmakers, had appointed 10 more members, all
nominated by opposition parties, as electoral commissioners.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts said KANU's move was responding to the similar
accusations to itself from various opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
Despite common complaints, Kenyans show impressive and serious
enthusiasm for choosing leaders who they believe can be the best
to head the eastern African country into the next millennium.

<HEADLINE> Protests Against Unemployment Continue in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- As 1997 is drawing to an end,
France is seeing a nationwide movement of protests against
unemployment by militant associations and trade unions, which is
exerting great pressure on the government.
</P>
<P>
A demonstration against unemployment was held today at the new
Opera Music Hall at Bastille square by union members and
anti-unemployment groups, and some 50 militants occupied the hall
of the Center of Social Action -- an official agency in charge of
social aid programs -- of the city of Paris.
</P>
<P>
The unions and militants promised to hold "strong" actions in
Paris on Wednesday, the last day of the year.
</P>
<P>
In Marseille, about 200 unemployed people blocked the tracks at
the Saint Charles railway station of the city on Monday, while
between 150 and 200 unemployed workers demonstrated in the streets
of Arras in Pas-de-Calais in northern France.
</P>
<P>
Protests were also held in a number of other cities across the
country.
</P>
<P>
The government announced today that France's unemployment rate
dropped by 0.3 percent in November to lower to 12.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
But this drop only benefits the young people under 25, while
the number of chronically unemployed people in France increased by
1.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Monde said that the under-privileged people are
taking advantage of the period of Christmas and New Year festivals
to win sympathy from the public, which pays little attention to
them in ordinary times because they have "neither status nor
means of pressure."
</P>
<P>
The daily said that the fight against unemployment shows an
essential question: Although the French economy is enriching
itself, it is incapable of eliminating poverty.
</P>
<P>
The National Secretary of the Communist Party of France, Robert
Hue, said today that the government should agree without delay to
the demand by the unemployed for a 3,000 franc (500 U.S. dollars)
bonus for Christmas and the New Year.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Communist Party supports the actions of the
unemployed people, who also demand a raise of the minimum social
aid.

<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- R&AMP;D spending in the United
States is expected to reach more than 216 billion U.S. dollars in
1998, a 4.66 percent growth over the 1997 level, a research
magazine predicted.
</P>
<P>
The Ohio-based Battelle-R&AMP;D Magazine put the 1997 figure as 206
billion dollars, citing the National Science Foundation estimates.
</P>
<P>
R&AMP;D spending for 1998 is expected to compose of 62.9 billion
dollars from government contributions, 143 billion dollars from
industry investments and 10.2 billion dollars from universities
and other non-profit institutions, the magazine said in its
January issue.
</P>

HARARE, December 30 (Xinhua) --The Plan International will
fund various local community development projects in Zimbabwe
worth of 150 million Zimbabwean Dollars (about 10 million U.S.

Ernesto Moran said here today.
</P>
<P>
Moran was quoted by the Zimbabwe News Agency as saying that
more sustainable development projects will take place in several

''We emphasized a lot on sustainable development and we gave
the communities more empowerment to take control of the
development process,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Establishment of China-SAfrica Diplomatic Ties Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 30 (Xinhua) -- China and South Africa will
establish diplomatic ties at the ambassadorial level starting from
January 1, 1998, Thursday, completing the normalization process of
their relations.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial to be released Wednesday, China's official
People's Daily warmly congratulates the two nations, and described
the event as having historic importance.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says the people of China and South Africa have
enjoyed traditional good relations dating back to 500 years ago.
</P>
<P>
During the apartheid times, the Chinese people showed sincere
sympathy and strong support to the South African people in their
fight against racial discrimination and persecution, it says.
</P>
<P>
In April 1994, the first multiracial elections were held in
South Africa and a new government was born. Since then, bilateral
exchanges in all fields have been active, and the understanding
and friendship between them greatly enhanced.
</P>
<P>
To normalize their ties is the common need of the two countries
to support each other politically and cooperate with one another
economically, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial reiterates China's willingness to develop good
relations with all countries based on mutual respect for
territorial integrity and the five principles of peaceful
coexistence.
</P>
<P>
There is one China, and Taiwan is an inalienable part of
her. This is a fact that has been widely recognized by the
international community, it says.
</P>
<P>
During the apartheid times, Taiwan established the so-called
"diplomatic relations" with South Africa. It has also been trying
by all means to obstruct the normalization of ties between China
and South Africa since the birth of a new South Africa.
</P>
<P>
But the new government of South Africa ended the "diplomatic
relations" with Taiwan, and opted for full diplomatic ties with
the People's Republic of China. This has demonstrated again that
Taiwan's "pragmatic foreign policy" will not work and its act to
split the country will not get any support.
</P>
<P>
To cement and develop relations with all African countries has
been an important part of China's foreign policy. China and South
Africa have similar experiences in history, and are both
developing nations, it says.
</P>
<P>
They hold identical or similar views on many major
international issues. And there exists great potential for their
economic and trade cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Following the normalization of ties, the friendly cooperation
between the two countries will surely be fully developed, the
editorial says.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot Government Slams Turkish Cypriot Decision </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
slammed the Turkish Cypriot decision to suspend contacts between
the Greek and Turkish communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing here, government
spokesman Manolis Christofides described the Turkish Cypriot
decision as "unfortunate and devious," saying it "serves other
purposes and expediencies."
</P>
<P>
"The bicommunal meetings and gatherings serve the good
intentions of the Cyprus people," he said, stressing that the
Cypriot government will pursue to promote rapprochement.
</P>
<P>
"Rapprochement requires more deeds and less words. We believe
in rapprochement," he added.
</P>
<P>
Taner Etkin, foreign minister of the breakaway state in
northern Cyprus recognized only by Turkey, announced last Saturday
that all bicommunal activities are suspended, apparently in
protest of a European Union (EU) decision.
</P>
<P>
He claimed the suspension was taken to allow the Turkish
Cypriot side time to review the Luxembourg EU decision earlier
this month to include Cyprus in membership negotiations but to
exclude Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash's claim
that from now on the Cyprus peace talks would be held between "two
equal states" and not between two communities on the island, the
spokesman said "there are two communities in Cyprus, which are
recognized by the Constitution, there are no two states."
</P>
<P>
Christofides noted that the international community and a
number of U.N. resolutions on Cyprus stress there is only one
republic and one government in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Both Turkey and Denktash have recently stepped up their
efforts to achieve recognition of the breakaway "Turkish Republic
of Northern Cyprus" declared in 1983. The U.N., however, has
called on member states not to recognize it.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into a Greek Cypriot south and Turkish
Cypriot north since Ankara sent troops and took over the northern
third in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Woman Posting Pig Leaflets Convicted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Jerusalem District
Court today convicted Tatiana Susskin, who posted drawings
depicting the Muslim Prophet Muhammad as a pig, of racism,
inciting violence and supporting terror organizations.
</P>
<P>
The court is to hand down a sentence on Wednesday. Susskin, 26,
faces a jail term of up to 26 years. But defense lawyers said they
would only settle for a one-year sentence, otherwise they would
continue the legal battle to reduce it.
</P>
<P>
Susskin, from Jerusalem, was arrested in late June after
posting the pig leaflets on storefronts of 20 Arab shops in the
West Bank city of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The leaflets, depicting the Prophet Muhammad as a pig writing
in the holy Koran, sparked angry Muslim protests worldwide and
Palestinian violence in Hebron and other cities.
</P>
<P>
Susskin's defense lawyers have tried to convince the court
that she was suffering from psychological illness, which they
claimed made it impossible for her to control her own actions.
</P>
<P>
But the court rejected the defense's argument after four
psychologists, who observed Susskin for a period, ruled that she
was in stable condition and fit to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
In addition to posting provocative drawings, Susskin was found
having committed other crimes against Arabs, such as throwing
stones at Palestinian cars and supporting the outlawed Jewish
extremist group the Kach Movement.
</P>
<P>
While posting the pig leaflets, she was wearing a yellow
sweater bearing the Kach's symbol of clenched fists, according to
the court.
</P>
<P>
Pronouncing the ruling today, the court said Susskin had
carefully planned and carried out cooly her action, and she was
also fully aware of the consequences of posting such offensive
leaflets against the Muslim religion.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the court after the verdict, Susskin claimed she
was a victim of the legal system that only convicts small
criminals while letting "the big fishs go free." She said she was
not regrettable about what she had done.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Urges International Community to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today urged all sectors of the global community --
Governments, international funding agencies, Non-governmental
Organizations, civil society and the private sectors to embrace
and redouble efforts to meet the goals of the Convention on
Biological Diversity.
</P>
<P>
In a message to the occasion of celebrating the fourth
anniversary of the entry into force of the Convention, Annan said
the Convention is the centerpiece of the international community's
efforts to conserve and make sustainable use of some of the
earth's greatest riches.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General said the Convention was conceived out of
the concern that many species and ecosystems are threatened with
extinction. It was born of the conviction that biological
diversity is a global asset of incalculable value to present and
future generations.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the Convention is a responsibility of humankind and
its sustainable uses is crucial to meeting the food, health and
other needs of a growing world population.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said the threat to biodiversity stems mainly from
habitat destruction, overharvesting, pollution and the
inappropriate introduction of foreign plants and animals.
</P>
<P>
Annan said as the new century approaches, the Convention has
evolved from a negotiating document to an active program that
makes itself felt at the local, national, regional and
international levels.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary-General added the procedures and programs are
in place, and the challenges facing the 170 parties to the
Convention is to make real and visible changes in humankind's
relationship with biodiversity.

<HEADLINE> Riot and Robbery Reported on New Year's Eve in France </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Two days from the start of 1998,
the southern French city of Toulouse experienced one night of
violence from Monday night till Tuesday while a spectacular
hold-up took place in the tourism city of Nice, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
A wave of violence erupted since Monday in a working class
district of Toulouse, after one youth was killed and three others
injured in a traffic accident after they stole a vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Groups of youths charged police for causing the accident, as
the car stolen by Karim Jaoual, 20, was over-speeding and possibly
chased by police before crashing into a sign post.
</P>
<P>
Rioters threw stones at police Monday and Tuesday and burnt
vehicles, dustbins and tires in the district of Bagatelle,
inhabited mainly by immigrants and working class people.
</P>
<P>
The daily Le Figaro said that as the new year is approaching,
the number of vehicles burnt has increased in the city suburbs by
young people frustrated with their situation.
</P>
<P>
Several dozens vehicles were burnt over the past several days
in Strasbourg. More than 500 vehicles were burnt in the Alsacian
capital over the past one year.
</P>
<P>
Burning of vehicles is a way to express anger and frastrations
by young men in France, and is usually accompanied with riots in
working class and immigrant districts of big cities such as Paris
and Lyon, said experts.
</P>
<P>
A hold-up took place today in the southern tourism city of Nice
in the French Riviera. Two hooded men took away 600,000 francs
(100,000 U.S. dollars) from a currency exchange bureau, said
police.

JERUSALEM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Legislative
Council (PLC) today decided to postpone a no-confidence vote
against the cabinet of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA).
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers continued their 25th session today in the West
Bank city of Ramallah after a one-week recess. Most PLC members
agreed to a three-month postponement on the voting of the
no-confidence motion against the cabinet, according to the
Palestinian news service JMCC (Jerusalem Media and Communication
Center).
</P>
<P>
The session was adjourned last week after some of its members
threatened to hold a vote on the no-confidence motion. They blamed
the executive authority for inefficiency and not implementing the
legislations adopted by the PLC.
</P>
<P>
To solve the conflicts between the legislators and the cabinet,
PNA President Yasser Arafat promised on Sunday to reshuffle the
cabinet in the near future, probably after his return from the
United States next month.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen ministers of the 18-member cabinet, including
Agriculture Minister Abdul Jawad Saleh, submitted their
resignations to Arafat over alleged corruption and mismanagement
of funds last August.

LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Ghanaian President Jerry

"It is painful to read in foreign papers about the depth of

He warned that he would not tolerate corruption nor spare

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Rapid population growth in
poor countries remains a global demographic problem, the U.S
Population Institute cautioned.
</P>
<P>
Despite significant fertility declines in many countries in
Latin America and Asia, the annual number of births worldwide will
be at least 132 million for many years to come, the institute
said in a report released today.
</P>
<P>
It said in its 1997 World Population Overview that this is due
the fact that most of these countries have a large population base
and a large number of women entering their reproductive years.
</P>
<P>
About 3 billion people are expected to enter their childbearing
age within the next generation and only 1.8 billion of them will
leave that period of their lives.
</P>
<P>
Today, close to 98 percent of the annual population growth
takes place in the less developed countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the world population lives in less
developed nations and 74 percent of these countries are expected
to double their populations in 30 years or less.
</P>
<P>
The report cited one of the demographic realities that about
1.3 billion people in the world live in absolute poverty on the
equivalent of one U.S. dollar or less a day.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Electoral Commission Denys Rigging of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Electoral Commission of
Kenya today denied accusations of the rigging of the on-going
general elections by both the ruling and opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement issued here this evening, the commission
said that it had "carried out its responsibilities in accordance
with the provision of the Constitution without fear or favor and
without interference from any quarters."
</P>
<P>
Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, Chairman of the ruling Kenya
African National Union (KANU), today accused the commission of
involvement "in a scheme to rig the on-going General Election in
favor of the Opposition".
</P>
<P>
Later this afternoon, KANU headquarters issued a statement,
saying that KANU was "extremely unhappy" with the conduct of the
commission which should take full responsibility for all
irregularities in the two polling days.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Raila Odinga, leader of the opposition National
Development Party, charged today that "Moi has rigged the process
as he did in 1992, just that this time round he will not fool
anybody".
</P>
<P>
There were widespread reports of ballot paper mix-ups, missing
electors' names from registers, shortage of ballot papers and bad
weather which caused delays, chaos and tension nationwide in the
past two days.
</P>
<P>
The Electoral Commission said in the statement that as a
result of severe flooding in some areas, the movement of election
materials and personnel became "extremely difficult and
hazardous".
</P>
<P>
Referring to the mix-ups, the commission explained that
British company Smith and Ouzman Ltd., supplier for the ballot
papers, failed to meet the commission's expectations in the
printing and packaging of ballot papers.
</P>
<P>
The commission's instructions on the packing of ballot papers
on the constituency basis were not strictly adhered to, thus
causing a major mix-up in the eventual distribution of ballot
papers, it added.
</P>
<P>
Commission Chairman Samuel Kivuitu today told reporters that
"at six o'clock all of them (polling stations) should be closed,"
adding that "if the time is over, it's over."
</P>
<P>
Kenya's presidential, parliamentary and civic elections began
at six a.m. Monday but had to be prolonged for 24 hours until six
p.m. today due to bad weather and poor organization.

<HEADLINE> Egypt: 1997 Not Positive Year for Mideast Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that 1997 was "not a positive year" for the
Mideast peace process and the entire region, the Middle East News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Moussa, in a year-end press briefing here today, said that
tension prevailed in the region due to lost credibility in the
peace process resulting from Israel's policies.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the deadlock of the peace drive would end, and
the concept of the peace talks, would be clear to everyone.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian-Israeli talks are in tatters as Israel insisted
on building Jewish settlements in the occupied Arab lands and
delayed troop withdrawal from the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said this year also had witnessed tension in Iraq and in
the Gulf in addition to resurging terrorism. "In general, the year
was not at its best," he added.
</P>
<P>
However, There were positive things. he said the Arab world has
taken good stances by strengthening "cooperation in facing such
instabilities and emerging military alliances."
</P>
<P>
Moussa cited Somali reconciliation and a trend towards the
establishment of sound relations in the entire region, Iran
included, as "gains secured in 1997."
</P>
<P>
As for Egypt's foreign policy and diplomacy, the foreign
minister said great achievements were made during 1997, such as
Cairo's a clear position in the peace process and improved
Egyptian-Sudanese relations.

LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of air passengers to
the northern part of Nigeria have been stranded in Lagos, the
country's economic center in the southwest, following mass
cancellation of flights due to bad weather.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted airport officials as
saying that the flights were cancelled because of poor visibility
caused by the haze of Harmattan, a seasonal hot, dry and
dust-laden wind originated from the Sahara.
</P>
<P>
Passengers have called on the government to provide adequate
landing equipment at the airports to facilitate air travel during
the Harmattan season, which usually goes on till the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
As of 3:00 this afternoon, no flights had taken off for the
capital Abuja in the center of the country, which normally
receives more than five domestic flights a day, said the official
news agency.
</P>
<P>
However, flights to other parts of the country like Calabar
and Port Harcourt in the east, have not been disrupted, whereas
those flying international routes arrive and depart as usual.

<P>
LAGOS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Two persons were killed and 25
others injured in six road accidents recorded in the Lagos area
during Christmas holidays, the Federal Road Safety Commission
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government announced December 25 and 26 as public
holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Lagos sector commander of the commission blamed the
accidents on poor maintenance by vehicle owners and bad driving
habits.
</P>
<P>
"Some drivers are so careless that they drive when tired or
drunk and then doze off behind the wheels," said Ayobami Oniyale,
according to the News Agency of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The commander appealed to motorists, especially commercial
drivers, to be safety conscious by properly servicing their
vehicles before embarking on journeys.
</P>
<P>
"Safety should be at the back of the mind of any driver and
they should learn to drive to stay alive," he added.

</P>
<P>
The minister told a press conference here that 2,610 cases

CAIRO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
said today that the current deadlock would lead to a debacle in
the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The failure to bring the Israeli redeployment in the West Bank
into play will hurl the peace process into a crisis that would
menace Israel itself," Mubarak said in an interview with Egyptian
Television.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of haughtiness will not lead (to anywhere) but to
extremely bad results," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's worries mirrored those pervading Egypt, the Arab
world and the international community in the light of continued
deadlock of the peace drive since Israeli Prime Minister Banjamin
Netanyahu came to power in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
His warnings came before United States President Bill Clinton's
separate meetings with Netanyahu and Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat due next month.
</P>
<P>
Egypt set up diplomatic relations with Israel in 1980. But the
ties has been strained over the deadlock in the peace negotiations
between Israel and the PNA, Syria and Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Former President Meets Kaunda in Prison </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian former president
Julius Nyerere today visited the detained Zambian former
president Kenneth Kaunda and persuaded him to end his hunger
strike, the state-owned Zambia Television Station reported.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere went to Kabwe, 150 kilometers north of the capital, to
meet Kaunda in the city's Mukobeko Maximum Prison and had a
two-hour talk with his "old" friend.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Nyerere succeeded in persuading Kaunda to
end his hunger strike, which has lasted for nearly a week since
he was arrested and detained last Thursday in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, who is alleged to have connections with the abortive
military coup last October, had said after his detention that
hunger strike is his "only" weapon to press for his freedom and
release.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 73, also leader of Zambia's biggest opposition, the
United National Independence Party, was initially detained at
Kamwala Remand Prison in the capital and later transferred to
Kabwe, where he lives in a cell with best conditions, the state
television quoted the prison's commissioner as saying.
</P>
<P>
Nyerere, accompanied by his wife and six of his staff, arrived
in Zambia Monday to pay a three-day surprise visit to the country
amid speculations that he came to mediate an immediate release of
Kaunda.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said the Tanzanian former leader was entrusted
by several African leaders in the sub-region including Nelson
Mandela of South Africa and Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe with a
mission to secure Kaunda's release.

WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A British-owned cargo ship
began sinking in rough seas in the Atlantic Ocean this morning and
U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were rescuing the 28 crew members
from the churning waters.
</P>
<P>
The 493-foot (160-meter) Merchant Patriot was 270 miles (435
km) east of Cape Canaveral, Florida. The ship, which was traveling
from Praia Mole, Brazil, to Savannah, Georgia, began sinking after
a water pipe ruptured in the engine room and flooded the vessel,
reports from Miami said.
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. Air Force and Coast Guard helicopters from bases in
Florida and the Bahamas joined the rescue task. The rescued
crewmen were being flown to Marsh Harbor on Great Abaco Island,
Bahamas.
</P>
<P>
Strong wind blew away the life raft on the ship and the crewmen
have to leap into the water one by one to let the helicopters pick
them up.
</P>
<P>
The vessel is owned by the British company Cenergo Navigation
Ltd. and was flying a Ukrainian flag.

<P>
NAIROBI, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Central African Republic
President Ange-Felix Patasse has vowed that he would never allow
the use of his country for an attack on neighboring Democratic
Republic of the Congo.
</P>
<P>
Patasse made the remarks Monday during a one-day visit to the
Congolese capital Kinshasa where he met President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
"We will never accept that anyone could attack the Democratic
Republic of the Congo and vice versa," Patasse said, quoted by a
release faxed to Xinhua by the Nairobi-based IRIN, a U.N.
humanitarian information unit.
</P>
<P>
Patasse's visit to Kinshasa was the second for him since
Kabila toppled former President Mobutu Sese Seko in May after a
seven-month guerrilla war in the former Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Congolese officials were quoted as saying that the talks of
the two leaders were centered on cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
After the overthrow of late Mobutu, thousands of soldiers of
his defeated army, including those from his elite presidential
guard, fled across the border into the northern neighbor of the
Central Africa Republic.
</P>
<P>
Since then, there have been rumors in Kinshasa of a potential
security threat from neighboring Central African Republic to the
Kabila administration.

ATHENS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Turkish committee of
experts had proposed that contacts with its Greek counterpart
should continue directly through the embassies of the two
countries, rather than through the European Union (EU), the Greek
Foreign Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to their Greek counterparts recently, Turkish
experts said that the proposal was made because the Turkish
government had decided to cease it contacts with the EU with
regard to Greek-Turkish relations.
</P>
<P>
But the Greek foreign ministry stressed that the entire process
constituted a European initiative, therefore, Athens wanted to
raise the issue at the next EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
In May, Greece and Turkey established committees of experts to
review the procedural matters regarding their differences, but
later this year, the two committees in fact suspended their
contacts due to the deterioration of Greek-Turkish relations.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Motor Companies in Search of Fuel Alternatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Motor companies in the United
States are experimenting fuel alternatives for the environmental
protection purposes, industry sources said.
</P>
<P>
Ford Motor Co. has planned to produce 250,000 vehicles capable
of operating on E85 "flexible fuel" over the next four years while
Chrysler Corp. will make the E85 engine standard in 200,000
minivans each year.
</P>
<P>
All new vehicles will be capable of using the E85 blend or any
combination of E85 and unleaded gasoline, the Washington-based
research group Fuels for the Future said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
E85 is a fuel made from 85 percent ethanol and only 15 percent
conventional gasoline. Ethanol, made from corn and other sources,
is being viewed as an energy choice to drive some versions of fuel
cells, considered as a possible automotive successor to the
current internal combustion engine.
</P>
<P>
Ford intends to invest 420 million dollars to work with German
and Canadian firms to develop automotive engines using fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
The Nissan U.S. subsidiary announced on Monday that it will
introduce an electricity-powered four-passenger minivan in
January.
</P>
<P>
The vehicle uses Lithium-ion batteries as those used in
notebook computers and video recorders, the company said.
</P>
<P>
The batteries achieved the level of 90 watt-hours per kilogram,
about three times the energy density of conventional lead-acid
batteries.
</P>
<P>
The minivan model could have a maximum driving range of 120
miles, the company said.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Eighty new liquid
tank-containers provided by China today went into service on the
Tanzania-Zambia Railway (TAZARA).
</P>
<P>
Kingston Mkandawire, managing director for TAZARA, expressed
satisfaction over the quality of the tank-containers at a
hand-over ceremony here in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
They will "solve quite a lot of problems" for TAZARA which has
long suffered from acute shortage of oil tanks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ma Zhihe, the Chinese Economic and Commercial Representative
who signed the contract to grant the tanks on behalf of the
Chinese government to TAZARA, said it's the first time for China
to design, produce and export such tanks with internationally
advanced technology in accordance with an agreement between the
Chinese, Tanzanian and Zambian governments in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The 1CC-type tanks in line with international standard were
manufactured by the Xi'an Locomotive Rolling Stock Factory under
the Ministry of Railways of China and certified by the China
Classification Society (CCS).
</P>
<P>
The multi-purpose tanks, used for transporting oil as well as
chemical liquids on trains, automobiles and vessels, are able to
provide door-to-door service, said Sun Kai, vice president of the
Xi'an plant.
</P>
<P>
The tanks, each with a capacity of 24.71 cubic meters, arrived
at the port in the Tanzanian capital on December 21 and have
passed technical appraisal by TAZARA.
</P>
<P>
The 1,860-km railway from Dar es Salaam, capital of Tanzania,
to Zambia's Kapiri Mposhi was built with the aid of the Chinese
government in the 1970s. It is the largest aid project China has
ever launched abroad.

<HEADLINE> Drug-Related Emergency Room Visits Drop 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Emergency rooms in the
United States witnessed a six percent drop in drug cases in 1996,
the government said Monday.
</P>
<P>
The number of cocaine, heroin and marijuana cases remained
steady from 1995 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decrease, small but statistically significant, is
considered attributable to decreased cases involving legal drugs.
</P>
<P>
While calling these results "another hopeful sign" of progress
in efforts against drugs, Health and Human Services Secretary
Donna Shalala said in a statement Monday, "they also signal that
our work to prevent substance abuse and treat addiction is far
from finished."
</P>
<P>
Overall, there were 487,564 drug-related emergency room visits
in 1996, down from 517,764 in 1995, according to the Drug Abuse
Warning Network's annual survey, which polls a representative
sampling of U.S. hospitals to measure health consequences of drug
abuse.
</P>
<P>
Half the cases were drug overdoses, and another 37 percent were
attempted suicide, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The most common cases involved alcohol use in combination with
another drug, followed by cocaine and heroine.
</P>
<P>
Officials said a leveling off is significant given the steep
increases in illegal drug use and emergency room visits between
1990 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
In a statement Monday White House National Drug Policy Director
Barry McCaffrey said, "The slight success we are seeing encourages
us to continue our hard work."

LONDON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of pro-British
Protestants attended the funeral of loyalist paramilitary leader
Billy Wright in a Northern Ireland town today, leading to a high
tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Wright, chief of the Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF), was killed
by republican inmates inside the top security Maze prison near
Belfast on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Wright's coffin was escorted through the Protestant town of
Portadown by an "honor guard" of 18 men, dressed in black
trousers, white shirts and black ties, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of police and soldiers were on standby in a major
security operation in Portadown where the funeral was held.
</P>
<P>
Two hours before Wright's funeral, the Catholic community in
Coalisland attended a funeral of Seamus Dillon, a former Irish
Republican Army (IRA) guerrilla who was shot dead by the LVF on
Saturday night in revenge for Wright's murder.
</P>
<P>
About 1,000 mourners followed Dillon's coffin to the local

WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
urged Zambia's government to release former President Kenneth
Kaunda, arrested last week under emergency laws.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that he ought to be released, and we believe that
the judicial system in Zambia can run its course, that any charges
that there might be would have to be rendered publicly, and that
due process be given in this case," State Department spokesman
James Foley told a briefing.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 73, held in a maximum security prison in central Zambia
after arrest last Thursday on charges of being involved in a coup
attempt, was said to be suffering severe physical discomfort in
prison.
</P>
<P>
The United States has called for his release. Last weekend,
Jesse Jackson, special U.S. envoy for Africa, intervened on
Kaunda's behalf and got assurances he is well and will be
prosecuted promptly.
</P>
<P>
Foley said that, given the former president's role and his
status, "he ought to be released" regardless of the seriousness of
the charges against him.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda led Zambia to independence in 1964 and was called
"father of the nation." Now he leads the opposition United
National Independence party after being defeated by current
President Frederick Chiluba at presidential elections in 1991.

<HEADLINE> China-S. Africa Diplomatic Ties A Milestone: Qian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen today hailed the establishment of
diplomatic ties between China and South Africa as an important
milestone in the history of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Qian and South African Foreign Minister Alfred Nzo signed a
joint communique in Pretoria today on the forging of diplomatic
ties at ambassadorial level between the two countries as from
January 1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of diplomatic ties marks the beginning of a
new chapter of friendly relations and cooperation between the two
countries, Qian told a reception held here in his honor.
</P>
<P>
The reception was hosted by Wang Xuexian, director of Chinese
Center for South African Studies and the expected first Chinese
ambassador to South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Qian said exchanges between the Chinese and South African
peoples can be traced back to last century.
</P>
<P>
"After the founding of new China in 1949, the Chinese
government and people consistently sympathized with and firmly
supported the people of south Africa in their struggles for
racial equality and national liberation," Qian told an audience
of several hundred people at Sandton Sun Hotel.
</P>
<P>
He said China, in particular, stood firmly by South Africans
"in their just struggles against apartheid under the leadership
of the ANC (African National Congress)."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people joined the South African people in
celebrating the birth of new South Africa and rejoiced at their
achievements in nation-building in many areas in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, each with its own strength in economic
development and natural resources, share a high degree of
complementarity, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese foreign minister, two-way trade has
risen sharply in the past few years, from 14 million U.S. Dollars
in 1991 to 1.34 billion Dollars in 1996, and to an expected 1.6
billion Dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Qian also mentioned South Africa's economic, trade, financial
and civil aviation links with Hong Kong, over which China resumed
the exercise of sovereignty last July.
</P>
<P>
Qian said a bilateral trade agreement and an investment
protection agreement, which are under preparation, will put in
place a new framework for the future trade and economic
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"We have every reason to believe that after the normalization
(of relations), China and South Africa are destined to become
economic and trade partners of ever increasing importance," Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperation on the diplomatic front, Qian said
China and South Africa, both developing countries that have
considerable influence in Asia and Africa respectively, could
work together on many issues.
</P>
<P>
"We have common language on many important international
issues. With our diplomatic relations established, we will step
up our consultation and cooperation in international affairs,
play a greater role in global and regional affairs and join hands
in safeguarding the rights and interests of developing countries
and promoting the cause of peace and development for mankind."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government attaches importance to developing
friendly relations and cooperation with South Africa, said Qian.
</P>
<P>
"In keeping with the principles of enhancing understanding,
increasing trust, expanding cooperation and achieving common
development, we are ready to work with our South African friends
to actively explore and open up new areas and new ways of
bilateral cooperation so as to further enrich the friendship
between the two countries."

JOHANNESBURG, December 30 (Xinhua) -- South African Foreign
Minister Alfred Nzo said today that his country would have

</P>

reception in honor of visiting Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen.
</P>
<P>
Nzo and Qian signed a joint communique earlier today in
Pretoria on the establishment of diplomatic relations between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
In a cordial speech at the reception hosted by Wang Xuexian,
the Chinese ambassador-in-waiting, Nzo said the normalization of
relations accommodated to the international trend and was a
"natural outcome".
</P>
<P>
"It would have been totally untenable that a situation should
continue to exist where one of the leading countries in Africa
does not have formal relations with one of the leading countries
in Asia and the world," he told an audience of several hundred
people.
</P>
<P>
"The continuation of such a situation would have been
inconsistent with decisions taken by international bodies such as
the U.N. and the OAU (Organization of African Unity), international
law and the state practice followed by the overwhelming majority
of countries," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"This would also have been a denial of the major role that
African countries have played to secure the rightful place of the
People's Republic of China at the United Nations in 1971."
</P>
<P>
Nzo said the two countries will enter "a new era" with the
establishment of diplomatic relations, adding, "This will be an
auspicious occasion for both countries."
</P>
<P>
The forging of diplomatic ties between the two countries is
the natural outcome of a long evolutionary process of contact
between them, dating back more than three centuries, according to
the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
"In many ways, the strong bonds between China and Africa have
been forged through similar historical experiences. Both have
suffered dearly at the hands of colonial powers, including
humiliations and injustices because of discrimination," Nzo
added.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the founding of the People's Republic of
China in 1949, China unselfishly became a steadfast moral and
material supporter for Africa's struggle for liberation and
democracy, Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that during those long and bitter years of struggle
against apartheid, much encouragement and inspiration was drawn
from the examples by the great Chinese leaders such as Sun
Yat-sen, Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
"It (China) today provides once again an example for Africa --
this time for the economic liberation and renaissance of Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We in South Africa in particular and Africa in general have
been following with great admiration how China, in adapting free
market principles to China's own unique situation, has
transformed its economy and society in less than 20 years,
resulting in the greatest reduction in poverty ever recorded in
human history.
</P>
<P>
"Through these transformations, the People's Republic of China
has achieved a status and position in the world where it enjoys
the respect and attention of everyone.
</P>
<P>
"The South African government is grateful that notwithstanding
China's newly elevated status in the international political
system, it has not forgotten the developing world, especially
Africa. We look forward to China joining other leading powers in
the world in assisting in the development of Africa," Nzo said.
</P>
<P>
South African and China, both developing countries, share many
similar ideals and objectives. Both countries are for example
committed to the principle that in the international political
and economic system, the "strong should not dominate the weak"
and that the interests of developing countries should be
adequately safeguarded.
</P>
<P>
"In this regard, South Africa, as a non-aligned country
pursuing an independent foreign policy, is looking forward to
forging a strategic partnership with China for the 21st century."
</P>
<P>
He believed that the establishment of diplomatic relations
will give impetus to the existing ties.
</P>
<P>
"Let us in partnership, with enthusiasm, seize the
opportunities that this new relationship will bring about to the
mutual benefit of both countries," he wished.

<HEADLINE> FM: Iran Disappointed to Egypt's Stance on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran today expressed
disappointment to Egypt's attitude towards Iran, saying that at
present there were no grounds for normalizing the bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
The recent statements of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak were
disappointing and only repetition of Egypt's past positions, said
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi in an interview with the
official Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi contended that the Egyptian president was not aware of
the realities in the Islamic Republic of Iran, and did not show a
necessary political will.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak reportedly said recently in a televised interview that
he wanted to be sure of Iran's intention before any normalization
in Cairo-Tehran relations.
</P>
<P>
He said Egypt was cautious in resuming diplomatic relations
with Iran, and that "we must first feel that the issues of
exporting the (Islamic) revolution, offering shelter to terrorists
and naming streets in Iran after them are over."
</P>
<P>
Mubarak was referring to Iran's alleged support for Egyptian
terrorist groups, and Tehran's Khaled Eslamboli Street named after
the assassin of late Egyptian president Anwar Sadat.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian Foreign Minister said that it was a regret that
Egypt was repeating its past positions and attributing the
internal problems to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the importance of understanding and cooperation of
the Muslim world, saying that Egypt needed more time to take
serious strides towards improving relations with Iran.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that the remarks of both Mubarak and
Kharrazi implicated a setback of the relations between Iran and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
During the eighth summit of the Organization of the Islamic
Conference held here on December 9-11, Egyptian Foreign Minister
Amr Moussa and Kharrazi expressed the readiness of their countries
to improve the strained ties.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed its diplomatic ties with Egypt after it granted
political asylum in 1979 to Iran's late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi
toppled in the Islamic Revolution of Iran in the year.

<HEADLINE> Britain Pledges to Make Single Currency Success </HEADLINE>

<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook pledged here today that Britain would use its coming European
Union (EU) Presidency to make the single European currency a
success.
</P>
<P>
Cook told BBC Radio this afternoon that the Labor government,
due to take over the EU presidency on Thursday, would make sure
the European Monetary Union (EMU) proceed properly although London
will not join the single currency in the first wave.
</P>
<P>
"What we are going to do is make sure that the plans for the
single currency are sensibly carried out and everything possible
is done to make sure that those who want to go ahead succeed,"
Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook emphasized the importance of the single currency to
British economy by saying "Remember our own economy is very
heavily bound up in the continent."
</P>
<P>
"It is most certainly not in Britain's interests that this
project should go ahead and not prove a success," he added.

<HEADLINE> Britain Unlikely to Share Falklands with Argentina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook said here today that there was no question of sharing
Falklands (Malvinas) sovereignty with Argentina without the
agreement of the local residents.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Carlos Menem, due to visit London early
next year, reportedly said in Buenos Aires recently that he would
discuss the issue of Argentina's claim over the islands and would
suggest sharing sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"Perhaps we could talk about shared sovereignty, which would be
a significant step," Menem told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in an interview with the BBC Radio early today, Cook
ruled out the possibility of sharing Falklands (Malvinas) with
Argentina.
</P>
<P>
"We have always made it perfectly clear that the wishes of the
Falkland (Malvinas) islanders are what counts. They do now want
shared sovereignty and in those circumstances there is no question
of us agreeing shared sovereignty," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
On Menem's visit to Britain, Cook noted that Menem would
exchange views with British government leaders on various issues
on bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"President Menem's visit will not be about the Falklands
(Malvinas) Islands. It was established between the two countries
that President Menem's visit was about the very strong bilateral
relations between Britain and the new democratic Argentina," Cook
said.
</P>
<P>
Menem will be first Argentine President to visit Britain since
the Falklands (Malvinas) War in 1982.

<HEADLINE> Report on Major Events in HKSAR Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A special report explaining
the key issues which have dominated the first six months of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was released here on
Wednesday for distribution overseas.
</P>
<P>
A government spokesman said the 22-page report has been sent to
all 10 Hong Kong Economic and Trade Offices in the United States,
Europe and the Asia-Pacific region in response to tremendous
international interest in Hong Kong since it became a SAR of China
on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The report includes an overview of the major events in the past
six months, as well as sections on the economy and economic
prospects, infrastructure development, politics, the rule of law,
human rights, education, tourism, the People's Liberation Army
Garrison and the avian flu.
</P>
<P>
It says that Hong Kong's return to China has gone smoothly and
its people are running their own affairs, as promised in the Basic
Law, stressing that Hong Kong's successful transition has clearly
proved wrong those critics who predicted a doomsday scenario after
July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The report mentioned the commitment that President Jiang Zemin,
premier Li Peng and other Chinese government leaders have
underlined on many occasions to the "one country, two systems"
policy.
</P>
<P>
Despite the Asian economic crisis, the report says that Hong
Kong will still be able to forge ahead with important road, rail
and port projects as well as new initiatives in education and
tourism promotion.
</P>
<P>
It also reinforces the HKSAR government's determination to
maintain the Hong Kong dollar link to the U.S. dollar and explains
why the exchange mechanism is needed.
</P>
<P>
It is inevitable that Hong Kong will be affected by the
regional financial crisis and that GDP growth in 1998 will slow as
a result, the report says.
</P>
<P>
However, the report states: "balancing this are a number of
factors that will help Hong Kong to cope with the current downturn
better than most of our competitors and will help us recover more
quickly once favorable conditions return."
</P>
<P>
These factors include: lower inflation rates than neighboring
economies; the high capital adequacy ratios and prudent lending
policies of Hong Kong banks; the upside to the downturn in the
property market through lower rents and prices, thus increasing
competitiveness and keeping inflation in check; currency stability
through the link with the U.S. dollar, the report says.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, chief
executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, said
here Wednesday that the government had closely monitored the avian
flu situation.
</P>
<P>
"The top priority is always the protection of public health,"
he stressed while visiting a temporary wholesale poultry market
and poultry stalls here in Wednesday afternoon to see the
condition there after cleansing.
</P>
<P>
To date, the total number of confirmed cases of bird flu in
Hong Kong remains 13 and that of suspected cases is six.
</P>
<P>
Tung said that once the presence of the H5N1 virus was
established in samples taken from chickens, the government had
resolutely and aptly made the decision to launch the chicken
slaughter exercise.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, Tung was also briefed on the progress of
actions taken in tackling the problem of avian flu.
</P>
<P>
Up to Tuesday mid-night, Hong Kong had destroyed more than one
million poultry in a bid to help prevent the spread of the H5N1
virus.
</P>
<P>
Appreciating that the poultry trade had encountered losses and
residents had been inconvenienced by the chicken slaughter
exercise, Tung said that the government would shortly seek funds
from the Finance Committee to assist those in need.
</P>
<P>
"I hope the problem will soon be over. The raising and sale of
chickens will resume once all the farms, wholesale markets and
retail outlets have been thoroughly cleaned and a good control
system is in place to ensure chickens entering Hong Kong are free
from virus."

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
economic powerhouse, has racked up 22.2 billion U.S. dollars in
foreign trade at the end of November.
</P>
<P>
Sources with the municipal Foreign Trade and Economic
Commission said the city expects to finish more than 14.5 billion
U.S. dollars of exports this year.
</P>
<P>
Of the total export volume, industrial products will account
for 93 percent. Electrical machinery products have become more
popular, with the export value jumping from 17.9 percent of
industrial exports in 1993 to present 31 percent.
</P>
<P>
Major destinations for the city's exports are Southeast Asia,
Oceania countries, Latin America, Middle East and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaoming, head of the trade commission, said that China is
confronting an increasing product cost and funds shortage, a
continuing challenge for the country's export sector.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has formed a group of foreign trade conglomerates in
an effort to improve the operating scale. It has also introduced
share-holding and mergers to make the city's 725 foreign trade
enterprises more competitive on the international market.
</P>
<P>
In addition, 218 of Shanghai's overseas foreign trade companies
have formed six regional conglomerates.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanghai has placed equal emphasis on cargo
trade, technological trade and service trade. The city's
transaction of technology is expected to top 650 million
U.S. dollars, 3.5 times that of 1993.
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area in Shanghai has conducted one-fifth of the
city's exports, with its value registering 2.8 billion
U.S. dollars for the first 11 months of this year.

<HEADLINE> Pak President-Elect to Be Sworn In Thursday </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Rafiq Tarar, who won an
absolute majority of votes in Wednesday's presidential election,
will be sworn in as Pakistan's ninth president Thursday morning,
official sources here said.
</P>
<P>
Tarar, candidate from the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N) for
the presidential poll, secured a total of 374 votes out of the 457
calculated votes in the presidential elections held simultaneously
in the national and four provincial assemblies, Chief Election
Commissioner Qadeer Chaudhry announced here late Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Shahban Mirani, former defense minister and nominee of the
major opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP) obtained a mere 58
votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Muhammad Khan Sherani from Jamiat-e-Ulema Islami
(JUI) won 22 votes, Raja Saeeduz Zaman (independent) got one and
the PML(N)'s covering candidate Haleem Siddiqui polled two votes.
</P>
<P>
The remaining two candidates did not secure any vote in the
poll.
</P>
<P>
The president-elect will be sworn in on Thursday morning in the
Presidential House. The oath-taking ceremony will be administered
by Chief Justice of Pakistan's Supreme Court Ajmal Mian.
</P>
<P>
The total electoral college votes are 476, including 87 from
the Senate, 217 from the National Assembly and 43 each from the
four provincial assemblies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Law, whosoever secures 51 percent of
all the 476 electoral college votes, or 239 votes, will be
declared next president of this South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still uncertain whether Tarar will hold the
office he won on Wednesday. Tarar was allowed by the Lahore High
Court on December 19 to participate in the election after his
earlier disqualification of candidature by the Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Former acting chief election commissioner Mukhtar Ahmad
Junejo's order to disqualify Tarar's candidature for his alleged
remarks against judiciary remains suspended.

<HEADLINE> Floods Kills 38 in Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Zhang Dacheng, Gu Ming)
</P>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The devastating floods
in Tanzania have left 38 people dead and tens of thousands of
others homeless, Prime Minister Frederick Sumaye told a press
conference here today.
</P>
<P>
The floods, starting from early December, have paralyzed the
central railway and a number of roads and bridges in the country,
said Sumaye, who was represented by Jacob Tesha, the Press
Secretary to the prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Areas along the central railway were worst hit by the floods.
In Kilosa District alone, more than 104,000 people have been
rendered homeless.
</P>
<P>
The floods have also damaged eight bridges on the railway
between Kilosa and Mzaganza districts.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said the government has decided to provide
an additional fund of 500 million Shillings (about 800,000 US
Dollars) for the emergency repairs of the damaged facilities.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 313 million Shillings have been released so far by
the Ministry of Works for the rehabilitation, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the whole rehabilitation work will take six
months, but key structures are expected to come back to normal in
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
The floods, brought about by the El Nino weather phenomenon,
have also threatened the output of maize, cotton and other crops,
but the prime minister said coffee farmers may be spared.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, most of the roads leading to
wildlife parks in the north have also been cut off, which may
hurt tourism in the country.
</P>
<P>
As the rains continue to pour down, fears of the outbreak of
cholera, typhoid and other diseases have increased. The
government has admonished people to observe hygiene, such as
boiling drinking water and using toilets.
</P>
<P>
Economic losses are yet to be known, as the floods have
blocked traffic and cut off telecommunications to several areas,
thus making statistics impossible.
</P>
<P>
As meteorologists have forecast that the above average
seasonal rains will continue until next April, the World Food
Program has expressed the fear that Tanzania's food shortage
resulting from last season's drought may worsen.

<HEADLINE> PSA Condemns Use of Zambian Air Controllers in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Public Service
Association (PSA) President Givemore Masongorere today condemned
the move by the government to engage Zambian air traffic
controllers to replace those fired recently.
</P>
<P>
The PSA urged the government to develop a culture of dialogue
with its workers whenever there is a problem.
</P>
<P>
"The PSA is naturally very disturbed by the move to fire local
air traffic controllers replacing them with foreigners," he said,
adding "We condemn the move in the strongest sense."
</P>
<P>
The government last Wednesday fired 67 air traffic controllers
who went on strike demanding better working conditions and
salaries.
</P>
<P>
Masongorere said bringing in people from Zambia would create
bad blood between the workers in the Southern African Development
Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
"The PSA would like to come in and mediate, and try to bring
the two parties to an amicable understanding. We would rather
solve the problems internally than bring in a neighbor," he said.

<HEADLINE> Malaysians Urged to Make Sacrifice to Revitalize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad urged all Malaysians to make sacrifices to help
steer the country towards economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
The people would have to endure all sorts of pressures and make
sacrifices, he said in his New Year message broadcast over radio
and television Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
He said that one sacrifice for them was to save and invest
confidently despite knowing that their savings would depreciate if
the value of the ringgit continued to fall.
</P>
<P>
"If we have no confidence in our own currency and because of
that we don't save or invest and instead convert our money to
foreign currencies or deposit them overseas, this will still cause
our currency to depreciate all the same," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Preserving the value of the ringgit is a crucial and common
responsibility of all Malaysians because others would not bother
to, he said, adding that the decline in the ringgit's purchasing
power for domestic goods and services would not be the same as its
depreciation by more than 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since
last July.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir reiterated that Malaysia would not borrow from
international institutions as that was not the approach to resolve
the current problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that in taking on the present economic challenges, the
people should not easily give up and admit defeat. Instead,
Malaysians should show willingness to face hardships and make
sacrifices to defend the country's independence and integrity.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir said "our struggles not only have yet to end but they
are only getting more crucial."
</P>
<P>
He thanked all Malaysians for their expressed confidence in the
government and in himself, saying their pledge of support should
be translated into action to help the country recover
economically.

<HEADLINE> Sono Likely To Coach South Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Former national soccer
star Jomo Sono looks set to succeed Clive Barker to coach South
Africa's national soccer team.
</P>
<P>
Barker resigned on December 20 after the African champions and
World Cup qualifiers' dismal performance at the Confederations Cup
in Saudi Arabia, where they finished bottom of Group B behind
Uruguay, the Czech Republic and the United Arab Emirates.
</P>
<P>
Sono, 42, owns and coaches Jomo Cosmos, the Premier League's
underdog whose greatest achievement was reaching the 1993 African
Cup-Winners Cup semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Another local contender for the 10,000-dollars-a-month post is
Gordon Igesund, who coached Manning Rangers from the port city of
Durban to first place in the 1997-1998 national championship.
</P>
<P>
Dutch pair Jo Bonfrere and Clemens Westerhof, Frenchman
Philippe Troussier, Englishman Terry Venables and Russian Victor
Bondarenko are also short listed for the job.
</P>
<P>
After Barker's resignation, national association officials
hinted at a foreign replacement with high-profile Venables or
former Nigerian coach Bonfrere.
</P>
<P>
This triggered an outcry from local coaches who claimed foreign
coach would destroy the natural style of South Africans and they
were interested only in money.
</P>
<P>
Since South Africa's returning to international football in
1992, locals Tshabalala and Barker and Peruvian Augusto Palacios
have coached the national team.
</P>
<P>
The vacant post of South African soccer coach will be filled on
Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Upbeat About Germany's Economic Outlook In 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl
Wednesday expressed confidence in his country's economic outlook
in 1998, but cautioned that Germany still needs more reforms in
order to adapt to dramatic changes in the world.
</P>
<P>
In a year-end interview with the German business daily
Handelsblatt, Kohl said that current economic data are pointing to
a German economic growth of 2.5 percent in 1997 and a growth rate
of up to three percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
There are also signs of a gradual improvement next year on the
country's sluggish job market where unemployment is hovering at
about 4.3 million, or over 11 percent, in 1997, Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in his New Year's speech televised on Wednesday,
Kohl also said that Germany would have to make hard choices about
its future development next year when the general election is due
to be held in September.
</P>
<P>
Kohl, who has already announced to seek an unprecedented fifth
term in office since 1982, will face serious challenge from the
main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD), which is at
loggerheads with Kohl's centre-right ruling coalition on most of
Germany's domestic issues, including a major tax reform.
</P>
<P>
"The coming year will see heated debates about what is the
right course the country should take in the future," Kohl said.
</P>
<P>
In order to be competitive in a dramatically changing world,
Germany must continue its course of renewal and push through
necessary reforms, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called on his countrymen to maintain what he
said are the world-recognized German values of inventiveness,
conscientiousness and diligence, adding that these values are the
best preconditions for more investment and more jobs in Germany.

conditions of local residents, Wen said that poverty alleviation
must be carried out simultaneously with rural development.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural production, grain in particular, should be given
priority in a bid to address the food problems of farmers, he
said, adding that a diversified rural economy should be boosted to
raise farm income.
</P>
<P>
In the course of ending poverty, the agricultural
infrastructure must be improved and education must be

<HEADLINE> Feature: Direct Election of Deputies Draws Crowd of Candidates (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of deputies to the
county people's congress is about 3,000 in central China's
municipality of Wuhan. But the number of candidates nominated by
voters, parties and organizations for the election exceeds 16,000.
</P>
<P>
In some electoral districts, a candidate was jointly nominated
by more than 1,000 voters. The number of candidates in some
districts was finally decided after four or five screenings.
</P>
<P>
The election in Wuhan epitomizes those at different levels
across the country.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute such an unprecedented democratic atmosphere
in the election of deputies to the people's congress to the direct
election of village and township deputies in China during the last
few years.
</P>
<P>
The direct election system of village and township deputies is
maturing in China, said Qiao Xiaoyang, deputy-director of the
Commission of Legislative Affairs under the National People's
Congress.
</P>
<P>
The law stipulates that direct election of deputies to the
people's congress should be held at the village and township
levels since the 1950s. Direct election was expanded to the county
level in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
This will be the sixth county-level direct election, and the
first since the new election law was promulgated in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The election began six months ago in the country's 2,800
counties involving nearly 800 million voters.
</P>
<P>
About 2,000 counties will complete the election today.

<TEXT>
<P>
Some 90 percent of the candidates in east China's Zhejiang
Province were elected through joint nomination of more than 10
voters.
</P>
<P>
"It is a remarkable characteristic of the deputy election this
time that a high ratio of candidates are jointly nominated by more
than 10 voters," said Zhao Yongqian, chairman of the Xiaoshan City
People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that it is a breakthrough in China's election system
and it guarantees that voters can choose the people they trust to
be deputies to the people's congress, "so that they can speak and
do things on behalf of the people."
</P>
<P>
"Another symbol for the maturing of direct elections is the
introduction of competition and multi-candidate elections," said
Qiao, adding that it guarantees the election will fully mirror the
will of voters.
</P>
<P>
Lu Qinghua, a 30-year-old farmer, is a newly elected deputy to
the Langxi County people's congress in east China's Anhui
Province. Lu, a candidate jointly nominated by voters, is one of
the district's two elected deputies.
</P>
<P>
With the economic and cultural growth and the improvement of
people's democratic and legislative awareness, the people's
enthusiasm to participate in public affairs has risen greatly.
Statistics show that more than 90 percent of the voters in a large
number of places have participated actively in the deputy election.
</P>
<P>
"Direct election has expanded the democratic basis of the
people's congress above the city level," Qiao said, adding that
the combination of direct and indirect elections is an important
characteristic of China's current system.
</P>
<P>
"Direct election is the base and, to a certain degree, the
democracy of indirect elections depends on the degree of direct
election," Qiao added.
</P>
<P>
He said the expansion of direct elections to the county level
will provide experience and create conditions for the expansion of
direct elections to a wider range in the future.
</P>
<P>
"China's election system will be improved step by step, and the
county will implement an entirely popular, equal, direct and
secret voting system when conditions mature," Qiao said, quoting
Liu Shaoqi, the late president of the country. However, he did not
specify when and to what level China will expand direct election.

<HEADLINE> Energy-Conservation Law to Take Effect Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Energy Conservation Law of
the People's Republic of China will go into effect tomorrow. The law
is considered by experts as an important step for the nation to
better manage and properly use energy.
</P>
<P>
As a country with a large population and relatively limited
energy resources, China's economic development long has been
restricted, an official with the State Economic and Trade
Commission said today.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, waste has remained a big problem though
the country suffers from a serious energy shortage, "so there is
great potential to exploit energy-savings."
</P>
<P>
He said that if only one percent of consumed energy is saved, the
country could save more than 10 billion yuan (1.3 billion
U.S. dollars) of industrial costs yearly, as well as reducing
pollutants released into the natural environment.
</P>
<P>
The Energy Conservation Law was passed in November by the 28th
session of the Standing Committee of the Eighth National People's
Congress.

"Practice has expanded the belief of Chinese people in Deng
Xiaoping Theory, trust in the Party Central Committee with Comrade
Jiang Zemin at the core, and confidence in the brilliant prospects
for their great motherland," it says.
</P>
<P>
It goes on to say that there will be many difficulties to
overcome and many problems to solve during 1998, especially in
terms of reforming state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"We must extend greater efforts to study and understand the
guidelines of the 15th national Party Congress, and must always
fully consider the overall situation," the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial points out that New Year's Day is also the 20th
Anniversary of the convening of the Third Plenum of the 11th Party
Central Committee which formally endorsed China's policies of
reform and opening.
</P>
<P>
"Our Party and nation have achieved a great historic turn
during the past two decades, and have opened a new era of reform
and opening," it adds.
</P>
<P>
The editorial notes that it is critically important to carry on
and further develop the fine traditions of the Party which were
restored by the Plenum, as well as the good style of work formed
in the new period.
</P>
<P>
"We must conscientiously adhere to the ideological line
of 'emancipating the mind' and 'seeking truth from facts', the
very essence of Deng Xiaoping Theory," the editorial stresses.
</P>
<P>
Only by emancipating their minds and seeking truth from facts,
can people remove the restraints of various unrealistic and
outdated concepts and, in turn, usher in a new situation for
China's socialist modernization drive.
</P>
<P>
"The 15th National Party Congress represented a new milestone
in our Party's efforts to emancipate the mind and seek truth from
facts," it continues.
</P>
<P>
The editorial says that "We can surely achieve greater success
in various undertakings after we grasp the full essence of the

The editorial emphasizes that China must continue to focus on
the central task of economic development which represents the
fundamental point of Deng Xiaoping Theory and the key substance of
the Party line.
</P>
<P>
"Whether we can achieve further economic development is
the key to propelling the great cause of building socialism with
Chinese characteristics into the 21st century," it says.
</P>
<P>
The editorial urges leading officials at all levels to focus on
implementing the general requirements and all important tasks for
this year's economic work outlined by central authorities, and to
constantly improve their competence and standards in guiding
economic construction.
</P>
<P>
It calls for strict adherence to the principle of "grasping
with both hands and with equal emphasis", namely, attaching equal
emphasis to the promotion of both economic development and
cultural, ethical progress. The principle is an important part of
China's endeavors to build a prosperous, democratic, and civilized
modern socialist country.
</P>
<P>
The Party's basic guiding principles for economic, political
and cultural development in the primary stage of socialism, which
were clearly defined by the 15th National Party Congress in line
with Deng Xiaoping Theory and the Party's basic line, have
provided new theoretical ground and placed greater demands on the
principle of "grasping with both hands and with equal
emphasis". The editorial points out that the key task is to ensure
that the principles are loyally carried out.

"The good work style must be faithfully carried out in the face
of new circumstances, problems and difficulties," the editorial
says, adding that respect must be paid to the wishes of the
people, importance must be attached to their creativity, and
concern must be shown for their well-being.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin recently urged officials to speak the truth and do
solid work, while at the same time putting an end to formalistic
and bureaucratic practices. "Therefore, leading officials at all
levels must at all times remember the purpose of serving the
people, and must be examples of honesty, uprightness and hard
work," according to the editorial.
</P>
<P>
It points out that Chinese people will greet 1988 with new
opportunities, challenges and new goals.

The editorial concludes that Chinese people will hold high the
great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory and make even more glorious
achievements under the leadership of the Party Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core and the guidelines of the 15th

<HEADLINE> Singapore Economy Grows by 7.6 Percent in 1997: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore economy grew
by 7.6 percent in 1997, better than earlier expected, while the
country will have a more difficult year in 1998, Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong said in his New Year message on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that 1997 was a most eventful year,
with the most important development being the on-going regional
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Predicting 1998 to be a more difficult year, he said, "Slower
growth in our neighbors will affect Singapore. Trade with the
region will fall. Banks will see less financial activities, and
make fewer loans to the region. Fewer ASEAN (Association of
Southeast Asian Nations) tourists will visit Singapore."
</P>
<P>
However, the prime minister pointed out that Singapore's
economic fundamentals are sound and the country has large foreign
reserves, runs substantial budget surpluses, and has no foreign
debt. Besides, Singapore has political stability, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the current gloom, the medium and long term prospects
of the region are promising," Goh said.
</P>
<P>
Provided the countries in the region undertake necessary but
painful adjustments, robust growth should resume after two to
three years, he said.
</P>
<P>
Goh also stressed that Singapore must use the next few years to
consolidate and sharpen its competitive edge by upgrading skills
and developing talent. The country will also continue to "add
value" to the economies in the region and help them overcome their
difficulties and grow.
</P>
<P>
"Then we can ride the next wave and surge ahead when the region
picks up again," the prime minister said.

<HEADLINE> Chiluba Orders to Trasfer Prisoned Kaunda to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba here today signed a presidential order to tranfer
</P>
<P>
At a news conferrence held this morning in the State House,
Chiluba signed the order with immediate effect to transfer Kaunda
from Mukobeko Maximum Prison in Kabwe, 120 kilometers north of
the capital to house arrest in Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
"Kaunda will be under the police care in his Kalundu residence
and no political activities are allowed there until all the
police investigations (into the abortive military coup last
October) are over," said the president.
</P>
<P>
He explained that he made this decision in consideration of
the former president's old age and the approaches made by some
leaders, namely former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, and
Zimbabwean President and Chairman of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC), Robert Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that Zambia is an independent country and it is
not subjective to external pressures.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda is not the nation and the nation is not Kaunda, said
Chiluba, adding that "no one is above the law."
</P>
<P>
Observers here noticed that Chiluba's presidential order came
one day after Nyerere's two-day visit to Lusaka. Nyerere paid his
personal suprise visit on Monday and had a meeting with Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that Nerere was entrusted by several
southern African leaders, including Nelson Mandela of South
Africa and Mugabe with a mission to press for Kaunda's immediate
release.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, 73, also leader of Zambia's biggest opposition party,
the United National Independence Party, was detained on 25
December for alleged connections with the country's abotive
military last October which aimmed to overthrow Chiluba's
government.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 91 people, mostly soldiers, are detained on
presidential orders under the state of emergency declared by
Chiluba following the foiled coup.

<HEADLINE> Tarar Elected Pakistani President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The official candidate of
the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N), Rafiq Tarar, was elected
president of the country on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Tarar, a former judge of the Supreme Court, is
to become the ninth president of Pakistan since its independence
in 1947.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest results released by the Election
Commission, Tarar won 381 votes in the presidential elections held
simultaneously in the National and four Provincial Assemblies.
</P>
<P>
Shahban Mirani, former defense minister and nominee of the
major opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP), got 77 votes.
</P>
<P>
Counting of votes in the Provincial Assemblies of Baluchistan
and Punjab is still under way.
</P>
<P>
The total electoral college votes are 476, including 87 from
the Senate, 217 from the National Assembly and 43 each from the
four Provincial Assemblies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Law, whoever secures 51 percent of
all the 476 electoral college votes, or 239 votes, will be
declared the next president of this south Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still uncertain whether Tarar will hold the
office he won on Wednesday. Tarar was allowed by the Lahore High
Court on December 19 to participate in the election after his
earlier disqualification of candidature by the Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Former acting chief election commissioner Mukhtar Ahmad
Junejo's order to disqualify Tarar's candidature for his alleged
remarks against judiciary remains suspended.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Electrician Turns Face Musical (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese electrician has been
playing Carmen, Jingle Bells and many other musical pieces by
thumping his head with his fingers.
</P>
<P>
His unusual musical performance will be broadcast live by CCTV,
China's most prominent television station, at the end of January
when Chinese are observing their most important holiday, Spring
Festival.
</P>
<P>
For Cui Wenping, an electrician from the Foreign Language
Publishing and Distribution Administration (FLPDA), this
performance will be his 50th in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
It's not just his head that can be musical. At times he taps
his forehead, the bridge of his nose and his teeth for different
sounds.
</P>
<P>
The trick to producing music is to form a resonant box in his
head by holding his throat, tongue and mouth in the right position
and then beating at the muscle for sounds.
</P>
<P>
His "musical instrument" has a 2 1/2-octave range. With a
microphone, the range can be broader, he said.
</P>
<P>
"To develop face music into an art that can be something so
funny as to be talked about by people at their meals, I need to
work harder, (just as Lenin once said) `study, study and study',"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The 43-year-old man said that he taps his head every week.
"Otherwise the muscles turn clumsy and I can't play the notes
right," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cui said that he invented his musical style accidentally.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Maldives Continues to Be Tourist Paradise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Come and enjoy a few days of
stay in a place where abundant sunshine, crystal-clear lagoons,
fine white beach and peace are absolutely natural.
</P>
<P>
That's what the Maldivians want you to do in their country. The
image of a tourist paradise has been projected by the Indian Ocean
nation for 25 years in the world tourism market.
</P>
<P>
The Maldives has the most beautiful tropical scenery, graceful
coconut palms leaning over warm sea water, coral reefs promising
great snorkeling and scuba diving, and more.
</P>
<P>
With the increasing pace of life in the modern world, it has
become the ultimate getaway for those who like doing nothing but
enjoying noise- and-pollution-free nature.
</P>
<P>
During the 1980s, tourism became one of the most important and
highest growing sectors of the Maldivian economy.
</P>
<P>
The industry has brought in 70 percent of the country's foreign
exchange, 40 percent of government revenue and almost 20 percent
of the Gross Domestic Products (GDP) in 1997, the year that
commemorated 25 years of tourism in the Maldives.
</P>
<P>
The country designated 1997 as "Visit Maldives Year," targeting
350,000 visitors. Though it's a bold target, compared with 280,000
tourist arrivals the previous year, the country achieved it at the
end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Maldivian Tourism Minister Ibrahim Hussain Zaki, brimming over
with optimism about the future of the industry, attributed the
success first to political stability. There has been no political
turmoil or ethnic war as in its neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, pragmatic tourism policies ensure the Maldives to be
a superb tourist destination in the world. In pursuing quantity of
visitors, the country doesn't sacrifice quality.
</P>
<P>
"What we want is quality tourism. If we want quantity, we can
easily have it," said the minister, who paid a visit to Sri Lanka
recently.
</P>
<P>
Only 74 of the more than 1,000 uninhabited islands have been
developed into resorts.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the industry enjoys a very successful partnership
between the public and private sectors in developing the industry.
Tourism officials are often invited to speak in various regional
or international forums.
</P>
<P>
A properly stipulated price strategy also benefits the industry
to a certain extent.
</P>
<P>
The Maldivians have made sure that backpackers with budget of
10 to 15 U.S. dollars a day cannot get in. At the high end of the
tourism market, what the Maldives offers can cost at much as 700
dollars a day. Even at the low end, prices don't dip below 50
dollars.
</P>
<P>
As the industry grows, so does the sentiment in the Maldives
that tourism, and the economic prosperity that comes along with
it, cannot exist unless the pristine purity of the country's
environment is well-preserved.
</P>
<P>
"Our tourist product is primarily dependent on the natural
environment, so there must be the right balance between tourism
and environment. We cannot develop one at the cost of the other,"
Zaki explained.
</P>
<P>
With annual tourist arrivals exceeding the Maldivian population
of 260,000, the future prospects for the industry turn out to be
rosy.
</P>
<P>
Islands further away from the capital atoll are now being
developed. Under a tight regulatory framework intended to protect
environment, 14 islands have been offered for new resort
development projects in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Nine islands will be developed by Maldivian investors, some of
whom will collaborate with foreign partners. The remaining five
islands will be tendered in early 1998.
</P>
<P>
Apart from a fleet of sea planes and helicopters that have been
in service, hovercraft and hydrofoil will be brought in to enable
quick transportation between the Male International Airport and
each of the resorts.
</P>
<P>
Now the government is making plans to let more Maldivians get
into the sector in the new year. The local youth are getting
necessary training both on the job and in the Hotel School, which
is being expanded.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Election Free, Fair Despite Chaos: Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior electoral official
today said Kenya's general elections taking place on December 29
and 30 were free and fair although there were confusions and
chaos.
</P>
<P>
Samuel Kivuitu, Chairman of the Electoral Commission, told a
press briefing that "Kenyans excelled in the numbers that turned
up to cast their votes and the remarkable state of peace that
prevailed all round."
</P>
<P>
He paid tribute to Kenyan voters, political leaders and the
churches, saying that "it was indeed a superb display of maturity
and patriotism".
</P>
<P>
The electoral official noted that polling was closed at six
o'clock p.m. on December 30 all over the country and counting of
votes is now in progress.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout so far has ranged from about 65 percent to 89
percent, according to the electoral official.
</P>
<P>
There were widespread reports of ballot paper mix-ups, missing
electors' names from registers, shortage of ballot papers and bad
weather which caused delays, chaos and tension nationwide in the
two polling days.
</P>
<P>
Because of the chaos, the presidential, parliamentary and
civic elections were extended for a further 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Kivuitu repeated his complaint that a British firm which
printed the ballot papers should bear some responsibility, adding
that people should "put blames partly to the printer and partly
to the commission".
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi, National
Chairman of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU),
accused the commission of its involvement "in a scheme to rig the
on-going general elections in favor of the Opposition".
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Social Democratic Party presidential candidate, Charity
Ngilu, was quoted as saying that her party would not accept the
results of the election as serious anomalies had marred the poll.

<HEADLINE> Post-handover Hong Kong Sports Striving with Validity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Similar to all the sectors
of its social life, Hong Kong's historic handover to China and
establishment of the Special Administrative Region (SAR) on July 1
this year ushered in a new era in local sports.
</P>
<P>
Worries by some for post-handover local sports' status built up
when it was proposed to send a large Hong Kong SAR delegation to
the Eighth National Games in October in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
But, international sports leaders including Juan Antonio
Samaranch, President of the International Olympic Committee (IOC),
had even before the handover confirmed that Hong Kong, after its
handover to China, would keep its internationally recognized
independent status as before.
</P>
<P>
Two days after the handover, Samaranch reached agreement in
Hong Kong with Arnaldo de O. Sales, President of the local Amateur
Sports Federation and Olympic Committee (ASF&AMP;OC), on HKSAR's
participation in such future international competitions as the
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The five-point document ensures that local athletes continue to
compete independently in future international competitions such as
Olympic Games and local Olympic Committee keeps its status
recognized by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
It also rules that the local Olympic Committee be renamed as
"The Amateur Sports Federation and Olympic Committee of Hong Kong,
China" and has its emblem to be redesigned.
</P>
<P>
The instructive document wiped away worries and settled down
arguments around the HKSAR's status in international sports arena.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this year, Joao Havelange, President of the
International Football Federation (FIFA), had ensured Hong Kong
sports' autonomy after the handover. And in early December,
FIFA's executive committee issued a statement, which reaffirmed
that the Hong Kong Football Association would keep as before its
FIFA membership and compete in future international competitions
as an independent body.
</P>
<P>
The National Games in Shanghai brought about new chances and
challenges as well to Hong Kong's sports. A 168-athlete
delegation, the first ever since Hong Kong became a SAR of China,
was warmly welcomed at the Games' opening ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"At that very moment, I really felt the pride of being a
Chinese and the tenderness of being a member of the big family,"
recalled a member of the HKSAR delegation.
</P>
<P>
The victory by Hong Kong's ace cyclist Wong Kam Po in the men's
180-kilometer road race, which brought Hong Kong's first ever
National Games gold medal, became the biggest news in Hong Kong
sports since last summer when Lee Lai Shan, the most famed product
of local sports machine as an ace woman wind surfer, won for Hong
Kong its first ever Olympic medal -- a gold at last year's Atlanta
Games.
</P>
<P>
And, with the victory which upset China's top racer Tang
Xuezhong, Wong was later named one of Best Athletes of the Games
and, before the New Year's Eve, was listed as one of the country's
Top Ten Athletes of the Year.
</P>
<P>
Although Wong's victory was Hong Kong SAR athletes' only
medal-winning performance in Shanghai, the number one harvest for
the delegation was the experience of competing in the country's
top-class sports gala. Leading officials of many Hong Kong sports
associations took the chance to discuss with their mainland
counterparts on such topics as ways to further the cooperation
between them and to promote Hong Kong sports.
</P>
<P>
The local sports has very positive prospects since it enjoys
the advantage of its geographical location adjacent to China's
mainland, which provides excellent chances for exchanges and
mutual support.
</P>
<P>
SAR Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa has on many occasions
expressed his optimism on the prosperity of HKSAR's sports. "Both
Hong Kong and Hong Kong sports will enter a new era when Hong Kong
reunifies with the motherland," he said in January.
</P>
<P>
He guaranteed that the future HKSAR government would inject
enough funds into programs promoting local sports. "Don't worry
about money," he ensured.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong sports would have much better chance and advantage
in the future after Hong Kong's reunification with China. I'm
optimistic of this," said John Hung, Chairman of the Hong Kong
Sports Development Board (HKSDB).
</P>
<P>
"China is one of the world's sports powers. HKSAR's sports
shall take the orientation of promoting exchanges and mutual
supports with the mainland so as to have both programs steamed
up," said Timothy Fok, Vice-Chairman of the HKSDB.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong SAR has remained, since the handover, one of the
world's most important economic, financial, tourist and
information centers. And, it is still vigorous in promoting
sports with ambitious programs for local development and projects
for hosting international competitions.
</P>
<P>
Bright prospects are ahead as SAR strives with might and
validity to attain a higher standard both for its athletes and its
residents' health.

<HEADLINE> New Oil, Gas Reserves Found in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Iran has found new reserves of
1.49 billion barrels of oil, 31.85 trillion cubic feet of gas and
596 million barrels of liquid gas in the current Iranian year
ending on March 20, 1998, an Iranian official said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to Iran's official news agency IRNA, exploration
director of the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) Mahmoud
Mohaddes said that the new oil and gas reserves were discovered in
the Persian Gulf as well as in the southern provinces of
Khuzestan, Fars and Bushehr.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that with the drilling of about 300 wells, some
18 trillion to 200 trillion cubic feet of gas and over 15 billion
barrels of oil will be discovered in other fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
Mohaddes said that exploitation operations in subterranean
surfaces of Bibi Kakimeh field in southern Iran are indicative of
1.984 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves.
</P>
<P>
He said that Zagros area has the largest gas potentials in the
country, especially the region between Aghar and Dalan gas fields
stretching toward Bandar Abbas and the strait of Hormuz.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports said that the country has an oil reserve of
about 93 billion barrels, ranking fourth in the world, and a gas
reserve of 742.3 trillion cubic feet, ranking the second in the
world. It is believed that Iran will find new oil and gas reserves
with the exploration in the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
At present, Iran's oil output stands at 3.6 million barrels
per day (bpd) and the figure will be raised to about 4 million bpd
according to a decision of the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC).

<HEADLINE> Feature: Electrician Makes Face Musical (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the spring of 1980, after playing his harmonica all morning,
he tapped his strained face for relief. The sounds surprised and
intrigued him.
</P>
<P>
For several days he tapped his face until it was black and
blue, his gums were swollen and his knuckles ached. He was unable
to play a simple tune, but persevered.
</P>
<P>
Cui first tapped his face with one finger, then used three
while drawing inspiration from the Chinese three-string instrument
called the "Sanxian'er." He learned to use five fingers after
studying another Chinese musical instrument, the "Pipa."
</P>
<P>
His skills are so good now that he can tap music off his head
just as easily as he waves his leg. But even playing the most
solemn music, he has to "box" his ears to make loud notes.
</P>
<P>
Cui, who has been an electrician for 27 years, also plays the
violin, clarinet and other instruments. His musical repertoire
also includes plucking a comb and rubber belt.
</P>
<P>
He often finds contradiction between his job as an electrician
and a musical performer. But his boss helps him by granting eaves
whenever he needs to perform. Sometimes Cui flies out of Beijing
after work and returns early the next morning so that he can
perform his job.
</P>
<P>
Cui also wins unrelenting support from his wife, a shop
assistant, and his daughter, a high school student.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Loses $8b Yearly to Foreign Shippers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria loses an estimated
eight billion U.S. Dollars annually to foreign shippers for the
import and export of its oil and non-oil products, an industrial
leader has disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Due to non-participation of indigenous shipping companies, the
country loses about two billion dollars annually to foreign
shippers in the lifting of crude oil, according to Alhaji Buba
Galadima, Director-General of National Maritime Authority (NMA).
</P>
<P>
Another six billion dollars is lost to foreign shipping
interests in dry cargo shipment, project cargo, containers,
general cargo imports and exports, he said at NMA's 10th
anniversary celebrations held in the capital Abuja Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria sells its crude oil on Free on Board
(FOB) basis and is the only member of the organization of
petroleum exporting countries which does not freight its crude
oil and own its tankers.
</P>
<P>
"Our foreign terms of trade which have our exports to be
conducted on FOB and the import on CIF (cost, insurance and
freight) basis make it extremely difficult to effectively partake
in cargo carriage," Galadima said, quoted by press reports today.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that the story is not any different in the
gas sector.
</P>
<P>
Galadima explained that efforts "to reverse these unfavorable
trends, which had seen us taking strong position at higher
levels, continue to be challenged and thwarted by the foreign
shipping interests".
</P>
<P>
"To date, it has remained difficult, for instance, to open
foreign offices abroad to monitor shipments," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigerian ships are still being detained in
foreign ports on the slightest excuse, while service charges due
to NMA are denied, delayed or under-declared by foreign shipping
interests.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the government to come to the aid of NMA for it
to surmount some of the problems.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Minister of Transportation major-general
Ibrahim Gumel said the government is presently looking into the
details of how indigenous shipping companies can participate in
the carriage of crude oil, liquified natural gas and other
freight exports and imports.
</P>
<P>
According to industry sources, Nigerian shipping companies
have over the years sought to participate in the lifting of the
country's crude oil.
</P>
<P>
To demonstrate their capability, six indigenous carriers
formed a consortium two years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Uganda is installing a large
cold-storage facility near the Entebbe International Airport to
save its fish exports, a local report said.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda fish exporting companies said they were pressing
for the speeding up of the project to complete the storage
facility, ahead of the February 1998 European Union deadline on
its fish exports.
</P>
<P>
The European Union has threatened to ban all Uganda fish
exports, complaining they were of poor quality, being short of
storage facilities.
</P>
<P>
Fish is one of Uganda's key exports. Up to 20,000 tons are
exported out of more than 200,000 tons caught annually. The
country earns around 40 million U.S. Dollars per year from fish
exports.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the trade and industry ministry say they want
to make fish exports number two to coffee as a hard currency
earner. Coffee brings in up to 400 million U.S. Dollars each
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Senator Rafiq Tarar, the
official candidate of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)
and its allied parties, won the presidential election Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
While counting is still under way in the three of the four
provincial assemblies, the 68-year-old Tarar, a former judge of
the Supreme Court, has secured 312 votes including 243 from the
National Assembly and 69 from the Sindh provincial Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Tarar swept the House by obtaining 243 votes of the total 298
votes polled at the National Assembly, according to the results by
the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Law, whoever secures 51 percent of
all the 476 electoral college votes, or 239 votes, will be
declared the next president of this south Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
Shahban Mirani, former defense minister and the nominee of the
major opposition Pakistan People's Party (PPP), secured 39 votes
while Muhammad Kan Sherani from the Jamiat-e-UlemaIslami (JUI) won
seven votes.
</P>
<P>
Seven votes at the National Assembly were declared invalid,
while six Parliamentarians failed to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
Results coming from the Provincial Assembly of Sindh show that
Tarar secured 69 votes as against 34 won by Mirani. Out of a
total of 109 votes in the Sindh Provincial Assembly, 105 votes
were cast.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still uncertain whether Tarar can hold the
office he has won. Tarar was allowed by the Lahore High Court on
December 19 to participate in the election after his earlier
disqualification of candidature by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
Former acting chief election commissioner Mukhtar Ahmad
Junejo's order to disqualify Tarar's candidature for his alleged
remarks against the judiciary remains suspended.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China has unveiled a set of
provisions governing the securities consulting sector.
</P>
<P>
The regulations, which outline detailed qualification criteria
for consultants and related agencies, ban investment consultants
from investing in securities.
</P>
<P>
The provisions are designed to standardize consulting practices
related to securities and futures investments, protect individual
investors, and promote the standardized and sound development of
China's securities market, according to a spokesman for the
China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC).
</P>
<P>
The regulations will also be conducive to the self-development
of the securities consulting sector, according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that numerous irregularities in the sector
resulting from low-level professionalism, the lack of
self-discipline, ignorance of professional ethics and weak
supervision have severely misled individual investors involved in
securities trading.
</P>
<P>
Individual investors, who still account for the major portion
of investments in China's securities sector, rely heavily on
professional advice. Therefore, the regulations represent a highly
significant measure adopted to standardize the market, according
to the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Low Inflation Rate, Best Gift to Poor: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram said here Wednesday that containing inflation at 4
percent is the best gift offered by the United Front government to
the poor in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The year of 1997 was a roller-coaster year for the country's
economy due to political uncertainty. The Reserve Bank of India
has forecast a six percent economic growth for this fiscal year
(April 1, 1997--March 31, 1998) against a 6.8 percent last year.
This was not a very happy conclusion, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that he did not buy the argument that a four percent or
less inflation rate was anti-growth.
</P>
<P>
Slowdown in exports was attributable to the economic slowdown
on a global scale as well as devaluation of Asian currencies. Poor
performance of industrial and export sectors would not last long
because the country's economic fundamentals were strong, he added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's Inflation Rate Falls to 8.8% </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria has brought down to the
single digit mark its inflation rate, which dropped to 8.8
percent in November from the previous month's 10.1 percent, the
Federal Office of Statistics (FOS) says.
</P>
<P>
The achievement falls within the 15-percent budget target for
the year.
</P>
<P>
"The average annual rate of rise of consumer retail prices for
the 12-month period ending November 1997 was 8.8 percent," FOS
reported, quoted by The Vanguard today.
</P>
<P>
But FOS warned that it was not yet a relief for consumers as
"the level of prices are still very high when compared to the
corresponding level at the base period."
</P>
<P>
According to the government agency, the consuming price index
(all items) of 2,837.5 naira for November 1997 was 28.375 times
that of September 1985 in terms of average prices of goods and
services.
</P>
<P>
The FOS report said the single digit inflation rate only
indicated "a substantial slow-down in the upward movement of
consumer retail prices."
</P>
<P>
Average retail prices of consumer goods and services "are
still experiencing price increase," it added.
</P>
<P>
FOS attributed the rapid drop of the inflation rate to the
government's tight fiscal and monetary policy stance.
</P>
<P>
The combination of policy measures, however, also helped in
starving the economy of funds, resulting in the weak purchasing
power of the public and a build up of inventory in the
manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
The agency also warned that low inflation rate was not a good
yardstick for an economy that is not growing or performing well.
</P>
<P>
"One digit inflation does not mean that the economy is totally
good. Inflation can be brought down when people are too poor to
buy," FOS said.
</P>
<P>
It is learned the Nigerian government is to adopt a reflation
policy to promote economic growth in the new year.
</P>
<P>
According to National Planning Minister Chief Ayo Ogunlade,
the thrust of the 1998 budget would include consolidating gains,
revitalizing the economy and an easier import of goods by
manufacturers and attractive atmosphere for foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
The government will also increase the salaries of public
servants.
</P>
<P>
These policy measures, when implemented, are expected to
increase the purchasing power of both individuals and
enterprises, leading to an upward movement of prices, analysts
said.

results.
</P>
<P>
-- At least 350 people were killed in Algeria in less than 10
days, which did not take into account the casualties of security

<HEADLINE> Jiang Delivers New Year's Message on State Radio and TV (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- In a new year's message
broadcast worldwide today, President Jiang Zemin said that people
of all countries across the world should make joint efforts to
usher in a new century of enduring peace and common development.
</P>
<P>
In his message to the audience of China Central People's
Broadcasting Station, China Radio International and China Central
Television, delivered here on the eve of 1998, Jiang expressed his
confidence in the future of China and the world by titling the
message "March toward a promising new century."
</P>
<P>
Describing 1997 as "a very important and very extraordinary
year in the Chinese history," President Jiang said that the
Chinese people are determined to carry forward the behest of Deng
Xiaoping, who passed away in February in Beijing, and promote the
advancement of the cause of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, he recalled, the Chinese government smoothly resumed
its exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong and maintained Hong
Kong's prosperity and stability under the principle of "one
country, two systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and
a high degree of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
"Also this year, the Communist Party of China (CPC)
successfully convened its 15th National Congress, which, holding
high the great banner of Deng Xiaoping Theory, summarized China's
history over the past century and worked out the program for
action for the country's development in the next century," he
added.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China's reform, opening-up and modernization
drive continued to make progress in the past year, with high
growth and low inflation for the national economy, another bumper
harvest in agriculture, further deepening of enterprise reforms
and further improvement of people's lives.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China's foreign economic and technological
cooperation and exchanges have continued to expand, while new
achievements have been scored in building democracy and the legal
system, promoting ethical and cultural progress and other social
undertakings, he said.

<P>
"Though we still face many difficulties in economic growth and
social progress, we surely can overcome them and continue to make
steady progress, for we have the guidance of Deng Xiaoping Theory,
rich experience accumulated in the past nearly two decades of
reform and opening-up, and many other advantages," he said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang then acknowledged that it is the common
aspiration of all Chinese across the world to realize the complete
reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Macao will certainly return to the motherland
smoothly in December of 1999 with the cooperation and joint
efforts between China and Portugal," he said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and
that any attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan"
and seek "Taiwan independence" are doomed to fail.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Taiwan authorities could put national
interests in first place, show sincerity and take concrete steps
to promote economic, cultural and personnel exchanges across the
Taiwan Straits and help realize the direct mail, shipping and
trade between the two sides of the straits," he urged.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan authorities should also make an early response to the
mainland's serious appeal for negotiations under the "one China"
principle, he added.
</P>
<P>
With regard to world affairs, Jiang said that the ever-closer
global economic links and the rapid scientific and technological
progress worldwide are offering a historic opportunity for the
economic development of all countries.

"Generally speaking, we have continued to maintain stability in
the overall situation of China's reforms and development," he
asserted.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that the Chinese government is
extremely concerned about the financial turmoil that recently hit
a number of countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that through the efforts of these countries and
regions and relevant international cooperation, the situation will
get better step by step," he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that 1997 is a year of major diplomatic
success as China and the United States, Russia, France, Japan and
other major nations have established goals and guiding principles
for developing bilateral relations through the exchange of a
series of high-level visits.
</P>
<P>
China has further enhanced its friendly cooperation with its
neighboring countries and developing countries by taking an active
part in Asia Pacific Economic Council (APEC) activities and
participating in the informal summits between leaders of the
Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and China, Japan
and the Republic of Korea (ROK), he added.
</P>
<P>
"All these diplomatic maneuvers are compatible with the major
theme of peace and development of our time, as well as the
multi-polarization drive in the world today," he said. "They have
made positive contributions to the promotion of friendly
cooperation and common development in the global community."
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Chinese people will strive for new achievements
with full confidence, he said.

"However, the world is still not tranquil," he said. "The
wealth gap between the north and south continues to widen;
regional conflicts break out from time to time; and no fundamental
changes have taken place in the old international political and
economic order that is unjust and unreasonable."
</P>
<P>
Developing countries remain in a weak position in the intense
global economic competition, and the subsistence and development

Though the 21st century is full of hope and promise, he said,

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Gov't Announces Merger of Four State Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
Wednesday announced a plan to merge a number of state owned banks
into one to improve the health of the country's banking sector and
provide foreign banks of international reputation with the
opportunity to become shareholding partners.
</P>
<P>
"The preparation process of the merger will be carried out from
January-March 1998 while the actual merger is expected to be
completed not later than July 31, 1998," Finance Minister Mar'ie
Muhammad said here after meeting with President Soeharto at his
residence.
</P>
<P>
As part of the economic reform measures, the merger and
restructure of government banks is meant to accelerate the
revitalization efforts of state-owned banks, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the government will also form a credit settlement
company -- with the status of state-owned company -- tasked to
solve or liquidate all non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
The four state-owned banks that will be merged into one are
BAPINDO (Bank Pembangunan Indonesia), Bank Bumi Daya, Bank Dagang
Negara and Bank Ekspor Impor Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Following the merger, non-performing loans will be removed from
the banks involved and transfer them to the newly created credit
settlement company to ensure there is improvement in the quality
of assets resulting from the four merged banks, Mar'ie said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the government's decision to allow foreign banks
to become shareholders will ensure that the merged banks would
become a strong financial institution that can compete globally.
</P>
<P>
On why the government is giving opportunity to foreign banks to
become shareholders, he said, "we want to improve our skills and
credibility and transfer the technology."
</P>
<P>
The government's decision to merge the four state-owned banks
is the second step to make them more efficient.
</P>
<P>
On November 1 this year, the government closed 16 insolvent
private banks in a bid to make the banking sector more healthy.
</P>
<P>
Economists and monetary institutes here regards the existing
240 commercial banks in Indonesia as far too many for the
country's banking sector at this stage of economic development.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Senator Rafiq Tarar,
official candidate of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N)
and its allied parties, won the presidential election Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 68-year-old Tarar, a former judge of the Supreme Court,
swept the House by obtaining 243 votes out of the total 298 votes
at the National Assembly, according to the results by the Election
Commission.
</P>
<P>
Shahban Mirani, former defense minister and the nominee of the
major opposition Pakistan People's Party won only seven votes out
of a total 298 votes.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Muhammad Khan Sherani from the Jamiat-e-Ulema Islami
(JUI) secured seven votes.
</P>
<P>
Seven votes at the National Assembly were declared invalid
while six Parliamentarians failed to cast their votes.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Law, whosoever secures 51 percent of
all the 476 electoral college votes, or 239 votes, will be
declared next president of this South Asian nation.
</P>
<P>
However, it is still uncertain whether Tarar will hold the
office he wins. Tarar was allowed by the Lahore High Court on
December 19 to participate in the election after his earlier
disqualification of candidature by the Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
The order by former acting chief election commissioner Mukhtar
Ahmad Junejo to disqualify Tarar's candidature for his alleged
remarks against judiciary remains suspended.

For such an end, he said, there are also needs to strengthen
the administration and party organizations, and to promote

The prime minister told the VNA that economic integration into
the region and the world is necessary for Vietnam's development.

Local traditional crops such as millet and maize did not fit
to the prolonged rains, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The prolonged drought by October and torrential rains since
late November had hindered the growth and delayed collection of
coffee seeds and cotton, the main cash crops of Ugandan farmers.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics of Ugandan authorities, coffee
export in September and October this year dropped from last
year's 792,839 bags to 310,433 bags.
</P>
<P>
Coffee export earns 65 percent of foreign exchange for
Ugandans. Each bag of coffee contains 60 kilogram of its seeds.
</P>
<P>
Cotton, another main export crop, also was predicted to
decrease to 60,000 185-kilograms bales this year from last year's
110,000.

In addition, most of Macao exports went to the United States
and the European Union. The two bought 77.8 percent of Macao's
exported goods.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Macao imported more capital goods, fuel and
lubricating oil, raw materials and semi-finished goods from
neighboring regions. The imports of consumer goods dropped 0.7
percent.
</P>
<P>
The imports from China's inland, Taiwan, the Republic of Korea
and Japan increased in the period, but the purchase from Hong Kong
and Australia declined.
</P>
<P>
The external trade is perhaps the most bright side of Macao
economy this year, analysts said. Other leading economic sectors,
like real estate and tourism, have dropped.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Farmers Applying Computers to Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- An illiterate ethnic Chinese
farmer cannot tell what a computer is, yet he believes in the
"stuff" since he has tasted its sweet.
</P>
<P>
Jiasan Daha, a veteran farmer of the Yi Nationality in Ninglang
County, of southwest China's Yunnan Province, turned to computers
for advice this summer when he found his apple trees suffering
insect diseases. And in a matter of a few seconds, the computer
did tell him what to do.
</P>
<P>
He is only one of the numerous Chinese farmers who have
benefited from a nationwide project called Computerized Agronomist
System, which stores varied agro-sciences, farming knowledge and
agriculture-related information.
</P>
<P>
The computer gives specific answers and solutions to any
questions and problems raised by farmers, based on scientific
calculation.
</P>
<P>
The project, initiated by the State Science and Technology
Commission, has been extended to nearly 100 counties across the
country, covering more than 26 million ha of farmland.
</P>
<P>
"Is is encouraging that such high-techs have been spread so
quickly in outlying poor areas," said Gao Zhenning, vice-chairman
of the China Association for Science and Technology, after an
on-the-spot inspection in the county.
</P>
<P>
Not only farmers but also county leaders did not know anything
about computers years ago. Local people used to turn to "slash and
burn" method for farming.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning, Jiasan Daha would never believe that the
"stuff" would know how to do farming. But he was convinced when
his neighbors collected higher grain output with computers'
help. And he is now a regular visitor to the local computerized
agronomist system center.
</P>
<P>
"High-techs have really been turned into a productive force
in our county," said Li Xingshun, the county's Party secretary.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The Inter-American
Development Bank (IDB) said Tuesday its financial help for Latin
America and the Caribbean reached a record high in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Disbursements exceeded 5.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1997, up 1.2
billion dollars against 1996, said IDB President Enrique Iglesias
in his year-end address to the Board of Executive Directors.
</P>
<P>
Approved loans totaled 6.0 billion dollars for a record 99
lending operations, including 327 million dollars complemented by
564 million dollars in syndicated loans for private infrastructure
projects without government guarantees, an IDB record for private
sector lending.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Washington-based IDB financed 294
technological cooperation projects on a nonreimbursable basis for
a total of 73.6 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Lending for social programs, mainly for health and education,
constituted 43 percent of the IDB lending in Latin America and the
Caribbean in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In promoting regional integration, the IDB provided a line of
credit to the Central American Bank for Economic Integration as
well as financing for transportation corridors that link Uruguay
with other Mercosur countries and the Bolivia-Brazil natural gas
pipeline.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Two people have reportedly
claimed seeing a Fiat coming out of the tunnel of Alma in Paris on
August 31, seconds after the crash which killed Princess Diana.
</P>
<P>
The two anonymous people -- one man and one woman -- said the
white Fiat Uno was driven by a European man of some 40 years old
with brown hair, said the daily Aujourd'hui/Parisien Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Fiat driver had a big dog at the back seat, they were
quoted as saying by a report in the daily newspaper. And his
behavior "appeared abnormal," as his car zigzagged.
</P>
<P>
The daily also cited an unpublished investigation report by
French investigators working on the case, which said the testimony
of the double witness was corroborated by scientific experts.
</P>
<P>
These presumed findings would "strengthen the hypothesis that
Diana's Mercedes car collided with a white Fiat Uno under the Alma
tunnel," the paper said.

<HEADLINE> US Urged to Revise Policies toward Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior Iranian official has
said that Washington should revise its policies toward Iran and
correct the "misconceptions" of the American people about Iran,
local daily Iran News reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Iran News published today, Iranian Deputy
Foreign Minister for legal and international affairs Mohammad
Javad Zarif said the United States had to acknowledge that Iran is
an active country and could not be isolated.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has to have a realistic approach toward the
new international climate, the end of the Cold War, the change in
the international structure, as well as recognizing the Islamic
Republic of Iran as a pluralistic system," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zarif said that the eight Islamic summit held here on December
9-11 proved that allegations and propaganda against Iran were
"unfounded, because all regional countries have unanimously
announced that the source of their anxiety is Israel."
</P>
<P>
He said that all the ambiguities should be resolved and
allegations retracted, adding that "we will adopt a more active
policy in this regard."
</P>
<P>
Zarif also denied the report about the visit of a U.S. Senator
to Iran, saying that "I am not in charge of Iran-U.S. relations,
but I strongly deny this rumor."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Mahmoud Mohammadi
Monday also denied a visit of U.S. Congressman Tom Lantos to
Iran, saying that "we have no information about such a plan."
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi also dismissed the report that Iranian Foreign
Minister Kamal Kharrazi called for better ties with the United
States.
</P>
<P>
After Iranian President Mohammad Khatami announced his
willingness to have a dialogue with the American people, there
were many reports and rumors about possible rapprochement between
the two rival countries.
</P>
<P>
However, Mohammadi said that there was no new developments
between the two countries and many Iranian officials urged
Washington to revise its policies toward Iran as a goodwill
gesture to Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the United States broke diplomatic relations in 1980
after the Iranian Islamic revolution and the U.S. Hostage
crisis and the Untied States has been imposing economic sanctions
against Iran ever since.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Chinese Audiences Enjoy Opera and Ballet (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese audiences had ample
opportunities to enjoy opera and ballet during 1997 -- the
"International Opera and Ballet Year" initiated by the Ministry of
Culture on January 5.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xiaohong, an official from the ministry, said 17 art
troupes from eight countries, including China Japan, Russia,
Israel, and Austria, took part in the event. The troupes staged 30
outstanding operas and ballets for a total of 350 nights in over
20 major cities throughout the nation.
</P>
<P>
More than 430,000 Chinese people have journeyed to local
theaters to watch world-famous opera and ballet classics
such as "Le Nozze di Figaro" performed by the Vienna State Opera,
"Turanto" by the National Opera of China, "Swan Lake" by the State
Ballet Troupe of Russia, and "Red Detachment of Women" by the
National Ballet Troupe of China (NBTC).
</P>
<P>
Chinese audiences have gained considerable knowledge and
understanding of opera and ballet and, at the same time, have
learned to enjoy high-quality performances of traditional European
art forms dating back over 400 years.
</P>
<P>
"I'm delighted to have had the opportunity to enjoy ballets
performed by the world's top dancers," said Zhao Weifeng, a lawyer
in Beijing. Zhao noted he was fond of watching the movie version
of the modern Chinese ballet "White-haired Girl" during his
boyhood.
</P>
<P>
NBTC Director Zhao Ruheng said that the troupe has presented 59
performances of five ballet classics during 1997, including "Swan
Lake," "Sleeping Beauty," and "Don Quixote." Thousands of Chinese
residents fell in love with the art, a combination of charming
dancers, beautiful stage design, moving stories, pleasing music,
and skillful performances.

<P>
The NBTC also invited a dozen excellent ballet experts and
artists from Great Britain, Denmark, France, and Russia to join in
art exchange programs, and developed a series of cooperative
performances with young Chinese dancers, said Zhao, adding that
"the activities were a sign of further links between Chinese and
western arts."
</P>
<P>
Zi Huajun, a leading researcher on the art of dance, said that
modern Chinese opera and dance started early this century with the
development of western opera and ballet in China.
</P>
<P>
"Regardless of the place of their origin, outstanding arts are
treasures for people throughout the world, and the only way for
art forms in a country to improve is to engage in exchanges and
learn from arts in other countries and regions," said Zi. For
example, active art exchanges between central areas in China and
foreign regions yielded a prosperous era of dance and music
culture during the Han Dynasty (206-220 B.C.) and the Tang
Dynasty (618-907).
</P>
<P>
This year's cultural exchange programs and art performances
helped Chinese art troupes learn more about European ballet and
opera, establish a profitable culture market in China, and serve
the desire of Chinese audiences for high-quality art programs,
according to Zi.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Culture has extended great effort to introduce
outstanding foreign art genres to Chinese people. Apart from the
year of international opera and ballet, the ministry also
sponsored the International Symphony Year in 1996, and will
sponsor the International Fine Arts Year in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Banks Aim at Higher Loan Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The increasingly risk-aware
Chinese banks are taking active measures to improve their loan
efficiency, while gradually reducing the existing bad loans.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the banks have focused on improving their
loan-extending systems, strengthening internal control, and
stepping up the risk prevention effort during the past year as
required by the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
All the major Chinese commercial banks have endorsed the
ambitious goal to cut down their existing bad loans by two to
three percentage points a year for the coming three to five years.
</P>
<P>
Inefficient and bad loans are labeled as a major pain for the
Chinese banking sector. The central bank estimated the nation's
bad loans at more than one trillion yuan, about 20 percent of the
total loans.
</P>
<P>
The major blame may be dated back to the traditional planned
economic system, under which the banks paid more attention to the
quality of their services rather than the loan efficiency and loan
risks. Over-speculation in the real estate sector and the
financial difficulties of the state-owned enterprises also
resulted in an increase in inefficient bank loans.
</P>
<P>
However, the liquidity, safety and efficiency of the bank loans
gradually rose to become the top concern of the Chinese banks from
1995, when the central government decided to commercialize the
once state-owned specialized banks.
</P>
<P>
And the banks' efforts to fight bad loans and improve loan
efficiency have paid off this year, said a central bank official,
pointing to the fact that all the Chinese banks have set up a
scientific loan-extending system, improved the internal
supervision mechanism, and stepped up the administration of their
loan assets.
</P>
<P>
As an immediate outcome, the four largest state commercial
banks have reported smaller growth but increased quality in
outstanding loans, with the loan structure further improved and
some bad loans either recalled or written off.
</P>
<P>
The shift of the Chinese banks' focus to improving loan
efficiency and increasing risk awareness showed that the sector
was a substantial step closer toward the final goal of becoming
commercialized, said Jin Guanwen, a loan management official with
the Agricultural Bank of China.
</P>
<P>
However, the "digestion" of bad bank loans is complicated and
demands the efforts from the whole society, and is closely related
to the maturing of the market economy and the continuous reform of
the state enterprises, according to Wang Guogang, deputy director
of the Financial Research Center under the Chinese Academy of
Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"But we may count on a gradual decline in the bad loans in the
coming years, as a result of the gradual progress in the economic
performance of the enterprises," added Wang.

<HEADLINE> Israel Developing Laser System to Counter Katyusha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Israel will be able to deploy
an anti-missile laser system capable of shooting down Katyusha
rockets fired from Lebanon in early 1999, local newspaper Daily
Star reported today.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted an Israeli report as saying that field
tests of the Nautilus laser, being jointly developed by Israel and
the United States at a cost of 160 million U.S. dollars, would be
conducted at the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Nautilus is a tactical high energy laser, whose main function

into Israel by Lebanese resistance guerrillas in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The idea involves a high energy beam being directed at an

</P>
<P>
It said that the U.S. had hoped that a prototype of the
Nautilus would be ready for installation in northern Israel at the
end of this year, but the project reportedly has been delayed due
to funding and technical problems.
</P>
<P>
Since 1985 when Israeli troops occupied Lebanon's
1,200-square-kilometer area in the south with the claimed aim of
protecting its residents in the northern area, Lebanese
guerrillas often use Katyusha rockets in attacking Israeli
occupation forces.

<HEADLINE> County Economy Becomes Dynamic Sector (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 31 (Xinhua) -- Jinxiang County in East
China's Shandong Province, one of the nation's major grain and
cotton bases, was still a poor area only five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Things have changed, however, and the mid-sized county has been
growing by an average annual rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
Jinxiang, with a population of 600,000, is one of China's over
2,000 counties, including more than 400 county-level
cities. Jinxiang's high economic growth rate reflects the dynamism
of China's overall county economy.
</P>
<P>
State Statistical Bureau figures for 1997 show that the growth
rate for the county economy was between 3-4 percentage points
higher than the rate for the national economy.
</P>
<P>
Counties, with land areas ranging from 1,000 sq.m. to 3,000
sq.m. and populations of between 200,000-1,000,000 people, are the
most stable level in China's administrative structure. Counties
are, in fact, home to over 80 percent of China's population and
over 90 percent of the nation's land and mineral reserves, as well
as water, agricultural, forestry, pastoral and fisheries resources.
</P>
<P>
According to Professor Gao Huanxi, who has studied the county
economy for many years, "The development momentum for the county
economy remains strong, despite the fact that Chinese leaders
still face difficulties in solving problems with state-owned and
large urban enterprises. The county economy have emerged as one of
the most dynamic sectors in the country's overall economic
framework."
</P>
<P>
China's county economy not only includes the family,
cooperative township economies, but also state-owned industrial
and commercial businesses. The total economic volume for the
county economy accounts for over 60 percent of the total national
economy.

Du Changwen, a local official in Jinxiang, said: "The rapid
development of our economy has benefited from a strategy of
agricultural industrialization which has further rationalized our
industrial structure and enabled industries to upgrade."
</P>
<P>
Like Du, local leaders in many of China's counties have
achieved success in organizing economic development with a view
towards industrialization. They have managed to achieve industrial
advantages by promoting market-oriented agricultural and
by-product processing.
</P>
<P>
Industrialization has also promoted the rapid development of
the secondary and tertiary industries in rural areas, with said
industries becoming energetic growth points in the county
economy. For example, two large enterprise groups and 76 private
enterprises in Jinxiang County are engaged in processing "white
garlic", a well-known local product. Jinxiang's export volume for
garlic currently accounts for 70 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ministry of Agriculture, the over 20,000
agricultural and by-product processing enterprises China has
established in recent years are predominantly distributed in
counties and represent a new force driving development of the
county economy.
</P>
<P>
"China's reforms have been most effective in counties. The
reforms have enabled flexible township enterprises to develop
rapidly, and many medium and small county-owned enterprises to
find various means for opening and expansion," according to
Professor Gao.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 100,000 small- to medium-sized state-owned
enterprises at the county level. Since the 15th National Congress
of the Communist Party of China, various localities have
accelerated their pace for restructuring and reshaping said
enterprises. They have also adopted various economic patterns such
as share-holding, leasing, auctions and joint stock ownership to
strengthen the major force in the county economy.
</P>
<P>
The most important result of county reform in recent years
centers on the fact that township enterprises have largely
improved their quality. Projections from the Ministry of
Agriculture indicate that national township enterprises will
achieve a 1997 added-value of 180 million yuan, up 18 percent on
1996. Their profits and taxes will also grow by over 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
Professor Gao noted that the rapid and healthy development of
the county economy has not only consolidated the fundamental level
of the national economy, but has also significantly improved
infrastructure in most areas of the country without increasing
government inputs.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that China will have over 200 million surplus
rural laborers by the end of the century, with the national annual
floating population expected to hover between 60-80
million. Officials from the State Commission for Restructuring the
Economy noted that further development of the county economy will
provide more employment opportunities and beneficial conditions
for China's poverty relief campaign.

<HEADLINE> China, South Pacific Nations Forge Closer Ties (2) --by Liu Dongkai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During a meeting with Australian Prime Minister John Howard in
Beijing in March, Chinese President Jiang Zemin said the two
nations should proceed from a point of strategic height in
considering the expansion of bilateral relations. Jiang added that
the two countries should proceed from the standpoint of
maintaining and promoting peace, stability and prosperity in the
Asia-Pacific Region and should fully consider both the future and
the current general situation.
</P>
<P>
In its foreign affairs and trade white paper issued in August,
the Australian government stated that it planned to forge closer
links with Asian countries such as China and Indonesia in order to
safeguard its national security and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
This year marked the 25th anniversary of the establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and the two largest nations in
the South Pacific. CPPCC Vice-Chairman Li Ruihuan attended
commemoration ceremonies in Australia and New Zealand during
visits to the two countries in December. Australian Foreign
Minister Downer also visited Beijing to attend a series of
celebrations held during the same month.
</P>
<P>
Hu Jintao, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and member of the committee's
Secretariat, attended a ceremony marking the 100th birth
anniversary of the late Rewi Alley, a well-known social activist
from New Zealand and an old friend of Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation represents one of the most
notable aspects of relations between China and South Pacific
nations. China is Australia's fifth largest trade partner, and
seventh largest for New Zealand. Two of China's largest overseas
investment projects are in Australia and New Zealand, including a
joint-venture iron ore mine in Australia and a logging operation
in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
China has signed bilateral trade agreements with seven island
nations in the South Pacific, and has also signed civil aviation
agreements with a number of the nations. The agreements provide a
solid foundation for the further development of economic and trade
cooperation between China and these nations.
</P>
<P>
People-to-people contacts represent yet another outstanding
feature of Sino-South Pacific relations. The Chinese Government
has designated Australia and New Zealand as two of five official
tourist destinations for Chinese citizens. According to
projections by Australian immigration authorities, the number of
Chinese citizens traveling to Australia will double over the next
three years to reach 130,000 by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Local governments from China and South Pacific nations have
also increased contacts, with Chinese and Australian cities
establishing 31 sister-city relationships. In addition, cities in
China and New Zealand have established 13 similar relationships,
with one sister-harbor relationship between ports in the two
nations.
</P>
<P>
China actively supports efforts by the South Pacific Forum to
protect the environment, promote economic development and maintain
stability in the region. The South Pacific Forum has also decided
to establish an economic and trade representative office in China.
</P>
<P>
Local experts expressed the belief that China will continue to
work for closer ties with South Pacific nations on the basis of
the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

<HEADLINE> Wheat Prices on China Market Likely to Edge Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Wheat prices on the Chinese
market are thought likely to edge up in 1998 due to an
expected fall in output and falling prices this year, today's
China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
As most wheat producers in China have suffered severe drought
since last October, the per-unit wheat production in 1998 will be
lower than that in 1997. Consequently, the total output will be
less than last year's record high, 122.6 million tons.
</P>
<P>
As domestically produced wheat cannot meet market demands, China
is expected to import more wheat in 1998 than in 1997, but much
less than in 1995 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
As wheat stores are sufficient in early 1998, the wheat supply
will roughly equal the demand.
</P>
<P>
According to figures released by the State Statistics Bureau on
Monday, grain output in 1997 is expected to be 492.5 million tons,
a record high in two years running. Experts had predicted
that China's grain reserves would hit a record high in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, influenced by low wheat prices in 1997 and producers'
and consumers' expectations, wheat price rises in 1998 will not be
too radical, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Wheat prices on the Chinese market have been dipping in 1997,
mainly stemming from good wheat harvests over the past three years.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1997, wheat output, at 22.25
million tons, hit a record high and led to an oversupply. Prices
on the international market also kept going down, which posed a
great threat to the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Consequently, the domestic prices have dropped to their lowest
level for three years. Statistics indicate wholesale prices
declined continuously from 1,744 yuan (210 US dollars) per ton in
March to 1,410 yuan (170 US dollars) in August.

<P>
NANNING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Thanks to loans from the World
Bank, women and children in south China's Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region are now enjoying much better health care.
</P>
<P>
With 8.82 million US dollars of loans from the World Bank and
76.73 million yuan (9.2 million US dollars) of supportive funds
from local governments, maternity and child care projects have

counties.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the death rate of pregnant and lying-in
women in the counties on the average has been reduced from 2,308
per million in 1992 to 1,080 per million at the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the mortality rate of babies decreased
from 86 per thousand to 37 per thousand.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 130,000 local maternity and child
care workers have received training and greatly raised their

<P>
HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong share prices
slumped by 25 percent in the year of 1997, as the key market index
closed at 10,722.76 points during the half-day session on New
Year's Eve.
</P>
<P>
A year earlier on December 31, 1996, the Hang Seng Index
reached 13,451.45 points, a quarter higher than the year-end close
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip index fell 32.45 points, or 0.3 percent,
Wednesday from the previous close to end the year at 10,722.76
points.
</P>
<P>
The 33-member index surged 180.37 points in the first few
minutes of trading Wednesday morning to the day's high of
10,935.58 points, but lost ground later.
</P>
<P>
Turnover climbed up to 4.948 billion HK dollars (634 million
U.S. dollars) Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
As of December 19 this year, the market capitalization stood at
3,148 billion HK dollars (above 400 billion U.S. dollars), down
five percent from a year before but still putting the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong (SEHK) well into the world's top ten
bourses.
</P>
<P>
Total turnover for the year reached 3,761 billion HK dollars
(482 billion U.S. dollars), 2.7 times that of 1996.
</P>
<P>
There are 658 listed companies on the SEHK, with 82 initial
public offerings in 1997. Fifteen more China's state-owned
enterprises, known as H shares, were listed in Hong Kong this
year, raising a total of 28.625 billion HK dollars (3.7 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far 39 H shares and more than 50 red chips (China-affiliated
and Hong Kong-registered companies) have gone public on the SEHK.
The market capitalization of these China-related companies
accounts for 18 percent of the total in the Hong Kong market.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Closes Lower </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar closed
weaker Wednesday, trading quietly in a shortened session ahead of
the New Year's Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed weaker on the last day of trading
following another fall in the gold price Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 65.24 U.S. cents at midday
Wednesday, back from 65.48 late Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
A trader from Rothschild Australia said the slip in gold prices
fostered some bearish sentiment in the market.
</P>
<P>
"Gold prices are definitely weighing it down," he said.
</P>
<P>
The gold price was pressured by sharp U.S. equities gains and
research from Merrill Lynch predicting a bearish trend for gold in
the next two to three years.
</P>
<P>
Compounding the world-wide loss of faith in gold, economic
meltdown in Asia and falling commodity prices present a grim
outlook for the New Year.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar will enter 1998 more than 14 U.S. cents
lower than its level a year ago, when it was trading at 79.46 U.S.
cents.
</P>
<P>
Colonial State Bank chief economist Craig James said the
Australian dollar fell just over 12 percent against its U.S.
counterpart during the past four months, while commodity prices
dropped almost 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
"How much of a surprise is the Australian dollar at 65 U.S.
cents when gold is just above 18 year lows, copper prices are at
four year lows, oil prices are near 2 year lows and aluminum
prices are near 12 month lows," he said.
</P>
<P>
James said the Australian dollar was likely to be mired around
65 U.S. cents to 67 U.S. cents for several months.
</P>
<P>
He said the dominating influence was the prospect of recession
in Australia's two largest export partners, Japan and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Asian currency crisis was now giving way to a debt crisis,
James said.
</P>
<P>
"Corporate bankruptcies will increase, unemployment will rise
and output will contract as the region undertakes painful
restructuring," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the year at 84.76 Japanese yen,
from 85.04 Tuesday, and at 1.1672 German marks, from 1.1704.

CANBERRA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Australian share market
finished New Year's Eve trading on a stronger note following a

<HEADLINE> No Cases of Bird Flu Reported in Inland China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Experts with China's National
Influenza Center confirmed that no cases of H5N1 virus infection
have been discovered in the inland areas, even though the strain
has been detected a small group of Hong Kong residents.
</P>
<P>
Surveillance work targeting the virus will be intensified
across the country. "However, there is no need to panic about the
possibility of an epidemic," according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The virus, known to cause "bird influenza" in chickens, has
been transferred to human beings in Hong Kong. The virus is
believed to be transmitted through direct contact with poultry or
from contact with bird droppings.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Hong Kong requires further observation and
research, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Surveillance has been strengthened in some south China
provinces since August, especially in the cities of Guangzhou and
Shenzhen which border on the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR). Experts noted that "human blood samples have have
not as yet been tested for the virus."
</P>
<P>
The experts suggest that consuming cooked chickens and other
poultry is safe since cooking destroys influenza viruses.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Former defense minister
Aftab Shahban Mirani, the nominee of the major opposition Pakistan
People's Party (PPP) in Wednesday's presidential elections, is
seen as a worthwhile, though not the most hopeful, candidate.
</P>
<P>
Given the thin strength of the PPP in the federal parliament
and four provincial assemblies, Mirani seems to be in no position
to compete with the most possible winner, Rafiq Tarar, candidate
of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N).
</P>
<P>
However, Mirani, a member of the National Assembly, is still
seen as a worthwhile candidate in light of his noticeable
political career.
</P>
<P>
Mirani hails from a political family. His father Ghulam Kadir
Shahban Mirani was one of the three elected members of the Indian
Central Legislative Assembly from Sindh in pre-independence era.
</P>
<P>
He started his political career as elected president of
Shikarpur Municipality. Before he was elected to the National
Assembly in 1990, he had served as chief minister of Sindh
province for a long time.
</P>
<P>
In 1993, he was awarded the PPP ticket to contest election for
the National Assembly, wherefrom he succeeded with a majority.
Later he was appointed defense minister by then prime minister
Benazir Bhutto.
</P>
<P>
Mirani, who speaks fluent English, Sindhi and Urdu, has
represented Pakistan at various international seminars and
conferences.
</P>
<P>
Being an agriculturist, Mirani had attended formal courses in
modern farm management and agriculture in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Mirani is married and has one son and three daughters.

<HEADLINE> China, South Pacific Nations Forge Closer Ties (1) --by Liu Dongkai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China and South Pacific
nations have maintained steady momentum in developing bilateral
relations, scoring notable breakthroughs in many areas over the
past year, according to observers here.
</P>
<P>
This year has witnessed increased exchange visits between
leaders from China and South Pacific nations. Senior Chinese
officials visiting the region included Zhu Rongji and Li Ruihuan,
two of seven members in China's highest leadership group--the
Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC). Zhu and Li were
the highest-ranking Chinese officials visiting the region in a
number of years.
</P>
<P>
Leaders from most major countries in the South Pacific visited
China during 1997, including Australian Prime Minister John Howard
and Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer, former New Zealand Prime
Minister James Bolger and former Deputy Prime Minister Winston
Peters, Vanuatu Prime Minister Rialuth Serge Vohor, Palau
President Kuniwo Nakamura and Fijian Minister of Foreign Affairs
and Trade Berenado Vunibobo.
</P>
<P>
Frequent visits by high-ranking officials and the smooth
operation of bilateral consulting mechanisms strengthened
relations between China and nations in the South Pacific.
</P>
<P>
China established diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands on
July 25, thereby raising the number of the region's nations having
diplomatic ties with China to 10.
</P>
<P>
Local foreign affairs experts point out that China and South
Pacific nations, neighbors in the Asia Pacific Region, share a
broad range of mutual interests and either common or similar views
on many major issues.
</P>
<P>
Prior to China's resumption of sovereignty over Hong Kong on
July 1, Australia and New Zealand took the lead amongst western
countries by announcing their decisions to send represtatives to
all ceremonies marking the establishment of the Government of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR). Government
officials from the two countries repeatedly made it clear they
would contribute to the smooth transfer of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During the April meeting of the United Nations Commission on
Human Rights, Australia refused to sponsor an anti-China motion
tabled by a small group of countries. Instead, Australia sent
representatives to Beijing in August to initiate a dialog with
China on bilateral relations and human rights.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the Chinese Foreign Ministry note that
strengthening relations between China and South Pacific nations is
in the mutual interests of all sides and highly beneficial for
promoting regional stability and development.
</P>
<P>
China has maintained good momentum in its relations with
Australia and New Zealand, the two largest countries in the South
Pacific.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province, a backward
economy in southwest China, is creative in aiding its impoverished
regions by giving automobiles a new life.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, 235 second-hand taxis and shuttle buses have been
overhauled by the provincial public transport society and handed
over to impoverished prefectures free or at a price of 3,000-4,000
yuan (361-481 U.S. dollars). An additional 600 automobiles
reportedly will be recycled in the same way by June.
</P>
<P>
Headed by the the construction department of the province two
years ago, the plot now has been consummated with a complete
managing system. No accident due to quality problems has been
reported on these vehicles.
</P>
<P>
With the province's assistance, eight counties where no public
traffic existed now have their own traffic companies.
</P>
<P>
Kaili City, located in a mountainous area and whose bus firm
had been on the verge of bankruptcy, also received 67
automobiles. Its fare income for this year has reached 2.8 million
yuan (337,000 U.S. dollars), compared with 800,000 yuan (96,000
U.S. dollars) two years ago.
</P>
<P>
Auto maintenance and infrastructure building in these areas
have been boosted along with the improvement of traffic
conditions. Carts, rickshaws and unqualified motorcycles and
diesel-driven three-wheeled cars are being removed from the
streets.
</P>
<P>
Vehicle transfers has also quickened the step of automobiles
renewal in large cities. Guiyang, capital of the province, has

<HEADLINE> Profile: Rafiq Tarar, Hot Favorite for Pakistan's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Senator Rafiq Tarar,
presidential nominee of the ruling Pakistan Muslim League (N)
(PML-N), is tipped as a hot favorite for the presidency in
Wednesday's election.
</P>
<P>
Given the overwhelming parliamentary strength of the PML-N, the
68-year-old Rafiq is almost certain to win the presidential
election.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq's nomination as presidential candidate by the PML-N and
its allied parties, which hold a two-thirds majority in the
217-member National Assembly, had come as a surprise to all, as
his name was not among those who were expected to occupy the
presidential office.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's presidential polls are taking place as a result of
the resignation of President Farooq Leghari early this month at
the climax of a worst-ever constitutional crisis involving the
government and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission, whosoever secures 51
percent of the 476 electoral college votes, or at least 239 votes,
will be declared next president of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
A former judge of the Supreme Court, Rafiq, who hails from a
relatively humble origin, is noted for his legal scholarship,
honesty and devotion to justice.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq, who was born on November 2, 1929, got his law degree
from Punjab University Law College in 1951 and then started his
legal practice.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, he was elevated to the High Court of Lahore, capital
of Punjab province, and served as a member of the Election
Commission of Pakistan from 1980. He was appointed Chief Justice
of the Lahore High Court on December 13, 1989.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq was elevated to the Supreme Court in January 1991, and
was a member of the 11-person bench which restored the first
government led by Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif in May 1993.
</P>
<P>
He retired in October 1994 and was elected a senator on a
ticket of Pakistan Muslim League (N) in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The nomination papers of Rafiq were first rejected by the
Election Commission for his alleged remarks ridiculing the
judiciary.
</P>
<P>
However, he has his name cleared from the Lahore High Court
which Tuesday allowed him to contest the presidential election. If
he makes it, he will be the first former judge to become the head
of state of Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> A Brief History of Pakistan's Presidential Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is holding
presidential election Wednesday to elect the country's ninth
president since its independence in 1947.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing presidential election is being held after
resignation from the presidency by Farooq Leghari on December 2 at
the peak of a worst-ever constitutional crisis in this South Asian
nation.
</P>
<P>
Under Pakistan's Constitution, the president is not only the
head of state but also represents the unity of the Islamic
Republic.
</P>
<P>
It is constitutionally stipulated that any Muslim Pakistani
citizen enrolled as a voter, not less than 45 years of age and
qualified to be elected as Member of the National Assembly, can
become president.
</P>
<P>
The first election to the office of president was conducted by
the Speaker, Constituent Assembly, under the 1956 Constitution.
Iskander Mirza, being the only candidate for this election, was
declared elected unopposed.
</P>
<P>
The poll for the second election to the office of president was
held on January 2, 1965 under the 1962 Constitution. Field Marshal
Muhammad Ayub Khan was declared elected as president.
</P>
<P>
After the promulgation of the 1973 Constitution, the first
election to the office of president was held on August 10, 1973.
This presidential race was won by Fazal Elahi of the Pakistan
People's Party against the opposition's joint candidate Amirzada
Khan.
</P>
<P>
As a consequence of referendum held on December 19, 1984,
General Zia-ul Haq was elected president of Pakistan. After his
death on August 17, 1988, then Chairman of the Senate Ghulam Ishaq
Khan took over as acting president, who was elected to the office
of president on December 12, 1988.
</P>
<P>
The political instability and crisis that engulfed Pakistan
from February/March 1993 due to strained relations between the
president and the prime minister finally resulted in the
dissolution of the National Assembly on April 18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
However, the Supreme Court set aside the order of dissolution
of the National Assembly and restored it on May 26, 1993. The
political situation thereafter further aggravated and, ultimately
on the advice of the prime minister, the National Assembly was
again dissolved on July 18, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The second dissolution of the National Assembly in 1993 was
followed by the resignation of President Ghulam Ishaq Khan on July
18 the same year.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the Senate Wasim Sajjad then became acting
president until Farooq Leghari was elected to the office of
President in November 11, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Farooq Leghari tendered his resignation from the presidency on
December 2, 1997 after the four-month-long nerve-wracking tussle
between the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and the
judiciary led by then Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah reached its
climax.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Collect Data on Opium Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar will launch a
nation-wide campaign to collect baseline data on opium cultivation
and drug addicts beginning January 1, 1998, a senior Myanmar
official told a press briefing here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The three-month campaign will be carried out with mobilization
of the entire population in Myanmar including ethnic minorities to
correctly assess the opium yield and addicts in the country, said
Colonel Kyaw Thein, head of the Office of Strategic Studies of the
Myanmar Defense Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A wide gap exists in the forecasts on the hectarage and
production of opium made by Myanmar and the United States, he
pointed out, arguing that Myanmar's opium cultivation data are
based on actual ground survey and calculation, while the U.S. data
are based on satellite images.
</P>
<P>
The national-level statistical data compilation is initiated
following a recent reformation of the country's Central Committee
for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), he added.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that the Myanmar authorities destroyed 33
opium refineries in Shan state of the country in 1997, seizing a
total of 9,800 kg narcotic drugs, including 1,396 kg heroin and
7,651 kg opium in the country in the year.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- At least 150 police
officers were killed on duty in the United States this year, up 27
percent from last year, the National Association of Chiefs of
Police said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Association officials said California had the highest number of
deaths, with 18 reported so far, followed by Texas with 10.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the death toll was uncharacteristically low and this
year's figure is similar to the years before.
</P>
<P>
"What we are seeing is a return to typically tragic levels of
officer deaths, consistent with what we've seen throughout this
decade," said Morton Feldman, executive vice president of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
Between 1990 and 1996, 1,111 U.S. officers lost their lives
while on duty, or an average of 159 annually.
</P>
<P>
"Regrettably, the 1996 figure apparently was nothing more than
a statistical anomaly and not an indicator that officer deaths are
following the general U.S. trend toward decreasing violent crime,"
Feldman said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin on Russia's Major Achievements in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said here Tuesday that Russia has scored a number of major
successes in 1997 in the economic, political and diplomatic fields.
</P>
<P>
In a year-end interview with major Russian press organizations
in Moscow, Yeltsin said that after years of decline, Russia's
economy had stabilized and even registered a growth in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic growth, though limited but statistically
significant, signaled a recovery of the Russian economy, he noted.
</P>
<P>
It was encouraging that the number of districts which witnessed
industrial output growth had risen to 30 in 1997 from four in
1996, he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Russian president stressed the need to continue
developing national economy instead of resting on the laurels of
achieved successes.
</P>
<P>
On the political situation, Yeltsin said there emerged a
momentum of national harmony and reconciliation in Russia in
1997. Relations among government organs at different levels have
greatly improved.
</P>
<P>
He called on local governments to strengthen regular and
constructive dialogues and to wipe out the legacy of confrontation
left over by history.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Russia's diplomatic achievements in 1997, Yeltsin
cited the establishment of the Russia-Belarus alliance, the
improvement of Russia-Ukraine ties, the entry of Russia into a
number of international organizations, the consolidation of
Russia's equal partnership with the United States and other
developed countries, as well as the improved ties between Russia
and Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
Particularly citing the progress made in the development of
Russia-China ties, Yeltsin said the settlement of nearly all the
border issues between Russia and China is significant not only for
the two countries, but also for Asia as a whole.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president admitted that although Russia has made
progress in many fields in 1997, there was still much room for
improvement.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that the Russian government will concentrate its
efforts on revitalizing the economy in 1998 and work out new plans
in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Presidential Election Starts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A secret ballot poll to
elect the ninth president of Pakistan started Wednesday at 10.00
a.m.
</P>
<P>
The election, which is to conclude till 3 p.m., is also being
held simultaneously in the four Provincial Assemblies of Punjab,
Sindh, Balochistan and North West Frontier provinces.
</P>
<P>
According to the Election Commission, the total electoral
college votes are 476, including 87 Senators, 217 members of the
National Assembly and 43 votes of each of the four provincial
assemblies. A candidate must poll at least 51 percent of the total
or 239 votes to win.
</P>
<P>
The contestant to emerge successful in the elections is likely
to be sworn in as Pakistan's next president soon after the
announcement of the results, the Election Commission said, adding
the counting of the votes will start right after the close of the
polling.
</P>
<P>
In all, seven candidates are in the run for the presidential
race, with the government fielding Rafiq Tarar, the opposition
represented by Aftab Shaaban Mirani from the Pakistan People's
Party, Maulana Shirani from Jamiat-e-Ulema and Zafarullah Jamali
contesting as an independent.
</P>
<P>
Rafiq, the official nominee of the ruling Pakistan Muslim
League (Nawaz) (PML-N), appears to be the most possible winner as
the PML-N and its allied parties enjoy a favorable two thirds
majority in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's elections were required as President Farooq Leghari
resigned on December 2 when a worst ever constitutional crisis
involving the government and the judiciary reached its climax.
Leghari had refused to sign a reference against Chief Justice
Sajjad Ali Shah at that time as required by the government led by
Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
</P>
<P>
Under Pakistan's constitution, a new president has to be
elected in 30 days starting from the president-in-power's

<HEADLINE> Thai Economy May See Zero Growth in 1997: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to record
zero economic growth for 1997 and the prospects for recovery next
year are uncertain, according to a year-end report of the Bank of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
All the key economic indicators showed signs of slowdown since
the beginning of 1997 as a result of the financial crisis,
according to the report available Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In the first 10 months of the year, the industrial production
index expanded only 1.6 percent, and private investment grew only
0.2 percent, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In the 10-month period, exports growth reached 3.7 percent in
U.S. dollar terms, or 20.7 percent in baht terms.
</P>
<P>
The current account will post a deficit of 3 percent of the
gross domestic product (GDP) this year, totaling about 85 billion
baht (1.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The economic slowdown has reduced Thais' purchasing power. In
the period under review, retail sales at department stores plunged
4.7 percent, while automobile sales plummeted by 15.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
As to the prospects for 1998, the central bank was not certain
as to when the economy will bottom out. A recovery will depend on
the speed with which the financial institutions are tackled, said
Kleo-thong Hetrakul, director of the central bank's Economic
Research Department.
</P>
<P>
"If the policy framework is implemented successfully,
confidence will quickly return," The Nation Wednesday quotes
Kleo-thong as saying.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Residents Care for Air Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Air quality is the first
consideration for more and more residents in Shanghai when they
purchase houses.
</P>
<P>
"Many residents inquire about the air pollution index in
the area where they plans to buy houses," said Liu Hong, an
official with the Municipal Environmental Monitoring Center.
</P>
<P>
She added that she receives an average of 80 phones a
day.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has been issuing weekly reports on air quality since
June 5, and many have since begun to care for the urban air
condition as much as the weather.
</P>
<P>
"Many complained for the serious air pollution in the areas
they live. They write to us and ask the government to take
steps," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The city has witnessed a "warm winter" this year. The slow wind
speed has led to the increase of the air pollution index.
"Residents care very much for this and ask us to show their
concern for the deterioration of the air quality," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
"Although the air-quality report brings pressure to us, it
enhances the city's efforts for pollution control," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
The city has banned the sale of lead gasoline since December 1,
and it plans to transform its 400,000 taxis and a number of the
buses into liquefied natural gas automobiles in five years, in a
bid to improve the city's air quality.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Needs More Loans: Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Thailand will need at least
another 8 billion U.S. dollars in fresh loans next year to bolster
its foreign exchange reserves and help stabilize the sagging Thai
baht, according to The Nation newspaper Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The suggestion, made by Chalongphob Sussangkarn, president of
the Thailand Development Research Institute, reflects a growing
school of opinion at home and abroad that the 17.2 billion dollar
bailout package arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
is far from adequate to tackle the country's financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Chalongphob said the central bank's foreign exchange reserves
have been reducing significantly in spite of the IMF's package
because foreign investors are selling off the baht for the U.S.
dollar for fear the reserves will not be enough to meet the
country's huge debt obligations.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's private debts have reached 70 billion dollars, about
half of which are believed to have short-term maturity.
</P>
<P>
Chalongphob said the baht will continue to come under pressure
next year because investors believe short-term debts will continue
to rise.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that once the reserves of the central
bank have strengthened, confidence will return to the Thai
economy.
</P>
<P>
He also believes that an 8 billion additional credit will help
prop up the baht from 47 to 42 against the U.S. dollar next year.

COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga Tuesday asked the southern youth not to be misled by
the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), an organization that had
staged an armed rebellion in 1971 to capture power, news reaching
here said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The president made the call while attending a rally in the
southern city of Galle.
</P>
<P>
She noted the JVP, also called the People's Revolutionary
Front, seemed to be raising its head again.
</P>
<P>
In the 1971 youth rebellion, the JVP held several areas of the
country for almost one month and in 1988 they shocked the nation
again by assassinating several VIPs.
</P>
<P>
The movement met a major setback when all key leaders but one
were arrested and killed in 1989 by the then government under the
United National Party. But it regained its momentum in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
Kumaratunga also said at the rally that the constitutional
reforms of her government was the only solution to the present
crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
An ethnic war has been going on for 14 years in the north and
east of the country between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam

MANILA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The prolonged financial crisis
in the Philippines continued to take toll on small companies, with
six more companies seeking debt relief, local press reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
This brought to 21 the total number of firms that crumbled
under the weight of bad loans and sought the permission of the
Securities and Exchange Commission to suspend debt payments, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that this could also well serve as a warning signal
that corporate failures are "imminent" next year while the
depreciation of peso has triggered high interest rates.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson practically conceded
defeat in his efforts to lower interest rates and keep a healthy
peso-dollar exchange rate on December 29, the last working day in
1997.

Since July, the Philippine peso has fallen by 52 percent from
26.4 pesos to a dollar to the Dec. 29 level of 40.116 pesos per

</P>

Due to higher interest rates caused by the currency turmoil,

NEW DELHI, December 31 (Xinhua)-- The Indian government will
take measures to tighten indigenization norms for the car
manufacturing sector in the country, Commerce Ministry sources
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Ministry is expected to issue a detailed

its product in writing.
</P>
<P>
This declaration will then be taken into account to calculate
the net import content of the specific car project.
</P>
<P>
The government will take into account the import content of
each auto-ancillary vendor of a car company in order to calculate
the indigenization level for the entire car project.
</P>
<P>
At present, the vendor's import content is not taken into
consideration while calculating the net indigenization on the
engine.
Under the proposed norms, the vendor's import content will be
taken into account.
</P>
<P>
By using this method, the government hopes to plug a loophole
which car companies can use to show high indigenization levels by
outsourcing from domestic auto vendors, which in turn import from
overseas.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Predicts Paltry Growth in Tourist Arrivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign tourist
arrivals are expected to increase by 0.6 percent in 1997 to 5.06
million, the lowest growth in a decade due to the country's haze
problem and a regional monetary crisis, a senior official said.
</P>
<P>
"The country's tourism is suffering. This is not a laughing
matter. This is very serious," Minister of Tourism, Post and
Telecommunications Joop Ave told the local press Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia originally expected to see between 5.3 million and
5.7 million foreign tourist arrivals this year, or between 5
percent and 13 percent more over last year's level.
</P>
<P>
Revenue generated from foreign tourists was initially estimated
to total between 6.64 billion and 7.14 billion U.S. dollars in
1997, up between 5 percent and 13 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 5.03 million foreign tourists visited Indonesia,
spending 6.3 billion dollars. Last year's growth rate was 16.42
percent in arrivals and 20.64 percent in expenditures over 1995's
figures.
</P>
<P>
"We have never experienced anything like this," Joop was quoted
as saying by local press reports.
</P>
<P>
The current monetary turmoil, which has hit several Asian
countries, is believed to be the most influential factor behind
the fall in foreign tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
Many overseas tourists have also been turned off by the smog of
forest fires in Indonesia. Thick haze which blanketed most part of
Sumatra and Kalimantan for several months significantly reduced
tourist arrivals this year.
</P>
<P>
The country expects tourism to become the biggest foreign
exchange earner by the end of the seventh five-year development
plant in 2004.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, annual growth in tourist arrivals has
averaged more than 20 percent, while growth in revenue generated
by foreign tourists has averaged more than 27 percent annually.

<HEADLINE> Castro Urges Cubans to Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuban President Fidel Castro
Monday called on his countrymen to participate in the legislative
election to be held on January 11.
</P>
<P>
He told Communist Party members and government representatives
in Havana that each citizen should be convinced that the vote is
the best guardian of the revolution.
</P>
<P>
Castro underlined unity as the best way for Cuba to defend
socialism and prevent disasters that happened in some former
socialist countries.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Cuba's electoral system was "the most
democratic one in the world", saying half the National Assembly
(Congress) deputies were ordinary citizens with no official posts.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the 601 candidates running the elections will
not spend a single penny in their campaigns, nor will they use
propaganda to get elected.
</P>
<P>
The candidates are nominated by Mass Organizations and from
delegates elected by municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
Castro attaches great importance to the forthcoming election as
it comes after a five-year "special period" program, during which
the island experienced the most difficult time because of the
collapse of the Eastern bloc.

<HEADLINE> China Able to Design Nuclear Power Plants with Pressurized Water Reactors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- China is now able to
independently design nuclear power plants with pressurized water
reactors.
</P>
<P>
This marks the improvement in China's self-designing capability
of nuclear power plants, said Chinese experts at a working
conference held here recently by the China Nuclear Power Institute.
</P>
<P>
They said that China expects to use nuclear power plants that
are designed, manufactured, built and operated by the Chinese
themselves.
</P>
<P>
China built the 300,000-kw Qishan Nuclear Power Plant with
pressurized water reactors in 1991, the first of its kind in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Around the turn of the century, China will complete building
the second and third phases at Qinshan and the Lianyungang Nuclear
Power Plant in east China's Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The eight generating units needed at Qinshan and Lianyungang
will have a generating capacity of 600,000 to 900,000 kw each and
they will be built at home, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
China has acquired the tehnology to design and produce some 400
softwares of pressurized water reactors.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China is also working on perfecting the standards
for nuclear power plants.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Laments Sixth Abortive World Cup Attempt (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese soccer fans have
been tantalized to the worst as their footballers played their
best in an abortive sixth straight attempt towards the World Cup
finals in the past year full of sorrows and sadness.
</P>
<P>
After squeezing into the top 10 in Asia, China was nevertheless
kept away from booking any of the three or four Asian tickets
allocated by FIFA for the quadrennial soccer summit.
</P>
<P>
Being an overall sports power in Asia, China was still on the
way to make its footsteps in the men's soccer world as its
footballers have a lonely silver to their credit from the Asian
Games in Hiroshima in 1994.
</P>
<P>
In the Asian qualifying tournament, China was lucky enough to
avoid its neighboring chief rivals of South Korea and Japan after
being pitched in Group A, together with four West Asian nations of
Iran, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese squad, under the orchestration of a dozen
of coaches and advisors, was plummeted to the mud with 11 points
from three wins, two draws and three loses after a morale-boosting
warm-up voyage of three wins and one draw in England.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the final clashes in the Asian qualifying tournament,
the Chinese players and even their coaches nourished a dream of
making the debut in the World Cup finals as they boasted of the
players' speed which saw a tough quarterfinal loss 4-3 against
eventual winners of Saudi Arabia in the Asian Cup last December,
and a deserved draw with Iran in a warm-up.
</P>
<P>
Yet, their cautious and optimistic spirits were blown away as
the Chinese eleven were thrashed 3-8 on aggregate by runners-up
Iran, and even sunk 3-4 by the group tailers Qatar despite their
overall win of 2-1 against group leaders Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"Our players, for the most of the time, were at loss on the
pitch because no specific tactics were fixed for the squad and the
players ran to and from at large which resulted in many a unmarked
spots in the back court," said former head coach of the national
squad Nian Weisi in a column in the local media.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Soccer Laments Sixth Abortive World Cup Attempt (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese footballers were teased to the most when they lost
the opener 4-2 from a comfortable 2-0 advantage. After a lukewarm
1-1 tie in Doha with Qatar, the Chinese scored only seven points
against Iran's 12 and Saudi's nine.
</P>
<P>
With three games remained, China theoretically still had the
chance for the top spot in the Group after Saudi Arabia was held a
goalless draw by Kuwait, and at least could settle for a runner-up
playoff with two wins and a draw on goal differentials.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the worse moment came when the Chinese saw their hopes
evaporated when the Chinese squad squandered its earlier lead on
home turf as the Qatars scored three goals in 15 minutes for a 3-2
away win.
</P>
<P>
Chinese head coach Qi Wusheng, who was booed by the agitated
fans, fielded off the questions saying that "my players were not
quick enough for the control in the midfield. We failed in our
counter attacks and lost our composure."
</P>
<P>
After the defeat, the Chinese side was virtually out of the
contention for its outing for the World Cup finals.
</P>
<P>
Peter Vellapan, general secretary of the Asian Football
Association, commented later that "they (the Chinese footballers)
are not as enterprising as pro players in German League. They
played the first halves of the most games with consistency and
strength. But in the second half, you might think you were
watching an amateur team instead of a national squad."
</P>
<P>
Back to home, the Chinese clubs were seemingly full of energy
and geniuses as Dalian Wanda, triple winner of China's soccer
league, secured its third national title in advance with five
rounds remained and even attained an unpredecented feat of 55
straight wins.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, who had its winning streak snapped by runner-up Shanghai
Shenhua in the last round of the league, also moved into the
quarter-finals of the Asian Champions Tournament after trouncing
Na Huan of Hong Kong, China, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
League third-placer Beijing Guo'an also made its quarter-final
debut in the Asian Cup Winners' Cup, eliminating the Japanese Cup
winners Verdy Kawasaki 3-0 on aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Guo'an, who humiliated Shanghai Shenhua 9-1 in a July league
match, then became the first club to retain the Chinese Football
Association Cup title by defeating Shenhua 2-1 on December 28.
</P>
<P>
It goes without saying that the victories of the clubs only
reflect the immaturity and lack of competitiveness of the Chinese
footballers who again pin their hopes upon the 2002 World Cup
finals and even later.

<HEADLINE> Migrants Come to Spend Winter in Shanghai Safari </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- With winter gradually taking
over the northern hemisphere, thousands of migrants have found a
haven from the winter chill in Shanghai Safari.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of October, more than 1,000 black-crowned
night-herons and hundreds of mallards and other wild ducks have
come to live in the safari, said Zhang Cizu, deputy general
manager of the safari.
</P>
<P>
Being wading and natatorial birds, the herons and wild ducks
live in or beside the water. Some even brave the reed marshes in
the living quarters of tigers and cheetahs, and the birds and
their feline neighbors are so models of good neighborliness by
keeping a peaceful co-existence with each other.
</P>
<P>
The migrants usually find their own foods, and they have
another food source in the abundant feeds provided for resident
birds.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the abundant food and favorable environment, explain
a safari worker, the herons and wild ducks have come here also to
hide from attacks from humans outside.
</P>
<P>
It is recorded that only a dozen black-headed night-herons came
to spend the winter in the Shanghai Safari when it was open to
public in 1995. Last winter, about a hundred herons visited, and
the heron population soared to more than 1,000 this winter.
</P>
<P>
The migrants will fly back to the north in March and April next
year.

<HEADLINE> Economy in Southwest China Catching Up With National Average </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou, an impoverished
province in southwest China, has caught up with the national
average in economic growth, according to a high provincial
official.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product (GDP) this year is expected to
increase 9 percent over last year and inflation should be less
than 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
This would be the first time the backward province has kept
pace with the national economy, said Liu Fangren, secretary of the
Guizhou Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, Guizhou will reach a total revenue of 10
billion yuan (1.2 billion US dollars) this year, up 14 percent
over 1996, an all-time record in the sector.
</P>
<P>
Local statistics show that the industrial output this year will
increase by 14.8 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Grain output was 10.26 million tons this year, a 2.3 percent
increase over 1996. Meanwhile, the output of flue-cured tobacco,
rapeseed and meat is also on the rise.
</P>
<P>
The sales of township-run enterprises in the province have
risen by 31 percent, compared to 1996, according to the statistics.
</P>
<P>
With the aim of shaking off poverty and embarking on the road
of economic sustainable development, the provincial government has
attached importance to agriculture and infrastructure
construction, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
A new, modern airport has been built in Guiyang, the provincial
capital, and a 155.3-km highway connects Guiyang and Zunyi.
</P>
<P>
The province's export-oriented economy has made great progress
with improvements made in the basic facilities, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has utilized 138 million
U.S. dollars of overseas funds this year, a 30 percent increase
over 1996, and exports have grown by 10 percent.

<HEADLINE> North China's Laid-offs Doing As Well In Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- An increasing number of
laid-off workers in money-losing state enterprises turn to private
businesses, and the fact is that many of them are just doing as
well.
</P>
<P>
One example is Han Kuiju in the capital city of Shijiazhuang,
Hebei Province. The 41-year-old ex-serviceman lost his job early
in 1988. But now he runs a garage, with 30 laid-offs working for
him.
</P>
<P>
A technician in a state enterprise, Han felt ill at ease doing
private business at the beginning. He tried to look for another
post in state institutions or enterprises, but in vain. This
forced him to make a career independently.
</P>
<P>
So he borrowed some money from friends and relatives and
started a garage to repair imported cars, which he found began to
flood into the country. He hired some skilled mechanics and
purchased advanced equipment for his garage.
</P>
<P>
Accurate market information and good service have brought him
more and more business, and profits as well. Now the garage has
grown into a vehicle maintenance center, graded as second-class by
local department of communications.
</P>
<P>
Hu Ruixiang of Baoding city is another example. Crowding
parents at primary schools' gates reminded Hu of setting up a
fetch-and-send team to take over the responsibility. So he did,
and employed more than 20 other laid-off workers to do the job,
making good money.
</P>
<P>
More than 130,000 laid-offs in Hebei Province have entered the
private sector, and governments and departments concerned have
adopted some favorable policies to promote the effort, according
to the provincial Administration Bureau for Industry and
Commerce.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Court Postpones Liquidation of Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The Jakarta State
Administrative Court Tuesday overturned decrees of the Finance
Ministry and Bank Indonesia (the central bank) to close Bank
Jakarta, and allowed the bank to remain open pending a final court
verdict on its closure.
</P>
<P>
"The ministerial decree and the central bank governor decree
have been postponed," local press reports Wednesday quoted Jakarta
State Administrative Court Chief Justice Lintong Oloan Siahaan as
saying in his preliminary verdict in the bank's case against
Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad and Bank Indonesia Governor
Soedrajad Djiwandono.
</P>
<P>
Bank Jakarta, owned by President Soeharto's half-brother
Probosutedjo, was one of 16 private banks liquidated by the
government on November 1 in a move to make the banking sector more
healthy.
</P>
<P>
The liquidation of 16 insolvent banks was part of reforms
ordered to comply with a 23 billion U.S. dollar aid package set up
by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail out Indonesia's
ailing economy.
</P>
<P>
Bank Jakarta filed a suit contesting the rulings at the state
administrative court on November 7. Probosutedjo contended that
the decision to close his bank was unfair. His lawyer Muhammad
Yusuf said Tuesday's ruling means Bank Jakarta could "reopen its
activities right now" until a permanent decision on the suit.
</P>
<P>
However, the government lawyers did not say whether they would
appeal, but lawyer Luhut M.P. Pangaribuan said the team would file
a letter of objection to the court. He said the liquidation had
been conducted as part of the country's economic reform needed to
cope with the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Siahaan said the court ruling was only temporary and would
remain valid until the court decides whether or not to proceed
with the case. The next hearing was scheduled for January 8, 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The once harsh and adverse
conditions of Yulin Prefecture in northwestern Shaanxi Province
have been conquered and the prefecture turned into a grain base.
</P>
<P>
Major Chinese newspapers have run front-page stories about the
success of water and soil conservation, ecological farming and
tree-planting in the northern part of the province.
</P>
<P>
Yulin is located between the Muus Desert and the Loess Plateau,
a transit area where there was little vegetation. Local villages
and farmers were threatened by shifting sands.
</P>
<P>
The vegetation coverage in Yulin area has been raised from 1.8
percent in the early 1950s to 38.9 percent this year, and the
shifting sand dunes have diminished sharply.
</P>
<P>
The sandy Yulin Prefecture has been able to convert 400,000
hectares of the 533,000 hectare sandy area into high-yield
farmland which now produces 15,000 kg of grain per-hectare.
</P>
<P>
Governor Cheng Andong of Shaanxi Province said: "Although the
environment in the northwest is vulnerable, we are confident that
it will be improved greatly in the near future."
</P>
<P>
Sources show that one-ninth of China's domain is desert, mainly
in northwestern areas. Thousands of hectares of farmland are
endangered annually by the deserts.

HONG KONG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The establishment of
diplomatic relations between China and South Africa is of
importance and benefit to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (HKSAR), a Chinese diplomat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
China and South Africa sealed diplomatic ties Tuesday when
foreign ministers of the two countries singed a joint communique
in Pretoria, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Wu Hongbo, spokesman of the Commissioner's Office of the
Chinese Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong, told Xinhua Wednesday that
as agreed upon between the two governments, South Africa can
maintain its consulate general in the HKSAR starting from January
1, 1998.
</P>
<P>
He added that the central government has authorized the HKSAR
to negotiate with South Africa on a civil aviation agreement to
replace the current temporary arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that after China and South Africa forged diplomatic
ties, the HKSAR and South Africa will further their cooperation in
the economic, trade, shipping and tourism fields. There are broad
prospects for friendly cooperation in the future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wu also said that the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries is of great importance, and the
traditional friendship between the two peoples will develop on a

forecast by November just 200 million dollars, almost the same
as 1996.
</P>
<P>
It is said that the rise was due to the approval of a U.S.
migratory law that legalized the stay of 250,000 Nicaraguans in
that country, so that they can send more money home.

<P>
COLOMBO, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A bomb disposal unit of the
Sri Lankan Army Tuesday defused a parcel bomb sent to a police
officer who arrested nine Tamil rebel suspects involved in
Sunday's truck-bomb explosion in the southern city of Galle.
</P>
<P>
The bomb was defused at the Kalavanchikudi Post Office in Galle
Tuesday morning and nobody was hurt.
</P>
<P>
The parcel had been addressed to police officer L.G. Gunaratne,
who was responsible for the arrest of the suspects.
</P>
<P>
The 40kg parcel aroused suspicion when it was received at the
post office. The postmaster informed police of the suspicious
parcel, which later was found to be a bomb.
</P>
<P>
The truck-bomb exploded at around 02:30 Sunday morning 200

<HEADLINE> Secluded Islands Offer Safe Habitat for Birds in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Seventeen secluded bird islands,
mostly located in the middle of lakes, have been found in the
Tibet Autonomous Region, and they have become the safe habitat or
virtually "heaven" of the birds.
</P>
<P>
Through a six-year survey, Chinese experts found that Tibet has
more birds islands than previously thought. Most of the 17 bird
islands, each with an area of one hectare, are scattered far and
wide on the lakes at 4,200-5,000 meters high above sea level,
according to Liu Wulin, a wild-animal expert.
</P>
<P>
Tibet boasts most of the lakes in China, with 612 of one square
meter or larger.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the bird islands are dotted in the lakes of the
northern and southern Tibet Plateau, because the environment there
is very monotonous," Liu said, "therefore the birds have to go to
the islands to seek both shelter and food."
</P>
<P>
Thousands of birds dwell on the islands, including rare species
such as brown-headed sea gulls. Liu said there is an average of
one or two rare birds, or 10 sea gulls, for every square meter of
island. The birds substitute mainly on fish in the lakes.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that these islands are untraversed regions where
land foes are kept off and there is sufficient fish for the birds
to live on.
</P>
<P>
Because of the vast lake area in Tibet, Liu noted, many such
islands have not been discovered and more bird finds are possible.
</P>
<P>
"It is of vital importance to protect these islands and do more
in-depth research," one expert said.

<P>
YANGON, December 31 (Xinhua) - Myanmar leader Lieutenant
General Tin Oo has urged local entrepreneurs to boost production
of import substitutes and promote exports.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with members of the Myanmar Chamber of Commerce

reliance on imported goods in the country's consumption and
production sectors, the official newspaper The New Light of
Myanmar reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
He said the private sector involvement increased to about 76
percent in the gross domestic product due to the greater role of
the market economic system, citing the ever increasing ratio of
the private sector in production, services and trade.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Chamber of Commerce and Industry to serve as a
 bridge between the government and merchants and entrepreneurs and
to strengthen the economic relations between the foreign
organizations and domestic ones.

<HEADLINE> Italy Seeks Control on Kurdish Inflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 30 (Xinhua)-- Italy is negotiating with Turkey
and other European Union member states to seek effective measures
to control the inflow of Kurdish refugees into Italy, Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
After meeting with Interior Minister Giorgio Napolitano at the
Lower House, Dini said he is confident Turkey will be cooperative
over a problem which not only involves Italy, but also "all
Europe", the Italian news agency Ansa reported.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of Kurdish immigrants disembarked in Italy illegally a
few days ago, and many thousands more are reportedly waiting to
come. They were driven from home by Turkish army campaigns against
Kurdish separatists and other local conflicts in southeastern
Turkey and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are seeking to reach families or friends
in countries with large Kurdish communities such as Germany,
France, the Netherlands and Sweden, and only see Italy as a
transfer station. Very few of them seek political asylum or
refugee status in Italy.
</P>
<P>
"It is difficult for these people to be considered exiles or
political refugees because they don't declare themselves to be
such when they arrive in Italy," Dini said. He was also reacting
to some calls from government officials for them to be granted
refugee status.
</P>
<P>
Dini pointed out that the Kurds' arrival was often financed by
Kurds already resident in Europe.
</P>
<P>
The journey might cost as much as 7,000 dollars per person,
making it a highly profitable trade in which mafia in Italy,
Turkey, Albania and other countries are said to be involved.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Village Leaders Given Chance to Go to College </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 31 (Xinhua) -- "I can't believe I can go
to college; it's like a dream coming true," said Ma Lianglu, a
44-year-old village head in Youyilu Village in north China's Hebei
Province.
</P>
<P>
Ma is just one of 121 village heads who went to Hebei
Agriculture University to receive 1 1/2 years of college education
there. The village leaders are expected to take such courses as
law, economics, policy, agricultural technology and public
relations.
</P>
<P>
"For me, a diploma isn't important," Ma said. "I was worried a
little bit, before I came, whether what is taught here could help
my work; now I just feel it is very useful."
</P>
<P>
Several years ago his village was involved in a lasting lawsuit
and eventually lost because of dubious clauses in the signed
contract and a lack of legal knowledge. Ma learned a painful
lesson.
</P>
<P>
The law course Ma and fellow village leaders are taking will
make them better able to protect their villages' interests, an
official from the local organization department said.
</P>
<P>
The 121 village heads from 23 counties of Baoding city in the
province will go back to their posts after graduation.
</P>
<P>
They are expected to help raise the knowledge standard of the
whole village, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Baoding has drafted a three-year plan to educate the village
heads. By 1999, the people who have received college and
polytechnic school education will constitute 20 percent of all the
village leaders, a sharp increase over the present 1-to-2
percent.

<HEADLINE> Radar Control System Operational at Beijing Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- A radar air-traffic control
system went into service Tuesday at the Capital Airport of
Beijing, "China Daily" reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The state-of-the-art air-traffic control system, installed
initially in Beijing's Capital Airport as a replacement for the
out-of-date procedure-based system, indicates that China has taken
a major step towards keeping abreast with advanced technology in
the world's civil aviation sector," air traffic control officials
were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The system for the air terminal is expected to substantially
reduce time for take-offs and landings, improve the flight
punctuality rate and make better use of air space, said the
officials at yesterday's inauguration.
</P>
<P>
Advanced radar and accessories worth nearly 200 million yuan
(24.1 million US dollars) were imported from Italy, Norway and the
United States for installation at the Capital Airport, considered
as country's busiest airport.
</P>
<P>
Traffic at Capital Airport has been expanding by 12 percent a
year, according to bureau statistics. Aircraft arrivals and
departures are expected to exceed 140,000 in 1997, with a record
daily peak of 481 on September 1.
</P>
<P>
Procedure-based control or control with radar guidance has been
used for decades to supervise flights, mainly on the basis of
reports from air-traffic controllers.
</P>
<P>
The system has been criticized for its low speed and
inaccuracy. Statistics indicates that cases of delayed flights
because of backward air-traffic control conditions exceeded 2,000
last year.
</P>
<P>
"With radar-based control air traffic system, the number of
planes allowed to land at or leave the Capital Airport during a
specified time period will double," said air traffic control
officials.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that radar-based air-traffic control system are
expected to be established at Guangzhou Baiyun Airport and
Shanghai Hongqiao Airport by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Police Storm Bank and End Hostage Siege </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Italy's hostage crisis ended
Tuesday morning after special assault police stormed a Milan bank
held up by a gunman for more than 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
Italy's state television said two policemen were slightly
injured during the assault, while the gunman, Domenico Gargano,
was also hurt.
</P>
<P>
A 30-second television coverage showed that a trained guard dog
was unleashed and knocked Gargano down as he stepped outside the
bank.
</P>
<P>
Gargano opened fire as special agents jumped on and immobilized
him. Ricochets hurt two policemen and Gargano himself.
</P>
<P>
The three injured were taken to hospital after the operation,
the state television reported.
</P>
<P>
The crisis began when Sicilian-born Gargano, 35, pulled out a
gun and a hand grenade in the Banca Popolare di Milano branch,
Monday afternoon, apparently after being refused a loan of several
million lire.
</P>
<P>
He held four men in the bank as hostages and then released one
man to deliver his demand for 10 billion lire (5.7 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Early on Tuesday, police handed over four billion lire (2.3
million dollars) in return for the release of the bank's
manager. After further negotiations, two remaining hostages were
released in stages.
</P>
<P>
Gargano then demanded that police drive him to the city's main
square so that he could scatter the four billion lire to passers-by.
</P>
<P>
He planned to turn himself in at the court after scattering the
money, but police refused his demand and ended the crisis by the
raid.

<HEADLINE> Appliance Market Expects Steady Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- The domestic household
electrical appliance market will continue a steady growth next
year amid a deepened restructuring of supply and demand, according
to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the Internal Trade Ministry indicate that many
domestic brands, even famous ones, are facing a serious
over-supply problem.
</P>
<P>
Duing the second half of 1997, 55.3 percent of the 36 kinds of
household electrical appliances saw supplies exceed
demands. However, larger stockpiles do not discourage investment,
as showed by 1996's color TV market.
</P>
<P>
Urban residents will aim at high-grade new appliance to replace
their outdated ones, while rural demands include more varieties
expanding from TVs, freezers and washing machines to
air-conditioners, audio and video equipment.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that color TV sales will reach 16.4 million
sets in 1998, a five percent increase over this year, with
home-made TVs dominating the market.
</P>
<P>
About 7.2 million sets of refrigerators will be sold next year
with a seven percent hike in total sales. Well-known brands such
as Haier, Rongsheng and Xinfei will still be the top sellers.
</P>
<P>
Washing machines will have a similar sales growth of 9.3
percent to stand at 17.6 million next year. Air-conditioners, VCD
and personal computers will all witness a growth exceeding 20
percent in sales next year.
</P>
<P>
VCD sales will expand a stunning 29 percent. However, prices
will be cut facing the threat from DVD development.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, personal computers sales are expected to reach 2.5
million sets in 1998.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- East China's Jiangsu Province,
one of China's most developed areas, has scored overall growth in
foreign trade, overseas investment and technological cooperation
this year.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu, the third biggest foreign-trade base in China, handled
imports and exports of 20.2 billion U.S. dollars during the first
11 months of this year, a 21.93 percent rise over the same period
last year, with exports increasing 17.95 percent to nearly 13.96
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the provincial state-owned enterprises which are
authorized to directly handle foreign trade showed an increase of
19.61 percent during the same period, exceeding the provincial
average growth of foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
To attract more overseas funds, Jiangsu has invested more than
80 billion yuan (10 billion U.S. dollars) in the construction of
airports, highways and other basic facilities in the last five
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the province has approved 1,819 overseas

<HEADLINE> Shanghai to Encourage Development of Nongovernmental Economies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, December 31 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial center, will make greater efforts to develop
nongovernmental economies, including the private sector,
Vice-Mayor Chen Liangyu said at a meeting recently.
</P>
<P>
To become an international economic metropolis, Shanghai
needs an economic structure of multiform ownerships, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nongovernmental economies have come to account for 15 percent
of the city's industrial output value. In some suburban
counties, the private sector contributes one third of the
local revenues.
</P>
<P>
The city is leading China in developing foreign-funded
enterprises, which in 1996 provided one third of Shanghai's
exports and industrial and commercial taxes.
</P>
<P>
The nongovernmental sectors in the city have hired more than a
million people, alleviating the unemployment pressure, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai will encourage nongovernmental economies to develop
high-tech industries and participate in the reform of state-run
enterprises in a bid to better use the huge amount of idle fixed
assets of the state-owned enterprises, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The city government will incorporate nongovernmental economies
into the outline of local economic and social development and
treat them as the state-owned sector, he noted.

<HEADLINE> "Amphibious Farmers" Emerging in East China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, December 31 (Xinhua) -- More and more farmers in east
China have turned to aquatic breeding and pelagic fishing while still
staying on farming, and they are called "amphibious farmers" as a
result.
</P>
<P>
In Ganyu County in Jiangsu Province, for example, some 8,000
farmers have started the new business, as little farmland gives
them meagre income. A common approach in this regard is that the
farmers join local fishermen to shoulder risk and share profits.
</P>
<P>
In Liuxiang Town alone, some 3,000 farmers have bought shares
for purchasing large fishing boats with local fishermen. Another
2,000 farmers go fishing on the sea with fishermen, selling labor
as stocks.
</P>
<P>
In addition, about 3,000 farmers at Liuxiang have invested in
breeding prawns, crabs and shellfish. Of the 400 prawn growers in
the town, 95 percent are local farmers, working on 730 ha of water
surface. Some farmers have even gone to north and northeast China
provinces to raise prawns.
</P>
<P>
"Amphibious farmers" are also emerging in other
provinces of east China. They go back to their farmland in busy
farming seasons, while making extra money on the sea in slack
seasons.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador's Shrimp Production Gets Better </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Ecuador's exports of shrimp rose
in 1997 by 26 percent in volume and 39 percent in value compared
with those in 1996, hitting a historic record,the Chamber of
Aquiculture reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Foreign sales of the crustacean amounted to 106,221 tons worth
858.58 million U.S. dollars in the year. 95 percent of the total
was shrimp cultivated and the rest was fished.
</P>
<P>
The El Nino climatic phenomenon is affecting seriously the
fishing of shrimp, but the event is favorable for the cultivation
in pools, as the rising temperature of waters fosters the growth
of the species, explained the Chairman of the Chamber, Erick
Notarianni.
</P>
<P>
He added that higher temperature accelerates the shrimp's
metabolism and lowers the salt level of the pool's waters.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador ranks second in production of shrimp in the world, just
after Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The South American country counts on 180,000 hectares for the
raising of shrimp and more than 100,000 workers in the aquiculture
industry.

<HEADLINE> Belgian Court Sticks to Tobacco Ban Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 30 (Xinhua) -- A Belgian local court said
Tuesday it did not have the power to overrule a government ban on
tobacco advertising in sports events.
</P>
<P>
The court decision came just before the December 31 deadline
set by Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone who gave Belgian Grand
Prix organizers some time to find a way around the government ban.
</P>
<P>
The law, which bans all tobacco advertising and sponsorship
from January 1999 in Belgium, was challenged by supporters of the
Belgian Formula One race at Spa-Francorchamps.
</P>
<P>
These supporters include local organizers, retailers and
government authorities.
</P>
<P>
After the Verviers court announced its decision, legal
representatives of the race organizers and local restaurants,
cafes and tourism agencies said that they would take the case to
Belgium's appeal court, the highest court on legal and
administrative matters in the country.
</P>
<P>
A lifting of the Belgian ban law may allow local race
organizers to continue their races until 2006 when the European
Union decides to launch a union-wide complete ban on tobacco
advertising and sponsorship in sports and arts activities.
</P>
<P>
An EU-wide ban on tobacco advertising and sponsorship will lead
the tobacco industry to support major events outside the EU. Now
over 70 percent of the world television audience of Formula One
races is in the Asia-Pacific region though 10 of the 16 annual
Formula One championship races are held in EU countries.

for attacking a Kuwaiti TV anchorman on Tuesday, facing a maximum

fine, said al-Othman's lawyer Ibrahim al-Athary, adding that the
maximum penalty could have been one year in prison.

In April, White grabbed al-Othman by the tie, shoved him
backwards and shouted obscene words after being asked in the live

White's attorney Ernest Alexander said White had apologized to
al-Othman for the bad language and his behavior immediately after

<HEADLINE> Thailand Asks for Suspending Purchase of Fighters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States will
consult with Thailand for its request to suspend the purchase of a
squadron of U.S.-built F/A-18 Hornet fighter jets because of
economic woes, the Pentagon said today.
</P>
<P>
"We are consulting with the Thai government on this issue,"
Pentagon spokesman Maj. Bryan Salas told reporters.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Air Chief Marshal Thananit Niamchan, commander of
the Royal Thai Air Force, said Thailand would negotiate with
Boeing Co. to delay the scheduled eight aircraft purchase for
three years. And he will lead a team to negotiate with Boeing next
month for the deal, valued at 392.1 million dollars, originally to
be completed by 2000.
</P>
<P>
Salas declined to comment on any role the Pentagon might play
in the coming Thai talks with Boeing, but he said, "The U.S.
security commitment to Thailand remains strong during this time of
economic turmoil."
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Boeing said the company had not yet received
official notification of the Thai request for the delay from the
U.S. navy, which is handling the contract through the U.S. foreign
military sales program.
</P>
<P>
"Until we've received official work, there's nothing we can say
or do," she said.
</P>
<P>
Sources said Boeing Co. is expected to charge Thailand about 9
percent of the total project value, or 26 million dollars, for
delaying payment and delivery.

The 28 men jumped into the chilly waters to be hoisted on to
the helicopters as winds made it impossible to lift them from the

</P>
<P>
The 493-foot (160-meter) Merchant Patriot began sinking this
morning 270 miles (435 km) east of Cape Canaveral, Florida, after
a water pipe ruptured in the engine room and flooded the vessel.
</P>
<P>
The ship, owned by the British company Cenergo Navigation Ltd.,
was traveling from Praia Mole, Brazil, to Savannah, Georgia, with
general cargo including containers and heavy steel.
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. Air Force and Coast Guard helicopters from bases in
Florida and the Bahamas joined the rescue mission. The crewmen
were plucked from the sea one by one by rescue crewmen lowered
down in a basket as strong wind blew the life raft off the
vessel's stern.
</P>
<P>
The helicopters flew the rescued crewmen to Marsh Harbor on
Great Abaco Island, Bahamas, about 25 miles (40 kilometers) away.

Our interests are not always the same."

Given differences in geography and history, there will be

"Also, there will be different views on tactics in situations

</P>
<P>
"I think that's inevitable in international relations," he

Russia recently expressed its concern at Washington's dominance

<HEADLINE> Report: Population of 74 Poor Countries will Double </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The population boom is
still booming in the world's poorest countries and 74 less
developed nations can expect their populations to double in 30
years or less, the Population Institute reported today.
</P>
<P>
In its annual overview report, the Washington-based institute
said the world's total population will reach six billion by
mid-1999.
</P>
<P>
"Rapid population growth in the poorest countries of the world
remains the most pressing global demographic problem, despite a
decline in annual increments in human numbers," the institute's
president Werner Fornos told a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Fornos disputed recent reports, notably in the New York Times
magazine and the Wall Street Journal, which said that the global
population boom had ended or there may even be a "population
implosion".
</P>
<P>
Such reports "ignore demographic realities", he said, citing
figures from the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization listing
86 countries as low-income and food-deficient, and suggesting this
is attributable to overpopulation in those countries.
</P>
<P>
"Although many of the countries of Latin America and Asia have
recorded significant fertility declines, the annual number of
births worldwide will be at least 132 million increase for many
more years to come," he added.
</P>
<P>
Some 80 percent of the world's population now resides in the
developing world. The population growth is slowing down in the
developed countries.
</P>
<P>
In Mexico, Morocco, Turkey, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Kenya,
Brazil, the Philippines, Egypt and Pakistan, the use of
contraception has cut fertility rates since 1973, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The institute, a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that seeks
a balance among the world's population, environment and resources,
called for increased contributions from the developed world,
including the United States.
</P>
<P>
Fornos complained Washington has cut population assistance over
the last four years from 585 million to 385 million U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kinkel: 1997 Is a Successful Year for European Politics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, December 30 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Klaus
Kinkel Tuesday struck a positive balance of the year 1997,
describing it as "an extremely successful year for European
foreign and security politics".
</P>
<P>
In his New Year's statement delivered today, Kinkel noted that
during the course of 1997, European and transatlantic institutions
had managed to make considerable progress in shaping Europe for
the 21st century. Major achievements made during the year
including:
</P>
<P>
-- The signing of the European Union Amsterdam Treaty, which
has modernized the organization and created the preconditions for
admitting new members;
</P>
<P>
-- The creation of a strategic partnership between Russia and
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has filled up
security trenches in Europe;
</P>
<P>
-- The historic decisions to enlarge the EU and the NATO, which
have laid the foundation for a new European security order.
</P>
<P>
The year 1997 also saw EU states make serious preparations for
the planned single European currency, the Euro, Kinkel said.
</P>
<P>
"Although decisions on Euro member states are still due to be
made in May next year, it is already foreseeable that a large
number of EU countries, including Germany and France, will qualify
for the first wave," Kinkel said.

<HEADLINE> 2,719 Barred From Federal Health Insurance Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. government barred
2,719 doctors, suppliers and others from the Medicare -- the
federal health insurance program -- in 1997, nearly double 1996,
for fraud and abuse.
</P>
<P>
The increase is largely due to better funding for
investigations, the inspector general's office for the Department
of Health and Human Services said today in releasing the figures.
</P>
<P>
In the fiscal year that ended October 1, 2,719 people and
companies were banned from doing business with Medicare that
covers nearly 40 million elderly and disabled Americans, some for
years. That's up from 1,408 in 1996, the inspector general's
office said.
</P>
<P>
Not all cases involved fraud. In 1996, 797 doctors, dentists
and chiropractors were kicked out of the program because they had
defaulted on a student loan. Another 588 were suspended because
their licenses had been pulled by state authorities.
</P>
<P>
The inspector general said that last year saw a significant
increase of funding to investigate fraud, with more state and
federal governmental agencies working more closely.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 30 (Xinhua) -- Former White House aide E.
Barrett Prettyman Jr. was selected today as interim head of an
investigation into alleged corruption in the U.S. capital police
department, which has been accused of cronyism and mismanagement.
</P>
<P>
Prettyman was also counsel to the Ethics committee of the House
of Representatives in the 1980s. He was the first president of the
D.C. Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
"I have only one objective and that is to restore confidence in
the police department," Prettyman said.
</P>
<P>
City leaders said Prettyman will be named acting inspector
general for the nation's capital.
</P>
<P>
A lifelong Washington resident, Prettyman agreed to take the
job on a temporary basis while local leaders conduct a nationwide
search for a permanent inspector general.
