<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Outlook / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures continued their retreat  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, tumbling to new lows amid a looming 
farm crisis caused by too many supplies and too few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
        Midwest farmers, faced with few alternatives this spring despite  
the potential for sharply lower prices, planted large tracts of corn 
and soybeans. Near-ideal growing weather so far has virtually assured 
bumper fall production, which will add to already ample stockpiles, 
agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
        While demand from Asia and other key importing countries is  
on the rise following a year of relatively low U.S. purchases, it is 
not expected to improve enough to correct the imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
        The government is predicting farmers will harvest 9.45 billion  
bushels of corn this year, but market participants now suspect the 
figure will rise close to or above 10 billion bushels. Farmers are 
expected to harvest a record 2.88 billion bushels of soybeans, and 
that figure also is expected to go higher unless crops are affected 
by an early frost. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures were pressured by active harvesting of what is  
expected to be a large winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.60 a bushel;  
December corn fell 3 cents to $1.96 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cents to $1.08 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents 
to $4.11 1/2 a bushel. Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, while most pork futures contracts finished sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle rose .70 cent to 62.82 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .67 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
rose .05 cent to 46.12, while other contract months retreated; August 
pork bellies fell 2.67 cents to 33.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE>  Greek Princess Weds in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- A gaggle of royals descended upon London on Friday  
for the wedding of Princess Alexia of Greece, eldest daughter of 
the exiled King Constantine and Queen Anne-Marie. 
</P>
<P>
	No fewer than eight queens and three kings, plus a plethora of  
princes and princesses, gathered in a small cathedral in west 
London. 
</P>
<P>
	Queen Elizabeth II and her husband, Prince Philip -- a former  
Greek prince who is distantly related to the bride -- were guests, 
along with Prince Charles and several British royal cousins. 
</P>
<P>
	Princess Alexia, 33, was married to 28-year-old Carlos Morales  
Quintana of Spain in the 19th-century Greek Orthodox cathedral of 
St. Sophia. 
</P>
<P>
	The guest list also included King Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia of  
Spain, King Carl XVI Gustaf and Queen Silvia of Sweden, Queen 
Margrethe of Denmark and her mother Queen Ingrid, Queen Sonja of 
Norway, and the widowed Queen Noor of Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	It was one of the largest gatherings of royals in Britain since  
the last Greek royal wedding, when Alexia's brother Crown Prince 
Pavlos married American heiress Marie Chantal Miller four years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
	This time it was the ceremonial union of an exiled princess who  
is a teacher in Barcelona for children with Down syndrome, and a 
Spanish architect who is also a champion yachtsman. 
</P>
<P>
	The Greek royals have lived in London since a military coup in  
1967. Greece abolished the monarchy in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
	The bride, who wore an off-white satin gown and a diamond and  
white-gold tiara, said she hoped to be able to visit Greece with 
her husband. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would love to,'' she said. ``I would like to show Carlos  
all the places that I have visited in the past but have only been 
able to describe to him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same royal guests had turned out for the June 19  
wedding of Britain's Prince Edward and Sophie Rhys-Jones at Windsor 
Castle.

<HEADLINE> Teledesic Gets Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BELLEVUE, Wash. (AP) -- Teledesic LLC, which plans a network of  
low-orbit satellites to conduct a range of telecommunications 
services, announced today that it has signed a major launch 
contract with Lockheed Martin and an agreement with Motorola to 
build the satellite communications network. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin will use Proton M and Atlas V boosters to launch  
a significant portion of Teledesic's planned 288 satellites. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract calls for three Proton launches and three Atlas  
launches, with options for five additional launches on each. Each 
launch vehicle will carry multiple Teledesic satellites. Financial 
terms of the agreement were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the other agreement, Motorola will engineer and build the  
Teledesic Network, a telecommunications grid designed to provide 
high-speed data connections to businesses, institutions and 
individuals worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of the deal, Motorola made a $150 million cash payment  
to Teledesic, part of its previously announced investment in the 
company. In addition, Teledesic has made a down payment of $250 
million to Motorola for its work as prime contractor. 
</P>
<P>
	Teledesic, founded by Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and cellular  
phone pioneer Craig McCaw, has now raised more than $1.5 billion 
for its satellite system, which will be used to conduct high-speed 
Internet access and interactive multimedia services. Other large 
investors include Saudi Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal and The Boeing 
Co.

<HEADLINE> Gordon Hopes To Keep Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- Before he left the CART FedEx Series  
to give NASCAR stock cars a try in 1997, Robby Gordon was on track 
to become an open-wheel star. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Gordon is struggling to regain that status.  
</P>
<P>
	After struggling through the early part of the season, the  
30-year-old Gordon showed some of his old prowess two weeks ago in 
Cleveland in the rain, running near the front, dicing with the 
leaders and finishing ninth only because a cut tire forced him to 
pit late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``To finish the way we did was especially sweet because we had  
our share of struggles earlier in the weekend at Cleveland,'' said 
Mike Held, team manager and co-owner of Team Gordon. ``We've gotten 
into a bit of a slump on Fridays and Saturdays the last few races. 
But, sure enough, we've come out strong for the Sunday-morning 
warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good thing, to come out strong on race day, but it's  
also frustrating because you wish you could've found the right 
package two days earlier, when practice began on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those frustrations are particularly difficult to take for  
Gordon, considering the situation he was in before his failed 
attempt to race in Winston Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a Californian with movie star looks, had won two races  
and four poles and appeared ready to blossom into a serious Champ 
Car contender. Then he went South to drive for stock cars, an 
experiment that ended abruptly late in the season with Gordon out 
of a ride after finding very little success. 
</P>
<P>
	He quietly returned to CART last year, replacing retiring  
veteran Hiro Matsushita at Arciero-Wells Racing and finishing 23rd 
in the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1998, Gordon joined forces with longtime friend  
Held and Midwestern home improvement mogul John Menard to form Team 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been an instant return to success in the very  
competitive CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is what you sign up for when you start a brand new  
race team,'' Held said. ``We all bought into that when the season 
started. The key is to keep looking forward, build on your 
successes, learn from your mistakes, and remember that this is all 
supposed to be fun. Racing has its ups and downs. If it was easy, 
everybody would do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon actually began the turnaround in May when he drove in the  
rival Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500 -- the only CART regular 
to take part in that event. And he nearly won, running out of fuel 
while leading less than two laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon will try to keep the momentum going today in practice and  
provisional qualifying for the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Road America has always been a homey place to race -- very  
beautiful, very comfortable surroundings, and one of the world's 
most classic road courses,'' Gordon said. ``The food's great, the 
people are very nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Gordon is feeling very positive after his showing at  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left there feeling like we had about as much fun as we had  
all year,'' Gordon said. ``We slid off the track several times. It 
was a mess. But it was a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll be able to come back strong this weekend on a  
totally different kind of racetrack. We go from the wide open 
spaces of an airport road course to a more traditional four-mile 
road course that's got all kinds of challenges. It's got its fast 
parts and its slow parts, so finding the right balance as quickly 
as possible will be the key.''

<HEADLINE> UCLA Players Charged in Parking Scam </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Fourteen football players -- arguably the most  
able-bodied men on the UCLA campus -- received handicapped parking 
permits by claiming fake injuries, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who do you think would less need something like this?'' said  
Maureen McCloskey of the Washington-based Paralyzed Veterans of 
America. ``What were they thinking? This is a moral outrage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players' applications to the state Department of Motor  
Vehicles listed a litany of complaints: knee injuries, back 
injuries, back surgery, a torn ligament, Bell's Palsy, asthma. All 
of the claims were bogus, said Mike Qualls, spokesman for the city 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, 14 current and former Bruin players were charged  
with misdemeanors of illegally possessing the blue handicapped 
parking placards. Each count carries a maximum six months in jail 
and $1,000 fine. One person who allegedly obtained two placards was 
charged with four counts. 
</P>
<P>
	The players allegedly submitted applications with the  
signatures, addresses and medical license numbers of nonexistent 
physicians. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basically if a doctor signs it, we accept it,'' DMV spokesman  
Evan Nossoff said. ``We do not have the medical expertise to do an 
independent evaluation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	California law allows people with temporary or permanent  
disabilities to obtain permits to park in special handicap spaces, 
to use metered spaces for free and to park in limited-time zones 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
	The football players allegedly used the placards to avoid the  
$132-per-semester fee for parking on campus and to park in the area 
around the University of California, Los Angeles, where parking 
problems are chronic. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA said no one at the school knew about the alleged scam. The  
school begins football season Sept. 4 and several of the defendants 
are starters or key reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am embarrassed and disappointed for the young men who were  
involved in this problem,'' UCLA coach Bob Toledo said. ``I have 
spoken to the team as a whole and to the individuals involved, and 
those individuals will be disciplined by me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bryan Branly, 19, a junior majoring in English, said he was not  
surprised by the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``They always try to find shortcuts around certain policies and  
so forth,'' Branly said. ``They think they have special treatment 
'cause they're football players. ... I think the school gives a lot 
of leniency towards them.''

<HEADLINE> Court Sends Williams Appeal Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The state Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a  
state judge wrongly dismissed two claims for a new trial raised by 
Wayne B. Williams, a photographer who killed two men but is 
suspected in as many as 24 murders. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-3 ruling sends the case back to Superior Court, where  
Judge Hal Craig must rule on Williams' claims that prosecutors were 
guilty of misconduct and that his own attorneys did not effectively 
represent him during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Drolet, the Atlanta solicitor who was one of the prosecutors  
in Williams' trial, said the ruling was ``a procedural matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Lynn Whatley, Williams' attorney, said the decision  
indicates the court is very concerned about issues that were raised 
and not properly addressed. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a win-win in that regard, but we've got some  
daylight,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams was convicted of murder in the deaths of Nathaniel  
Cater, 27, and Jimmy Ray Payne 21, two of 29 young Altanta blacks 
whose slayings between 1979 and 1981 led to one of the most 
intensive police investigations of the century. Most of the victims 
were black children. 
</P>
<P>
	After the conviction, authorities blamed Williams, who is black,  
for 22 other slayings but never charged him. Five of the 29 murders 
investigated by a special police task force remain officially open. 
</P>
<P>
	The 41-year-old freelance photographer and talent scout was  
convicted in 1982 and sentenced to two life terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' attorneys claim prosecutors suppressed evidence, such  
as: 
</P>
<P>
	-- A forensic expert's report that dog hairs found on some of the  
victims came from an Alaskan Malemute or a Siberian Husky. 
Prosecution experts testified that the dog hairs were consistent 
with a German Shepherd owned by Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Reports that a witness who said he saw Williams with one of  
the victims had been convicted of murder and driving while 
intoxicated and had one good eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig could order a new trial for Williams or reject his appeal  
again after considering the two issues he had declined last year to 
review. Either ruling likely would be appealed back to the Georgia 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams became a suspect in the string of murders in May 1981  
when police staking out a bridge over the Chattahoochee River -- 
where some of the victims' bodies had been found -- heard a splash 
and stopped Williams as he drove away. Two days later, the body of 
Cater was found downstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The main prosecution evidence against Williams was tiny fibers  
found on the bodies and matched to rugs and other fabrics in the 
home and cars of Williams' parents.

<HEADLINE> Officials Weigh Olympic Indictments </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- With initial evidence-gathering completed,  
Justice Department officials have begun weighing whether to seek 
indictments of anyone over the scandal surrounding Salt Lake City's 
successful effort to win the 2002 Winter Olympics, a law 
enforcement official said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal prosecutors in Salt Lake City and supervisors in the  
fraud section of the department's criminal division here are going 
over the witness interviews and the documents and records gathered 
since the probe got under way early this year to see if there is 
enough evidence to support federal criminal charges, according to 
the official, who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	No decision is imminent; the review may take some time, the  
official said. Indeed, superiors here could order the six Justice 
lawyers and FBI agents who work full time on the case in Salt Lake 
City to go back to gather more evidence. Or they could draft a 
prosecution memorandum for top-level approval and ask the federal 
grand jury in Salt Lake City to return indictments. 
</P>
<P>
	It could not be learned how many indictments might be  
considered, although some published reports have put the number at 
two or more. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have looked for evidence against both alleged  
bribers in Salt Lake City and bribe-takers on the International 
Olympic Committee, which selects the sites for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said Salt Lake City's 2002 bid committee spent  
$800,000 on 14 IOC members, including travel expenses and 
entertainment, gifts, scholarships for their children and cash 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
	At least four IOC members were reportedly questioned by the FBI  
in May when they attended a Coordination Commission meeting in Salt 
Lake. 
</P>
<P>
	Ten IOC members either resigned or were expelled for receiving  
cash and other improper inducements from Salt Lake bidders. The two 
top Salt Lake bid and organizing committee officials lost their 
jobs in the scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	Mail and wire fraud, conspiracy and travel in aid of  
racketeering are among the charges that federal investigators 
looked into because they saw the case as one of commercial bribery, 
rather than the more familiar government variety, Justice officials 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
	While the government usually lets private parties settle  
commercial bribery cases through civil lawsuits, federal charges 
are possible when a federal interest is involved, like the 
integrity of the Olympic games. 
</P>
<P>
	The racketeering law -- known as ITAR, for interstate travel in  
aid of racketeering -- prohibits interstate and foreign travel to 
further federal or state crimes like bribery and extortion or to 
distribute their illicit proceeds. It could be used against both 
bribe givers and takers. 
</P>
<P>
	Bribe takers also might face extortion charges, depending on the  
evidence gathered. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators also have looked at whether the Salt Lake City  
panel violated its tax-exempt status and whether recipients failed 
to pay any U.S. taxes due on payments. And they looked at possible 
gun charges over the shipment out of the country of rifles, pistols 
and other weapons given as gifts to IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice officials familiar with the Foreign Corrupt Practices  
Act were involved in the investigation, but that act applies only 
to bribes paid by U.S. citizens to foreign officials to influence 
actions of their governments. Some foreign officials serve on the 
Olympic Committee, but it is a private organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, prosecutors must still weigh whether federal or state  
charges would be the most likely to succeed, reach the largest 
number of potentially guilty parties and provide the most 
appropriate penalties.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Q&AMP;A </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some questions and answers about the Women's World Cup:  
</P>
<P>
	Q. WHEN IS IT ON?   	
</P>
<P>
	A. The Women's World Cup final between the United States and  
China is scheduled to begin at 3:50 p.m. EDT Saturday. ABC's 
broadcast of the game begins at 3:30 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The third-place game (Norway vs. Brazil) will be at 1:30 p.m.  
EDT and be broadcast by ESPN starting at 1 p.m. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WHO'S LIKELY TO WIN?   	
</P>
<P>
	A. China has been the best team in the tournament, outscoring  
opponents 19-2, including a 5-0 rout of defending champion Norway 
in the semifinals. The Chinese have won two of three meetings with 
the United States this year, and even U.S. coach Tony DiCicco tabs 
them as the favorite. 
</P>
<P>
	The Americans, who beat China in the 1996 Olympic final, have  
been riding an emotional wave for three weeks that has inspired 
their play. Their offense is as dangerous as China's and their 
midfield just as solid. But the Chinese are far more organized on 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	If it comes down to technical skill and tactics, the Chinese are  
likely winners. If it is decided by emotion, the United States has 
the edge. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WILL THIS BE THE LARGEST CROWD TO WATCH A WOMEN'S SPORTING  
EVENT? 
</P>
<P>
	A. In the United States, yes. The record was set in the opener  
at Giants Stadium, which drew 78,972. Organizers are predicting the 
game will draw between 88,000 and 90,000 to the Rose Bowl and be a 
sellout. Tickets are being scalped, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	It cannot be verified if the crowd will be the largest to see a  
women's sporting event anywhere. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WHAT DOES THE WINNER GET?   	
</P>
<P>
	A. The Women's World Cup trophy, designed by William Sawaya, is  
brand new. It is crafted from green marble serpentino, with a 
spiral figure and soccer ball made of sterling silver and laminated 
with 23 carat gold and white gold. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to her salary, each U.S. player will get a $12,500  
bonus for winning; the Chinese have not revealed bonus information. 
</P>
<P>
	And, of course, the winners will get all the accolades that  
accompany earning a major international championship. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THIS U.S. TEAM AFTER THIS GAME?   	
</P>
<P>
	A. For a few weeks, the players will be on their own. Some will  
return to college. Others will be involved in endorsement deals and 
make personal appearances. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Women's Cup will take place in early October, with the  
Americans scheduled to play in the new Crew Stadium in Columbus, 
Ohio, in the opener. Opponents and other venues have not been 
settled, but discussions are being held with the Chinese and 
Brazilian federations. 
</P>
<P>
	A tour of various U.S. areas and foreign countries is likely for  
late fall, although not every player will take part. 
</P>
<P>
	Next March is the prestigious Algarve Cup in Portugal. That will  
be followed by a residency camp to choose an Olympic squad, and 
that team then will stage a barnstorming tour similar to the 
pre-World Cup tour. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WILL THIS TEAM PLAY IN THE OLYMPICS?   	
</P>
<P>
	A. Most, if not all, of the women on the World Cup team will  
also be in Sydney next year. Veterans Michelle Akers, Joy Fawcett 
and Carla Overbeck are among those who have not committed to the 
2000 Olympics. 

</P>
<P>
	Q. WILL THERE BE A PROFESSIONAL WOMEN'S LEAGUE AFTER THE WORLD  
CUP? 
</P>
<P>
	A. No. After the Olympics, possibly.  
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Soccer, the governing body for the sport, has commissioned  
a study into the subject and will develop a marketing plan. But the 
earliest a U.S. league might get started would be 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The national team will be the focus for women's soccer in this  
country through Sydney. Look for it to play perhaps a dozen games 
next year in the buildup for the Olympics.

<HEADLINE> Cubs' Tapani Leaves After 2 Innings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Just what the pitching-poor Chicago Cubs didn't  
need -- two more injuries to their ravaged pitching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Starter Kevin Tapani was forced to leave Friday night's  
interleague game against the crosstown White Sox after two innings 
with a bruised right thumb from fielding a hard hopper back to the 
mound. 
</P>
<P>
	Three innings later, his replacement, Matt Karchner, also had to  
depart with a strained right groin. 
</P>
<P>
	Tapani was hit in his pitching hand by a hard bouncer from the  
White Sox's Mark Johnson in the bottom of the second. He fielded 
the ball, threw Johnson out at first and, after a short delay to 
throw several warmup pitches, retired the next hitter to end the 
inning. X-rays were negative. 
</P>
<P>
	Karchner was called on to start the bottom of the third. With  
two outs in the bottom of the fifth, he delivered a pitch to 
Magglio Ordonez, then leaned over on the mound in pain. The 
right-hander, who spent time on the disabled list with a groin 
injury earlier this season, walked gingerly off the mound to the 
dugout and was replaced by Ray King. 
</P>
<P>
	The Cubs entered play Friday with 20 losses in their previous 27  
games, a stretch in which the team ERA was 8.10.

<HEADLINE> Booze Sales Banned on Reservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BROWNING, Mont. (AP) -- A five-day ban on alcohol sales on the  
Blackfeet Indian Reservation could be the forerunner of year-round 
prohibition. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban from Thursday night until Monday night was imposed by  
the Blackfeet Tribal Council in an effort to control drinking 
during North American Indian Days, the biggest annual celebration 
on the reservation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There have been too many crashes and too many deaths in recent  
months,'' said Herman Whitegrass, a chemical dependency counselor. 
``We have to take off our blinders and take action to save lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ban will be reinstated during next month's Heart Butte  
Society Celebration, and tribe officials are interested in 
prohibiting alcohol sales all year. They plan a series of public 
meetings on the idea. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitegrass said officials will monitor the next five days  
closely. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will use this as a measuring stick,'' he said. ``We will  
chart how many crashes there are and how many other problems -- 
things like people going to the emergency room for things like 
abuse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the 27 alcohol vendors on the reservation near Glacier  
National Park in northern Montana say permanently prohibiting sales 
would simply drive people off the reservation to buy booze. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a problem. I'll admit that, but I think you're  
compounding the problem by taking away something that's legal and 
making people go farther for it,'' said Norris Gilham, whose mother 
owns Ick's Place bar and liquor store in Browning. ``There's a lot 
of enterprising people here. They're going to see a way to make 
money and start bootlegging.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tribal law already bans alcohol sales on religious holidays,  
including Christmas and Easter.

<HEADLINE> Dow Closes at New High 11,193.70 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks sailed to new record highs Friday as  
continued optimism about corporate profits and strong consumer 
spending offset the effects of a rocky bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average rose 66.81 to 11,193.70,  
topping its previous record close of 11,187.36, set Wednesday. The 
Dow picked up 54.46, or 0.49 percent, for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 and the Nasdaq composite index also  
hit new records. For the Nasdaq, rich with technology stocks, 
Friday was the sixth record-setting day in seven sessions as it 
rose 21.21 to close at 2,793.07. 
</P>
<P>
	The S&AMP;P 500 rose 8.86 to 1,403.28.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks are flourishing as the first few companies to report  
second-quarter earnings meet Wall Street's high expectations. With 
the robust economy continuing its expansion, analysts expect the 
strongest profit growth since the third quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer led technology issues, rising 2 7/8 to 42 13/16,  
after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the company. Analysts said 
the positive word from Goldman sparked interest in the whole 
technology sector, helping the Nasdaq extend its winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is evidence of sustained growth rates among the computer  
makers,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officer at First 
Albany Corp. IBM, a component of the Dow, rose 3 3/8 to 137 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow's gain would have been much more modest without  
McDonald's, which rose 3 15/16 to 44 9/16. Wall Street investment 
firm Schroder &AMP; Co. upgraded the company's stock, citing strong 
expectations for the fast-food chain's second-quarter sales. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont rose 3 3/16 to 71 11/16 after the company unveiled some  
details of its spinoff of its Conoco unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the solid gains, stocks were somewhat unsettled by  
continuing fluctuations in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	``Bonds remain extremely volatile,'' said Peter Anderson, chief  
investment officer at American Express Financial Advisors. ``My 
hunch is that the economy will remain strong longer than we 
anticipate, producing higher rates, and that's ultimately not going 
to be good for stocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Early in Friday's session, stocks fell along with bond prices as  
the credit markets absorbed an $8.6 billion offering by Ford Motor 
and its Ford Motor Credit unit. The offering is the largest 
corporate bond deal ever, topping AT&AMP;T's $8 billion sale earlier 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices evened out as the market digested the impact of the new  
corporate supply. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which 
had spiked as high as 6.03 percent at noon, edged back to 5.99 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks recovered, although it was a quiet summer Friday with  
little news to stimulate trading. Advancing issues outnumbered 
decliners by an 11-to-7 margin on the New York Stock Exchange, one 
of the strongest ratios in recent sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume came to 698.56 million shares, well short of the  
820.02 million shares traded Thursday. The volume was significantly 
higher than last Friday, however, when many market players started 
their Fourth of July holiday early. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Friday's gains, many traders were watching their moves  
ahead of next week, when the government's producer and consumer 
price indexes, which are key measures of inflation, are scheduled 
to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Next week will also bring a flood of profit reports. Given the  
market's sharp advance these past two weeks, analysts say stocks 
are unlikely to rise much more unless profits sharply exceed 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have already priced strong earnings into the market,''  
said Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors appears ready for a plunge on Monday. A jury  
ruled late Friday that the company must pay $4.9 billion to six 
people who were severely burned in a 1983 accident. Its shares fell 
2 1/4 in after-hours trading to 66 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 3.63 to 657.68, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.04 to 812.73. The Russell 
2000 index of smaller companies rose 3.23 to 457.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.17 percent.  
European indexes were higher, as Germany's DAX index rose 0.6 
percent, France's CAC-40 rose 0.4 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 
gained 0.1 percent.

<HEADLINE>  New EU Nominees Announced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Former Italian Prime Minister Romano  
Prodi today announced a list of the 19 people he wants to replace 
the scandal-ridden European Commission, the main European Union 
executive body. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodi promised ``a new era of change,'' saying the new  
commissioners will ``meet the very highest standards of public life 
(and) give clear direction and leadership.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission runs the day-to-day affairs of the 15-nation  
union. It drafts EU law, enforces its implementation across Europe 
and represents EU governments in international trade talks and 
summits of the G-7 group of nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The last Commission headed by Jacques Santer of Luxembourg  
resigned in March after a report by independent experts found 
nepotism and financial mismanagement at the EU head office. 
</P>
<P>
	Among Prodi's high-profile nominees for the new commission is  
Guenter Verheugen, Germany's deputy foreign minister, who was 
selected to head the EU's efforts to bring in more eastern European 
countries. Chris Patten, who served as Britain's last governor of 
Hong Kong before it returned to Chinese rule in 1997, is to head 
foreign affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Prodi also proposed former British Labor Party Neil Kinnock, now  
the transportation commissioner, to take charge of reforms at the 
EU head office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Prodi team will take over once its members have been  
approved by the European Parliament in confirmation sessions 
scheduled for September. It will serve out the term of the Santer 
commission, which expires Dec. 31, and then serve a full five-year 
mandate. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Monti, now the EU taxation commissioner, will become  
antitrust chief. Spain's Pedro Solbes Mira was put forward as 
monetary affairs commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	Of the incumbent commissioners, only Franz Fischler stays with  
the job he has: agriculture. Another incumbent, Finland's Erkki 
Liikanen, moves from budget to enterprise and information society 
matters. The 20-member Prodi team includes five women. 
</P>
<P>
	Others put forward by Prodi are: Germany's Michaele Schreyer, a  
Green Party member, as budget commissioner; France's Pascal Lamy 
and Michel Barnier as trade and regional policy commissioners 
respectively; Loyola de Palacio (Spain, transport and energy), 
Frits Bolkestein (Netherlands, Internal Market); Poul Nielson 
(Denmark, humanitarian affairs); Philippe Busquin (Belgium, 
Research); Viviane Reding (Luxembourg, education); Margot 
Waldstroem (Sweden, environment); Antonio Vitorino (Portugal, 
justice and home affairs); David Byrne (Ireland, consumer affairs); 
Ana Diamantopoulou (Greece, employment, social affairs). 
</P>
<P>
	Of the 15 EU nations, the five biggest -- Britain, France, Italy,  
Spain and Germany -- each get to name two commissioners. The other 
counties get one each. 
</P>
<P>
	Once in Brussels, the commissioners take an oath to represent  
the interests of the union, though in practice EU countries often 
use ``their'' commissioners to lobby for issues that are of prime 
concern.

<HEADLINE> Crowds Awaited at Hacker Convention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Undercover federal agents can rest assured that the ``Spot the  
Fed'' contest at this year's annual hackers convention is all in 
good fun. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the ``Feds'' insist they won't be present when the  
seventh annual geek gathering known as DefCon gets underway today 
in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
	That's hard to believe though, considering the cyber-crime wave  
of recent months, ranging from nasty computer bugs to cyber-attacks 
on prominent Web sites that have been glamorized online by would-be 
Internet desperados. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a sign of the times, and not a welcome one among the  
hacking elite, that this year's DefCon will feature a beginners' 
session so the ``newbies'' won't bog down the discourse with 
low-tech questions. 
</P>
<P>
	The geeky masses attending the proceedings Friday through Sunday  
are expected to number in the thousands, up from only about 100 
back in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	With that many people, of course, it's hard to maintain the type  
of secretive aura that hackers desire and require to practice their 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
	The debate over what exactly that craft constitutes should  
figure prominently during DefCon after all the headline-grabbing 
intrusions on computer security of recent weeks and months. 
</P>
<P>
	Since late March, computer networks have been besieged by e-mail  
viruses called Melissa and Chernobyl, and a file-eating bug with 
the not-so-catchy name Worm.Explore.Zip. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, hackers have managed to break into Web sites  
belonging to institutions as prestigious as the White House and The 
New York Times, as well as security-minded organizations like the 
FBI and U.S. Army. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been nearly 1,500 cases of Internet vandalism  
reported in the first half of 1999, according to Attrition.org, a 
cyber-gathering place for hackers. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of these security breaches have gone unsolved, which is  
likely a major source of hack appeal for the young and the restless 
in the world of computers. It's also a big reason why DefCon 7.0 
will probably attract the largest cadre yet of undercover law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
	But law enforcement officials aren't the only ones dismayed by  
the mainstreaming of the computer hacking. 
</P>
<P>
	Veterans of the trade prefer to view themselves as Robin Hoods  
of the computer world, exposing the vulnerabilities of computers 
for the common good. These members of the anti-establishment 
establishment don't want their ranks infiltrated and tarnished by 
the likes of would-be vandals and vigilantes. 
</P>
<P>
	Hacking ``is a word that is used, mangled, and should be left  
alone,'' said one hacker, who like most hackers would only speak on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the people at DefCon ``basically live for the glamour  
aspect of 'the scene,''' he added. ``These kids are mainly there to 
just be a part of something, needing an identity, etc.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from prickly debates, however, DefCon is now chock full of  
tradition, including the annual game of ``Capture the Flag.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what type of counter-culture computer gathering would be  
complete without some sort of Microsoft bashing? 
</P>
<P>
	The software company has notified legal authorities about the  
expected DefCon release of an updated ``remote access'' program 
from a group named ``Cult of the Dead Cow''. Once installed on a 
computer running a Microsoft Windows operating system, the program 
will allow someone to control that machine from another location. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat isn't considered very major, however, since it should  
take less than a few days or even hours for computer security 
companies to update their detection software.

<HEADLINE> Hungry Hoppers Vex Texas Farmers / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) -- Marauding grasshoppers are munching  
their way across Texas in an infestation expected to grow worse for 
farmers as the summer wears on. 
</P>
<P>
	Hordes of hoppers are fattening themselves on grass, weeds and  
anything edible in North Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``These things will feed on a lot of things as long as there is  
green vegetation. We've seen them feed on fence posts,'' said Ellis 
County official Glenn Moore. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some things that have helped us is a lot of areas are getting  
rain, keeping pastures green and more attractive to them,'' said 
Moore. ``Otherwise the grasshoppers head to the field crops.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Moore said minor crop damage has been reported so far, although  
another month of hot weather is expected to bring out peak numbers 
of hoppers who prefer it hotter and drier. 
</P>
<P>
	Allen Knutson, a Texas A&AMP;M University entomologist, said this  
year's infestation will be a bumper crop. There was an outbreak 
last year, and grasshopper infestations build over three- to 
five-year dry periods as adults lay increasingly more eggs. 
</P>
<P>
	This past mild winter protected the eggs, while dry weather kept  
at bay a fungal disease. Add a spring dry enough for immature 
grasshoppers to survive but wet enough to grow plenty of vegetation 
for the young bugs and the result has been near-perfect pest 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, experts don't expect the insect invasion to grow into a  
plague of Biblical proportions or even to the size of swarms 
weathered by the West between 1984 and 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	That infestation was the nation's last major plague, with  
grasshoppers by the millions smothering an area the size of Kansas. 
The insects devoured wheat and grasses over 55 million acres, 
forcing farmers in 17 states to buy feed for cattle and sheep. The 
Agriculture Department mustered military jets and spent more than 
$21 million spraying bugs. 
</P>
<P>
	Agents this year are advising farmers and gardeners to mow down  
weeds near crops and to carefully use chemical sprays. 
</P>
<P>
	Another possibility is releasing flocks of birds on the bugs.  
</P>
<P>
	----	 
</P>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Marvin Yost was far from jubilant this week  
when he finished harvesting the 800 acres of wheat on his farm near 
Dewitt. 
</P>
<P>
	In any other year, he would be celebrating a crop yield of more  
than 50 bushels per acre. 
</P>
<P>
	But bumper harvests across the nation's bread belt are adding to  
an oversupply of grain that has pushed commodity prices to their 
lowest levels in nearly 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat, corn and soybean production is far exceeding demand,  
pinning prices below the break-even mark for most farmers for the 
second straight year. 
</P>
<P>
	``To turn it around, it's going to take a severe drought ... but  
I hope it's not here,'' said Victor Bohuslavsky, of the Nebraska 
Soybean Growers Association. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's above-average crop yields and low prices prompted  
many to sit on their grain rather than sell. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result, 850 million bushels of soybeans sit in storage  
nationwide, compared to 180 million bushels two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreover:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Wheat farmers are getting about $2 a bushel, prices as low as  
those from the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Corn is at its lowest price in the last two years, about $1.50  
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Soybean prices, hovering around $2.30 a bushel, haven't been  
this low since 1972.

<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The marketing onslaught of big chains such as

convention, which opened Thursday, say adult videos that chain 
stores refuse to stock are shoring up business and, in some cases, 
keeping their doors open. 
</P>
<P>
	With national stores popping up all over, and industry deals  
that allow Blockbuster to stock big new releases in huge 
quantities, independent retailers are focusing on more eclectic 
inventories, with pornographic videos an increasing part of their 
bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
	Some outwardly mainstream retailers say adult videos make up a  
third or less of their film titles while accounting for more than 
half of their rentals. Porn video viewers tend to be more regular 
customers and check out multiple titles at a time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got nobody who comes in and takes out 12 classics, but I  
do have people who come in on a weekend and rent 12 porns,'' said 
Jerry Neeley, who owns Jerry's Video Reruns in Los Angeles. ``I 
joke with customers that those videos pay for me having the 
classics on hand.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neeley said X-rated movies account for about 10 percent of his  
30,000 titles, but 40 percent of his business. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Kobierecki, who operates five video stores around Scranton,  
Pa., said adult films make up about a third of his titles, up from 
10 percent five years ago. Those movies account for 60 percent of 
his business, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	If not for his adult-movie customers, Kobierecki said, his  
stores would have closed by now. 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers relying more on pornography say they have to be  
careful not to push those film stocks too high or they might run 
afoul of local obscenity laws and find themselves classified as 
adult businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Landall Goolsby, who owns a video store in Portales, N.M., said  
he keeps his adult stock at about 10 percent of his inventory of 
16,000 titles, but the rentals off those movies is on the rise. 
</P>
<P>
	Goolsby said he has been promoting his adult section more  
heavily because Blockbuster does not carry such movies. His 
newspaper ads include the line, ``all ratings available.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Before we had the dirty little room with our adult stuff,''  
Goolsby said. ``Now we market more aggressively that we have adult 
movies. The dirty little room's becoming more profitable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Red Board Video of San Francisco, which distributes adult films,  
has had more queries about titles from smaller video stores over 
the last six months, said sales director Duck Dumont. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're looking at expanding what they have to offer,'' Dumont  
said. ``People get hungry, and when they do, you look under 
different rocks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers spent $4.1 billion on adult video rentals and sales in  
1998, down from $4.2 billion a year earlier, the first drop since 
tracking began eight years ago, said Paul Fishbein, editor of the 
trade publication Adult Video News. Adult sales and rentals make up 
about 20 percent of the video market. 
</P>
<P>
	While X-rated movies are becoming more important to many  
independent stores, adult videos also can boost mainstream business 
by increasing foot traffic, Fishbein said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there's a Blockbuster in your neighborhood with 150 copies  
of 'Saving Private Ryan' and you've only got four, the odds are the 
customer's going to Blockbuster,'' Fishbein said. ``But if a 
customer knows you have adult films and Blockbuster and Hollywood 
don't, he may come in and rent 'Saving Private Ryan' from you, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kristi and William Smylie said they planned to browse an adult  
entertainment expo at the convention to help decide whether to add 
X-rated movies at their video store in Angels Camp, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Business has been fair since they bought the store a year ago,  
but offering adult videos might help boost business, they said. 
They plan to survey customers to make sure an adult section would 
not chase away mainstream business. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we do it, we'd probably put the titles in a book behind the  
counter so as not to offend anyone,'' Ms. Smylie said.

<HEADLINE> New Yorkers Offer First Lady Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ONEONTA, N.Y. (AP) -- When waitress Kathy Schmid was setting up  
the coffee cream and white chocolate chunk cookies at a makeshift 
cafe for Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit, she didn't imagine the 
first lady would seek her counsel. 
</P>
<P>
	But this was the ``Listening to New Yorkers'' tour, and Mrs.  
Clinton skipped not even the smallest chance to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
	``She asked what spritzer I'd recommend,'' Schmid said. ``I told  
her strawberry-kiwi was good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry-kiwi it was for the first lady, and she insisted on  
paying for her drink. With a smile and a thank-you, she also made 
progress toward a goal of her week-long tour -- endearing voting New 
Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	``She was really down-to-earth. It was really cool,'' Schmid  
said. ``She has a lot of work to do, but I think she's up for the 
challenge and she's willing to work hard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most walking down Oneonta's Main Street welcomed Clinton's  
visit, but it appeared to change few voting decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think I'll save that to see who's running first,'' Dale  
Rogers, a maintenance worker at Wilber National Bank, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't approve of the whole mess -- she's condemned by  
association,'' Carol Norris, of Liberty, said while 
window-shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Some residents were turned off by the event's perfect  
choreography. A meeting with the feel of a living room chat at the 
State University of Oneonta was invitation only. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was a little disappointed there wasn't more of a public  
forum,'' said Stephanie Drinkwater, a 34-year-old mother of three. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton continued her tour of New York on Thursday,  
traveling to Cooperstown to talk health care, to Clinton for lunch, 
and to Utica for a meeting with senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
	Except for plastic letters on the Kentucky Fried Chicken's  
marquee shouting ``Welcome To Oneonta Mrs. Clinton,'' there were 
few indications on Thursday that the first lady had been there just 
24 hours before. 
</P>
<P>
	A police officer weaved his bicycle slowly through the quiet  
downtown, where the Secret Service the day before asked retired 
lawyer John King to vacate a park bench. Betsy Busche felt relief 
after working two weeks to make the local product retail store she 
oversees look just right. 
</P>
<P>
	Elena Doyle again tended her two gourmet Italian markets after a  
week's worth of media attention as a hand-picked attendee at Mrs. 
Clinton's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The economy will rule the Senate race, several residents agreed.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think her so-called listening tour exposes her to the  
issues upstate,'' said retired college professor Thomas Gergel. 
``Her husband's visiting places that have not taken part in the 
country's economic recovery. We certainly here have not 
participated in the national economic recovery either.''

<HEADLINE>  Ships Arrive in France for Armada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROUEN, France (AP) -- Dozens of tall ships gracefully slipped  
into Rouen harbor from points around the world Friday, preparing to 
glide down the Seine River in the ``Armada of the Century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horns honked and visitors lining city streets and country roads  
stared and waved as the majestic ships glided 75 miles down the 
northern stretches of the Seine River toward the Normandy port of 
Rouen. Crews aboard the vessels returned the welcome. 
</P>
<P>
	Hailing from Russia, Britain, the Netherlands, as well as  
Scandinavia and Latin America, the ships from almost 30 countries 
evoked memories of an era when such vessels were the majestic 
rulers of the sea. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the arrivals was the Mir, a hulking 356-foot-long  
triple-mast ship from the Russian National Maritime Academy. 
Boasting a crew of over 200, it is second in size only to the 
360-foot Dar Milodziezy of Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, 30 tall ships, 12 battleships and more than 30 barges  
will dock at the harbor for ``the largest gathering of tall ships 
of the millennium.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barry Lee, a retired Marine Corps helicopter pilot from  
Pensacola, Florida, was among the 140 paying customers sailing on 
the 288-foot-long Statsraad Lehmkuhl of Norway. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was unbelievably fantastic ..., riding into France and  
having all those people waving at us,'' Lee said. ``I've always 
wanted to do this, ever since I was a kid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The docks were brimming Friday with tourists. Nearly one million  
tourists have already passed through for the event, which is 
expected to attract nine million more by the time it ends on July 
18. 
</P>
<P>
	A string of festivities are planned for the tall ships' 10-day  
stay in France, including nightly fireworks and a handful of 
concerts with musicians such as jazz great Elvin Jones and French 
pop star Faudel. 
</P>
<P>
	On the final day, all the boats will meander up the Seine in  
formation to the northern seaside resort of St. Malo. 
</P>
<P>
	Rouen has hosted the armada twice before -- in 1989 to celebrate  
the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution, and in 1994 for the 
50th anniversary of the D-Day landings. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials hope in the future to stage the event every five  
years.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Restores Daily Overtime Pay </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- California's governor is expected to  
sign a bill that would once again require employers to pay overtime 
to workers in most cases on days they work more than eight hours. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure would cover 8 million workers and would reverse a  
1997 decision by a state commission that required overtime only 
after 40 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
	Under that system, workers lost up to $200 on each paycheck,  
said Assemblyman Wally Knox, the sponsor of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents of the measure said flexible schedules, under which  
employees sometimes work more than eight hours a day, are 
convenient for people who have other obligations. They also said 
the measure will be a hardship for small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill passed the state Senate 23-15 and the Assembly 47-27 on  
Thursday and went to Gov. Gray Davis, who has said he would sign 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill requires employers to give workers 1 1/2 times their  
normal pay for working more than eight hours a day and double pay 
for work more than 12 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	There are exceptions in the law. Workers could agree, by a  
two-thirds vote, to flexible schedules under which they would work 
up to 10 hours a day in a 40-hour week without getting daily 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	If their employer agreed, workers also could take personal time  
off and make it up later in the week without overtime, as long as 
they worked no more than 11 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
	And workers who voluntarily worked an alternative schedule  
before this month could continue to do so.

<HEADLINE> Jagger, Hall Seek Annulment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- After more than two decades of unwed and perhaps  
never-really-wedded togetherness, Rolling Stone lead singer Mick 
Jagger and Jerry Hall announced Friday that they are seeking to 
have their marriage annulled. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger and the Texas-born model reached a ``mutually acceptable  
legal and financial settlement'' after a 12-minute court hearing, 
attorneys for both parties said. Details of the deal were not 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Many British newspapers, quoting unidentified sources or none at  
all, however, purported in Saturday's editions to know how much she 
received. 
</P>
<P>
	The Daily Mail tabloid reported Saturday that Hall received $11  
million while three other newspaper said she received $15.5 million 
from Jagger's estimated fortune of $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Times speculated that she succeeded in getting the $50  
million she reportedly was seeking. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to seek an annulment means the couple is attempting  
to prove their marriage was never recognized in English law and is 
therefore void. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall filed for divorce in January after a Brazilian model  
claimed she was pregnant after a brief liaison with Jagger. But 
Jagger contested the divorce, arguing that their marriage in 1990 
on the Indonesian island of Bali was not legally valid because the 
civil part of the ceremony was not completed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger, 55, and Hall, 43, have been together for more than two  
decades. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall are determined that their  
friendship and mutual respect will endure. They will always be 
linked through the great shared love they have for their four 
children and their determination to both play their full part as 
parents,'' their attorneys said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Annulment requests are typically heard within three months of  
application and must be agreed to by a judge, said family law 
specialist Eileen Pembridge. 
</P>
<P>
	The purpose of Friday's hearing was to arrange an agenda for a  
full hearing of Hall's divorce petition.

<HEADLINE> Brown Headed to Louisville </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) -- Erik Brown, who led the nation's Division  
I freshmen in scoring at Morehead State before leaving in May, 
intends to make Louisville the next stop in his college basketball 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Though Louisville has no scholarships available for the  
1999-2000 academic year, Brown said Friday he will enroll in the 
fall and has been promised a scholarship for 2000-01, when he will 
next be eligible to play. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's stability there, I get a chance to play for a Hall of  
Fame coach,'' the 6-foot-5 forward said. ``They've got three wing 
players graduating this year -- Nate Johnson, Tony Williams and 
Kevin Smiley -- so I see after this year there'll be a chance for me 
to step in and a spot will be wide open for me, and that wasn't an 
opportunity I could pass up.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brown's departure from Morehead -- after he had signed papers  
renewing his scholarship, enrolled in summer school and gone home 
to Lexington during a school break -- outraged Eagles coach Kyle 
Macy. Backed by the school's athletic department, Macy initially 
refused to release Brown from his scholarship, saying he believed a 
larger school had tampered with the player. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown hired Lexington lawyer Shirley Allen Cunningham Jr., who  
threatened legal action. After a review of the case by Morehead 
president Ronald Eaglin, the school released Brown from his 
scholarship last month, though Eaglin said he was convinced that 
someone had tampered with Brown. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown said Friday that he was unhappy throughout his freshman  
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just felt out of place there,'' he said. ``I was depressed  
about hating it there. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was nothing against coach Macy.''  
</P>
<P>
	Morehead has asked the NCAA to investigate Brown's departure.  
</P>
<P>
	``I know I wasn't contacted by anybody'' about leaving Morehead,  
Brown said.

<HEADLINE> Court Sends Williams Appeal Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTA (AP) -- The man blamed for killing 24 young Atlanta  
blacks two decades ago has persuaded the state's highest court to 
order a judge to reconsider his request for a new trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Wayne B. Williams was convicted in 1982 of murdering Nathaniel  
Cater, 27, and Jimmy Ray Payne 21, two of 29 blacks whose slayings 
between 1979 and 1981 led to one of the most intensive 
investigations of the century. Most of the victims were children. 
</P>
<P>
	After his conviction, authorities blamed Williams for 22 other  
slayings but never charged him. Five of the 29 murders investigated 
by a special task force remain officially open. 
</P>
<P>
	The Georgia Supreme Court ruled Thursday that a state judge  
wrongly dismissed two grounds for a new trial raised by Williams, 
41, who is serving life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 4-3 ruling sends the case back to Superior Court, where  
Judge Hal Craig must rule on Williams' claims that prosecutors were 
guilty of misconduct and that his attorneys did not effectively 
represent him during trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Lynn Whatley, Williams' lawyer, said the decision ``certainly  
indicates the court is very much concerned about issues that we 
raised and that were not properly addressed.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Drolet, the Atlanta solicitor who was one of the prosecutors  
in Williams' trial, described the ruling as ``a procedural matter 
that doesn't really go to the merits of anything of great 
importance in the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams claims prosecutors improperly withheld evidence that  
would have helped his defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams became a suspect in 1981 when police staking out a  
bridge over the Chattahoochee River -- where some of the victims' 
bodies had been found -- heard a splash and stopped Williams as he 
drove away. Two days later, the body of Cater was found downstream. 
</P>
<P>
	The main prosecution evidence against Williams were tiny fibers  
found on the bodies and matched to rugs and other fabrics in the 
home and cars of Williams' parents.

<HEADLINE> CART Race Extended by Five Laps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- Hoping to avoid another fuel economy  
run in Sunday's Texaco/Havoline 200, officials from CART and Road 
America agreed to extend the race by five laps on the four-mile 
road course. 
</P>
<P>
	Road America president Jim Haynes said, ``Too many times, the  
outcome here was decided primarily by which team got the best fuel 
mileage. By lengthening the race slightly, we have made this a 
three-stop race for everyone, which allows more teams to be racing 
full bore at the finish. That means more exciting racing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Competitors have a 35-gallon fuel tank and, under CART rules,  
must average 1.85 miles per gallon to make it to the end of each 
race. 
</P>
<P>
	With the advent several years ago of electronic fuel management,  
getting the minimum has become virtually automatic. But the current 
fuel systems, which can be controlled from the cockpit, also allow 
the teams to try a variety of strategies. 
</P>
<P>
	At Road America, the longest track on the 20-race CART schedule,  
many teams have tried to stretch their fuel and make it to the end 
of the race with only two carefully planned pit stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the green flag, the cars can run about 16 laps -- 64 miles  
-- between stops. With the race extended from 50 to 55 laps, the 
only way it can become a fuel strategy event is if there is an 
unusually high number of full-course caution flags. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anything can happen, but the odds of having a race more speed  
and competition oriented than fuel management oriented are much 
better,'' said J. Kirk Russell, CART's vice president of 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically, fuel management has been a major part of the  
strategy at Road America. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1982, Al Unser Sr. had a comfortable lead going into the  
final lap, but ran out of fuel halfway around the course, allowing 
Hector Rebacque to gain his only CART victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andretti had a 22-second lead going into the final lap  
in the 1989 race, but ran out of fuel two miles from the finish. 
That gave the victory to Danny Sullivan, who had made a quick fuel 
stop two laps earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the race will cover 220 miles, Haynes said the name  
will not be changed this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I call it a bargain for the fans,'' Haynes said. ``Same name,  
more miles.'' 
</P>

<P>
	 *NOT READY YET:* Mark Blundell, recuperating from a broken  
vertebrae in his neck, will not return to racing yet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Englishman's return has been postponed until the Detroit  
race Aug. 8 after it was recommended by CART medical officials that 
Blundell take more time to gain neck strength. 
</P>
<P>
	Blundell practiced earlier this week in his PacWest Reynards at  
Putnam Park in Indiana. The doctors cleared him to continue 
practicing and working on his conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, super sub Roberto Moreno was back in the car Friday.  
Moreno has finished in the points -- the top 12 -- in each of the 
five races he has run for PacWest since Blundell was injured May 4 
in a crash during testing at Madison, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	Moreno is scheduled to stay in the car for the races in Toronto  
next week and Brooklyn, Mich., July 25.

<HEADLINE> Control Center Dark for 13 Minutes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- As technicians scrambled to restore communications  
between south Florida's main air traffic control center and jets, 
one controller watched helplessly as two radar blips crept toward 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
	The planes managed to avoid each other, but it was a harrowing  
13 minutes after a construction worker accidentally knocked out 
power to the center's radio system Thursday morning and a backup 
system failed to take over. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was extreme potential for disaster here,'' said Jerry  
McArthur, who heads the National Air Traffic Controllers 
Association's Miami chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Air Route Traffic Control Center is the main radar  
complex that controls and separates airplanes between Orlando and 
San Juan, Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
	No mishaps occurred during the outage, Federal Aviation  
Administration officials said, thought some flights were delayed. 
Planes already approaching their destinations were placed in 
holding patterns until communications were restored. 
</P>
<P>
	Two jets flirted with disaster over central Florida as a  
Southwest Airlines flight nearly caught up with a Delta jet as both 
climbed toward the same altitude, McArthur said. The Southwest jet 
turned away and climbed higher, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said it does not believe the two airliners breached  
federal separation standards, which call for planes to remain five 
miles apart horizontally and about 1,000 feet apart vertically. 
</P>
<P>
	The controller was so unnerved he filed a medical report for  
trauma, McArthur said. 
</P>
<P>
	The communications problem happened at 7:40 a.m. Thursday, when  
a worker accidentally bumped into an electrical switch, tripping a 
circuit breaker and cutting off power to the center's Voice 
Switching and Control System, the FAA said. The system allows 
controllers to talk to airplanes by radio and to other radar 
complexes on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
	As controllers worked to restore order, 14 planes were held on  
the ground at Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and 
37 planes were held at Miami International. Flights around the 
nation bound for south Florida were held at their gates, officials 
said.

<HEADLINE> Quayle Meets Religious Conservatives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PELLA, Iowa (AP) -- Former vice president Dan Quayle sharpened  
his appeal to religious conservatives Friday, calling for greater 
government support for religious institutions to deal with social 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	During his latest campaign swing, Quayle spoke of his opposition  
to abortion while his wife met influential religious conservatives. 
He toured a pregnancy crisis center before meeting about 30 
conservative activists in Pella. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we believe in separation of church and state, but these  
faith-based institutions are doing the work,'' Quayle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said organizations with a religious base have a far more  
effective success rate in dealing with issues such as drug 
addiction and he urged greater government partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
	``My point is the government shouldn't just ignore them,''  
Quayle said. ``I don't think the government should run it and I 
don't think faith-based institutions would permit that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates across the ideological spectrum and party lines have  
been competing to become players in the debate over ``values,'' a 
theme Quayle sounded early; indeed, back when he was vice 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican candidates are actively courting social and religious  
conservatives. An increased emphasis on religious organizations 
also underpins the Democratic campaign of Vice President Al Gore, 
who says such groups can play a larger role in solving problems 
government is trying to tackle, such as moving people to work from 
welfare. 
</P>
<P>
	Quayle also urged greater school choice and additional  
assistance for parents who choose private schools, and said society 
should be more positive about women who choose to be full-time 
mothers. 
</P>
<P>
	``My priority is going to be the American family because  
families are stressed,'' Quayle said. ``There's a lot of exhaustion 
out there. We've got a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While Quayle was stumping through central Iowa, his wife,  
Marilyn, attended a suburban tea held by Bobbie Gobel, head of the 
Iowa Christian Coalition.

<HEADLINE> NBA Players Skeptical of Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- A minimum age for playing in the NBA is  
out of the question as far as the players' union is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
	The union ended its annual meeting Thursday opposed to an  
absolute age restriction. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't want an absolute limit,'' said Michael Curry of the  
Milwaukee Bucks. ``We want something that's fair to those who are 
ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is we're not going to accept an age limit,''  
said Brent Barry of the Chicago Bulls, a member of a six-man union 
committee formed to address the issue of players as young as 18 
coming into the league. 
</P>
<P>
	Players threw out several ideas, saying the league could form  
some sort of minor league system similar to the one in baseball so 
that younger players can develop their games rather than sitting on 
the ends of NBA benches. 
</P>
<P>
	At least one player called for mandatory college education  
programs for players entering the NBA out of high school. Another 
proposed a mentor program using retired players who want to stay 
involved in the league. 
</P>
<P>
	``There isn't a one-rule-for-everyone answer,'' said Danny  
Schayes of the Orlando Magic. ``We need a system with the right 
alternatives for the right guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The union also formed a committee to respond to the proposed  
rules changes for the 1999-2000 season. One new rule would give a 
player five seconds to pass or shoot. Another would limit most 
defensive contact on the perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
	Many players said the changes ignored the root of the problem  
that has caused the trend toward low-scoring games. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of us are old enough to remember 120-point games,'' said  
the 40-year-old Schayes, who entered the league in 1981 and plans 
to play at least two more years. ``From what we've seen of these 
new rules, they're barking up the wrong tree. There's a false hope 
if they think this is going to change the pace of the game. We're 
not in desperate need of rules changes, we need a fresh approach to 
the offensive style of play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schayes and union delegates Herb Williams, 41, and Eddie  
Johnson, 40, have been around long enough to see the league go from 
the high-octane, run-and-gun style of the early 1980s to the 
defensive-oriented, offensively-challenged style of the late 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Antonio Davis was a member of a special 16-member NBA committee  
that discussed proposed rules changes in June. At that meeting, 
Miami Heat coach Pat Riley proposed eliminating the 3-point shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Most players said the new 5-second rule and the defensive  
hands-off rule could merely end up causing more fouls, more free 
throws and less free-flowing action. 
</P>
<P>
	``I played for a team in Denver that didn't have a single  
24-second violation all season,'' Schayes said. ``Defenses had much 
more leeway then, and we were still able to score. What's happened 
is that teams now play their hardest on defense and rest on 
offense. We want to look for ways to reinvigorate the pace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The players also voted Thursday that no player, from the  
lowest-paid rookie to the highest-paid superstar, will be exempt 
from paying the so-called escrow tax -- up to 10 percent of their 
paychecks -- to the owners in the final three years of the current 
six-year collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Such a tax will kick in if owners pay more than 55 percent of  
basketball-related income to the players in the 2000-01 season.

<HEADLINE>  Killer Rains Swamp Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A powerful summer storm transformed this  
simmering desert city into a raging river that swamped hundreds of 
cars, smashed mobile homes and killed at least two people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide strip of devastation,'' Gov. Kenny Guinn said  
after taking a helicopter tour of flooded areas Thursday evening, 
when the water finally started to recede. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be more of the same today: The National Weather  
Service placed the Las Vegas Valley under a flash flood watch until 
9 p.m. PDT, warning of the possibility of more heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas isn't used to this kind of downpour, with 3 inches  
falling in just a few hours Thursday. The Las Vegas area usually 
receives slightly more than 4 inches in an entire year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron McQueen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,  
said it was the city's worst flooding in 15 years: Water turned 
parts of Interstate 15 into a lake, most intersections were under 
water much of the day and firefighters rescued stranded motorists 
from their waterlogged cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was picking up cars and throwing them around like  
toothpicks,'' said Robert Anderson, who watched as his neighbor's 
mobile home was swept away. ``It was a huge double-wide and it just 
went into the water and it just disintegrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County Fire Department spokesman Steve La-Sky said  
hundreds of cars were trapped in high water and at least three 
mobile homes had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain appeared to have led to the deaths of two people, a man  
whose body was found in a flood channel and a woman who died in a 
traffic accident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists sought shelter in the casinos along the famed Strip.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Strip is a lake, up over the curbs, into our fountains,''  
said Phil Cooper, spokesman for Caesars Palace hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the casino was closed.  
</P>
<P>
	Flights at McCarran International Airport were shut down for 45  
minutes, and two planes were diverted to Los Angeles, airport 
spokeswoman Cynthia Markson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare. It's one of the worst things I've ever  
seen,'' said Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Flabi. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding could have been much worse if not for a flood  
control program that was initiated in 1987 and has cost $400 
million to date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't begin to estimate what would have happened if these  
flood controls were not in place,'' Gale Fraser, general manager of 
the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, said today. ``I 
know it would have been a lot worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system is made up of huge detention basins that capture  
flood water and control the release eastward across the valley into 
Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will take another 25 years and $1 billion to  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilles Bloch, a tourist from France who watched the flooding  
from his hotel room at the Sahara hotel-casino, described the city: 
``Looking out the window, it looked like a beautiful woman who had 
been crying, and all the makeup was running down her face. That's 
Las Vegas today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in California, monsoon rains flooded roadways and  
fields in southern parts of the state, sending children into the 
streets of Hemet for improvisational surfing on water boards tied 
behind pickup trucks.

<HEADLINE> Tea Reduces Heart Attack Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- An apple a day may keep the doctor away, but  
researchers now say a daily cup of tea could do the job just as 
well, reducing the chance of a heart attack by 44 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The study by Dr. Michael Gaziano, a heart specialist at the  
Harvard Medical School-affiliated Brigham and Women's Hospital in 
Boston, suggests that may be because tea contains powerful amounts 
of flavonoids, natural substances that make blood cells less prone 
to clots, which can cause heart attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	Flavonoids also are one of the most powerful antioxidants, which  
offset the damaging effects of oxygen in the body, such as fatty 
deposits in the arteries. Scientists have recently become excited 
about the potential benefits of flavonoids, which number about 
4,000 and are also found in fruits, vegetables and red wine. 
</P>
<P>
	While earlier studies have suggested that tea-drinking could be  
good for the heart, the latest findings, presented Thursday at a 
Royal Society of Medicine conference in London, are the most 
comprehensive and indicate the most dramatic effect. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaziano found that people who drank one or more cups of tea a  
day slashed their risk of heart attack by 44 percent, compared with 
those who did not drink tea. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is, in my view, quite an astonishing outcome,'' said Dr.  
Catherine Rice-Evans, an antioxidant researcher at King's College, 
London, who was not connected with the study. ``These are very 
exciting results.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the study did not compare the benefits of one cup versus  
two, three or four, and the question of how much tea to drink, and 
how strong it should be brewed for the greatest benefit, is still 
open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
	John Folts, a University of Wisconsin heart specialist who  
studies the effects of flavonoids on the heart and was not involved 
in the study, said he thinks it would take more than one cup of tea 
a day. His studies on dogs have indicated that six cups of tea 
daily are needed to prevent a blood clot in the coronary artery. 
</P>
<P>
	Gaziano's study examined 340 men and women who had suffered  
heart attacks and matched them by age, sex and neighborhood with 
people who had never had a heart attack. It then investigated their 
coffee- and tea-drinking habits over the course of a year. 
</P>
<P>
	The study involved regular tea from black tea leaves, as opposed  
to green or herbal teas. Scientists say black tea contains more 
powerful flavonoids than green tea, while herbal teas are not known 
to contain any. 
</P>
<P>
	Other studies have shown that it doesn't matter if milk, sugar  
or lemon are added to the tea. There also is no difference between 
drinking it hot or cold, or preparing it with loose tea leaves, tea 
bags or granulated crystals, said Dr. Paul Quinlan, a biochemist 
who heads the Brook Bond tea company's health research unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Few of the study subjects drank one beverage exclusively, so  
they were categorized by their strong preferences. 
</P>
<P>
	The study was adjusted for factors that could have skewed the  
results, such as smoking, exercise, alcohol intake and family 
history of heart trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Total calories consumed, intake of fatty foods and body mass  
index -- which compares the girth of people of different heights to 
determine obesity -- was about the same across the board. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists have not compared the flavonoid benefits of tea with  
those of red wine, made famous by research showing that the French, 
with red wine as a staple, have lower rates of heart disease 
despite their penchant for high-fat food. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Quinlan warned that tea is only part of a regimen for  
cutting heart attack risk and should not be seen as a substitute 
for eating fruits and vegetables, giving up smoking, cutting fat 
intake or other heart-healthy habits. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, which was paid for by the U.S. National Heart, Lung  
and Blood Institute, also found that coffee had no effect on heart 
attacks, regardless of whether it was decaffeinated.

<HEADLINE> Mojave Desert Courts Dreamworks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Cities have been scrambling to lure the  
DreamWorks SKG studio since Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg 
and David Geffen scrapped their $250 million Playa Vista proposal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mojave Desert community of Lancaster offered Thursday to  
give 40 acres to DreamWorks for its headquarters, noting films such 
as ``Terminator,'' ``Lethal Weapon,'' ``Independence Day'' and 
``Armageddon'' were filmed there. 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks spokeswoman Jennifer Gonring said executives were  
aware of Lancaster's offer, but she said there was no hurry to make 
a decision. 
</P>
<P>
	DreamWorks abandoned plans to build their new studio and  
headquarters in the $8 billion Playa Vista development, citing 
changes in their financing plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have always maintained we would move forward with Playa  
Vista only if the financial terms of the deal made good business 
sense for DreamWorks,'' Katzenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lancaster isn't alone in trying to woo DreamWorks, the company  
responsible for ``Saving Private Ryan'' and ``The Prince of 
Egypt.'' The studio now has operations scattered at Glendale, 
Universal City and Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
	Glendale, Santa Clara and Burbank City are among those who have  
made a pitch, or are planning to. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Los Angeles hasn't given up.  
</P>
<P>
	Dan Margolis, a spokesman for Mayor Richard Riordan's office of  
economic development, said DreamWorks is a priority for Los 
Angeles, which had offered more than $70 million in incentives for 
the Playa Vista site. 
</P>
<P>
	One possible site is the North Hollywood Studio Project, where  
developer J. Allen Radford has been cleared to build 10 
soundstages, two 20-story towers and a business campus.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 43.06; Nasdaq Up 11.58 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as investors  
remained on guard amid fluctuations in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 43.06 at 11,169.95, flirting with a new record high. The 
blue-chip index shifted course several times during the session. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were mostly higher. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 6.19 at 1,400.61. The Nasdaq composite 
index was again in record-high territory, up 11.58 at 2,783.44. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially benefited from a recovery in the bond market  
that followed a volatile session on Thursday. But stocks faltered 
as bonds swung in thin trading, due largely to the pricing of a 
massive, $8.6 billion bond offering by Ford Motor and its Ford 
Motor Credit unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices evened out as the market digested the impact of the new  
corporate supply. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which 
had spiked as high as 6.03 percent at noon, edged back to 5.98 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks recovered along with bond prices. DuPont led the Dow  
higher, rising 3 to 71 1/2 after the company unveiled some details of 
its spinoff of its Conoco unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer led technology issues, rising 2 29/64 to 42 25/64  
after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were mostly higher, many market participants were  
watching their moves ahead of next week, when the government's 
producer and consumer price indexes, which are key measures of 
inflation, are scheduled to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	The market is also awaiting the next round of corporate profit  
reports. While the second quarter is expected to produce robust 
earnings, analysts say many market participants have already bid 
stocks higher in anticipation of strong numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 555.78 million 
shares, down from 657.43 million shares Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 2.43 at 656.48, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 2.43 at 811.12. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000, which measures the performance of smaller  
companies, rose 1.55 to 456.30.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Shootings Leave 4 Dead, 1 Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- A factory worker shot and killed three  
teen-age girls at his home, then gunned down his Bible study 
teacher five miles away, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were searching for Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, who  
fled in his car and was believed to have several guns, including 
four rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A 22-year-old woman escaped Hensley's home after being shot in  
the legs and shoulder. She was hospitalized in serious condition 
and was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw her coming across the alley and crawling in the  
neighbor's back yard,'' said Donald Young, 85, a neighbor. ``She 
just kind of pulled herself up through the yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still trying to determine a motive for the  
shootings, which happened during the late afternoon Thursday in 
Sidney, a community of 19,000 people 40 miles north of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	The three teen-agers were found dead inside Hensley's one-story  
house, which he shared with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found 24 Molotov cocktails lined up on a workbench in  
the basement. They appeared to contain gasoline, according to bomb 
squad members who detonated the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Steven Wearly said Hensley knew the victims, although he  
did not say why they were at his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Kimbler and Tosha Barrett, both 16, had been shot several  
times at close range with a shotgun. Amy Mikesell, 14, who is 
Kimbler's cousin, was found stabbed and hidden in the basement. 
Police said Sherry was a neighbor to Hensley. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett R. Wildermuth, 37, was shot and killed at his house. He  
knew Hensley through home Bible study classes he taught, said the 
Rev. Ben Davis, pastor of First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have no reason to have contact with Mike or to even  
help Mike if it wasn't for his faith in Christ,'' Davis said. 
``Mike went to him for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Hensley, a church member for about a year, had  
problems but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly wanted to break from his past,'' the pastor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said the 22-year-old survivor identified Hensley as the  
gunman and said he left the house with his wife, Julie, in their 
car. Police believe the victims were shot before Mrs. Hensley 
arrived home and that she did not know the bodies were there. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hensley remained at Wildermuth's house after he was shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Hensleys had been married two or three months.  
Hensley has a young son who doesn't live with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley, a worker at the Glacier Daido America automotive parts  
plant in nearby Bellefontaine, was considered an employee in good 
standing, said Jeff Wheeler, quality assurance manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But a former co-worker described him as ``weird.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He made us stop one night to look at road kill on the road,''  
said Lisa Perin, 31, who lives across the street from the Hensleys. 
``He thought that was so fascinating. He started taking the parts 
out of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it would be neat to hurt somebody and watch them  
die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Donna Parisse, 24, saw a different side.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to be a very nice guy. He was always out working in  
his yard, riding his bike,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He once found some money and brought it to her house across the  
street to see if it belonged to her, Parisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt uncomfortable around him.''

<HEADLINE> DVDs Getting Filmmakers' Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Even as they're shooting, filmmakers are  
looking ahead at the extras they can offer viewers on DVD that they 
won't get in theaters or on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Directors including Robert Altman, Werner Herzog and Bill Condon  
said Friday they are enthralled with the possibilities of digital 
video discs, which allow studios to enhance films with commentary, 
widescreen and TV-formatted versions and documentaries on the 
making of the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most directors nowadays, even those who haven't paid much  
attention to video, now are forced to,'' said movie critic Leonard 
Maltin, who moderated a panel on the new format at the Video 
Software Dealers Association convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them are thinking ahead about video even as they're  
making the film,'' Maltin said. 
</P>
<P>
	While shooting ``Kansas City,'' Altman worked up a 75-minute  
documentary on the jazz music used in the movie. Altman said he 
hopes to include the documentary on the DVD release. 
</P>
<P>
	``A great thing about this is that you can see other aspects of  
the film you didn't see in the theater,'' he said. ``If they want 
that, they can have it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The DVD release for Herzog's 1982 film ``Fitzcarraldo'' allowed  
him to enhance the sound and add a German-language version. 
</P>
<P>
	DVDs resemble compact disks but can hold far more information,  
with room for such added footage as director and actor interviews, 
movie trailers and scenes from the cutting-room floor. They offer 
sharper sound and images than VHS videos, and viewers can skip 
around easily, without having to fast-forward or rewind a tape. 
</P>
<P>
	DVDs are expected to eventually displace videotapes in the same  
way CDs replaced vinyl records. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of DVD players in U.S. homes has quadrupled in the  
last year to about 2 million, according to the Consumer Electronics 
Manufacturing Association. Some industry analysts say the number 
could reach 4 million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of DVD movies are running at about 10 percent of the $8  
billion videotape market, according to industry estimates, while 
DVD rentals lag behind that. 
</P>
<P>
	DVD critics say that until an affordable player that also can  
record comes on the market, videotapes will not go the way of vinyl 
records. Low-end DVD players cost $300 or less, but those that can 
record onto disks remain out of most consumers' price range. 
</P>
<P>
	Some retailers also say customers will not trade in their  
videotape libraries as readily as they did vinyl records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got customers who own thousands of videos,'' said Ray  
Hoving, who owns Rodeo Video in Victorville, Calif. ``They're not 
going to dispose of them just like that because of a new format.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the industry say there could be a peaceful coexistence  
between videotapes and DVDs for a number of years, with consumers 
having both types of machines wired to their televisions. 
</P>
<P>
	``People are still happy with VHS,'' said Bo Andersen, president  
of the video association. ``I think it's going to be a dual 
invention for some time.''

<HEADLINE> Cities Call For Milosevic's Removal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Adding strength to a growing  
anti-government movement, two more cities -- including Serbia's 
third largest, Nis -- passed declarations today calling for the 
resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	The move by city assemblies in Nis and Sombor, in southern and  
northern Serbia, followed similar declarations by city governments 
in other towns and cities, including Novi Sad, Serbia's second 
largest city. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's hardline supporters, meanwhile, are intensifying  
a counter-campaign that accuses the opposition of treason and of 
attempting to provoke a civil war in Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
	About 4,000 people demonstrated Thursday in the southern Serbian  
town of Prokuplje, brawling briefly with a handful of the 
president's supporters and ignoring gunshots fired in the air to 
disrupt the demonstration. It was the latest in a series of almost 
daily protests aimed at bringing down Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will chase him (Milosevic) out,'' pledged Goran Svilanovic,  
a top figure in the Alliance for Change, an umbrella group of 
opposition parties that organized Thursday's rally and others in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The influential Serbian Orthodox Church has sided with the  
opposition and has itself called for Milosevic to resign. The 
Church is alarmed that hundreds of churches, monasteries and other 
symbols of Serb heritage in Kosovo are now in danger from vengeful 
ethnic Albanians. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition parties are trying to capitalize on the growing  
discontent among Serbs over the loss of historic Kosovo province to 
ethnic Albanian separatists after Yugoslavia capitulated to NATO's 
widely destructive 78-day bombing campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``They put shame on us, killing and burning in our name,''  
Svilanovic said referring to atrocities committed by Milosevic's 
forces in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	``Too much evil has been done for them to be forgiven. It is too  
little to just demand that they leave, we must make them leave,'' 
said historian Milan Protic, another alliance activist. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite a plan by Milosevic loyalists to hold a parallel,  
counter-rally at the same time in this town, 120 miles south of the 
capital, Belgrade, only about a dozen of the president's supporters 
showed up, most of them elderly, and traded insults with the 
protesters. 
</P>
<P>
	One protester was slightly injured in a brief shoving match  
between the groups. The government supporters later left and 
displayed a banner on a nearby roof calling the protesters 
``traitors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With memories of the NATO bombing still fresh, Milosevic has  
sought to portray his opponents as traitors and stooges of the 
West, particularly of the United States. The accusations, pushed by 
state-run media, have made it difficult for opposition parties to 
advocate Western-style democracy and reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	The government paints the protests as a Western plot to  
destabilize Yugoslavia and to bring ``anarchy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dragan Tomic, a top aide to Milosevic and the Serbian Parliament  
speaker, said ``there are some who want to see Serbia burn once 
more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tomic charged that President Clinton ``is using the people he  
can buy and pay.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You can hear them asking for the removal of our president,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in Prokuplje, a town of 20,000 people, Milosevic opponents  
appeared more numerous than his supporters. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hunger is spreading through Serbia and 80 percent of the  
people live in poverty. Meanwhile, they (the government) have 
robbed all they could,'' said Vuk Obradovic, a former Yugoslav Army 
general who has became an outspoken Milosevic critic and opposition 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
	``In a few weeks, we will be in the streets day by day until he  
goes from power,'' said Zoran Djindjic, the top protest leader and 
head of the Democratic Party. ``We need a respectable government 
that can establish ties with the world, we need investments and 
reconstruction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Thursday, Djindjic toured Kosovo, where he met with  
representatives of the dwindling Serb community that continues to 
flee the province because of the effective ethnic Albanian 
takeover. 
</P>
<P>
	A debate continues in Serbia whether the de facto loss of Kosovo  
and ensuing exodus of Serbs from the province is the result of NATO 
intervention and Kosovo Albanian separatism or of Milosevic's 
brutality in dealing with ethnic problems in the province. 
</P>
<P>
	During his visit to Kosovo, Djindjic blamed Milosevic but was  
given a hostile reception by some of the remaining Serbs there. 
About 100 of them booed him and called him a traitor for leaving 
the country for weeks during the NATO air raids.

<HEADLINE> Religious Baseball Trial Nears End </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAGERSTOWN, Md. (AP) -- A baseball team humiliated and exploited  
an agnostic fan when it denied him a $2 admission discount reserved 
for those who brought church bulletins to a Sunday home game, the 
man's lawyer said Friday in a closing argument. 
</P>
<P>
	But a lawyer for the minor league Hagerstown Suns painted  
activist Carl Silverman as a crazed publicity hound whose religious 
discrimination complaint defies common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Administrative Law Judge Georgia Brady said she would rule by  
mid-October on a charge by Silverman and the state human-rights 
office that the church bulletin promotion violates Maryland's law 
against religious discrimination in places of public accommodation. 
They want the judge to bar the 6-year-old promotion, fine the club 
$500 and order sensitivity training for its staff. 
</P>
<P>
	American Civil Liberties Union lawyer Michael Berman said  
Silverman, a stay-at-home father from nearby Waynesboro, Pa., is 
following in the footsteps of Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King in 
peacefully protesting a violation of civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays, ``sent  
out a message that religious people are more welcome than others at 
their games,'' Berman said. 
</P>
<P>
	Suns lawyer Joseph A. Schwartz III countered that the team  
encourages everyone to attend games with a variety of promotions. 
``We've got promotions every day of the week, in every way,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schwartz said Silverman could have gotten another discount, and  
saved even more than $2, if the church bulletin promotion offended 
him. Instead, Silverman offered the ticket agent a copy of the 
federal anti-discrimination law. 
</P>
<P>
	``What sort of craziness is that to present to somebody?''  
Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is the case over $2? Sure, it's over $2, but that's not what  
it's about for Mr. Silverman,'' Schwartz said. ``It's the klieg 
lights. It's the smell of the crowd. It's the brightness of the 
lights.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Berman said expecting Silverman to use another discount program  
because of his agnostic creed was reminiscent of separate-but-equal 
racial accommodations, which the Supreme Court outlawed in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled Suns owner Winston Blenckstone's testimony when  
asked whether he would go to a Ku Klux Klan meeting just to get a 
bulletin to qualify for discounted admission to another event. 
Blenckstone said he wouldn't, because he didn't agree with the 
Klan's views. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Suns are telling Carl Silverman he has to violate his  
creed,'' Berman said. ``They're willing to humiliate him for 
profit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silverman filed the complaint after paying $8, instead of a  
discounted family admission price of $6, when he took his two 
daughters to a Suns game on Easter Sunday 1998.

<HEADLINE> Arbitration Panel Sides With U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- An arbitration panel on Friday rejected a  
Canadian air transport company's $50 million claim that the United 
Nations unfairly blocked it from bidding on U.N. contracts, but 
found ``serious flaws'' in the way the U.N. did business. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyLink Aviation Inc., of Toronto said it was satisfied with the  
ruling because it blamed the U.N.'s internal oversight office for 
incompetence in accusing the company of wrongdoing and suspending 
it from the bidding process. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us the whole thing was a matter of getting our credibility  
back after being suspended,'' SkyLink Manager Jan Ottens said. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyLink had sought compensation for what it said was ``an  
organized, systematic vendetta'' to keep the company out of U.N. 
contracts to transport U.N. troops and equipment to missions around 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyLink had won the bulk of such contracts in the early 1990s  
when U.N. peacekeeping was at its all-time high -- with an estimated 
70,000 troops in places such as Cambodia, Angola and Mozambique. 
</P>
<P>
	SkyLink claims it won 80 percent of U.N. contracts because it  
offered the best services at the cheapest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	But SkyLink was suspended from the list of vendors allowed to  
bid on contracts in 1993 for alleged ``safety issues'' after a 
competitor, U.S.-based Evergreen, raised questions about the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	At that same time, eight U.N. officials in the procurement  
office were suspended for having favored SkyLink in awarding 
contracts. Independent tribunals eventually overturned the 
suspensions of the officials, saying the charges were baseless. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1994 settlement between SkyLink and the United Nations over  
that matter and unpaid bills owed SkyLink resulted in the U.N. 
payment of $6.9 million to the company and a promise to conduct 
``normal business relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the case before the independent arbitration panel, SkyLink  
accused the United Nations of breaching the ``normal business'' 
agreement by suspending the company from bidding for contracts 
again in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The internal oversight office had recommended the suspension  
based on allegations of wrongdoing and possible suggestions that 
SkyLink provided false documentation to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel, however, found that SkyLink hadn't proved the United  
Nations acted in bad faith in ordering the suspension, and awarded 
SkyLink no money. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel did, though, find that the reports from oversight  
office were ``seriously flawed and not of the quality one would 
expect from an organization of the U.N.'s stature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The panel recommended the United Nations consider the findings  
if SkyLink were to re-apply to be on the list of vendors.

<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many companies are having trouble finding  
skilled workers as the nation's unemployment rate hovers at its 
lowest levels in three decades, top economic forecasters said in a 
survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Association for Business Economics conducted the  
quarterly survey in which 61.8 percent of the companies polled in 
June reported difficulty finding skilled workers to fill vacancies. 
In an April survey, 59.2 percent of the companies said they were 
short of skilled workers, and in a January poll, 52.5 percent 
reported problems. 
</P>
<P>
	However, only 9.8 percent of the companies polled reported  
problems finding unskilled workers, down from 11.7 percent in April 
and 12.5 percent in January. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey of business conditions for the second quarter of this  
year was based on responses from 111 of the association's 3,000 
members, mainly economists from a wide variety of businesses 
including manufacturing, financial services and utilities. A margin 
of error was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, the Labor Department reported that the nation's  
unemployment rate was at 4.3 percent in June, slightly higher than 
the month before but still at a remarkably low level. 
</P>
<P>
	The survey also found that for the first time in a year, more  
companies said they increased prices than decreased them. 
</P>
<P>
	About 28 percent polled in June said they increased prices, and  
10.5 percent lowered prices. In April 16.7 percent said they raised 
prices, and 18.5 percent lowered them. In January 11.3 percent said 
they increased prices, 21.8 percent lowered them. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about their pricing expectations for the rest of the  
year, 52 percent polled in June said they expected their companies 
to raise prices, 13 percent expected to lower them and 35 percent 
expected no changes.

<HEADLINE>  Third Astronaut To Walk on Moon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OJAI, Calif. (AP) -- Former astronaut Charles P. ``Pete'' Conrad,  
who in 1969 became the third man to walk on the moon, uttering an 
exuberant ``Whoopee!'' as he stepped on the lunar surface, died in 
a motorcycle accident. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, who also flew two Gemini missions in the 1960s and  
commanded first Skylab mission in 1973, crashed on a turn Thursday 
on Highway 150 near Ojai and died five hours later at Ojai Valley 
Community Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Flags at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., and at  
Johnson Space Center in Houston flew at half-staff today in 
observance of Conrad's death. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, who lived in Huntington Beach near Los Angeles, was on a  
trip to Monterey with his wife, Nancy, and friends, Ventura County 
Deputy Coroner James Baroni said. 
</P>
<P>
	Baroni said Conrad's injuries didn't initially appear to be  
severe, but he got worse after arriving at the hospital. He had 
some chest pain and had more trouble breathing. 
</P>
<P>
	``He showed that he had some type of internal bleeding and they  
needed to do exploratory surgery,'' Baroni said. But doctors were 
unable to revive him. An autopsy performed today determined he died 
from internal bleeding caused by chest and abdominal injuries, the 
deputy coroner said. 
</P>
<P>
	Just this spring, Conrad joked that he was looking forward to  
the day he would turn 77. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully expect that NASA will send me back to the moon, as  
they treated Sen. (John) Glenn. And if they don't do otherwise, 
why, then I'll have to do it myself,'' he declared in an interview 
with The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn became the oldest person in space at age 77 aboard the  
shuttle Discovery last year. Like Glenn, Conrad's passion for space 
exploration never diminished. In 1995, he formed several companies 
with the goal of commercializing space. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going back to space as an entrepreneur, trying to  
create ways for rockets to launch inexpensively and manage 
satellites,'' Mrs. Conrad said Thursday evening. She had been 
riding on another motorcycle at the time of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know anyone that was filled with more irrepressible  
enthusiasm and sense of humor and new ideas and general joy of life 
than Pete,'' Glenn said today. ``He was an outstanding pilot and 
astronaut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He recalled how Conrad spoke excitedly a few weeks ago about a  
small executive jet he was thinking of buying. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was just an enthusiastic guy about everything he did. It  
was just infectious,'' Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA selected Conrad, an aeronautical engineer and Navy test  
pilot, as an astronaut in 1962, three years after the first seven 
astronauts were announced. He piloted the eight-day Gemini 5 
mission in 1965, which set an endurance record in orbiting the 
earth. A year later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11, which docked with 
another craft during orbit and set a space altitude record of 850 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of the Apollo 12 mission in November 1969, Conrad  
earned the distinction of being the third man to walk on the moon 
after bringing the lunar module down in the moon's Ocean of Storms. 
</P>
<P>
	The first two moonwalkers were Neil Armstrong and Edwin ``Buzz''  
Aldrin, who landed there 30 years ago this month, on July 20, 1969. 
Armstrong's first words became famous: ``That's one small step for 
(a) man, one giant leap for mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When the 5-foot-6 Conrad stepped onto the surface four months  
later, he exclaimed with his trademark sense of humor: ``Whoopee! 
Man, that may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a long one 
for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad and astronaut Alan Bean spent seven hours and 45 minutes  
on the lunar surface. Among their tasks was installing a nuclear 
power generating station to provide a power source for long-term 
experiments. 
</P>
<P>
	During the 28-day Skylab flight in May-June 1973, Conrad  
established a personal endurance record for time in space by 
bringing his total flight time to 1,179 hours and 38 minutes. He 
called his last mission in space the most satisfying, working to 
repair the damage Skylab suffered during its liftoff. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he worked as  
chief operating officer of American Television and Communications 
Corp. in Denver and later for McDonnell Douglas Corp., the aviation 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his numerous awards were the Congressional Space Medal of  
Honor, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, two NASA Exceptional 
Service Medals, two Navy Distinguished Service Medals and two 
Distinguished Flying Crosses. He was enshrined in the Aviation Hall 
of Fame in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
	The Philadelphia native is the third of the 12 original moon  
walkers to die. James Irwin of Apollo 15 died in 1991 and Alan 
Shepard of Apollo 14 died a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	In reflecting on the upcoming 30th anniversary of Apollo 11,  
Conrad recently said, ``Time flies when you're having fun, and I've 
been having fun for the last 30 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, who divorced his first wife, is survived by his second  
wife, three sons and seven grandchildren. A son preceded him in 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	Funeral arrangements were pending.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard Benedict, executive director of the Astronaut Scholarship  
Foundation and a former Associated Press aerospace writer, recalled 
that Conrad's moon-bound rocket generated its own lightning and was 
struck by two bolts seconds after liftoff. Conrad calmly called 
down, ``I think we got hit by lightning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the electrical power was knocked out, but it quickly  
came back on. Conrad quipped that for a while, it looked like a 
lit-up pinball machine.

<HEADLINE> Soccer: Rockin' With Team USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Was it Ricky Martin? The Backstreet  
Boys? Bruce? 
</P>
<P>
	No, just the U.S. Women's World Cup team. Well, not JUST them. A  
crowd of perhaps 2,000 certainly treated the soccer players like 
rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans mobbed the bus as it pulled into the parking lot at  
Pomona-Pitzer College. They chanted the players' names as they 
stood behind makeshift fences during practice. They begged for 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99 might not be for another few weeks, but this crowd  
didn't need Dave Matthews when it had Michelle Akers. Britney 
Spears can stay home; Briana Scurry was there. Lilith Fair? How 
about Kristine Lilly? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome to see this,'' U.S. star Mia Hamm said as she  
surveyed a scene that also included policemen on motorcycles, about 
150 media members and Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden. ``It creates 
an extremely different atmosphere, to say the least. When we were 
in residency camp in Florida, if we had six people at the training 
site, it was a lot. Now, it's like at a game. It gets us excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it should. No team in recent memory has inspired such  
reactions, certainly not over a three-week period. The Americans 
have drawn record crowds -- a sellout approaching 90,000 is certain 
for the final against China on Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
Television shows ranging from SportsCenter to the evening news 
programs to David Letterman have discovered them. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, SRO at practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on rickety bleachers at one end of the field was a  
gray-haired man with a very familiar face: Malden. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' said the 87-year-old actor whose  
granddaughter goes to the college. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real positive thing to see people looking to sports  
figures like these women as role models,'' said Lt. Gary Jenkins of 
the Claremont Police Department, a member of the motorcycle brigade 
handling security. ``They've taken that role seriously and done a 
great job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of practice, the players sat on the motorcycles and  
took pictures with the police. Defender Christie Pearce even took a 
short ride on one of the bikes, which were used to form a motorcade 
when the players' bus arrived at the school. California's Highway 
Patrol also escorted the bus to and from the team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a blast for us,'' Shannon MacMillan said. ``They were  
cheering and chanting our names the whole time. When the bus pulled 
up, they ran along side, and when it moved up some more, they ran 
up some more. We had to have the policemen riding motorcycles by us 
just to get us to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see them share the enthusiasm.''  
</P>
<P>
	While the majority of the crowd was comprised of young girls,  
many wearing Mia Hamm No. 9 jerseys, there was a fair number of 
adults present. That impressed Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me the little girls are not dragging their  
parents here and dragging them to the games,'' she said. ``The 
parents are seeing how soccer has taken off and they have done well 
in getting the kids out to the games. They feel their daughters 
should see high-quality soccer and they are seeing it in the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, few of the fans were able to get autographs as  
officials chaperoned the players out a back way to their bus. The 
Chinese team already was on the field and an organizing committee 
official said they were annoyed that their practice was delayed. 
Any remaining fans were shooed away by security as the Chinese held 
a closed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly, playing in her third World Cup, opened her eyes  
wide as she surveyed the size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more people here at practice than at our first games  
in the '80s,'' she said. ``That tells you how much interest there 
is.''

<HEADLINE> Orioles' Ripken To Play in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cal Ripken's $6.3 million option for the  
2000 season was exercised by the Baltimore Orioles on Friday, 
giving baseball's iron man at least one more year in his brilliant 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who turns 39 next month, entered Friday night's game  
against Philadelphia with a .311 average, 12 homers and 36 RBIs. He 
will make his 17th consecutive All-Star appearance and 16th 
straight start for the American League on Tuesday at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the start of the season, I had a number of things hanging  
over my head, and the contract situation was one of them,'' said 
Ripken, who didn't want to talk about his contract until something 
more important was taken care of -- batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was an uncomfortable situation,'' he said. ``But after I  
sort of got myself physically back and got my focus back mentally, 
the contract thing sort of took care of itself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken, who played in a record 2,632 consecutive games before  
asking out of the lineup last Sept. 20, is 53 hits shy of 3,000 and 
four homers away from 400. 
</P>
<P>
	``Those are big numbers,'' Ripken said. ``Three thousand hits,  
that's a number that we as baseball fans have come to understand as 
a magical number.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken was batting .179 when he went on the disabled list for  
the first time in his career with lower back pain on April 20. 
Though some critics thought it was time for Ripken to retire, he is 
batting .332 since coming off the DL and has hit in 27 of his last 
35 games with a .345 average. 
</P>
<P>
	He had the first six-hit game of his career on June 3, going  
6-for-6 against Atlanta. Ripken admitted Friday that his stint on 
the DL and his poor start scared him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had never been on the DL,'' Ripken said. ``I didn't know how  
I was going to react, how I was going to feel. ... The season 
started with a major injury. There was a lot of uncertainty.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripken signed a two-year extension on April 3, 1997. The Orioles  
had until the All-Star break to exercise the option for 2000 or pay 
a $2.5 million buyout. Ripken had wanted three years guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
	Had the Orioles decided not to pick up the option -- a  
possibility that only would have presented itself if Ripken's 
performance had continued to slide -- Ripken wasn't sure how he 
would've responded. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've had a long and very fulfilling career to this point,''  
Ripken said. ``I probably would have done the very best I could the 
second half and when the season was over, re-evaluated my 
situation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles general manager Frank Wren, who made the announcement,  
didn't make it clear why it wasn't done in Baltimore Thursday on 
the team's day off. Then again, Veterans Stadium is the sight of 
one of Ripken's many milestones. He won his only World Series 
championship at the stadium in 1983, when Baltimore beat the 
Phillies and Ripken caught the last out -- a line drive by Garry 
Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one great memory here, the ending of the World Series  
in '83,'' Ripken said. ``There was a great celebration in that 
clubhouse, and a great feeling of satisfaction. I was fortunate 
enough to get there and play on a championship team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Orioles owner Peter Angelos issued a statement about Ripken's  
option. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very proud to have an individual of Cal Ripken's  
stature with us throughout his illustrious career,'' Angelos said. 
``His accomplishments are unparalleled and he will always be 
thought of as one of the greatest Orioles of all-time.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Astronaut Charles Conrad Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OJAI, Calif. (AP) -- Charles P. ``Pete'' Conrad Jr., an American  
astronaut who was the third man to walk on the moon, died Thursday 
after a motorcycle accident near Ojai. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad was riding his motorcycle with friends when he crashed on  
a turn, Ventura County Deputy Coroner James Baroni said. Conrad, 
who lived in Huntington Beach near Los Angeles, died later at an 
Ojai hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of the Apollo 12 mission in 1969, Conrad earned the  
distinction of being the third man to walk on the moon. Along with 
astronaut Alan Bean, Conrad spent seven hours and 45 minutes on the 
lunar surface.

in 1962. He was the pilot of the Gemini 5 mission in 1965, which 
set an endurance record in orbiting the earth. A year later, Conrad 
commanded Gemini 11, which docked with another craft and featured 
space walks by another pilot. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, who was an aviator in the U.S. Navy after graduating  
from Princeton University, also flew in the first manned Skylab 
mission, in 1973. During this mission, he established a personal 
endurance record for time in space, with 1,179 hours and 38 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with The Associated Press over Memorial Day  
weekend at Kennedy Space Center, Conrad said he was looking forward 
to the day he turned 77. 
</P>
<P>
	``I fully expect that NASA will send me back to the moon as they  
treated Sen. (John) Glenn, and if they don't do otherwise, why, 
then I'll have to do it myself,'' he declared. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from NASA and the Navy, he worked as chief  
operating officer of American Television and Communications Corp. 
in Denver and later for McDonnell Douglas Corporation, the aviation 
manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, he formed his own company called Universal Space Lines  
and several sister companies with the goal of commercializing 
space. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was going back to space as an entrepreneur, trying to  
create ways for rockets to launch inexpensively and manage 
satellites,'' said his widow, Nancy Conrad. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad is survived by his wife, three sons and seven  
grandchildren. A son preceded him in death.

<HEADLINE> PBS Remembers the Quest for Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Remember the glory days of the space program,  
when the thrill of exploration spurred this nation to reach for the 
moon? 
</P>
<P>
	Never happened.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any idea that the Apollo program was a great voyage of  
exploration or scientific investigation is nuts,'' says Frank 
Borman, who rode Apollo 8 to the dark side of the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	``People just aren't that excited about exploration. They were  
sure excited about beating the Russians.'' 
</P>
<P>
	This is one of the lessons of ``To the Moon,'' a two-hour  
``Nova'' special (airing Tuesday at 8 p.m. EDT on PBS) that follows 
the space program from the birth of Project Mercury to the moment -- 
more than a quarter century ago -- when man last stepped on the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Caught up in a Cold War that yielded no victories on the  
battlefield, fearful that the Soviet Union would dominate in space, 
the United States threw itself into a decade-long race for the 
moon. 
</P>
<P>
	Along the way, ``Nova'' shows how the National Aeronautics and  
Space Administration took some chances. 
</P>
<P>
	Frank Borman describes how he had to fly to Houston in 1968 for  
a conversation too sensitive for the phone. There, he was told that 
American intelligence had learned that the Soviets were planning to 
send men to orbit the moon by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Borman, James A. Lovell Jr. and William A. Anders had been  
scheduled to take Apollo 8 into Earth orbit; now their mission had 
changed. They were going to the moon, to beat the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
	Anders notes that there were three equally probable  
possibilities: They might make it to the moon and back; they might 
fail, but survive; they might fail and die, their lifeless bodies 
circling the moon every two hours for eternity. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, ``I was ecstatic,'' Lovell says. ``For me, the idea of  
going to explore a new planet far outweighed the fear of something 
going wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's plenty of right stuff of that sort throughout ``To the  
Moon.'' There are laughs, too: Borman and Lovell sang ``Put Your 
Sweet Lips a Little Closer to the Phone'' to each other again and 
again during the two weeks they were shoehorned into a Gemini 
capsule. 
</P>
<P>
	``Two weeks being with Frank Borman anyplace was a real  
challenge,'' jokes Lovell, one of the grand personalities of the 
space program. 
</P>
<P>
	But there are many nervous moments, too. Eugene A. Cernan spent  
an exhausting two hours walking in space, trying desperately to 
control his movements. He lost 10 1/2 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
	Thomas P. Stafford recalls being told that should Cernan die, he  
must bring the body back, for the good of the space program: ``We 
can't afford to have a dead astronaut floating around out there,'' 
he was told. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem, Stafford says, is that he had no way to bring a  
dead astronaut back into the capsule. He would have had to re-enter 
the Earth's atmosphere with the hatch open and the body tethered to 
the spacecraft. He would have died, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorry, he said. I'll have to cut him off.  
</P>
<P>
	Cernan did not die, but three astronauts lost their lives in a  
fire on the launch pad in 1967. An explosion on Apollo 13 very 
nearly marooned three others in space. Neil Armstrong overshot the 
lunar landing site and needed all his pilot's wiles to avoid 
landing in a field of boulders. 
</P>
<P>
	Again and again, we see the men of mission control -- and they  
are all white men, with white shirts and narrow ties -- standing at 
consoles with their hearts in their mouths. 
</P>
<P>
	Decades later, it is easy to forget just how risky it all was.  
They didn't know if the machines would work. They didn't know if 
the human body would endure space. They didn't know what they would 
encounter out there. 
</P>
<P>
	They also did not know that the Soviet Union would never send a  
manned spacecraft to the moon, or that the Soviet colossus itself 
would not survive the Space Age. So they pressed test pilots into 
service as Cold Warrior astronauts, held their breath and shot for 
the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	They made it, but the space race is not all they won.  
</P>
<P>
	Astronauts who initially scoffed at the science side of their  
flights became eager geologists, collecting rocks that pointed to a 
long-ago collision between a Mars-sized meteor and the Earth that 
created the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	They brought poetry back, as well. Apollo 8 captured  
breathtaking photos of Earthrise, and on Christmas Eve the whole 
world heard astronauts read from Genesis as they circled the moon. 
In a strife-filled time, mankind was reminded that it shared a 
gorgeous planet. 
</P>
<P>
	With detente, the Cold War eased. Suddenly, there was no money  
to send men to the moon. Cernan was the last man to leave his 
footprint there, on Dec. 19, 1972. ``May America's challenge of 
today forge man's destiny of tomorrow,'' he said as he departed. 
</P>
<P>
	``War talk by men who have been in a war,'' Mark Twain once  
wrote, ``is always interesting; whereas moon talk by a poet who has 
not been in the moon is likely to be dull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, Twain's words come from long ago, when a lunar voyage  
was merely the stuff of dreams. He could not imagine that when we 
finally reached the moon, it would be with warriors, not poets. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------

	`STREETS OF LAREDO': The five-hour miniseries adapted from Larry  
McMurtry's sequel to his novel, ``Lonesome Dove,'' will be 
rebroadcast on CBS, Sunday (9 to 11 p.m. EDT) and Wednesday (8 to 
11 p.m. EDT). The film stars James Garner as Captain Woodrow Call,

elusive Mexican bandit. Call is joined on this hunt by his old 
corporal, Pea Eye Parker (Sam Shepard); the railroad's nervous 
accountant, Mr. Brookshire (Charles Martin Smith); an awestruck 
deputy, Ted Plunkert (Tristan Tait); and the brilliant tracker, 
Famous Shoes (Wes Studi). ``Streets of Laredo'' also stars Sissy 
Spacek, Sonia Braga, Randy Quaid, Ned Beatty and George Carlin.

<HEADLINE> Grand Canyon Flight Limits Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Federal officials proposed new restrictions  
Friday for sightseeing flights over the Grand Canyon, including a 
cap on the number of flights and expanded ``no-fly zones'' over 
American Indian cultural sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed Federal Aviation Administration rules would ban  
flights over an area where the Colorado and Little Colorado rivers 
meet that is sacred to both the Hopi and Navajo. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan also would eliminate an air route that passes over  
parts of the Hualapai and Havasupai Indian reservations. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials said the purpose of the restrictions is to restore  
natural quiet to parts of Grand Canyon National Park as required by 
a 1987 federal law sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	Air tour operators say they plan to fight the proposed  
restrictions, claiming they could force tour operators out of 
business and send more aircraft into an area plagued by high winds 
and turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're seeking to move routes in such a manner that there's  
less and less of the Grand Canyon to show people,'' said Steve 
Bassett of the U.S. Air Tour Association. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would limit all annual air tours to the  
number of flights recorded from May 1997 through April 1998, or 
about 88,000 sightseeing flights per year, said Ken Webber of the 
National Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
	The FAA said that the regulations would ensure that 41 percent  
of the park would be free from aircraft noise at least 75 percent 
of the time, up from 32 percent of the park currently. 
</P>
<P>
	But some environmentalists say the proposals don't go far  
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would still fall short of the law's requirement that  
more than half of the park be free of airplane noise, critics of 
the plan say. 
</P>
<P>
	``The park is still going to be noisier than it should be from a  
business that the FAA seems to want to refuse to regulate,'' said 
Rob Smith of the Sierra Club. ``Grand Canyon National Park should 
be a place where nature prevails, not the almighty dollar.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the proposal, each of the 25 air tour operators will be  
limited to the number of flights they offered in the 1997-98 flight 
season, Webber said. More tours will be allowed during the peak 
summer tourist season. 
</P>
<P>
	Area Indian tribes have been pushing for years to have flights  
over their homes and sacred sites restricted. The Havasupai have 
been trying since the 1970s to ban flights over their reservation 
on the south side of the canyon, said the tribe's lawyer, Mike 
Shiel. 
</P>
<P>
	``They feel the Grand Canyon is large enough so they (tour  
operators) don't have to fly over their homes or their religious 
sites and sell tickets,'' Shiel said.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Brandi Chastain is giving something back  
to the kids -- in China. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain, one of five Americans among 16 members of the Women's  
World Cup All-Star team, was given the option of donating $1,000 to 
the SOS Children's Village of her choice. MasterCard, which 
sponsored the team, is donating that amount in the name of each of 
the all-stars to their chosen village. 
</P>
<P>
	Chastain chose China.  
</P>
<P>
	``The times I spent there have been very special for me,'' the  
U.S. defender said Friday as her team prepared for Saturday's final 
against the Chinese. '' The people were very warm and 
accommodating, especially the children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Michelle Akers would like her donation to go to a children's  
village in Israel, while Carla Overbeck chose one in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
	The other U.S. all-stars, Mia Hamm and Briana Scurry, have not  
decided where their donations will go. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *SELLOUTS BRING SCALPERS:* With Saturday's Women's World Cup  
final a sellout -- as many as 90,000 fans could be in the Rose Bowl 
-- scalpers are smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	Tickets went for $45, $65 and $110 for the doubleheader, and  
scalpers are asking as much as $800 for top-priced seats. 
</P>
<P>
	One advertisement on the Internet offered as much as $1,000 for  
a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	Scalping is legal in California, but not at the site of the  
event. In downtown Pasadena, business was expected to be brisk for 
the scalpers on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *CELEBRITY SEARCH:* In addition to the First Famly, celebrities  
expected for the Women's World Cup final include actors Antonio 
Banderas, Melanie Griffith, Elizabeth Shue and Scott Bakula, and 
singer k.d. lang. Actor Karl Malden attended U.S. practice on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Between the third-place and championship games, pop star  
Jennifer Lopez will perform two songs: ``If You Had My Love,'' and 
``Let's Get Loud.'' The U.S. national anthem will be sung by the 
group Hansen. The Chinese anthem will be sung by Lin Liu, a 
24-year-old singer. 
</P>
<P>
	At halftime of the final, English teenage pop singer Billie will  
sing ``She Wants You,'' and the tournament's official song, 
``Because We Want To.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *OLD FRIENDS:* Although they don't speak the same language, U.S.  
forward Tiffeny Milbrett and China goalkeeper Gao Hong have a 
soccer friendship. 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett and Gao both played in the women's J-League in Japan.  
Milbrett spent three seasons there, where she struck up a 
friendship with the outgoing goalie. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is a very happy person,'' Milbrett said. ``She is a little  
more personable than most of their players. We always say hello and 
try to talk to each other (through interpreters).'' 
</P>
<P>
	Milbrett believes Gao will be a key to Saturday's final.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's confident and acrobatic -- very acrobatic,'' Milbrett  
said. ``She comes up with the big save. Hopefully, she won't do it 
against us.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *THIRD-PLACE GAME:* Lost in the hubbub has been the third-place  
game between Norway and Brazil, which precedes the final at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Norway, along with the United States, has been the best team in  
women's soccer this decade. Brazil has been the quickest riser, 
surging from fourth place at the Olympics to bona fide World Cup 
contender in the strongest women's soccer event ever. 
</P>
<P>
	``We promise to make it an entertaining game for the fans,''  
Brazil forward Pretinha said with a smile. ``We like to play soccer 
and we hope they will like to watch us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Jarl Toske, Norway's assistant coach, ``We are building a  
new team, with only six or seven players left from our Olympic quad 
and 12 in their first big international tournament. But we also 
feel we proved something ... that Norway remains a very good 
team.''

<HEADLINE> Fla. Doctors To Be Probed, Profiled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla. (AP) -- Florida doctors with skeletons in  
their closets may soon have no place to hide them. 
</P>
<P>
	The state Department of Health this month will begin sending out  
fingerprinting cards to 60,000 physicians, chiropractors, 
osteopaths and podiatrists so that the FBI can run background 
checks on them. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislature mandated the fingerprinting after a doctor with  
an extensive criminal record was found to be practicing in Florida. 
The law requires all doctors to undergo the checks as a condition 
of getting their licenses renewed. 
</P>
<P>
	Aside from preventing doctors from misrepresenting themselves,  
the checks will make it easier for hospitals, insurance companies 
and other doctors to get background information, health department 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors previously were required to report their criminal pasts.  
</P>
<P>
	The Department of Health this month also began posting profiles  
of doctors on the Internet and by the end of the year will have a 
central database containing information on doctors' credentials. 
</P>
<P>
	Health department officials say Florida is believed to be the  
second state to fingerprint doctors and create an Internet data 
base. Massachusetts also has both programs.

<HEADLINE> N.C. Lighthouse Safely at New Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- As onlookers clapped and cheered, the Cape  
Hatteras Lighthouse today slid onto the concrete pad where its 
caretakers hope it will stand tall for another century, a safe 
distance from the thundering Atlantic surf. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's tallest lighthouse, 208 feet tall, glided over  
rails lubricated by soap to the spot where steel supports will prop 
it up and 140,000 bricks will form its foundation and base. Arrival 
time: 1:23 p.m. EDT. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Matyiko of Expert House Movers of Virginia Beach, Va.,  
exchanged high fives and handshakes with surveyor John Mayne when 
the lighthouse came to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The move began June 17 from its previous home 150 feet from  
ocean. Distance covered totaled more than a half-mile. 
</P>
<P>
	The contractors, National Park Service officials and tourists  
who had watched the tower lumber to its new site were relieved and 
jubilant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously, we're real pleased with it,'' said Joe Jakubik,  
project manager for International Chimney Corp. of Buffalo, N.Y., 
the general contractor. ``I know we have so much to go, but it's 
just a relief, if for no other reason than a happy occasion. It's 
out of the storm path.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those who urged the $10 million move had said a strong hurricane  
might one day topple the lighthouse into the Atlantic if nothing 
were done. Now, it's 1,600 feet away from the surf. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm happy that it's here safe and sound, and we're happy for  
all the guys, for all the hard work they did,'' said Bob Woody, a 
National Park Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	The park service plans to relight the twin beacons, which were  
extinguished March 1 for the first time in 50 years, on Labor Day. 
The lighthouse is to reopen to visitors next Memorial Day. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to move the lighthouse stirred debate among  
visitors and residents over whether it should have been left to the 
perils of the eroding Atlantic shore. 
</P>
<P>
	Like many of the 15,000 visitors who come each day to see the  
lighthouse, John Pfeiffer of Nazareth, Pa., said Thursday he was 
all for moving it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The technology is there to do it, so move it before the  
natural resources take it down,'' Pfeiffer said as he walked to see 
the lighthouse sitting atop a nest of steel beams. 
</P>
<P>
	A local resident, Dave Dudley of Manteo, said the move was an  
amazing engineering feat, but ``they're messing with history.''

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Against Taliban Buck Trend </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The argument seemed to be over. After U.S.  
sanctions were imposed against dozens of wayward countries in 
recent years, an emerging consensus in the administration and 
Congress concluded that such punishment rarely achieved the desired 
result while costing U.S. businesses billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But the administration bucked the trend this week by applying  
sanctions against the Taliban government in Afghanistan for 
harboring suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. officials acknowledge that a policy of economic denial  
against the Taliban is less controversial than it might be 
elsewhere because the economic stakes are so meager -- only $24 
million in two-way trade last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond that, the administration felt it was important to take an  
unambiguous stand against the Taliban, mindful of its links with 
the man held responsible for the bombings of U.S. embassies in 
Kenya and Tanzania last August. The bombings left more than 200 
dead, including 12 Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Politically, the sanctions rile few Americans. Known for its  
strict Islamist rule, the Taliban has banned girls from going to 
school and women from working. 
</P>
<P>
	With the economic stakes small, groups normally hostile to  
unilateral sanctions appear to be giving the administration the 
benefit of the doubt in the Taliban case -- but they worry about 
backsliding to the period of what some call ``sanctions overkill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Given the Taliban's perceived links to terrorism, that situation  
poses ``a very special case,'' says Frank Kittredge, who as 
president of the National Foreign Trade Council has been a leader 
in the fight against unilateral sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	He notes that the anti-sanctions backlash in Congress is such  
that there are 23 pieces of legislation before Congress designed to 
discourage go-it-alone sanctions by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sanctions,'' Kittredge says, ``are rarely if ever  
successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The administration has been responding to the anti-sanctions  
mood. In April, President Clinton announced that he would generally 
exempt food and medicines from unilateral sanctions in the future. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration also has said that unilateral sanctions will  
be a last resort -- coming even after military intervention. It also 
has expressed a strong preference for applying sanctions in concert 
with other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials cite the recent experience with Libya as demonstrating  
the value of multilateral sanctions. Libya agreed this year to turn 
over two suspects wanted in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 
that killed 270 people. The United States had sought the suspects 
for seven years. After Libya surrendered them for trial in The 
Netherlands, the U.N. Security Council immediately suspended 
sanctions against Tripoli. 
</P>
<P>
	The momentum against sanctions seemed to pick up a year ago when  
President Clinton applied congressionally mandated sanctions 
against India and Pakistan after they conducted underground nuclear 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation had been approved to deter such tests but failed  
to do so. Swift congressional action to roll back part of the 
sanctions enabled U.S. traders to secure a wheat purchase from 
Pakistan totaling $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Elliott Abrams, who heads the private Center for Ethics and  
Public Policy, speaks contemptuously of anti-sanctions business 
groups. In effect, they are saying, ``Get morality out of foreign 
policy,'' Abrams says. 
</P>
<P>
	He adds that no criticism is heard from the business community  
when the administration imposes sanctions to protect corporate 
interests. ``They only object to sanctions when somebody murders 30 
priests,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Abrams' position is shared by former Secretary of State George  
P. Shultz. William Mann, author of the book ``About Face,'' says 
that during a trip to China in 1983 Shultz reprimanded U.S. 
businessmen who complained about slow Reagan administration 
approval of export licenses for China compared with Japan or 
Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why don't you move to Japan or Western Europe?'' Shultz asked.

<HEADLINE> Ex-ADM Executive Sentenced to Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former executive of food-processing giant  
Archer Daniels Midland Co. who served as the FBI's undercover 
informant in a major price-fixing investigation was sentenced today 
to 2 1/2 years in prison for his participation in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Whitacre, 41, was sentenced by telephone. He is at a  
federal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year 
sentence for swindling ADM out of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	He and two other top ADM executives -- Michael Andreas and  
Terrance Wilson -- were convicted in September 1998 of conspiring to 
fix the $600 million world market in lysine, a soybean-based 
additive that promotes growth in hogs and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre originally went undercover and wore a wire for  
investigators but later broke with them and was accused of taking 
part in the crime he had helped to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have no case without me, against ADM and its  
executives,'' said Whitacre in court over the phone. ``I risked my 
life and my career for them, and I have yet to see anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning made 10 months in his term  
concurrent with the term he is serving, with the additional 20 
months to be served in addition. She also ordered him to 
participate in a mental health treatment program after his release. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning also heard arguments today from attorneys for Andreas  
and Wilson the length of their sentences. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. District Court jury convicted the three men of one count  
of conspiring with Japanese and Korean rivals to fix the price of 
lysine and limit its production -- a criminal antitrust violation.

	Andreas, 49, is the son of ADM chairman emeritus Dwayne Andreas,  
who in the 1960s built the company into a global agribusiness 
empire. At one point, Michael Andreas was considered heir to the 
top spot within ADM. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 60, is the retired head of ADM's big corn division.  
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre was brought to ADM as chief of its bioproducts division  
to lead the company into the lucrative lysine market. Producing the 
soybean-based product requires a sophisticated technical know-how 
that he claimed to have. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Whitacre who inadvertently launched the FBI investigation  
of the food-processing giant based in Decatur by claiming Japanese 
rivals were sabotaging ADM's move into the $600 million lysine 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre asked top ADM executives for $10 million to buy off  
``Mr. Fujiwara,'' the supposed leader of the saboteurs. Instead, 
company officials called in federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents could find no trace of sabotage. When FBI agents  
asked him about his claim, Whitacre instead told them about a 
conspiracy between ADM and rival companies to fix the price of 
lysine. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre wore a hidden microphone to gather evidence against his  
fellow ADM executives. Prosecutors say the tapes show ``a ruthless 
campaign to make its competitors its friends and treat its 
customers as enemies.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas attorneys insisted that the tapes contained nothing to  
show that their client had taken part in a price-fixing conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for the Wilson, who is heard on tape discussing lysine  
prices with ADM rivals, argued that he was merely playing along 
with Asian manufacturers as they hatched a conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Charges Dumped in Socialite-Dog Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Federal prosecutors have dropped charges  
against a socialite who argued with an American Airlines crew over 
where to stow her dog and ended up being tied to her seat with the 
animal's leash. 
</P>
<P>
	Marcelle Becker was charged with assaulting and interfering with  
a flight crew in the 1995 incident. She could have faced 20 years 
in prison, but prosecutors dropped the charges Wednesday, saying it 
was unlikely Mrs. Becker would repeat her behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	The widow of an insurance magnate was flying first-class from  
New York to Los Angeles with her 8-pound Maltese dog, Dom Perignon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Becker claimed that a flight attendant shoved and kicked  
the dog's Louis Vuitton carrier under the seat before takeoff, even 
though she had bought a ticket for it. 
</P>
<P>
	During the flight, the dog got loose. An argument broke out, and  
the crew said Mrs. Becker became so hostile that they had to tie 
her to her seat. 
</P>
<P>
	She sued the airline for unspecified damages, alleging assault,  
battery, violation of civil rights and cruelty to animals. A jury 
rejected her claims in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The dog died in 1996.

<HEADLINE>  At Least 36 Colombian Soldiers Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GUTIERREZ, Colombia (AP) -- The twisted bodies of dozens of  
soldiers were scattered about a damp, misty pasture outside this 
Andean town today, a day after fierce fighting with leftist rebels 
in mountains just south of the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	Army chief Gen. Jorge Enrique Mora said Friday at least 36  
soldiers died in the clashes, which started when rebels attacked a 
mobile army encampment. The number of rebel casualties was unclear. 
</P>
<P>
	The fighting was unique in that the rebels do not typically  
strike with such large numbers and so close to the capital. 
</P>
<P>
	As reporters surveyed the scene, a dazed 19-year-old soldier  
emerged from the jungle and looked over the fallen soldiers, many 
of whom appeared to have close-range shots to the head. 
</P>
<P>
	Standing over one body, he broke into sobs. ``They've killed my  
brother. They've killed my brother,'' said the young recruit, who 
identified himself only as Freddy and said he survived by hiding 
for three hours Thursday in a river. 
</P>
<P>
	Military leaders portrayed the fighting as a brave defense  
during a rebel drive on Bogota. But the battlefield scene suggested 
another rout by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or 
FARC, Latin America's most powerful rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
	The clashes also appeared to be a strong guerrilla show of force  
less than two weeks before the start of substantive peace talks 
with the government of President Andres Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC has refused a cease-fire and made clear its intention  
of continuing its 35-year insurgency, even as it enters 
negotiations with the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Until the peace process yields clear results, senior FARC  
commander Raul Reyes told The Associated Press this week ``the war 
will continue all across the country.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reyes was interviewed in La Machaca, a village that is part of a  
massive southern region from which Pastrana has evacuated all 
government troops in order to facilitate the negotiations. They are 
set to resume July 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana said Friday he viewed the latest fighting with  
``sadness'' and said the country was tired of seeing ``rivers of 
blood.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Thursday's 12-hour battle broke out after hundreds of FARC  
rebels apparently overran an army camp near Gutierrez, 27 miles 
from Bogota. The army said 600 soldiers squared off against 500 
fighters from the 15,000-member FARC. 
</P>
<P>
	The army claimed at least 38 rebels were killed. But Cesar  
Uruena, a Colombian Red Cross official who surveyed the 
battleground in Gutierrez, said his organization had not located 
any dead FARC fighters. 
</P>
<P>
	However, retreating guerrillas typically remove their fallen  
comrades. 
</P>
<P>
	A local farmer said he was driven from his bed by the fighting,  
which began before dawn and concluded late in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was sleeping, and suddenly I felt as if somebody was setting  
off fireworks by my side,'' said the farmer, who said he was afraid 
to give his name. ``I was scared, and I hid behind the door of the 
house.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The army is struggling to regain the upper hand against the  
FARC, which in the past three years has killed hundreds of soldiers 
and police and taken more than 450 of them prisoner in attacks on 
remote garrisons around the country. 
</P>
<P>
	The FARC controls 40 percent of the Colombian countryside,  
however military analysts say it is far from seizing power.

<HEADLINE> Asian Central Bankers See Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia is showing signs of recovery from its  
economic crisis, but reforms are needed to ensure a real return to 
financial health, central bankers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain risks that the recovery will not be  
sustained,'' said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority, after central bankers from the East Asia and Pacific 
region held a closed-door meeting that lasted much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets around Asia have been soaring in recent weeks,  
though some analysts worry that traders have been unrealistic about 
the prospects for a rebound in some economies. Some blue chip 
indexes have returned to levels unseen since the Asian crisis 
spread in the autumn of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers spent much of their time talking about Japan, the  
biggest economy in Asia that has been mired in recession, Yam told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan needs more fiscal stimulus to restart its economy and  
reform its financial systems if it is to resume its place as the 
growth engine for the region, the bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers said they were basically satisfied with the work  
Asian nations have done to prepare for Year-2000 bug computer 
glitches, but Yam said governments must now focus on boosting 
public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers said they would like to see greater disclosure of  
the movement of private funds moving through the region, although 
the details of setting up a monitoring system are tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to how we could achieve that is another matter,'' Yam said.  
``There is need for further discussion.''

<HEADLINE> Florida Execution Turns Bloody </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STARKE, Fla. (AP) -- As electricity coursed through the body of  
Allen Lee Davis, blood gushed from the mask covering his face, 
poured over his collar and chest and then oozed through the buckle 
holes on the chest strap holding him in Florida's brand-new 
electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	The execution horrified death penalty critics, who moved  
immediately to protect other condemned inmates from what they 
called the barbarity of Florida's electric chair. 
</P>
<P>
	``His death was neither instantaneous nor painless,'' read a  
petition to the state Supreme Court that won a delay of the next 
execution. ``It was certainly the kind of `savage and inhuman' 
spectacle forbidden by the Eighth Amendment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The high court delayed Thomas Provenzano's execution, which was  
scheduled for today, until Sept. 14, so state officials can review 
Davis' death. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses said the blood that covered the front of his white  
shirt appeared to come from his mouth and chest. But state 
officials said it was a nosebleed and insisted Florida's new 
electric chair worked properly during the execution early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing went wrong. The chair functioned as it was designed to  
function and we're comfortable that that worked,'' said Cory 
Tilley, a spokesman for Gov. Jeb Bush. ``The only source of blood 
was from the nose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report stated that Davis -- a 344-pound killer  
nicknamed ``Tiny'' -- had ``several predisposing risk factors'' for 
nosebleeds, including hypertension and arthritis that required him 
to take aspirin and Motrin, both blood-thinners. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis, 54, was sentenced to die for the murders of a pregnant  
woman and her two daughters during a 1982 home burglary. His 
lawyers had tried to stop the execution on the grounds that the 
voltage wouldn't be enough to kill a man of his size quickly and 
painlessly. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Marty McClain said a chart of the voltage showed that  
the current fell short of the 2,300 volts necessary to put someone 
to death humanely. 
</P>
<P>
	Provenzano, 50, won a postponement after arguing that Davis'  
execution demonstrated the electric chair still does not work 
properly. 
</P>
<P>
	The American Civil Liberties Union of Florida called for Bush to  
halt all executions until the state can ensure that they can be 
conducted properly. 
</P>
<P>
	``Florida's record of executions, and the Legislature's  
obsession with electrocution as the method of execution, has been 
barbaric,'' said Howard Simon, the state ACLU's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
	Amnesty International USA said Davis' bloody execution  
``demonstrates that the state's attempt to `improve' the process of 
executions cannot remove the cruelty inherent in state killing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The new chair replaced ``Old Sparky,'' which had been used to  
execute more than 200 people since 1923. The electrical equipment 
on the new chair, however, came from the old one. 
</P>
<P>
	Corrections officials said the old chair was falling apart. In  
1997, flames shot from the head of a condemned man. The problem -- 
later blamed on an error in the way sponges were applied to the 
inmate's head -- led inmates to call use of the chair cruel and 
unusual. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis' death was believed to the first time in 44 Florida  
executions since capital punishment resumed in 1979 that an inmate 
bled. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis was condemned for the slayings in Jacksonville of  
37-year-old Nancy Weiler, who was three months pregnant, and her 
two daughters. John Weiler, the victims' husband and father, 
witnessed the execution. 
</P>
<P>
	``The execution today was a legal, moral and righteous one,'' he  
said. ``I can assure you my God approves.''

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Wins 5th Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMIENS, France (AP) -- Heading north from the Loire Valley to  
Amiens in the Picardy region, the riders of the Tour de France 
passed tantalizingly close to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cipollini, Tom Steels, Jaan Kirsipuu and the other  
sprinters in Thursday's fifth stage may have been tempted to take a 
short cut directly to the Champs-Elysees, where the finale of the 
grand cycling race is always held. 
</P>
<P>
	But the finale isn't for more than two weeks. Before then, there  
will be grueling mountain stages in the Alps and Pyrenees. That's 
when the sprinters will stop shining -- and maybe even drop out 
altogether -- and the climbers will have their moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first week of the Tour de France, with its flat stages,  
always favors sprinters. This year, every one of the first five 
stages has ended in a mass sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu, from Estonia, won the first stage and has maintained  
the leader's yellow jersey since Monday. Steels, a Belgian, won 
stages two and three, and now Cipollini, the Italian also known as 
``King of the Sprints'' and the ``Lion King,'' has won two 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	As befits his regal nicknames, Cipollini clearly is inspired by  
grandeur. With the race passing a royal palace one day and three 
stunning cathedrals the next, the Italian has come alive. 
</P>
<P>
	All this when observers had started to grumble about his  
sluggish performance, and Cipollini had joked about soon being 
unemployed because his team, Saeco, was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have resumed about my future,'' he said Thursday  
after edging Steels to win the fifth stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu was third, Robbie McEwen of Australia fourth and German  
Erik Zabel fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was one of the longest of the Tour, a 145-mile ride  
through rolling wheat fields and occasional bursts of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It approached three grand cathedrals: the Gothic masterpiece at  
Chartres, with its famed stained-glass windows; a graceful one at 
Beauvais, and France's biggest at Amiens, where the stage ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Riding north to the Somme region, where the famous World War I  
battle was fought, Paris was only some 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Wednesday, when a favorable tailwind led to a record  
speed for the stage, the riders faced a headwind Thursday and the 
average speed was almost 6 mph slower, or 25.85 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, Steels moved up to second and  
Australian Stuart O'Grady was in third. American Lance Armstrong, 
on the comeback from testicular cancer, was in fourth, and 
Cipollini was in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Again the stage was marked by an early breakaway, this time at  
the four-kilometer mark. A group of 10 riders made the break and 
gained as much as a 6-minute, 15-second lead, but that soon was 
whittled down by the advancing pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Magnus Backstedt broke out for a brief lead near the  
end. But he was soon overtaken and the race was set for another 
furious, wide-open sprint. Cipollini's Saeco teammates again moved 
him into position, and the Italian sprinted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the talk at the Tour has been mostly about cycling, not  
drugs, which developed into such a monumental scandal last year 
that the Tour was almost scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, the sport's governing body had to deny a  
published report that a Tour cyclist tested positive for a banned 
drug after the race's prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	The French sports daily L'Equipe said one of four riders tested  
was found to have taken corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs 
that are not classed as steroids but are banned except when used 
for legitimate medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	That charge was denied by the International Cycling Union.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was not one positive case,'' UCI spokesman Enrico  
Carpani said.

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Tobacco Cos. in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A state jury said Friday that tobacco  
companies R.J. Reynolds Co. and Brown &AMP; Williamson Corp. were not 
responsible for the ailments that plagued lifelong smoker Robert 
Gilboy until his death in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gilboy's widow and their three children sought $840,000  
for injuries they allege that Gilboy, of Baton Rouge, suffered from 
smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what the jury said. I still think smoking caused  
his death,'' Mrs. Gilboy told reporters after the verdict was 
announced. She has not decided if she will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds hailed the verdict as a significant victory that  
``confirms that juries are still able to apply common sense and 
reasonable judgment regarding tobacco lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came two days after a state jury in Florida handed  
the tobacco industry a major setback by finding the companies 
responsible for making thousands of Florida smokers sick. The 
industry could be forced to pay billions in damages. The case was 
decided under state law, meaning the verdict has little value as a 
legal precedent in other states. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- three were overturned on appeal. In the two others, 
the awards were reduced by judges and the verdicts are being 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Albert Taylor told reporters that the ``evidence  
was too cloudy'' to say that cigarettes were the only cause of 
death. 
</P>
<P>
	The question presented to the jury by Judge Mike Caldwell was  
whether cigarettes caused the death, not whether smoking was a 
factor in the death, said Taylor, an oil refinery supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
	In closing arguments, the Gilboy family attorney argued that  
cigarettes controlled Gilboy to such an extent that he kept smoking 
even after suffering lung and brain cancer. Surgery for brain 
cancer left him weak and confined to a wheelchair, one attorney 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the act of a person in control of his  
facilities,'' said Gere Covert. ``Cigarettes had control of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco company attorneys said Gilboy chose to smoke, even  
though he knew the risks. They also said his death would have come 
whether he smoked or not because a scar on his lung, not smoking, 
caused his cancer. The cancer eventually spread to his brain. 
</P>
<P>
	They also challenged the plaintiffs' contention that Gilboy  
could not stop smoking, saying millions of people quit every day. 
</P>
<P>
	And they noted that Gilboy was cancer-free when he died at age  
64, about seven years after doctors diagnosed him with lung and 
brain cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Cigarettes didn't control Robert Gilboy. He wanted to smoke  
and he didn't want to quit. People make decisions all the time to 
take risks,'' said Gordon Smith, who represented American Tobacco 
Co., now part of Brown &AMP; Williamson. ``His family wants you to pay 
him money for doing what he wanted to do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was conflicting testimony over whether tobacco actually  
caused Gilboy's cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors testifying for the family said smoking caused the  
cancer. Tobacco company attorneys pointed to the testimony of a 
doctor at the LSU Medical School in New Orleans who said Gilboy's 
cancer was caused by a scar on his lung, not by smoking.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Move Upward; Dow Up 33.56 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today as interest  
rates declined in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At 11 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 33.56 at 11,1160.45, erasing half of its 60-point loss of 
Thursday 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were marginally higher. The Nasdaq  
composite index was up 1.02 at 2,772.88, while the Standard &AMP; 
Poor's 500 index was up 2.04 at 1,396.46. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks benefited from a recovery in the bond market. Prices had  
dropped Thursday, pushing yields higher and reminding investors 
that higher interest rates are taking hold in the economy, and 
could threaten earnings in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, bond prices advanced and the yield fell to 5.98 percent  
from 5.99 percent late Thursday. That helped boost bank and 
financial services stocks, including Merrill Lynch, which rose 1/2 to 
77 1/4, and Citigroup, up 1/2 to 48 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont led the Dow higher, rising 2 1/8 to 42 1/16 after the  
company unveiled some details of its spinoff of its Conoco unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer led technology issues, rising 3 9/16 to 42 1/16  
after Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were higher, many market participants were watching  
their moves ahead of next week, when the producer and consumer 
price indexes, which are key measures of inflation, are scheduled 
to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 222.6 million 
shares, down from 254.7 million shares Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 1.26 at 655.31, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.05 at 809.74.

<HEADLINE> Clash Over Plane Crash Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The National Transportation Safety Board and  
the nation's major airlines are developing a plan to streamline the 
delivery of information about airline crashes in the era of 24-hour 
newscasts. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitment came Thursday, following a meeting between the  
board's chairman, Jim Hall, and the chairman of American Airlines, 
Donald Carty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect some kind of agreement in the next couple of  
months,'' said NTSB spokesman Jamie Finch. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting was prompted by a sharp exchange of letters between  
the safety board and the airline after the June 1 crash of an 
American jet in Little Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline held two news conferences the day after the crash  
before the board had a chance to brief reporters. The airline said 
it was merely defending its reputation and trying to avoid 
speculation from media commentators. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the disclosures made by American: The captain, not the  
co-pilot, was flying the plane, and he was among the 11 people 
killed in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar revelations triggered immediate criticism from Hall,  
whose federal agency investigates transportation accidents and has 
traditionally been the sole source of information. 
</P>
<P>
	``If every party conducted press conferences like this, the  
public would be confronted with a series of often contradictory 
statements about an ongoing accident investigation and would be 
deprived of authoritative information from the only independent 
body charged with investigating the tragedy -- the National 
Transportation Safety Board,'' Hall wrote to Carty on June 2. 
</P>
<P>
	In a reply two days later, Carty said the airline had been  
careful to disclose only factual information. He also complained 
that the board's media practices are out of date. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mr. Chairman, the board's rules and procedures for conducting  
accident investigations cannot place an air carrier in the position 
with its multiple stakeholders of being evasive, unwilling to 
disclose facts that are reasonably expected to be in the purview of 
the carrier or less than 100 percent candid and honest,'' Carty 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unfortunately, the board's rules with respect to dealing with  
the media have contributed in recent years to increasingly negative 
perceptions of the airlines involved in investigations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trans World Airlines was accused of poor treatment of relatives  
after the explosion of TWA Flight 800 over New York's Long Island 
three years ago, which killed 230 people. ValuJet renamed itself 
AirTran when numerous safety problems were found after one of its 
planes plunged into the Florida Everglades in May 1996, killing 
110. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no question that your reputation is on the line,''  
said United Airlines spokesman Joe Hopkins. ``People need to be 
reassured that we have a safe operation, that we feel badly for the 
victims' families and that we will take care of them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those concerns run up against a modern reality: Cable news  
networks such as CNN and all-news sites on the radio and Internet 
have created a 24-hour news cycle. 
</P>
<P>
	A newsmaker can no longer wait until the late afternoon or early  
evening, as the safety board has traditionally done, to meet with 
reporters and give them information just before deadlines for the 
nightly news or morning newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's always prime time somewhere in the world,'' said William  
Gaillard, communications chief for the International Air Transport 
Association, a trade group representing 265 international airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you're not there, someone else who knows precious little  
will begin to speculate,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Rothschild Collection Up for Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lured by the Rothschild name, dealers and  
collectors paid a total of $90.7 million at auction for paintings, 
furniture and ornaments collected by the Austrian arm of the 
banking dynasty and seized by the Nazis during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	During frenetic bouts of bidding, most lots sold for far more  
than their reserve prices, making the Christie's sale the biggest 
auction ever held in Europe. The gilded collection, which included 
clocks, rugs and scientific and musical instruments as well as 
armor, fetched more than double what the auction house had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was exceptional interest,'' said Alexander Hope, who  
arranged the auction for Christie's. ``This is a fairly unique 
opportunity to buy a part of what was the greatest collection of 
its kind in Europe in the 19th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Hindlip, chairman of Christie's, said most of the items  
sold were purchased by European buyers, although Americans bought 
21 percent of the lots. Names of buyers were not immediately 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the more important items were three portraits by the Dutch  
master Frans Hals, including one of the Amsterdam merchant Tieleman 
Roosterman, splendid in a black suit with white ruff and cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	It fetched $12 million, more than double the $5.5 million  
expected. The painting has been described as ``one of the most 
splendid representations of the self-confident, rich, slightly 
parvenu, middle-class Dutchman.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A richly illuminated century Latin missal dated around 1503 and  
printed on vellum sold for $4.04 million. It had been expected to 
fetch $234,000 to $312,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A Book of Hours, or prayerbook, made in Flanders in the early  
16th century sold for $12.14 million -- well over the estimate of 
$4.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The salesroom burst into applause when an ornately decorated  
wooden commode, or cabinet, that was commissioned by Louis XVI and 
later furnished his private library at Versailles was purchased for 
$10 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Not all the items were so large and lavish. Louis XIV's  
gilt-handled shaving brush fetched $9,600. 
</P>
<P>
	The 250 items collected by barons Nathaniel and Albert von  
Rothschild evoke the sumptuous lifestyles of the rich in 
fin-de-siecle Vienna, when the Austrian scions of the 250-year-old 
banking dynasty were among the foremost collectors in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
	With their brother, Ferdinand -- who worked in the London branch  
of the family's financial houses -- Nathaniel and Albert inspired 
the term ``le gout Rothschild,'' a reference to their predilection 
for works of surpassing quality, frequently with a royal 
connection. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nazis seized the Rothschild collection soon after annexing  
Austria in March 1938. They then set about ruining the family 
financially by destroying their factories and investments. 
</P>
<P>
	The collection remained hidden for most of the war, mostly in  
salt mines, and was recovered by American soldiers after the 
hostilities ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, it has been in the hands of the Austrian government,  
which put it on display in the country's museums and libraries. It 
finally agreed to return it to the Rothschild family in February, 
to right what it called an ``immoral'' wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	Rothschild heirs sold the treasures because they no longer have  
sumptuous homes where they can display them.

<HEADLINE>  Third Astronaut To Walk on Moon Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad, the  
third man to walk on the moon and the only one to shout 
``Whoopee!'' as he hopped onto its dusty surface, was killed in a 
motorcycle accident, leaving life the way he lived it: traveling 
fast. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	The fun-loving, irrepressible Conrad crashed his 1996  
Harley-Davidson on a curve along a winding mountain road Thursday 
near Ojai in Southern California and died at a hospital of internal 
bleeding from chest and abdominal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Apollo 12 in November 1969, Conrad flew two Gemini  
missions in the mid-1960s and commanded NASA's first space station, 
Skylab, in 1973. He later worked as an aerospace executive and 
formed a company aimed at making spaceflight as common as a jet 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	Six weeks ago, in an interview with The Associated Press in  
advance of this month's 30th anniversary of the first manned moon 
landing, by Apollo 11, Conrad said he couldn't be happier and was 
looking forward to old age. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time flies when you're having fun, and I've been having fun  
for the last 30 years. I've been having fun for a lot longer than 
that,'' said Conrad, who lived in Huntington Beach, Calif., and 
went by Pete even though his real name was Charles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ever the joker, Conrad couldn't resist a playful jab at John  
Glenn, who became the oldest person in space last October: ``I am 
looking forward to when I'm 77. I fully expect that NASA will send 
me back to the moon as they treated Senator Glenn, and if they 
don't do otherwise, why, then I'll have to do it myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Flags flew at half-staff at Kennedy Space Center and other NASA  
installations in observance of Conrad's death. 
</P>
<P>
	``America has lost one of the great aviators and explorers of  
the 20th century,'' NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin said. ``He 
embodied the `can-do' spirit of NASA, taking on problems and 
dealing with them without a lot of fuss.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Apollo 11's Buzz Aldrin, the second man to walk on the moon,  
called Conrad a ``tireless pioneer ... enamored with `pushing the 
envelope.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Glenn said that he spoke with Conrad three or four weeks ago and  
that Conrad was considering buying an executive jet and was excited 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't know anyone that was filled with more irrepressible  
enthusiasm and sense of humor and new ideas and general joy of life 
than Pete,'' Glenn said. ``He'll be missed very much.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad always spoke his mind. To prove that NASA bureaucrats  
weren't telling astronauts what to say when they stepped onto the 
moon, he bet an Italian journalist $500 that he would declare: 
``That may have been a small one for Neil, but that's a hell of a 
step for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was a takeoff on Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong's line  
four months earlier, on July 20, 1969: ``That's one small step for 
man, one giant leap for mankind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Once he reached the moon, the 5-foot-6 Conrad cleaned up his  
language, but the essence remained. 
</P>
<P>
	``Whoopee!'' Conrad shouted as he descended the ladder of his  
lunar lander on Nov. 19, 1969. ``Man, that may have been a small 
one for Neil, but that's a long one for me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He claimed he never saw the $500.  
</P>
<P>
	Howard Benedict, a former Associated Press aerospace writer who  
is now executive director of the Astronaut Scholarship Foundation 
near Cape Canaveral, said Conrad stood out among the Gemini and 
Apollo astronauts because of his keen sense of humor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was fun-loving and he always had a smile, that famous gap  
tooth of his sticking out,'' Benedict said. ``He always seemed to 
enjoy life and he also could be very serious.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Benedict recalled Conrad's reaction after the Apollo 12 rocket  
was struck by lightning seconds after liftoff. Most of the 
electrical power was knocked out but quickly came back on, 
prompting Conrad to quip that it had looked like a lit-up pinball 
machine in the cockpit for a while. 
</P>
<P>
	Born in Philadelphia, Conrad received a bachelor's degree in  
aeronautical engineering from Princeton University in 1953. He then 
joined the Navy and became a naval aviator. He attended the Navy 
Test Pilot School at Patuxent River, Md., and later served there as 
a test pilot, flight instructor and performance engineer. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA picked him for its second group of astronauts in 1962,  
three years after the seven original Mercury astronauts were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad served as pilot of Gemini 5 in 1965, flying with Gordon  
Cooper. He went on to command Gemini 11 in 1966. His crewmate was 
Dick Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of Apollo 12, Conrad flew to the moon with Alan  
Bean and Dick Gordon. Conrad and Bean spent nearly eight hours 
exploring the lunar surface and 31 1/2 hours on the surface 
altogether, as Gordon circled the moon in the command module. 
</P>
<P>
	The three remained good friends after Apollo 12 -- unusual for a  
space crew -- and even called one another on the anniversaries of 
their flight. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad considered his 28-day Skylab mission the most challenging  
and satisfying of all because of repairs he and his crew made to 
salvage the space station, which was crippled during launch. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973.  
</P>
<P>
	``The moon didn't do anything for or against me, didn't change  
any of my ideas,'' he once said. ``I tell you, the most attention I 
ever got was in 1974 or 1975, right after I retired, when I did one 
of the original `You don't know me' American Express commercials.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After NASA, Conrad's passion for space exploration never  
diminished. 
</P>
<P>
	During the mid-1990s, he was flight manager for McDonnell  
Douglas Corp.'s prototype rocket that took off and landed 
vertically. NASA passed over it in a competition for a replacement 
for the space shuttle, instead choosing Lockheed Martin Corp.'s 
horizontally landing spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Conrad formed Universal Space Lines Inc. in Newport  
Beach, Calif., with the hope of making spaceflight available to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty years after the Wright brothers flew, in 1943, even if  
we were in the middle of a war, you could go buy an airline ticket, 
OK? It's been 41 years now since NASA was formed, and you can't buy 
a ticket anywhere in space,'' Conrad said. ``Commercial space is 
just barely beginning to be able to go, but we have wasted 30 
bloody years, if you want my take on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad is the third of the 12 moonwalkers to die. Apollo 14's  
Alan Shepard died last July following treatment for leukemia. 
Apollo 15's Jim Irwin died of a heart attack in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad is survived by his wife, Nancy, who was riding another  
motorcycle at the time of the accident; three sons; and seven 
grandchildren.

vertically. NASA passed over it in a competition for a replacement 
for the space shuttle, instead choosing Lockheed Martin Corp.'s 
horizontally landing spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Conrad formed Universal Space Lines Inc. in Newport  
Beach, Calif., with the hope of making spaceflight available to 
everyone. 
</P>
<P>
	``Forty years after the Wright brothers flew, in 1943, even if  
we were in the middle of a war, you could go buy an airline ticket, 
OK? It's been 41 years now since NASA was formed, and you can't buy 
a ticket anywhere in space,'' Conrad said. ``Commercial space is 
just barely beginning to be able to go, but we have wasted 30 
bloody years, if you want my take on it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad is the third of the 12 moonwalkers to die. Apollo 14's  
Alan Shepard died last July following treatment for leukemia. 
Apollo 15's Jim Irwin died of a heart attack in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad is survived by his wife, Nancy, who was riding another  
motorcycle at the time of the accident; three sons; and seven 
grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Silverbulletday Ready To Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OCEANPORT, N.J. (AP) -- Silverbulletday isn't only scaring rivals  
away -- the wonder filly also has the places where she races 
worried. 
</P>
<P>
	Monmouth Park announced Friday it will not offer show wagering  
when Silverbulletday faces what appears to be four mediocre rivals 
in the 1 1-16-mile Monmouth Breeders' Cup Oaks on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Track spokesman Steve Schwartz said it would be impossible to  
estimate how much money the track might have lost allowing show 
wagering, but it seems likely the track would lose based on 
Silverbulletday's record. 
</P>
<P>
	The filly has won 11 of 13 starts, finishing out of the money  
only twice in her career. The last time was in her last race, a 
seventh-place finish in the Belmont Stakes June 5 in her deubt 
against males. It ended her seven-race winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's her old self,'' trainer Bob Baffert said in a telephone  
interview from California earlier this week. ``She is ready. The 
Belmont Stakes is over, and she is over it. She will show that. We 
don't get on a plane unless we know she will show (her best), and 
she will show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's champion 2-year-old filly has won eight graded  
stakes races. The other four fillies in the field -- Bag Lady Jane, 
West's Secret, Chatter Patter and Boom Town Girl -- have combined 
for none. 
</P>
<P>
	Bag Lady Jane, the 5-1 second choice, has one stakes win,  
capturing a race restricted to Canadian-bred horses last year. She, 
however, has what appears to be controlling speed and she has been 
on the grounds getting acclimated for 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday arrived at the track Tuesday, and she had  
trouble gettting there from Kentucky. Her flight was delayed, and 
then there was traffic getting from New York City's Kennedy 
International Airport to the track on the New Jersey shore. The 
temperature also was 100 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Silverbulletday drew the outside post and will be ridden by  
Jerry Bailey and carry 121 pounds. Friday morning, she had her 
usual strong gallop. 
</P>
<P>
	Bag Lady Jane drew the rail. The Frank Stronach-owned filly will  
carry 116 pounds including Aaron Gryder. 
</P>
<P>
	Completing the field are West's Secret, Stewart Elliott, 114;  
Chatter Patter, Joe Bravo, 112, 20-1 and Boom Town Girl, Tommy 
Turner, 121.

<HEADLINE> Civil Rights Leader Farmer Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- James S. Farmer, a civil rights  
pioneer who pushed for nonviolent protest to dismantle segregation 
and served alongside Martin Luther King Jr., died Friday. He was 
79. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer, who had been in ill health in recent years, died at a  
hospital, according to Ron Singleton, a spokesman for Mary 
Washington College where Farmer was a professor. No further details 
were available. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an authentic activist willing to challenge obscene laws  
and unfair customs through nonviolent direct action,'' said the 
Rev. Joseph Lowery, former head of the Southern Christian 
Leadership Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was an authentic activist. He challenged injustice at its  
root,'' Lowery said. ``He was willing to take to the streets and 
stimulate and precipitate. He was a catalyst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer had taught at Mary Washington College since 1985, and  
battled pneumonia and complications from diabetes that included 
blindness for the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the founders of the Congress of Racial Equality in  
1942, Farmer was called one of the Big Four civil rights leaders in 
the 1960s, with King, NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League head 
Whitney Young. Farmer was the last surviving member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	``James Farmer helped to make America a better nation and I was  
saddened to learn of his death today,'' President Clinton said in a 
statement from Beverly Hills, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer's most celebrated accomplishment as head of CORE was to  
lead the 1961 Freedom Rides, a nonviolent effort to desegregate 
interstate buses and terminals. However, participants encountered 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer helped recruit CORE members James Chaney, Andrew Goodman  
and Michael Schwerner, all of whom were murdered in Mississippi in 
1964 during the Freedom Rides. Their slayings were the subject of 
the 1988 movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the early 1960s, Farmer often faced threats of violence  
himself. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who said he wasn't afraid during the civil rights  
movement was either a liar or without imagination,'' he said in a 
1991 interview. ``I think we were all scared. I was scared all the 
time. My hands didn't shake but inside I was shaking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last year presented Farmer with the  
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a high honor, and I'm grateful it came before I died,''  
Farmer said when he learned of the award. ``It's a vindication. I 
certainly was ignored and forgotten.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer was born in Texas and grew up in Mississippi. He entered  
Wiley College in Marshall, Texas, in 1934 as a 14-year-old 
freshman. He graduated from theological school at Howard University 
in 1941. He was a conscientious objector during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer remembered isolated incidents of racism during his  
childhood, but it wasn't until he was at Wiley that he began to 
agonize over segregation. After college, he worked for the 
Fellowship of Reconciliation and started contemplating how to 
change racist practices in America. He became a proponent of 
Mahatma Gandhi's nonviolent methods, something King later espoused. 
</P>
<P>
	Division within CORE over leadership and direction led Farmer to  
resign in 1966, and he settled into a quieter life. He taught at 
Lincoln University and New York University. Later he made an 
unsuccessful run for Congress against Shirley Chisholm, who by 
defeating Farmer became the first black woman to serve in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer moved to the Fredericksburg area in 1980 to write his  
autobiography, ``Lay Bare the Heart.'' The book charted his 
involvement in that struggle, and also his personal observations 
about gradually going blind from a rare ailment called retinal 
vascular occlusion. 
</P>
<P>
	``He is simply irreplaceable,'' said Kweisi Mfume, president of  
the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. 
``James Farmer leaves this century as one of a few select men and 
women to be responsible for great change. His legacy begs that he 
not be forgotten.''

<HEADLINE> Consumer Groups Want Privacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Consumer advocates on Thursday said that  
financial privacy legislation passed in Congress is far too weak to 
offer meaningful protections and urged President Clinton to push 
for more reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people are counting on you to protect their  
privacy,'' the advocates said in a letter to Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	The privacy legislation passed by the House last week was lumped  
together with a sweeping overhaul of financial institutions that 
would allow banks, securities firms and insurance companies to 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumer groups say allowing large financial institutions to  
become even larger heightens the need for better financial privacy 
provisions. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill, sponsored by Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, would  
bar financial institutions from providing a customer's personal 
data to outside firms if the customer chose. But even if a consumer 
stipulated that he did not want his information distributed, they 
could still share the data with banks and other institutions with 
whom they are affiliated. 
</P>
<P>
	With those affiliations being given permission to grow even more  
under the House bill, the privacy provision has a glaring loophole, 
advocates said. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't hide behind this minimalist approach that doesn't do  
much,'' said Consumers Union counsel Mary Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials with Consumers Union and the U.S. Public Interest  
Research Group say that supporting the bill would be an endorsement 
of widespread sharing of private information. 
</P>
<P>
	The House bill would also allow banks to share their customers'  
personal data with outside companies marketing financial products 
on their behalf. It would not require the institutions to tell 
consumers what kind of data they were collecting about them. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate has passed legislation which allows for financial  
mergers but it did not include privacy measures like the House's 
version. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., is the sponsor of a separate 
financial privacy measure in the Senate, but it has stalled in the 
Senate Banking Committee.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Film Celebrates Disco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Many Americans associate Singapore with  
discipline, stodginess and flogging. But the city-state's first 
movie export to the United States is a tribute to disco, of all 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Singaporean film shown commercially outside the tiny  
country is set for its U.S. premier on Aug. 6, director Glen Goei 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``That's the Way I Like It,'' the film deals with the  
1977 arrival of the Western disco craze in Singapore and its impact 
on the straight-laced Asian society. 
</P>
<P>
	Goei said he hopes the film will counter Singapore's reputation  
as a dull country famous for its ban on chewing gum sales and its 
1994 caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that Singapore is not that sterile. They don't really  
live in a totalitarian regime. There's disco there,'' Goei told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The film portrays a tough guy who takes to worrying about his  
hair, wearing satin shirts and entering dance contests. 
</P>
<P>
	It was released in Singapore last year under the title ``Forever  
Fever.'' Some critics said it was a blatant knockoff of the 1977 
American film ``Saturday Night Fever,'' but Goei makes no 
apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an obvious homage to Saturday Night Fever and all things  
disco,'' he said. ``We don't try to pretend it's completely 
original.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After premiering in Los Angeles and New York on Aug. 6, the film  
will be shown in the rest of the United States and 29 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Miramax paid $2.65 million for the rights.

<HEADLINE> Fisk Home Run Ball Sold at Auction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Carlton Fisk's home run ball that won Game 6 of  
the 1975 World Series sold for $113,273 on the first day of 
Leland's two-day auction of sports memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	The 12th-inning homer, one of the most dramatic in Series  
history, is remembered for Fisk waving his arms frantically at the 
ball, as if trying to keep it in fair territory as it sailed toward 
the wall in Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	The home run gave Boston a 7-6 victory and tied the Series at  
three games apiece. Cincinnati won Game 7 the next night. 
</P>
<P>
	Fisk's home run ball hit the foul pole, bounced back onto the  
field, and was retrieved by Cincinnati left fielder George Foster, 
who has had it since that game. The identity of the purchaser was 
not released by Leland's. 
</P>
<P>
	The ball was the final item sold at the auction on Thursday.  
Also sold were a ball Mickey Mantle hit off the facade at Yankee 
Stadium on May 30, 1956, and a 1977 World Series ring presented to 
John DeLorean, who then was a partner in the ownership of the New 
York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mantle ball, the closest any ball has come to being hit out  
of Yankee Stadium, went for $58,033 and the DeLorean ring sold for 
$20,373. 
</P>
<P>
	Bidding continued Friday with the centerpiece of the auction the  
uniform Lou Gehrig wore on July 4, 1939, the day he made his famed 
retirement speech at Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening bid on the Gehrig uniform was $295,000.

<HEADLINE> Trammell Wins University Hurdles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) -- Terrence Trammell  
brought some good, old-fashioned showmanship to the otherwise 
sedate University Games Friday night while winning the men's 
110-meter hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
	The American wore yellow sunglasses despite the onset of dusk,  
preened before settling into the starting blocks, and strutted 
across the finish line with arms spread, as if begging the sparse 
crowd at Son Moix Stadium to cheer his relatively pedestrian time 
of 13.44 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammel, the NCAA champion, stumbled over the first two hurdles  
and trailed before rallying to beat Belgium's Jonathan Nsenga, the 
runner-up in 13.51. Dawne Wallace of the United States was third. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been coming from behind all year. I was determined to win  
and caught (Nsenga) at the last hurdle,'' said Trammell, who will 
team with Coby Miller, winner of the 200 meters Friday in 10.32, 
and rising star John Capel in the 400 relay Tuesday. Capel sat out 
the 200, his best event, to rest for the 100 and relay. 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell qualified for the hurdles final at the USA  
Championships last month, but didn't finish that race. 
</P>
<P>
	``This gold is a big step,'' the South Carolina sophomore said.  
``It's my first international event. This sets the stage. Now I'm 
planning to get to the (2000) Olympics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trammell celebrated with a victory lap, draped in an American  
flag. There weren't many people to shower him with applause, 
though: Less than 250 spectators were at 25,000-seat Son Moix. 
</P>
<P>
	Two University Games records were broken in track and field.  
</P>
<P>
	World record-holder Mihaela Melinte defended her women's hammer  
throw title with a heave of 243 feet, 7 inches, the sixth-best 
effort in history. Cuba's Daymi Permi ran her heat of the women's 
400-meter hurdles in 54.57, slicing .37 seconds off the games 
record. The final is Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other events, South African Frantz Kruger's final throw of  
219-6 won the men's discus, beating Americans Andy Bloom and Doug 
Reynolds; Romania's Monica Dinescu cleared 6-4 3/4 to win the women's 
high jump, and Belgian Kim Gevaert took the women's 200 in 23.10. 
</P>
<P>
	NCAA 200 champion LaTasha Jenkins did not compete because she  
suffered a partially collapsed lung during the flight from the 
United States to this Spanish island. She was hospitalized, and a 
U.S. team official said it wasn't known if she would compete at the 
World Championships in August. 
</P>
<P>
	Swimming ended Friday with Japan's Noriko Inada turning in the  
fastest 100-meter backstroke in the world this year, breaking the 
University Games record. 
</P>
<P>
	American Mark Warkentin fell short in his bid to collect a fifth  
gold medal, finishing fourth behind Italy's Andrea Righi in the 
1,500 freestyle. 
</P>
<P>
	Inada, who helped set a games record in the women's 400 medley  
relay Thursday, clocked 1:01.06 in the backstroke to defend her 
title and better the event record of 1:01.60 set by Barbara Bedford 
of the United States in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Tomoko Hagiwara of Japan took the silver, her fifth medal of the  
games. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. swimmers won three events, raising their total to 32  
medals. Japan was next with 17. 
</P>
<P>
	In women's basketball, the defending champion United States  
defeated Lithuania 82-67 behind Camille Cooper's 20 points and 
eight rebounds to reach Saturday's semifinals. The Americans will 
play Russia, which beat Canada 89-55. 
</P>
<P>
	Spain and Ukraine will meet in the other semifinal.

<HEADLINE> Seniors Like Course, Hate Greens  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The Senior PGA Tour's first visit  
to Iowa is a big hit with the players, except for one thing. 
</P>
<P>
	The players are raving about the layout of the Des Moines Golf  
and Country Club. They're less thrilled with the severe slopes on 
the undulating greens. 
</P>
<P>
	``The golf course is great. The greens are rubbish,'' said Brian  
Barnes, a Scotsman who shot a second-round 69 on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnes also took a shot at famed designer Pete Dye, the course  
architect. 
</P>
<P>
	``The guy's screwy. Probably three-fourths of the bloody green  
can't be used for pin placement. So what's the point of having 
them? 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not upset. It just annoys me that a guy can get away with  
designing greens like this,'' Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champ Hale Irwin complained after the first round  
about putting ``a runaway rabbit.'' Gil Morgan had several putts 
get away during the second round, strokes he felt he might have 
secured elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	With wide fairways and forgiving rough, the course is a welcome  
sight for many of the senior tour players. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems like such a nice golf course, tee to green,'' Morgan  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	But eventually, they've got to putt, and that leads to plenty of  
gripes. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think if he (Dye) would have had a really good set of greens  
here that were a little flatter, you would have a really great golf 
course,'' Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	If Barnes seems grumpy, it's because he has rheumatoid arthritis  
and his feet were swelling near the end of his round Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was beginning to hurt so much toward the last five or six  
holes,'' Barnes said. ``It was just, `Let's get in as quickly as 
possible.' But you can't get in quickly around here with these damn 
greens.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HOLE-IN-ONE:* Hank Cooper of Sanger, Texas, aced the third  
hole, a 172-yard par-3 where the green is protected by a lake and a 
front bunker. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hit and hopped in,'' Cooper said. ``I didn't really see it  
but I heard the crowd, and I knew it went in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Then, Cooper added: ``Don't I win a Caddy or something?''  
</P>
<P>
	The USGA doesn't award a Cadillac for a hole-in-one.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *NICE TURNAROUND:* Dick Johnson pulled off an amazing  
about-face. 
</P>
<P>
	A teaching pro from Balsam Lake, Wis., Johnson shot an 85 on  
Thursday and started the second round with a double-bogey 6 on No. 
1. Then he turned it around and finished with a 71, a 14-stroke 
improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``You start second-guessing yourself,'' said Johnson, the only  
left-hander in the field of 156. ``I knew I was a better golfer 
than what my score indicated yesterday. I knew I had to come 
back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had only one other bogey and carded four birdies, three  
on the back nine. One of those birdies came on the 16th, a par-4 
that he had double-bogeyed on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The wind is down a little bit today,'' Johnson said. ``The  
greens are just as fast, but the ball is sticking when it hits. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll tell you what,'' he said. ``There's a lot of pressure  
playing in the U.S. Open. It's a great experience. You get those 
jitters out the second day and you're a lot more relaxed.'' 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *LAP LANDING:* Talk about something falling right into your lap.  
</P>
<P>
	Walter Morgan's tee shot on No. 3 sailed right and the ball  
bounced into the lap of spectator Chris Hawks, who was sitting in a 
collapsible chair. 
</P>
<P>
	Hawks, from Des Moines, held his knees together to keep the ball  
were it was until a USGA rules official arrived. The official told 
Hawks to hand the ball to Morgan, who was given a free drop. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *ATTENDANCE WATCH:* The crowd swelled to 38,400 on Friday, the  
fifth straight day with an increase. 
</P>
<P>
	Practice rounds early in the week had crowds of 25,000 on  
Monday, 27,000 on Tuesday and 29,000 on Wednesday. Thursday's 
opening round drew 30,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's galleries brought attendance so far to 154,400.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *HIT-&AMP;-RUN UPDATE:* West Des Moines police won't discuss an  
accident involving a Senior Open courtesy car until after the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Lt. Scott Wiegert said Friday an investigation continues. Police  
are sorting through differing statements concerning the crash, 
which apparently involved one of the 160 Cadillacs provided to 
players this week. 
</P>
<P>
	A motorist told police his vehicle was hit Tuesday by a white  
Cadillac sport-utility vehicle bearing a Senior Open logo. The 
crash occurred on Interstate 35 a few miles southeast of Des Moines 
Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
	Tournament officials won't disclose which player might have been  
involved but said the vehicle had minor damage. Police said charges 
were possible because the Cadillac left the scene.

<HEADLINE> Couples Pulls Out of British Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CARNOUSTIE, Scotland (AP) -- Fred Couples and Steve Jones pulled  
out of the British Open today, the latest American golfers to 
withdraw from next week's tournament at Carnoustie. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples, the 1992 Masters champion, sent a brief fax to the  
event organizers this morning to confirm he would not play. 
</P>
<P>
	He gave no reason.  
</P>
<P>
	Within an hour, 1996 U.S. champion Steve Jones also informed the  
organizers, the Royal and Ancient Club, that he was not well and 
would not be making the trip to Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous U.S. withdrawal notices came from 1995 British Open  
champion John Daly, Jack Nicklaus, Tom Kite and American Ryder Cup 
captain Ben Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples missed the cut at the U.S. Open last month and his form  
this year has seen him slip to 13th in the American Ryder Cup 
standings. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones made his debut at the British Open at Troon in 1989 and,  
after a five year absence, returned to play in 1996 until last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicklaus is rehabilitating after hip surgery, Kite and Crenshaw  
cited bad form and Daly, who finished in last place at the U.S. 
Open, said he was lacking confidence after finishing next to last 
in last week's Irish Open.

<HEADLINE> Union Wants Teacher Contract Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Individual schools need to take a bigger role  
in contract negotiations, the leader of a major teachers' union 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Sandra Feldman, president of the American Federation of  
Teachers, proposed that the nation's school boards and local 
teacher unions make radical changes in the contracts they negotiate 
in order to meet the high standards expected of students and 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The challenge before us is to work together to make this  
happen in every district and school, not just by adding waivers to 
traditional contracts, but by negotiating the kind of new 
agreements,'' Feldman told about 2,000 teachers and school 
officials gathered here for the national meeting of the second 
largest teachers' union. 
</P>
<P>
	She spoke of the cooperation between the teachers' union and the  
principal at a New York City public school attended by her 
grandson. 
</P>
<P>
	``Teachers, paraprofessionals and other school staff all have a  
voice in how the school is organized, run, and staffed,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can point to lots of other public schools across the country  
-- from cities like Boston to Los Angeles, from Pittsburgh to 
Chicago, from Minneapolis to Miami, and in communities like Poway, 
Calif. to Coventry, R.I.; Newburgh, N.Y. to Lake County, Fla., and 
more -- where the union, the school board, and the staff at the 
school level are working together to make it happen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The contract will require ``a new mindset'' among school  
managers as well as teachers, Feldman said, adding that some 
districts are already allowing unions to work with individual 
school administrators on contracts tailored to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our challenge is to take the best practices and to help  
teachers win the resources and flexibility to adapt them 
everywhere,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman's proposed changes to traditional contracts with  
districts would specifically: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Set standards for teacher workload, but school officials,  
rather than district officials, would have the autonomy and 
flexibility to work out the details of class size, scheduling and 
time; 
</P>
<P>
	-- Require adherence to state standards for teacher and teacher  
aide credentials and ensure due process for those who fall short, 
but give school-level staff the flexibility to put their own school 
team together 
</P>
<P>
	-- Ensure that teachers and staff get quality training, but allow  
school officials decide what kind of teacher training best meets 
the needs of their students. 
</P>
<P>
	Feldman asked school principals to focus on instruction: ``Treat  
us as colleagues and not as cogs in a machine, because a union 
cannot bring about these changes in an autocratic school.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal comes at a time when the 950,000-member AFT and its  
larger counterpart, the 2.4 million-member National Education 
Association, are seen as hindering needed school reform. But both 
teachers unions have worked to overcome the label in the last few 
years, seeking to shape public education policy. However, an 
academic study of Michigan and Pennsylvania state organizations 
showed that despite two decades of successfully pushing for better 
salaries and working conditions, the unions remained on the 
defensive on private-school vouchers and maintaining their 
membership and power base. 
</P>
<P>
	Other researchers say the unions are gaining greater credibility  
and influence by approaching national-level education issues such 
as teaching standards.

<HEADLINE> Nanny Gets 4 Years for Abduction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A nanny who admitted abducting an ultra-Orthodox  
Jewish boy with cerebral palsy was sentenced to more than four 
years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Theresa Goldberg, 40, asked for mercy Thursday, saying she only  
wanted to help 6-year-old Chaim Weill. ``I pray every day for 
him,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	But in sentencing her to four years, nine months in prison,  
Judge Leo Glasser told her, ``You did something terrible. You 
should be punished for it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Glasser also sentenced Mrs. Goldberg's husband, David, to 10  
months for not reporting the kidnapping. The couple pleaded guilty 
in January. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Goldberg had taken Chaim, who is confined to a wheelchair,  
for a walk last October when they disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents arrested Mrs. Goldberg two days later in a hotel  
parking lot in suburban Richmond, Va. She and the boy were found 
sleeping in a car. 
</P>
<P>
	David Goldberg, 47, told the FBI that his wife had talked for  
months about taking the child to South Carolina because she 
believed his parents were not taking good care of him. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Jerome Karp has denied reports that Mrs.  
Goldberg, a Jehovah's Witness, was seeking ``holistic healing'' for 
Chaim.

<HEADLINE> Kroger Promises Safety Improvements </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Worker training and safety programs are being  
improved at the Kroger Co.'s food processing plants nationwide 
after violations were found during a federal safety inspection at a 
suburban Cincinnati plant. 
</P>
<P>
	Inspectors for the Occupational Safety and Health Administration  
identified more than 75 safety and health hazards at Kroger's 
Springdale plant during an inspection from Jan. 7 through March 1, 
William Murphy, director of OSHA's Cincinnati area office, said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy said the company is cooperating and has started  
eliminating the hazards. 
</P>
<P>
	The agency cited Kroger for violating requirements on turning  
off machinery during maintenance; safety guards on moving machine 
parts; procedures for work done in confined spaces including tanks 
and pits; guardrails and safety harnesses to protect workers from 
falls; and training of forklift operators. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger, the nation's largest retail grocer and supermarket  
operator, agreed to pay a $247,000 fine, put plant supervisors 
through OSHA safety training courses and make the workplace safer. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger is working to bring similar training and safety  
improvements to its processing plants nationwide, company spokesman 
Gary Rhodes said. The Cincinnati-based company now has 43 food 
processing plants as the result of its merger this spring with Fred 
Meyer Inc., of Portland, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	OSHA inspected the Springdale plant based on the agency's  
analysis of Kroger employee workdays lost to occupation-related 
injuries and illnesses each year. Employers are required to report 
those rates to OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate of lost employee days for that plant in 1996 was higher  
than for the food processing industry as a whole, said Richard 
Gilgrist, assistant area director for the OSHA office. 
</P>
<P>
	Kroger management has paid more attention to safety at the  
Springdale plant in recent years and reduced the days-lost rate 
last year to below the industry average, Rhodes said. He declined 
to release specific figures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are seeing some positive results from the changes we are  
making,'' Rhodes said.

<HEADLINE> Teens Charged With Killing Puppy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAGINAW, Mich. (AP) -- Two teen-agers are charged with killing a  
German shepherd puppy with a powerful firecracker they attached to 
its collar. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Powell, 17, was arraigned Wednesday on a charge of  
killing or torturing an animal. A 14-year-old boy is charged with 
the same offense in juvenile court. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the teen-agers set off an M-80, an illegal  
explosive with the power of a quarter-stick of dynamite, on June 
28. The blast killed the 4-month-old dog instantly. 
</P>
<P>
	Powell could get up to four years in prison. The other boy could  
be held in juvenile detention until his 19th birthday.

<HEADLINE> Jurors To Decide Future of Brothel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RENO, Nev. (AP) -- The federal government might once again find  
itself owning the Mustang Ranch brothel. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal jury held on Thursday that a former county  
commissioner conspired with the officers of two shell companies to 
keep fugitive brothel baron Joe Conforte in full control of the 
ranch. 
</P>
<P>
	The panel was to return to U.S. District Court today to hear the  
prosecution's recommendation that the gated bordello -- and an 
assortment of properties ranging from prostitutes' trailers to a 
restaurant near Virginia City -- be forfeited to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	Shirley Colletti, the former commissioner and a one-time manager  
of the the legal brothel 12 miles east of Reno, faces financial 
penalties and a prison term that will be decided by the judge on 
the basis of federal sentencing guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	In Nevada, prostitution is illegal in Reno and Las Vegas but  
allowed in some counties. There are some 30 brothels. 
</P>
<P>
	Conforte fled the country after the Internal Revenue Service  
seized the brothel in 1990 for failure to pay taxes. The government 
argued that the ranch then was sold to his minions at a tax auction 
two months later for pennies on the dollar. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Colletti worked with the bogus companies to  
siphon the prostitutes' earnings to Conforte at his hideout 
somewhere in South America. 
</P>
<P>
	Colletti was acquitted on 11 counts but convicted on 12,  
including two charges dealing with racketeering. She will remain 
free at least until the end of today's hearing and was told to 
bring tax records with her so prosecutors could argue for financial 
sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	She collapsed after Thursday's hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	``She's not doing well,'' said attorney David Houston. ``We'll  
talk and try to educate her a bit to where she stands on some of 
her options right now.''

<HEADLINE> Gun Dealer's Links Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Federal agents are trying to determine  
whether there is a reason to investigate whether a white 
supremacist group and its leader helped Benjamin Smith carry out 
his shooting attacks last weekend against minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney General Janet Reno said Thursday it was too soon to say  
if a review within the department will lead to an investigation of 
the World Church of the Creator or its leader, Matt Hale. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said they could find no other links between  
extremist groups and Donald Fiessinger, the man authorities say 
illegally sold Smith his weapons. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department rules require a reasonable indication that a  
group is engaged in criminal conduct before an investigation can be 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Reno said, ``In order to avoid an abuse of  
authority so that the FBI doesn't go out and investigate somebody 
because they say something that is protected by free speech, they 
go out and investigate a group only when there is a reasonable 
indication of criminal conduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at the facts and see whether there is any  
basis for proceeding on that standard, and that's what we're going 
to do,'' she said when asked whether the group would be 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal agents wanted to know whether Fiessinger, 64, sold Smith  
the guns as part of an effort to supply firearms to racist 
extremists. 
</P>
<P>
	Fiessinger faces a charge of selling firearms without a federal  
permit. He was freed after meeting a $10,000 bond Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to have used the guns on a three-day killing  
spree through Illinois and Indiana that targeted blacks, Jews and 
Asians. Two people were killed and nine others injured before Smith 
apparently shot himself and bled to death after a police chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith may have seen Fiessinger's classified ads in a local  
newspaper, said prosecutor Tate Chambers. Fiessinger had no 
knowledge of Smith's racist beliefs when he sold Smith a 
.308-caliber handgun on June 26 and a .22-caliber handgun on June 
29, Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators say Smith bankrolled his rampage by cashing  
investments of $10,000 to $20,000 in the last 30 days, the Chicago 
Sun-Times reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It looks like he was going on a road trip,'' said Skokie  
police Lt. Barry Silverberg. Earlier this week, authorities said 
they would investigate the source of Smith's cash to help determine 
if he acted alone. Investigators said they have not turned up 
evidence anyone assisted Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities are examining Smith's personal computer, which was  
found in a storage locker he shared with Hale, Silverberg told the 
newspaper. Authorities say they also found hate literature, a Nazi 
flag and an armband. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI agents have interviewed Hale at the East Peoria home where  
he lives with his parents. An upstairs bedroom doubles as his 
group's headquarters.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Hollinger International Inc., a newspaper group  
controlled by Canadian publisher Conrad Black, is in talks to 
acquire The New York Observer, a small weekly newspaper published 
in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Healy, a vice president of Hollinger, on Friday confirmed  
published reports that the talks were occurring, but declined

<HEADLINE> Newsprint Makers Seek Higher Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Major newsprint makers are hoping to raise  
prices by about $50 per metric ton, but analysts say it's uncertain 
that the price increase will stick. 
</P>
<P>
	Abitibi-Consolidated Inc., the world's leading supplier of  
newsprint, is notifying newspaper publishers that it wants to raise 
its prices in October to recoup some of the decline in prices this 
year. Bowater Inc., another major newsprint supplier based in 
Greenville, S.C., has reportedly made similar notifications. 
</P>
<P>
	Newsprint prices have fallen about 20 percent since the  
beginning of the year to just under $500 per metric ton because of 
a glut in supplies and weaker demand for the product in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Abitibi-Consolidated, which is based in  
Montreal, said the company expected the market to accept the price 
increases since demand has been picking up in Asia. A spokesman for 
newspaper publisher Knight Ridder also said he expected the price 
increase to stick, but possibly not beyond the beginning of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	But James Marsh, a publishing analyst for Prudential Securities,  
said he doubted that the market for newsprint would support a 
significant price increase due to a continuing glut and the fact 
that newsprint makers are not operating close to their full 
capacity, a condition usually required for buyers to accept higher 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a big poker game between the publishers and the  
newsprint makers, and I don't think the newsprint producers have a 
strong hand now,'' Marsh said.

<HEADLINE> Infection Fighting Protein Found </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROCKVILLE, Md. (AP) -- Scientists at a biotechnology company say  
they have discovered the human protein that triggers production of 
one of the body's most important cells, one that fights infection 
and disease. 
</P>
<P>
	Human Genome Sciences Inc. says the newly identified protein B  
lymphocyte stimulant, or BLyS, could have many uses. These include 
boosting immune systems weakened by chemotherapy, organ transplant 
drugs or diseases such as AIDS, leukemia and lymphomas. 
</P>
<P>
	The findings were published today in the journal Science.  
</P>
<P>
	The company announced Thursday it is developing an experimental  
drug based on the discovery and hopes to see it tested in humans 
this year. It usually takes five to eight years of human testing 
before the FDA considers approving an experimental drug. 
</P>
<P>
	The scientists say the protein is responsible for triggering  
production of B cells, a type of white blood cell. These immune 
system cells generate important antibodies that attack bacteria, 
viruses and fungi. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the country's leading immune system experts, Dr. Anthony  
Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 
Diseases, hailed the discovery as an example of deciphering human 
genes to find keys to how the body responds to disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look on this as being important because it demonstrates how  
incredibly powerful some of these biotech companies are becoming in 
doing things that would have seemed impossible a few years ago,'' 
Fauci said today in the The (Baltimore) Sun. 
</P>
<P>
	At least a dozen companies are trying to decipher information  
about the body's 80,000 to 100,000 genes in an effort to prevent 
diseases.

<HEADLINE> Bond Prices Slip on Ford Motor News / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Treasury prices edged lower in thin trading  
Friday as the market absorbed a record $8.6 billion corporate bond 
deal by Ford Motor Corp. and its Ford Motor Credit unit. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 5/32 point, or $1.56  
per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite 
direction, rose to 6 percent from 5.99 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Worries about the corporate-bond deal led to uncertainty in the  
market this week. Analysts said that investors can now turn their 
attention to upcoming economic releases, sifting for clues about 
the future direction of interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is scheduled to release data on retail sales and  
producer prices on Wednesday, consumer prices on Thursday and 
industrial production on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the broader Treasury market, prices of short-term securities  
fell 1/16 point and intermediate maturities fell 1/16 point to 3/32 
point, reported Bridge Telerate. 
</P>
<P>
	In other trading, yields on three-month Treasury bills rose to  
4.67 percent while the discount rose 0.02 percentage point to 4.55 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Six-month yields rose to 4.73 percent, as the discount rose 0.02  
percentage point to 4.56 percent. One-year yields held at 4.98 
percent as the discount was unchanged at 4.74 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, was unchanged at 4.94 percent from late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds rose 3/16 point to 118 15/16. The average 
yield to maturity fell to 5.53 percent from 5.54 percent late 
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 1973 study that coldly calculated the cost  
to General Motors of settling claims for fatal crashes was key to a 
jury that awarded the largest products liability verdict in U.S. 
history -- $4.9 billion to six people badly burned in a collision. 
</P>
<P>
	``We figured that if they had no regard for the lives of people  
in their cars, they should be held liable for it,'' jury foreman 
Coleman Thorton said after Friday's verdict. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children and family  
friend Jo Tigner $107 million in compensatory damages and $4.8 
billion in punitive damages for injuries they suffered when their 
Chevrolet Malibu exploded in flames when it was rear-ended in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said the verdict will be appealed,  
and legal experts predicted it will be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crash was not GM's fault and we are disappointed the  
conduct of this trial did not let the jury fairly evaluate the 
claims,'' Rhadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came after a 10-week state court trial focusing on  
internal GM documents about fuel tanks in its various models. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the documents do not specifically mention the 1979  
Malibu driven by the plaintiffs, their lawyers said GM knew for 
years its gas tanks were unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than pay for a recall, they argued, GM found it cheaper  
to settle lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM had numerous failures in their crash tests, but chose to  
leave the tank where it was because changing it would have cost 
$8.59'' per car, said Brian Panish, lead attorney in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1973 study, part of a general analysis of gas tank  
safety, GM design engineer E.C. Ivey -- who testified at the trial -- 
estimated it would cost the company $200,000 to settle legal claims 
from each fire-involved fatality, or about $2.40 for each GM 
vehicle on the road. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously Ivey is not an individual whom we would ever, in any  
conceivable situation, want to be identified to the plaintiffs in 
(an accident) case,'' said a 1981 Oldsmobile memo introduced as 
evidence along with the study. ``The documents he generated are 
undoubtedly some of the potentially most harmful and most damaging 
were they ever to be produced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jurors concluded GM knew it should have made its gas tanks  
safer. 
</P>
<P>
	``From the beginning I was surprised that Mr. Ivey was evasive  
of the questions the plaintiffs asked. He was quite cooperative 
with the defense. That got me to wondering,'' Thorton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhadigan said the accident's severity wasn't the fault of the  
Malibu's fuel system, but of a drunken driver who plowed into the 
vehicle at a red light. 
</P>
<P>
	Plaintiffs argued the gas tank was too close to the rear bumper  
and better designs would have placed it over the axle or 
incorporated a shield. 
</P>
<P>
	Thorton said the panel calculated its award based on the amount  
GM spent advertising cars with similar gasoline tanks. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, said the enormous  
punitive portion of the award is unlikely to stand on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're sending a message,'' he said of the jurors. ``They're  
mad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Olson, a fellow at the Manhattan Institute, was critical  
of juries that seek to punish companies with verdicts that threaten 
their financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The idea is, 'How shameful for an American manufacturer who  
would build a car that could not withstand being hit from behind at 
70 mph,''' he said. ``There is a word for that kind of car: a 
tank.''

<HEADLINE> Soccer: Rockin' With Team USA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- Was it Ricky Martin? The Backstreet  
Boys? Bruce? 
</P>
<P>
	No, just the U.S. Women's World Cup team. Well, not JUST them. A  
crowd of perhaps 2,000 certainly treated the soccer players like 
rock stars. 
</P>
<P>
	The fans mobbed the bus as it pulled into the parking lot at  
Pomona-Pitzer College. They chanted the players' names as they 
stood behind makeshift fences during practice. They begged for 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
	Woodstock '99 might not be for another few weeks, but this crowd  
didn't need Dave Matthews when it had Michelle Akers. Britney 
Spears can stay home; Briana Scurry was there. Lilith Fair? How 
about Kristine Lilly? 
</P>
<P>
	``It's awesome to see this,'' U.S. star Mia Hamm said as she  
surveyed a scene that also included policemen on motorcycles, about 
150 media members and Oscar-winning actor Karl Malden. ``It creates 
an extremely different atmosphere, to say the least. When we were 
in residency camp in Florida, if we had six people at the training 
site, it was a lot. Now, it's like at a game. It gets us excited.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As it should. No team in recent memory has inspired such  
reactions, certainly not over a three-week period. The Americans 
have drawn record crowds -- a sellout approaching 90,000 is certain 
for the final against China on Saturday at the Rose Bowl. 
Television shows ranging from SportsCenter to the evening news 
programs to David Letterman have discovered them. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, SRO at practice.  
</P>
<P>
	Sitting on rickety bleachers at one end of the field was a  
gray-haired man with a very familiar face: Malden. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is great,'' said the 87-year-old actor whose  
granddaughter goes to the college. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a real positive thing to see people looking to sports  
figures like these women as role models,'' said Lt. Gary Jenkins of 
the Claremont Police Department, a member of the motorcycle brigade 
handling security. ``They've taken that role seriously and done a 
great job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of practice, the players sat on the motorcycles and  
took pictures with the police. Defender Christie Pearce even took a 
short ride on one of the bikes, which were used to form a motorcade 
when the players' bus arrived at the school. California's Highway 
Patrol also escorted the bus to and from the team's hotel. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a blast for us,'' Shannon MacMillan said. ``They were  
cheering and chanting our names the whole time. When the bus pulled 
up, they ran along side, and when it moved up some more, they ran 
up some more. We had to have the policemen riding motorcycles by us 
just to get us to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's great to see them share the enthusiasm.''  
</P>
<P>
	While the majority of the crowd was comprised of young girls,  
many wearing Mia Hamm No. 9 jerseys, there was a fair number of 
adults present. That impressed Scurry. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't tell me the little girls are not dragging their  
parents here and dragging them to the games,'' she said. ``The 
parents are seeing how soccer has taken off and they have done well 
in getting the kids out to the games. They feel their daughters 
should see high-quality soccer and they are seeing it in the World 
Cup.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, few of the fans were able to get autographs as  
officials chaperoned the players out a back way to their bus. The 
Chinese team already was on the field and an organizing committee 
official said they were annoyed that their practice was delayed. 
Any remaining fans were shooed away by security as the Chinese held 
a closed practice. 
</P>
<P>
	Kristine Lilly, playing in her third World Cup, opened her eyes  
wide as she surveyed the size of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are more people here at practice than at our first games  
in the '80s,'' she said. ``That tells you how much interest there 
is.''

<HEADLINE> Toxic Site Owner Agrees To Cleanup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- After years of squabbling, an agreement has  
been reached to clean up the former Avtex Fibers manufacturing 
plant, Virginia's biggest private Superfund toxic waste site. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the settlement with the Justice Department, the plant's  
former owner, FMC Corp., agreed to rid the 440-acre site of toxic 
chemicals within seven years at an estimated cost of $63 million, 
an administration official said. 
</P>
<P>
	The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that FMC  
Corp., as part of the settlement to be submitted to the court, 
commits to completing the Avtex site's cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	FMC Corp., a Chicago-based chemical and manufacturing company  
that sold the Virginia plant in 1976, already has spent about $20 
million and the Environmental Protection Agency another $27 million 
on site cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	Controversy has surrounded the Avtex Fibers plant near Front  
Royal, Va., for years. It is Virginia's No. 1 privately owned 
Superfund site and one of the state's most controversial and 
visible environmental problems. 
</P>
<P>
	FMC Corp., owned the plant from 1963 to 1976 when it was sold to  
Avtex Fibers Inc.. That company declared bankruptcy in 1989 after 
state officials revoked Avtex's water permit citing more than 2,000 
violations for polluting the nearby Shenandoah River. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Kline, a spokesman for FMC Corp., declined comment on the  
settlement, but said company officials would have a statement 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	FMC Corp., already has spent about $20 million on pollution  
controls at the former rayon manufacturing plant, including 
construction of a water filtration facility. The EPA has spent 
another $27 million for cleanup since the plant became a Superfund 
site in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
	Located in the shadow of the Blue Ridge Mountains, the plant  
once employed more than 3,000 workers. Originally owned by the 
American Viscose Corp., it opened in the 1930s and during World War 
II was a major supplier of rayon for tires. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, a smorgasbord of toxic chemicals spewed from the  
plant's 365-foot smokestack onto nearby buildings and the open 
countryside that surrounded the plant. The red brick smokestack was 
demolished in 1997 as part of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
	According to state and federal officials, the 440-acre area is  
contaminated with cancer-causing asbestos, PCBs, mercury, lead, and 
carbon disulfides, which cause nerve damage and other ailments. 
Contaminated lagoons and sludge pools dot the area. 
</P>
<P>
	Already more than 8,000 tons of contaminated soil, 2,000 tons of  
chemicals, 240,000 gallons of flammable chemicals and acids, and 
3,000 bags of asbestos have been removed from the site.

	Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the biggest product-liability award in  
U.S. history, a jury ordered General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 
billion Friday to six people severely burned when their Chevrolet 
Malibu exploded in flames in a rear-end collision. The plaintiffs' 
lawyers said the study demonstrated that GM had known for years 
that the tanks were unsafe, but found it cheaper to settle lawsuits 
than to pay for a recall. ``This crash was not GM's fault and we 
are disappointed the conduct of this trial did not let the jury 
fairly evaluate the claims,'' GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has  
withdrawn his appointment of a Muslim leader to a congressional 
panel assigned to review U.S. policy on terrorism. Jewish groups 
and several members of Congress said the nominee had justified acts 
of terror against Israel and the United States. In a letter to 
House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Gephardt said Salam 
Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los 
Angeles, had been recommended to him as having extensive public 
service experience and being involved in interfaith dialogue.

	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- James S. Farmer, who served alongside  
Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights giants of the 1950s 
and '60s, died Friday. He was 79. Farmer, who had been in ill 
health in recent years, died at Mary Washington Hospital. As one of 
the founders of the Congress of Racial Equality in 1942, Farmer was 
called one of the Big Four civil rights leaders in the 1960s, with 
King, NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League head Whitney Young. 
Farmer was the last surviving member of the group.

	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Slobodan Milosevic must not receive

said Friday as opposition to the Serb leader mounted at home in 
Yugoslavia. Cohen's warning came as two more Serbian cities passed 
declarations calling for Milosevic's removal and as Clinton 
administration officials evaluated intelligence reports indicating 
that some opposition leaders are considering using asylum as a way 
to hasten Milosevic's removal from power.

	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United States persuaded Libya's

still has to meet U.N. demands related to the Pan Am bombing trial 
before it can have sanctions permanently lifted. Namibia had taken 
the lead in pushing for the council to lift the measures, now 
suspended, based on the April 5 handover of two suspects in the 
bombing and pledges by Libya to cooperate with their trial and pay 
compensation to the victims' families -- if the men are convicted.

symbolic pilgrimage Friday to Egypt, the first Arab country to 
recognize the Jewish state, and declared it was time to end ``100 
years of conflict'' in the turbulent region. But even as Prime 
Minister Ehud Barak was promising to press ahead in his quest for 
peace with Arab neighbors, Palestinians crisply put him on notice -- 
in advance of a crucial first meeting with Palestinian leader 
Yasser Arafat -- that they will brook no delays in implementing 
existing peace accords.

<HEADLINE> Webvan Seeks Web Grocery Supremacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Wagering more than $1 billion on the  
premise that people will shop for home-delivered groceries through 
the Internet, an online supermarket with a tiny customer base has 
hired the Bechtel Group to help take it to the top of the fledgling 
Internet grocery business. 
</P>
<P>
	Webvan Group Inc., a 2-year-old startup in Foster City, Calif.,  
said Friday it had reached a deal with the global engineering, 
construction and consulting company to replicate its highly 
automated distribution center in 26 new markets across the United 
States over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The deal allows us to accelerate that rollout, putting the  
most difficult task -- building the distribution centers -- in the 
hands of the world's leading engineering firm,'' said Chris 
Mannella, Webvan's vice president for marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts called it an audacious move for a business that only  
began shipping groceries to customers in the Bay area five weeks 
ago. Webvan has one main warehouse, a small fleet of trucks and 
vans and only 275 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a major gamble, one that obviously could pay off in a big  
way for Webvan but also could very well overextend the company 
before the market's really there,'' said David Baltaxe, who follows 
Internet commerce for Current Analysis in Sterling, Va. 
</P>
<P>
	Webvan has some proven talent in its chief executive, Louis  
Borders, who founded Borders Books, and it has been hiring software 
engineers away from major computer companies. It also has received 
$120 million from CBS Corp., Knight Ridder Co., Softbank Corp. and 
some of Silicon Valley's top venture capital firms. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can guarantee that in two years they'll be the leading  
online seller of groceries,'' said Ken Cassar, a digital commerce 
analyst with Jupiter Communications. ``That doesn't mean they'll be 
the most profitable. It's not an easy business to do profitably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through the www.webvan.com site, customers can shop 24 hours a  
day, arranging for free home delivery through a 30-minute window of 
anything from tomatoes to prescription drugs to alcohol, once the 
liquor licenses come through. 
</P>
<P>
	Webvan says its prices are as much as 5 percent under the  
grocery stores, because its automated distribution center in 
Oakland can handle the volume of 20 supermarkets without all the 
costs for labor and store upkeep. 
</P>
<P>
	WebVan is just one of many online grocers, including Peapod and  
HomeGrocer.com, who are striving to convince shoppers to buy their 
food over the Internet. While only open in the Bay area now, WebVan 
plans to open a warehouse in Atlanta early next year; it did not 
provide details on where else it plans to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike some other online supermarkets that use mostly manual  
labor or send employees go into grocery stores to fill customers' 
orders, Webvan keeps the groceries on moving shelves in its own 
warehouse. Workers pluck off the goods and fill bins that travel 
along four miles of conveyor belts to waiting refrigerated trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``It requires far fewer people,'' said Mannella, adding that  
Webvan's system will prove far more profitable than the 2 percent 
profit margins conventional groceries earn. 
</P>
<P>
	Depending on Webvan's success in opening warehouses, the price  
tag on the arrangement with Bechtel could increase or decrease from 
$1 billion, Mannella said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cassar said the Bechtel investment will force Jupiter to  
substantially increase its predictions for online grocery market, 
which it earlier predicted would grow from $150 million last year 
to $3.5 billion in 2002. In comparison, consumers spent more than 
$440 billion in total supermarket sales last year 
</P>
<P>
	``The potential market they're going after is enormous. But it's  
going to require a fairly significant departure from consumer 
behavior,'' he said. ``The perishable end of the market is one 
where people are notoriously picky.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Customers who have tried Webvan in the Bay area said Friday that  
there have been some problems, such as a small selection and lost 
drivers, but they're willing to stick with the service because of 
its convenience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maybe they can buy these drivers some maps now,'' joked Steve  
Gershik, an Internet marketing manager in Hayward whose initial 
order was delayed by more than an hour because the driver's map 
showed a street where there was nothing but a horse trail. 
</P>
<P>
	``My wife went out and happened to see the van, and gave him  
directions to our house,'' said Gershik, who has since become 
something of an evangelist for the company, talking it up to people 
he meets at Web conferences. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food quality is relatively good, the price is competitive,  
and the customer service is great,'' he said. ``Who knows what the 
customer service will be like when they become a billion-dollar 
company.''

</P>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- Pete Conrad, the Apollo 12 astronaut  
and the third man to walk on the moon and the only one to shout 
``Whoopee!'' as he hopped onto its dusty surface, was killed 
Thursday in a motorcycle accident. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad crashed his 1996 Harley-Davidson on a curve along a  
winding mountain road near Ojai in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides Apollo 12 in November 1969, Conrad flew two Gemini  
missions in the mid-1960s and commanded NASA's first space station, 
Skylab, in 1973. He later worked as an aerospace executive and 
formed a company aimed at making spaceflight as common as a jet 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA picked him for its second group of astronauts in 1962,  
three years after the seven original Mercury astronauts were 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad served as pilot of Gemini 5 in 1965, flying with Gordon  
Cooper. He went on to command Gemini 11 in 1966. His crewmate was 
Dick Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of Apollo 12, Conrad flew to the moon with Alan  
Bean and Dick Gordon. Conrad and Bean spent nearly eight hours 
exploring the lunar surface and 31 1/2 hours on the surface 
altogether, as Gordon circled the moon in the command module. 
</P>
<P>
	He retired from NASA and the Navy in 1973.  
</P>
<P>
	During the mid-1990s, he was flight manager for McDonnell  
Douglas Corp.'s prototype rocket that took off and landed 
vertically.

	FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- James S. Farmer, who served alongside  
Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights giants of the 1950s 
and '60s, died Friday. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
	As one of the founders of the Congress of Racial Equality in  
1942, Farmer was called one of the Big Four civil rights leaders in 
the 1960s, with King, NAACP chief Roy Wilkins and Urban League head 
Whitney Young. Farmer was the last surviving member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer's most celebrated accomplishment as head of CORE was to  
lead the 1961 Freedom Rides, a nonviolent effort to desegregate 
interstate buses and terminals. However, participants encountered 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer helped recruit CORE members James Chaney, Andrew Goodman  
and Michael Schwerner, all of whom were murdered in Mississippi in 
1964 during the Freedom Rides. Their slayings were the subject of 
the 1988 movie ``Mississippi Burning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Farmer moved to the Fredericksburg area in 1980 to write his  
autobiography, ``Lay Bare the Heart.'' The book charted his 
involvement in that struggle, and also his personal observations 
about gradually going blind from a rare ailment called retinal 
vascular occlusion. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton last year presented Farmer with the  
Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian award.

recordings ``Up a Lazy River'' and ``You're Nobody 'Til Somebody 
Loves You,'' died Monday of heart failure and cancer. She was 86. 
</P>
<P>
	Miss Sherwood was a popular singer on the vaudeville circuit  
from age 11. When she married Broadway showman Don Lanning in 1938, 
she confined her singing to the Miami nightclub they ran for nearly 
two decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Comic Red Buttons and columnist Walter Winchell began touting  
the singer, and she was eventually booked in clubs from New York's 
Copacabana to Las Vegas' Frontier Hotel and Hollywood's Mocambo. 
</P>
<P>
	She gained a recording contract and appeared on such TV shows as  
``The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ``The Steve Allen Show,'' ``The Jackie 
Gleason Show,'' ``The Garry Moore Show'' and Edward R. Murrow's 
``Person to Person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among other favorites she recorded were ``Make Someone Happy,''  
``How Deep Is the Ocean,'' ``These Foolish Things'' and ``Stormy 
Weather.''

<P>
	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sola Sierra, a prominent human rights  
activist during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 
died July 1 of a heart attack. She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	An active member of the Chilean Communist Party, Sierra joined  
the opposition to Pinochet after her husband, Jorge Pizarro, 
disappeared after being taken away by Pinochet's security agents. 
</P>
<P>
	She organized an association for the relatives of hundreds of  
Chileans who vanished during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband's black-and-white photograph pinned to her  
chest, Sierra was a familiar figure at protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent visitors to Chile, including European politicians and  
rock stars, often made a point of meeting her. Among them were the 
Irish rock group U2 and British singer Sting, who wrote a song 
about her group called ``They Dance Alone.''

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Bohanon To Rest Elbow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies left-hander Brian Bohanon has  
bone chips in his throwing elbow and will be given about 10 days' 
rest over the All-Star break to determine if he can pitch with the 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon (9-7) leads the Rockies in wins but has lost his last  
four starts and has an 11.25 ERA in those games. He lasted only 
two-thirds of an inning on Thursday, allowing five runs and four 
hits in an 11-8 loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent an X-ray after Thursday's game and an MRI on  
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``They found some small bone chips in there,'' Bohanon said  
Friday. ``Yesterday I just could not get loose. I was so tight that 
I couldn't finish off some pitches, especially my slider and 
cutter. Obviously, I need those to be effective.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the Rockies using a four-man rotation, Bohanon would have  
been scheduled to pitch next Thursday, the first game after the 
All-Star break. Instead, he will pitch on the fourth day after the 
break, July 18. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're going to give me 10 days to get this straightened  
out,'' Bohanon said. ``I have to figure out something, because 
obviously I am not the pitcher I was earlier in the year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies medical staff has prescribed exercises to strengthen  
Bohanon's forearm, biceps and triceps muscles to take pressure off 
the elbow, reducing inflammation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bohanon, 30, hopes to avoid surgery until after the season.  
Doctors don't think Bohanon will cause additional harm to his elbow 
by continuing to pitch this season. 
</P>
<P>
	In an unrelated pitching move, the Rockies purchased the  
contract of left-hander Mike Porzio from Triple-A Colorado Springs 
and sent right-hander Dave Wainhouse outright to the minors. 
Wainhouse has 72 hours to decide if he wants to accept the 
assignment to Triple-A or become a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockies also announced makeup dates for three games that  
were postponed in April due to weather and the Columbine High 
School tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-Colorado game originally scheduled for April 16 will  
be played Thursday, Aug. 19, at 1:05 p.m. MDT. 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal-Colorado game originally set for April 20 will be  
played on Friday, Aug. 13, as the first game of a split 
doubleheader, with games at 1:05 p.m. and 7:05 p.m. The 
Expos-Rockies game of April 21 will be made up as the second game 
of a split doubleheader on Aug. 15 with games at 12:05 p.m. and 
6:05 p.m.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Withdraws Muslim Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has  
withdrawn his appointment of a Muslim leader to a congressional 
panel assigned to review U.S. policy on terrorism. Jewish groups 
and several members of Congress said the nominee had justified acts 
of terror against Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Gephardt  
said Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs 
Council in Los Angeles, had been recommended to him as having 
extensive public service experience and being involved in 
interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Democrat said, however, the appointment was  
subsequently questioned and since a security check could take a 
year, twice as long as the life of the commission, he was 
withdrawing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite these circumstances, Mr. Al-Marayati is prepared to  
provide input to the commission on matters of interest and concern 
to the American Muslim community,'' Gephardt said in the letter, 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt told Hastert he hoped the panel would ``listen to the  
voices of this community and address the issues of civil rights for 
all Americans consistent with a strong U.S. anti-terrorism 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven House members wrote FBI Director Louis Freeh they had  
received information of statements by justifying terrorism against 
Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These assertions cause us great concern as it is essential  
that all members of the commission be unequivocally committed to 
the prevention and prosecution of terrorism directed at the United 
States or our ally Israel,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment had been challenged by the Zionist Organization  
of America, the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation 
League and by the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish  
Committee, said Al-Marayati for a number of years had justified and 
minimized acts of terrorism against Israel and against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton A, Klein, national director of the Zionist Organization  
of America, said in a statement that ``these anti-Israel and 
pro-terrorist individuals and groups should be condemned and 
relegated to the margins of society, not granted credibility by 
being given government appointments and meetings at the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Gephardt's  
decision and said he had bowed to political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reversal by Representative Gephardt will only serve to  
institutionalize discrimination against American Muslims and their 
leaders,'' the council said in a statement. ``Muslims have been 
widely stereotyped using the issue of terrorism and it is therefore 
essential that a credible Muslim voice be heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Muslim Public Affairs Council called on Hastert and Gephardt  
to reinstate their director ``and allow the country to hear a 
Muslim voice'' on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
	It accused the ``pro-Israel lobby'' of manipulating discussion  
of an important issue, and said the Jewish groups that oppsoed 
Al-Marayati were ``extreme Zionist organizations'' trying to 
establish a pro-Israel litmus test for any Muslim considered for 
national service. 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Marayati told The New York Times he would not withdraw. ``I  
think that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite 
these security clearances and get down to the business of the 
country,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE>  Killer Rains Swamp Las Vegas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A powerful summer storm transformed this  
simmering desert city into a raging river that swamped hundreds of 
cars, smashed mobile homes and killed at least two people. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a wide strip of devastation,'' Gov. Kenny Guinn said  
after taking a helicopter tour of flooded areas Thursday evening, 
when the water finally started to recede. 
</P>
<P>
	There could be more of the same today: The National Weather  
Service placed the Las Vegas Valley under a flash flood watch until 
9 p.m. PDT, warning of the possibility of more heavy rain. 
</P>
<P>
	Las Vegas isn't used to this kind of downpour, with 3 inches  
falling in just a few hours Thursday. The Las Vegas area usually 
receives slightly more than 4 inches in an entire year. 
</P>
<P>
	Ron McQueen, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service,  
said it was the city's worst flooding in 15 years: Water turned 
parts of Interstate 15 into a lake, most intersections were under 
water much of the day and firefighters rescued stranded motorists 
from their waterlogged cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was picking up cars and throwing them around like  
toothpicks,'' said Robert Anderson, who watched as his neighbor's 
mobile home was swept away. ``It was a huge double-wide and it just 
went into the water and it just disintegrated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clark County Fire Department spokesman Steve La-Sky said  
hundreds of cars were trapped in high water and at least three 
mobile homes had been lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The rain appeared to have led to the deaths of two people, a man  
whose body was found in a flood channel and a woman who died in a 
traffic accident, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourists sought shelter in the casinos along the famed Strip.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Strip is a lake, up over the curbs, into our fountains,''  
said Phil Cooper, spokesman for Caesars Palace hotel-casino. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the casino was closed.  
</P>
<P>
	Flights at McCarran International Airport were shut down for 45  
minutes, and two planes were diverted to Los Angeles, airport 
spokeswoman Cynthia Markson said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a nightmare. It's one of the worst things I've ever  
seen,'' said Nevada Highway Patrol spokesman Scott Flabi. 
</P>
<P>
	The flooding could have been much worse if not for a flood  
control program that was initiated in 1987 and has cost $400 
million to date. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't begin to estimate what would have happened if these  
flood controls were not in place,'' Gale Fraser, general manager of 
the Clark County Regional Flood Control District, said today. ``I 
know it would have been a lot worse.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system is made up of huge detention basins that capture  
flood water and control the release eastward across the valley into 
Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	The system will take another 25 years and $1 billion to  
complete. 
</P>
<P>
	Gilles Bloch, a tourist from France who watched the flooding  
from his hotel room at the Sahara hotel-casino, described the city: 
``Looking out the window, it looked like a beautiful woman who had 
been crying, and all the makeup was running down her face. That's 
Las Vegas today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in California, monsoon rains flooded roadways and  
fields in southern parts of the state, sending children into the 
streets of Hemet for improvisational surfing on water boards tied 
behind pickup trucks.

<P>
	DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) -- Ford Motor Co. enthusiasts now can buy  
the company's apparel, accessories and other merchandise on the 
Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford has launched a new Web site, www.iCollection.com, which  
offers hats, flags, signs and shirts emblazoned with the company's 
logo. 
</P>
<P>
	Shoppers also can purchase accessories for Ford, Lincoln and  
Mercury vehicles, such as covers, floor mats and tools. 
</P>
<P>
	The new site, launched in June, is linked to Ford's main Web  
site and allows consumers to make all their purchases in one 
transaction. 
</P>
<P>
	The site has a password-protected section that allows dealers to  
purchase equipment, and the online store eventually will be 
accessible through dealers' individual Internet sites, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not on the Web just to promote vehicle sales,'' said  
Darryl Hazel, executive director of Ford's customer service 
division. ``Internet services like iCollection are just starting 
points from which we and our dealers are developing new ways for 
customers to engage with us.''

<HEADLINE> Is It Time for Inflation Bonds? / On the Money  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates  
to keep the economy from overheating, now may be a good time to 
take another look at what had been one of the least-desirable 
investments around: inflation-indexed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Shunned by investors since hitting the market within the last  
two years -- as the inflation rate was plunging -- inflation-indexed 
Treasury bonds and savings bonds have been attracting more interest 
lately as concerns about rising consumer prices have resurfaced. 
</P>
<P>
	``When the government first issued them ... it was like trying  
to sell hot chocolate in the summer,'' said Daniel J. Pederson, 
author of ``Savings Bonds: When to Hold, When to Fold and 
Everything In-Between.'' ``If inflation returns to even normal 
levels, inflation bonds will pick up steam.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some industry experts say that's already happening. The annual  
rate of inflation felt by consumers now stands at 3.3 percent, up 
from a 1.6 percent rise for all of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed made a pre-emptive strike against inflation after its  
June 29-30 policy-making meeting by raising short-term interest 
rates a quarter percentage point to 5 percent. Banks, in turn, 
nudged up the prime lending rate from 7.75 percent to 8 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've come out of a period where inflation has been coming  
down. I think that's behind us now,'' said Christopher Kinney, a 
manager at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Inflation-indexed bonds -- which come in five-, 10- and 30-year  
issues -- have managed to hold their own this year even though 
inflation has remained relatively low and interest from the 
investing public has been cool. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, they actually have been outperforming the rest of the  
Treasury market, market watchers point out. 
</P>
<P>
	Their average total return (price appreciation plus interest  
payments) was 1.88 percent through May, vs. 1.77 percent for 
one-year Treasury bills, minus 2.46 percent for five-year T-bills, 
and minus 8.77 percent for the 30-year Treasury bond, noted Kinney, 
whose firm offers the 59 Wall Street Inflation Index Fund, one of 
three mutual funds specializing in inflation bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	The other two funds are American Century Inflation-Adjusted  
Treasury Fund and Pimco Real Return Bond Fund. 
</P>
<P>
	The trio of funds, whose combined assets are under $100 million,  
have had returns ranging from 1.5 percent to nearly 4 percent so 
far this year, according to Morningstar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Also doing well are inflation savings bonds, or I-bonds, which  
were introduced last September and come in eight denominations, 
from $50 to $10,000, Pederson noted. 
</P>
<P>
	The I-bond currently carries a 3.3 percent fixed rate, though it  
returned 5.05 percent on May 1 based on a compiled Consumer Price 
Index average. That's better than the 4.31 percent rate on the 
Series EE U.S. savings bond. 
</P>
<P>
	The next rate change is on Nov. 1, and Pederson says he expects  
the I-bond yield to move higher to reflect a sharp uptick in the 
April CPI, which was not taken into account in the May adjustment. 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, the key advantage of inflation bonds is that they  
safeguard holders from inflation, which erodes the value of 
fixed-income securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors get a yield on their principal investment, and if  
inflation rises, the Treasury credits additional money to the 
bondholder's principal at the same percentage that inflation rises 
as measured by the CPI 
</P>
<P>
	There are some disadvantages, however. For starters, the market  
for inflation-indexed bonds isn't as liquid as for the other 
Treasury bonds, which means it may be a little harder to find 
buyers or sellers. 
</P>
<P>
	Another drawback is their tax treatment. Even though the  
inflation payout isn't made until the securities mature or are 
sold, investors still owe income taxes on it each year. (That's not 
the case with the inflation savings bond.) 
</P>
<P>
	It's for that reason that investment advisers suggest placing  
these bonds in tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401(k)s and 
Individual Retirement Accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It should be part of the conservative end of a portfolio,''  
said Kinney, who recommends they represent a minimum 20 percent of 
assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Andrew Horowitz, who runs the Hollywood, Fla., financial  
consulting firm Horowitz &AMP; Co., isn't quite sold on the idea yet: 
``Even though they seem at first glance pretty straight forward, 
there's an added level of complexity to them and every time you add 
complexity to an investment it concerns me.''

	NATO Says Area Looks Like Mass Grave  
</P>
<P>
	LJUBENIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers said today they  
fear the remains of up to 350 victims of Serb killings may be 
scattered in the nearby gorges and valleys near this village in 
western Kosovo. The peacekeepers sealed off parts of the 
mountainous area so war crimes experts could investigate reports of 
the mass burial site. If confirmed, it would be the largest 
massacre site yet discovered in Kosovo.

	Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the biggest personal-injury award in U.S.  
history, a jury ordered General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 billion 
today to six people severely burned when their Chevrolet Malibu 
exploded in flames in a rear-end collision. Lawyers for GM said the 
verdict is not likely to stand, but the plaintiffs hailed it as a 
huge victory for consumers. The huge verdict came after a 10-week 
state court trial that focused on an internal GM study. The 
plaintiffs' lawyers said the study demonstrated that GM had known 
for years that the tanks were unsafe, but found it cheaper to 
settle lawsuits than to pay for a recall.

Internet grocery business. Webvan Group Inc., a 2-year-old startup

live and some people die.'' The president spoke at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center three days before the Senate is to open debate on 
HMO regulation. Clinton's ``patients' bill of rights'' died in 
Congress last fall, but he pledged to revive the proposal this 
year. Democrats are again promoting the legislation, which would 
set more stringent rules on how managed-care organizations treat 
patients.

	Famous N.C. Lighthouse Relocated  
</P>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Workers gently pushed the Cape Hatteras  
Lighthouse over the threshold of its new home today to the cheers 
of hundreds of tourists and the relief of lighthouse lovers. The 
129-year-old lighthouse, renowned for its spiraling black and white 
stripes, was relocated slowly but steadily from its original 
location over a course of three weeks to spare it from the pounding 
surf, which had eroded the structure's shorefront.

	U.N. Waging Germ Warfare, Saddam Says  
</P>
<P>
	BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) -- President Saddam Hussein has accused the  
United Nations of mounting a secret germ war against Iraq, citing 
his government's accusation that a U.N. employee bred locust eggs 
to harm Iraqi crops. In remarks carried by three state-run 
newspapers today, Saddam also charged U.N. employees in Iraq of 
theft, mainly of archaeological treasures, for sale abroad. The 
United Nations did not immediately respond to the allegations, the 
harshest and most serious ever made by Iraq.

	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Cal Ripken's $6.3 million option for the  
2000 season was exercised by the Baltimore Orioles today, giving 
baseball's iron man at least one more year in his brilliant career. 
Ripken, who turns 39 next month, entered tonight's game against 
Philadelphia with a .311 average, 12 homers and 36 RBIs. He will

<HEADLINE> Swisscom Takes Big Stake in debitel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) -- Swiss telecommunications company  
Swisscom said Friday it is taking a majority holding in German 
network provider debitel in a 2.6 billion Swiss franc ($1.65 
billion) deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is buying a 34.2 percent stake from DaimlerChrysler,  
along with 17.7 percent from Metro Holding and 7.9 percent from 
Divaco. Divaco is a joint venture between Metro Holding and 
Deutsche Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler and Metro each will retain a 10 percent stake in  
debitel, the third-largest mobile telecommunications provider in 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Debitel has operations in France, Belgium, Denmark, the  
Netherlands and Slovenia, while Swisscom is active in Austria, 
Italy, France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	Swisscom said the deal, which will give it a 58 percent stake in  
debitel, will strengthen its European market position 
significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the largest investment Swisscom has ever made in a  
company. It is a worthwhile investment in the future that offers 
both companies new perspectives,'' said Swisscom chief executive 
Tony Reis. 
</P>
<P>
	Swisscom said there will be no job losses at either company.  
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Swisscom were up 1.2 percent at 598 francs ($381) in  
early trading in Zurich.

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Stage Win Annulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAUBEUGE, France (AP) -- Mario Cipollini made cycling history  
Friday, with an assist from the Tour de France race jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The Italian sprinter became the first rider since 1948 to  
capture three consecutive stages in cycling's showcase event. His 
milestone was assured only after Tom Steels of Belgium was stripped 
of the first-place finish in the sixth stage for dangerous riding. 
</P>
<P>
	``This annulment was justified because we almost had a serious  
accident,'' said Cipollini, a popular rider known as the ``Lion 
King.'' ``The sprint must be correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The jury ruled Steels pushed Jan Svorada of Slovakia with his  
hip during the final sprint and veered into Cipollini. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tom Steels swerved sufficiently,'' said Jacques Sabathier, the  
jury president. ``He shut Jan Svorada out. He didn't stick to his 
line and that can get dangerous.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Added Cipollini: ``The rules are clear. Steels was in a line,  
then he passed three meters to the right at the moment Svorada was 
passing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steels sought to win this stage and wear the leader's yellow  
jersey just as the race brushed by the border of his home country. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Belgian fans who crossed the border to see him didn't  
get what they were looking for. They did, however, get to witness a 
bit of history. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time a racer has won three straight stages at  
the Tour de France since Italy's Gino Bartali in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels was awarded 172nd place in the stage -- the last one in  
the pack that finished together, and fifth from last place. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not his first brush with Tour de France authorities. In  
1997 Steels was thrown out of the Tour after hurling a water bottle 
at a rival during a sprint. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Erik Zabel moved up to second in the stage and Jaan  
Kirsipuu of Estonia was third -- enough to hold the yellow jersey by 
26 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
	Cipollini is second in the overall standings and Steels remains  
third. Stuart O'Grady of Australia is fourth, followed by Zabel. 
</P>
<P>
	American Lance Armstrong, coming back from testicular cancer, is  
sixth and planning to mount his real attack in Sunday's time trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Every stage this week has been marked by unsuccessful early  
breakaways followed by a furious sprint to the finish. Friday's 
stage was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the longest breakaway was led by Francois Simon, the  
French national champion, who was trying to win a Tour de France 
stage as did each of his older brothers: Pascal, Regis and Jerome. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon's group was caught by the pack at 5 miles before the  
end. 
</P>
<P>
	The 107-mile route began at Amiens in the Somme region, where  
the famous World War I battle was fought. War cemeteries remain 
today, including some for Australian and British soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders passed fields of potatoes and sugar beets as the  
route headed to the town of Maubeuge, just near Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen riders broke out after 4 miles from the starting point  
of Amiens, a city known for having the largest cathedral in France. 
But they were soon swallowed by the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The second breakaway came at about 16 miles and featured 18  
riders. Among them were Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton. But the 
Americans were caught 9 miles later. 
</P>
<P>
	The main breakaway came after 46 miles, when Simon and fellow  
Frenchmen Frederic Guesdon and Gilles Maignan broke loose, as did 
Francisco Cerezo of Spain. 
</P>
<P>
	But the four, like so many before them this week, were unable to  
stay ahead of the pack and the final onslaught of sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
	When the race hits the mountains next week, the sprinters will  
give way to the climbing specialists, and many may drop out. But, 
for now, Cipollini is king.

<HEADLINE> China's Team Piling Up Flyer Miles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLAREMONT, Calif. (AP) -- China's World Cup players have been  
seeing a lot of the United States. From 30,000 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese, who play the Americans in Saturday's championship  
game at the Rose Bowl, have been piling up frequent flyer miles 
during the three-week tournament, with their travel schedule one of 
the most grueling. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can't let that cost us energy; we have just tried to stay  
with our program,'' coach Ma Yuanen said. ``That (the travel) has 
been something that has been out of the control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you worry about those things, it can affect you. We just  
want to be psychologically ready to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Counting the trip from Massachusetts earlier this week, the  
Chinese have made four cross-country trips and traveled a total of 
12,673 miles. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. players have flown less than half as much, with just  
one cross-country trip and a total of 5,498 miles. The Americans 
played their semifinal last weekend up the coast at Stanford, while 
the Chinese were back East in Foxboro. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the traveling -- and the fact that they've been  
mostly eating Chinese takeout because they aren't accustomed to 
American food -- the team has been sharp on the way to the final. 
</P>
<P>
	China sailed through its group with a 3-0 record, outscoring  
opponents 12-2. After beating Russia 2-0 in the quarterfinals, the 
Chinese humbled defending World Cup champion Norway 5-0 in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
	Led by Sun Wen, who has a tournament-high seven goals, China has  
scored 19 goals, one more than the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Gao Hong, one of the world's finest goalkeepers, has allowed  
only two shots get past her in the five games. Her American 
counterpart, Briana Scurry, has given up just three goals. 
</P>
<P>
	China also held an edge on the World Cup all-star team announced  
Thursday, with seven players selected to five for the United 
States. Sun and Gao were among the 16 all-stars named, as were 
America's Scurry and Mia Hamm. 
</P>
<P>
	China beat the United States in two of their last three  
meetings, and Ma, asked to compare the teams, said the Americans 
have a very aggressive attack. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are very familiar with the USA team and its tactics,'' the  
coach said. ``We're quite familiar with each key player. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our team has good ball-controlling ability, and very fluent  
combinations between the players. We have very good organization 
overall, defending and attacking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sun, a high-scoring forward, said that while the United States  
has a fine front line, she believes China might have more depth on 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we have a high level with all three of our lines,  
the forwards, the midfield and the defense,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The constant flying has been an adjustment for China's players,  
and so has the food. 
</P>
<P>
	``The food is too simple, the variety is too limited, so we  
always have orders delivered from Chinese restaurants,'' Ma said, 
smiling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese are used to having many courses, with a variety of  
tastes at each meal, unlike standard American fare. 
</P>
<P>
	Ma laughed and said that even the Chinese-Americans the team  
have encountered haven't been of much help. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have met many warmhearted Chinese people,'' Ma said,  
speaking through an interpreter. ``You meet Chinese people, you 
take at least two hours to chat; it's a cultural thing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want the food.''  
</P>
<P>
	Ma wasn't pleased Thursday when the start of China's practice at  
Pomona-Pitzer College was delayed by a media circus, with a 150 or 
so reporters, photographers and TV crews crowding around the 
Americans following their workout on the same field. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese players sat in the middle of the field and waited  
more than a half-hour for the area to be cleared so they could hold 
their drills, which were closed to the public and media.

<HEADLINE> Hispanic College Fund Pledges $50M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	INDIANAPOLIS (AP) -- The Lilly Endowment has offered a $50  
million grant to a fund that provides college scholarships to 
Hispanic students. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift to the San Francisco-based Hispanic Scholarship Fund,  
announced Thursday, is the largest ever pledged to any Hispanic 
organization, said Sara Martinez Tucker, HSF's president and chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Tucker said Hispanics have one of the lowest graduation  
rates among all U.S. ethnic groups, with about 9 percent graduating 
from four-year colleges. Her fund's aim is to double that 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lilly Endowment -- the charitable fund started by the  
Indianapolis-based drug company Eli Lilly and Co. -- will give the 
scholarship fund $45 million up front. It has offered another $5 
million if HSF raises an additional $5 million by the end of 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulk of the gift, $37.5 million, will be spent on direct aid  
for students. 
</P>
<P>
	This spring, the Hispanic fund gave $3.52 million to 2,600  
students. With the endowment's help, the fund will give $12 million 
each year to 6,000 students.

<HEADLINE> Strawberry Returns for Workout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry says he was so intent on  
resuming his career after colon cancer surgery that he lied about 
his chemotherapy and started drinking after the season began 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't mad at anyone. I was mad at myself more than  
anything,'' the suspended New York Yankees outfielder said. ``I 
expected more out of myself and felt I let myself down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry spoke Friday as he worked out at a team facility for  
the first time since his arrest on drug and solicitation charges 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he fell into a deep depression when the Yankees broke  
spring training and left him behind in Tampa to continue 
rehabilitation at the minor league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he covered up the fact that he was still undergoing  
chemotherapy because he didn't want to hurt his chances of making 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body went through some changes, some changes I've never  
experienced before in my life. It was very hard for me,'' 
Strawberry said. ``I think I was really too hard on myself, 
pressing myself to do too much, instead of allowing myself to wait 
until my body started feeling better. I take a lot of that 
responsibility on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also blamed his relapse with alcohol on himself, saying he  
``slacked off'' on attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The 
eight-time all-star spent four weeks in a rehab clinic for 
substance abuse in 1994 and was suspended for 60 days the following 
year after testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a tendency to come down on athletes, but we have  
people in very high positions that go through the same struggles I 
do with my alcoholism,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clean and sober today, and that's the most important  
thing. I want to stay that way. I'm back on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was arrested April 14 in Tampa and charged with  
possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and offering an undercover 
female police officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest six weeks later and was placed on 18  
months' probation. He was ordered to stay out of bars and be tested 
for drugs twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 37-year-old outfielder stretched, ran, took fly  
balls and 15 minutes of batting practice at the Yankees minor 
league complex. He hit 18 balls out of the park before continuing 
the closed workout in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball placed Strawberry on administrative leave following his  
arrest. Commissioner Bud Selig said he could rejoin the Yankees 
Aug. 11, and possibly this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the commissioner's hands,'' said Strawberry, who  
wouldn't speculate on how long it might take him to get into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let the team judge where I'm at, physically and mentally,  
as far as getting back,'' he said, adding he feels ``extremely 
healthy'' now that he's through with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry apologized to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner ``for  
any embarrassment, any pain and shame that I caused him because 
he's done so many great things for me as a person and helped me in 
so many ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Steinbrenner felt let down, yet ``realized all the  
things that I've been trying to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a world of pressure on me. I felt very hurt about  
the situation April 14 because I had been such a good citizen ever 
since I've been over here with the Yankees,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about those who think he doesn't deserve another  
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things that have happened to me are things that I bring on  
myself. It's not anyone else,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm not going to 
criticize what others have to say. I just hope they wish me well.''

<HEADLINE> Russell 2000 Kicks Out 375 Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- E-Trade is out. BarnesandNoble.com is in.  
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of speculation, the benchmark Russell 2000 stock  
index on Thursday released the list of small companies that will 
make up its roster for the coming year, knocking out 375 companies 
that had grown too large over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also out are Ameritrade, CMGI, Doubleclick, Lycos, RealNetworks  
and many other sexy Internet companies that help drive the Russell 
2000's 7.28 percent return in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are companies such as 24/7 Media and Bebe Stores.  
</P>
<P>
	Money managers across the country, many of whom measure their  
performance against the Russell 2000 index, have been anxiously 
waiting for the closely guarded list to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, The Russell 2000 eliminated all companies with a market  
value of more than $1.3 billion. A total of 513 companies were 
added to the index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 starts every July with 2000 companies, but many  
companies get acquired or go out of business, so more companies are 
added than axed each summer. The changes took effect July 1, but 
were announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. equity market is a very dynamic creature,'' said Paul  
Greenwood, senior research analyst at Frank Russell Co., the 
Tacoma, Wa.-based company that runs the indexes. ``Once again, the 
large number of initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions 
were responsible for a significant number of the changes to our 
indexes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The largest company in the index is American Management Services  
with a market value of $1.3 billion and the smallest company is 
Towne Services with a market value of $178.2 million.

<HEADLINE> Litton Won't Pursue Va. Shipyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- Litton Industries Inc.'s decision  
Friday to withdraw its offer to buy Newport News Shipbuilding means 
the Virginia shipyard will remain independent. 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel pretty good about that,'' Newport News Shipbuilding  
spokesman Mike Hatfield said. ``The company has been strong and we 
believe will continue to be strong as an independent company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In announcing the withdrawal, Woodland Hills, Calif.-based  
Litton said the deal was unlikely to receive government approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton had offered $1.3 billion in stock for Newport News, but  
last month Defense Secretary William Cohen said the Pentagon 
probably would tell the Justice Department to reject the bid for 
anti-competitive reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The Litton-Newport News deal would have reduced the number of  
companies competing to build most classes of Navy warships from 
three to two. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael R. Brown, Litton's chairman, president and chief  
executive, said the acquisition would have enabled the company to 
provide ships to the Navy and other customers at a lower cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``However, it is evident that our proposed transaction is  
unlikely to receive the necessary government approvals at this 
time,'' Brown said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Given Cohen's comments, Newport News Shipbuilding had expected  
that either the Defense Department would officially turn down the 
proposed acquisition or that Litton would withdraw the offer, 
Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Chairman William Fricks told shareholders at the company's  
annual meeting on June 25 that the shipyard expected to remain 
independent, Hatfield said. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton, meanwhile, is continuing with a plan to merge with  
another shipbuilder, New Orleans-based Avondale Industries Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Avondale earlier had agreed to merge with Newport News for $470  
million in stock, but Litton offered $529 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton originally sought to acquire both Newport News and  
Avondale in a deal that would have created a company with more than 
$7 billion in revenues and 58,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding is the nation's only builder of  
aircraft carriers. With about 18,000 workers, it is the largest 
industrial employer in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
	Litton makes advanced electronic, defense and information  
systems and designs and builds surface combat ships for the U.S. 
Navy and other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of Litton fell 43 3/4 cents to $72 a share on the New York  
Stock Exchange, where Newport News fell 25 cents to $30.75

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the biggest product-liability award in  
U.S. history, a jury ordered General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 
billion Friday to six people severely burned when their Chevrolet 
Malibu exploded in flames in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs hailed the verdict as a huge victory for  
consumers, while GM said it would appeal and legal experts doubted 
the award would stand on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God that me and my kids survived,'' said  
plaintiff Patricia Anderson, 31. ``I thank him for allowing me to 
be an example to the public to put an end to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The huge verdict came after a 10-week state court trial on the  
defective-products lawsuit that focused on an internal GM study. 
The plaintiffs' lawyers said the study demonstrated that GM had 
known for years that the tanks were unsafe, but found it cheaper to 
settle lawsuits than to pay for a recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Ms. Anderson, her four children and family  
friend Jo Tigner $107 million in compensatory damages and $4.8 
billion in punitive damages for injuries they suffered in the 1993 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``This crash was not GM's fault and we are disappointed the  
conduct of this trial did not let the jury fairly evaluate the 
claims,'' GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rhadigan said the Malibu's fuel system was safe and said the  
crash was the fault of a drunken driver. He said the Malibu was 
sitting still at a stop light when it was hit by a car going 70 
mph. The plaintiffs' attorneys estimated that car was going 50 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Coleman Thorton, foreman of the jury, said the panel based its  
decision on the amount GM spent on advertising during the years 
that it built cars with gas tanks that he called dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We figured that if they had no regard for the lives of people  
in their cars, they should be held liable for it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the plaintiffs argued that the gas tank was placed  
too close to the rear bumper and better designs would have placed 
it over the axle or incorporated a shield. They said GM's own study 
showed that the cost of settling lawsuits arising from accidents in 
which victims were fatally burned was $2.40 per car. Plaintiffs' 
attorney Brian Panish said the problem could have been fixed for 
cheap. 
</P>
<P>
	``GM had numerous failures in their crash tests, but chose to  
leave the tank where it was because changing it would have cost 
$8.59,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tanks were mounted in unsafe positions, 11 inches from the rear  
bumper, in the Chevrolet Malibu and El Camino, the Pontiac Grand Am 
and Oldsmobile Cutlass from 1979 to 1983, he said. The current 
Malibu is a vastly different design from the 1979 model. 
</P>
<P>
	GM was aware that its study, performed in 1973 by GM engineer  
E.C. Ivey, could cause problems if it became public, or if Ivey 
were called to testify, as he did in this case. 
</P>
<P>
	``Obviously Ivey is not an individual whom we would ever, in any  
conceivable situation, want to be identified to the plaintiffs in 
(an accident) case,'' said a 1981 Oldsmobile memo that Panish 
distributed to reporters. ``The documents he generated are 
undoubtedly some of the potentially most harmful and most damaging 
were they ever to be produced.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tigner and the Andersons were driving to a store to buy candy  
after attending church services on Christmas Eve when their 1979 
Malibu was struck from behind and exploded in flames in South 
Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just remember getting out of the church and going to the  
store and falling asleep,'' said Ms. Anderson's daughter, Alisha 
Parker, now 11. ``It's been tough.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, said the GM award  
is the largest product-liability and the largest personal-injury 
verdict in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	But the enormous punitive award is unlikely to stand on appeal,  
Harrison said. Even with awards in the tens of millions of dollars, 
it is rare for a plaintiff to actually get anything close to the 
jury's verdict, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	George Priest, a professor at Yale Law School, also predicted  
the verdict would be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
	``It certainly tells us our punitive damage regime is  
rudderless. That is, juries simply don't have a way of rationally 
figuring out punitive damages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. was involved in similar litigation in 1970s and  
'80s over the placement of the gas tank in its Ford Pinto.

<HEADLINE> Unity'99 Draws White House Hopefuls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- More than 6,000 minority journalists found  
themselves in the middle of a news event as their Unity '99 
conference became the place to be for presidential hopefuls. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrat Bill Bradley made a scheduled appearance and  
Republicans Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain also made 
last-minute stops. 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore was scheduled to address the gathering  
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush's unscheduled appearance Thursday seemed to generate ill  
will, rather than enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	The Texas governor initially declined an invitation -- his office  
said he was too busy. Then he showed up for a 15-minute 
walk-through, but without a speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just really disappointed,'' said Nancy Baca, president  
of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. ``He used us 
as a glorified photo opportunity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The conference planners held a special news conference to  
denounce Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	``We believe Gov. Bush missed a tremendous opportunity,'' said  
Unity President Catalina Camia, who called Bush's quick stop 
``inadequate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Camia added that the Republicans' last-minute presence  
``underscores the power of the Unity alliance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush later downplayed the political ramifications.  
</P>
<P>
	``My presence there hopefully reaches out and says I'll be an  
inclusive-type president,'' Bush said. He said he decided to drop 
by after reading news coverage that criticized him for not 
attending the conference while in Seattle on his initial Washington 
state campaign visit. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates said they approved of Bush's decision to attend, but  
felt insulted by the brevity of his visit. 
</P>
<P>
	``It upset me that he did not make a commitment ... That's a  
serious blot,'' said Art Norman, a Chicago TV anchorman and member 
of the National Association of Black Journalists. ``He should be 
here. He should not overlook us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the election so far away, political observers say it's hard  
to tell what effect, if any, Bush's perceived snub of the Unity 
conference will have on his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	Western Washington University political science professor Ken  
Hoover said Bush's decision was surprising for a candidate who has 
a reputation for reaching out to Hispanic voters and other 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
	For the most part McCain, who spoke and answered questions for  
about an hour, escaped the criticism. McCain said he also made his 
last-minute decision after reading news coverage. 
</P>
<P>
	``We should all, Republican and Democrat, be working toward a  
new American unity,'' the Arizona Republican said. Asked about 
affirmative action, McCain replied that he supports affirmative 
action, but only in the form of training and education programs 
that create ``an equal playing field.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bradley, who spoke shortly before McCain, emphasized the  
difference between his appearance and those of the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me just say at the beginning, I did not change my  
schedule,'' Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, said to much 
applause.

	GM Ordered To Pay Record Damages  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the biggest personal-injury award in U.S.  
history, a jury ordered General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 billion 
today to six people severely burned when the gas tank of their 1979 
Chevrolet Malibu exploded in flames in a rear-end collision. The 
huge verdict came after a 10-week state court trial that focused on 
an internal GM study. The plaintiffs' lawyers said the study 
demonstrated that GM had known for years that the tanks were 
unsafe, but found it cheaper to settle lawsuits than to pay for a 
recall. 

</P>
<P>
	Patients' Rights Pressed by Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton urged lawmakers today  
to set new rules for health maintenance organizations even if that 
would increase costs, saying the question is ``whether some people 
live and some people die.'' The president spoke at Harbor-UCLA 
Medical Center three days before the Senate is to open debate on 
HMO regulation. Clinton's ``patients' bill of rights'' died in 
Congress last fall, but he pledged to revive the proposal this 
year. Democrats are again promoting the legislation, which would 
set more stringent rules on how managed-care organizations treat 
patients. 

</P>
<P>
	Alleged Mass Grave in Kosovo Probed  
</P>
<P>
	LJUBENIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Bones litter the ground in this  
western village in Kosovo and NATO peacekeepers said today they 
fear the remains of up to 350 victims of Serb killings may be 
scattered in the nearby gorges and valleys. The peacekeepers sealed 
off parts of the mountainous area so war crimes experts could 
investigate reports of the mass burial site. If confirmed, it would 
be the largest massacre site yet discovered in Kosovo. 

</P>
<P>
	South Pole Researcher To Get Aid  
</P>
<P>
	CHRISTCHURCH, New Zealand (AP) -- A U.S. Air Force jet loaded  
with medical supplies landed Saturday in New Zealand to prepare for 
an emergency airdrop at the South Pole. The 19-member Air Force 
crew is racing to the coldest place on Earth with supplies for a 
researcher who has discovered a lump in her breast. Weather 
conditions prevent her from getting away from the bottom of the 
world until at least October. A landing to evacuate the woman from 
the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station would be impossible, U.S. 
military officials say. 

</P>
<P>
	IEA Sees Possible Oil Shortage  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- OPEC's cutback in crude production and a rising  
demand for gasoline and other refined products could lead this 
winter to the biggest oil shortage in more than a decade, a 
respected industry survey warned today. But the report by the 
International Energy Agency acknowledges that a further spike in 
prices, which have almost doubled since December, would probably 
tempt oil-producing countries to break ranks and boost output. ``A 
more plausible scenario is that, before the end of the year, there 
will be an 'upward adjustment' of production,'' the agency said. 

</P>
<P>
	Indians Push Militants Across Line  
</P>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- Indian forces pushed Islamic  
militants back across the cease-fire line into Pakistan-controlled 
Kashmir today, and Pakistan asked the militants to help ``resolve 
the crisis.'' Indian troops claimed to have cleared nearly all 
guerrillas from Batalik, the easternmost of the four battle sectors 
in the Himalayan mountains of Kashmir. The developments came a day 
after Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif returned from 
Washington, where he promised President Clinton he would take 
action to end two months of fighting. 

</P>
<P>
	Opera Staged for 1st Time Since 1617  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a 20-hour Chinese opera  
branded ``feudal, superstitious and pornographic'' in China, is 
getting its first full-length performance anywhere in the world in 
nearly 400 years. A $1.5 million production sponsored by Lincoln 
Center's annual arts festival began this week at a high school 
across the street from the complex. 

</P>
<P>
	Dow Closes at New High 11,193.70  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose to new heights today as continued  
optimism about corporate profits and strong consumer spending 
offset the effects of a rocky bond market. The Dow Jones industrial 
average closed up 66.81 to 11,193.70, a record. Advancing issues on 
the New York Stock Exchange led decliners 1,810-1,130. The Nasdaq 
composite index was up 21.05 to 2,792.91, also a record. 

</P>
<P>
	Palmer Sees The End Coming  
</P>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Frustrated by his two rounds in the  
U.S. Senior Open, Palmer said today he could not see himself 
continuing in competitive golf much longer unless he starts playing 
better. Palmer, 69, never used the word retire and named some 
tournaments in which he planned to play. But he noted, ``Well, I 
guess everything has to come to an end somewhere.''

<HEADLINE> Four-Way Liver Transplant Begins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Four teams of Japanese doctors began a tricky  
series of liver transplant operations Friday that will be the first 
in the world to simultaneously involve four patients. 
</P>
<P>
	The 20 doctors on the four teams at Kyoto University Hospital  
expect to complete the last operation Saturday morning, a hospital 
official said, requesting anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The procedure is called a domino transplant because it involves  
a string of operations conducted one after the other, like a line 
of falling dominoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The transplants are common in Europe, where they are used to  
help critically ill patients who might not survive the long waits 
for a healthy liver. But previous domino transplants involved only 
three patients. 
</P>
<P>
	In domino procedures, the first two operations are just like a  
regular liver transplant. Doctors removed half the liver from a 
healthy donor and then give it to a recipient who suffers from an 
ailment. In this case, the recipient is the donor's younger 
brother. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors had completed that part by Friday night, Kyodo News  
agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The domino effect comes as the ailing liver taken from the first  
transplant recipient is then given to a third patient with more 
serious problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The operations in Kyoto are unique because the second donated  
liver was cut in two and given to two women who both have 
life-threatening liver diseases. By Friday evening, doctors had 
severed the second liver and were starting one of the transplant 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors can transplant half a liver because the organ can  
regenerate and become a healthy organ. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it can help people who are suffering ..., then please use  
my liver,'' the donor of the second liver was quoted as saying 
before the operation by Kyodo. 
</P>
<P>
	Receiving a less-than-healthy liver may require the two  
recipients to undergo surgery again in the future. The second 
donated liver has a disorder known as familial amyloid 
polyneuropathy, or FAP, which causes it to produce proteins that 
collect in the body and cause other malfunctions. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors, however, say it will take decades before the recipients  
show any symptoms from this disease. Without the new livers, at 
least one of the women would probably not live more than about six 
months and would not have survived the wait for a healthy liver, 
said hospital officials. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first domino transplant operation in Japan. Earlier  
this year, Japanese doctors performed their country's first heart 
transplant in three decades after a change in the law made the 
procedure possible. 
</P>
<P>
	The first domino liver transplant in the world was conducted  
four years ago in Portugal.

<HEADLINE> Graf To Enter U.S. Open </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After announcing she had played her last French  
Open and last Wimbledon, five-time champion Steffi Graf has entered 
the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's name was included in a list of entries submitted by the  
WTA Tour to the United States Tennis Association, which will run 
the Open from Aug. 30 through Sept. 13. It could be her final Grand 
Slam event. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steffi has been one of the favorites at the U.S. Open  
throughout her career'' tournament director Jay Snyder said. ``We 
are excited that she has decided to return for at least one more 
run.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf, 30, won the French Open championship over Martina Hingis  
and then announced she would no longer compete in the clay-court 
tournament. Four weeks later, she lost to American Lindsay 
Davenport in the finals at Wimbledon and said it was her last match 
in the grass-court event. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a lot of fun, but I guess, yes, there's going to be  
a certain time when I've got to move on with something else in my 
life,'' she said after Wimbledon. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf's 22 career Grand Slam titles is second only to Margaret  
Court Smith's 24. She is ranked No. 3 in the world and was ranked 
No. 1 for a record total of 377 weeks. In 1988, she swept all four 
Slam tournaments -- the Australian, the French, Wimbledon and the 
U.S. Open -- as well as winning the Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	Graf has been the No. 1 seed at the U.S. Open a record nine  
times.

<HEADLINE> Minneapolis Boat Crash Kills 5 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A powerboat was likely traveling  
full-throttle at nearly 70 mph when it struck a smaller vessel on 
the St. Croix River in a crash that killed five men, federal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 27-foot boat, which carried three men, struck the smaller  
boat early Saturday at a 45-degree angle on the river between 
Stillwater, Minn., and Hudson, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	``It appears the throttle was wide open, and we know the top  
speed was close to 70 mph,'' National Transportation Safety Board 
spokesman Phil Frame said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators were uncertain of the smaller 22-foot boat's speed  
because the throttle might have shifted during the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Frame said there were no apparent problems with the steering or  
propulsion system on either boat. There is no speed limit in the 
area where the boats collided. 
</P>
<P>
	Five men, all in their 20s and early 30s, were killed in the  
crash. Officials said the two men in the smaller boat died 
instantly while the three others drowned. 
</P>
<P>
	Witnesses have said both boats left an access area by a popular  
Stillwater bar prior to the crash. Results of tests to determine 
whether boat operators had been drinking were pending.

<HEADLINE> Gore Defends Hiring Rivals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Al Gore's presidential campaign defended the  
hiring of two bitter rivals as good politics, but Republicans said 
Friday the personnel move was an act of desperation. 
</P>
<P>
	Bob Squier is both a close adviser and friend to Gore and a  
specialist in political advertising for the campaign. Carter Eskew, 
who has described Squier as his mentor and has known Gore for 
years, was hired last week to help refine Gore's message. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair worked together at one of Washington's top political  
consulting firms, but parted company on bitter terms in 1993. They 
have given conflicting reasons for Eskew's departure, but Eskew 
acknowledges leaving the firm without talking to Squier. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line on this is we are already working together  
with the common goal of getting Al Gore elected president,'' Squier 
said in a telephone interview Friday. ``One of my partners just met 
with him. We're all working together to get the vice president 
elected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democratic consultant Geoff Garin said Eskew and Squier have ``a  
lot of history'' to work through. ``They've been put in a difficult 
position. but they're both professionals,'' he said. ``My bet is 
they're going to work through it, but it's going to take some 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore campaign spokesman Roger Salazar said Eskew's hiring should  
not be taken as a sign that something was amiss with the vice 
president's campaign. ``It's a sign that we are building a strong 
media team to get the vice president's message out to the American 
people,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans portrayed it differently.  
</P>
<P>
	``Al Gore is desperate,'' said Mike Collins, a spokesman for the  
Republican National Committee. ``He has Bill Clinton 
second-guessing him, Hillary Clinton upstaging him and Bill Bradley 
nipping at his heels.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore is the front-runner in the race for the Democratic  
presidential nomination, but Bill Bradley has raised enough money 
to challenge him. In a head-to-head matchup with the Republican 
front-runner, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, Gore trails by as many as 
15 percentage points in recent national polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Squier said he and Eskew didn't talk with each other after Eskew  
left their firm because ``there wasn't any reason for us to talk 
together. Now there is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to go into details about their dispute and said the  
media was making too much of it. 
</P>
<P>
	In an article Friday, The New York Times quoted Squier as saying  
he had not talked publicly about Eskew's reasons for leaving the 
firm ``because it would be harmful to Gore if I did.'' He later 
called the newspaper back to say Eskew left in a money dispute. 
Eskew told the Times he left the firm because he needed to 
establish himself professionally. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew declined a request for an interview Friday, as did  
campaign manager Tony Coelho. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's huge bad blood,'' said Dick Morris, a former  
consultant to President Clinton and now a frequent critic of the 
administration. ``Even if these guys were best friends, you don't 
bring in two rival firms to do your media and your polling -- 
certainly you don't bring in two sworn enemies. It's like hiring 
the Albanians and the Serbs to work on your campaign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morris said a rivalry between the two aides that is played out  
in the media could undermine a Gore campaign that already ``is 
struggling badly.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew is a longtime confidant of Gore and worked on Clinton's  
1992 campaign. He has been a partner in the issues advocacy firm of 
Bozell Eskew. 
</P>
<P>
	Eskew's clients include pharmaceutical manufacturers, a life  
insurance foundation and Empire Blue Cross/Blue Shield, New York 
state's largest health care company. He also produced a 
multimillion-dollar advertising campaign for the tobacco industry 
that is credited with helping kill the Senate's tobacco bill last 
year. The American Lung Association protested his hiring by the 
Gore team.

<HEADLINE> Grain, Soybeans Sink in Glut Fears  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Grain and soybean futures continued their retreat Friday on the  
Chicago Board of Trade, tumbling to new lows amid a looming farm 
crisis of many supplies and too few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures retreated, while crude rose.  
</P>
<P>
	Midwest farmers, faced with few alternatives this spring despite  
the potential for sharply lower prices, planted large tracts of 
corn and soybeans. Near-ideal growing weather so far has virtually 
assured bumper fall production, agronomists said, which will add to 
already ample stockpiles. 
</P>
<P>
	While demand from Asia and other key importing countries is on  
the rise following a year of relatively low U.S. purchases, it is 
not expected to improve enough to correct the imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is predicting farmers will harvest 9.45 billion  
bushels of corn this year, but market participants now suspect the 
figure will rise close to or above 10 billion bushels. Farmers are 
expected to harvest a record 2.88 billion bushels of soybeans, and 
that figure also is expected to go higher unless crops are affected 
by an early frost. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, influential forecasting firm Sparks Cos. of Memphis,  
Tenn., predicted the soybean crop will top 2.94 billion bushels. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat futures were pressured by active harvesting of what is  
expected to be a large winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices for corn, soybeans and wheat fell despite government  
figures and anecdotal reports that the recent setbacks had 
attracted strong export demand from some of America's largest 
buyers, including Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.60 a bushel;  
December corn fell 3 cents to $1.96 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 1/4 
cents to $1.08 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents to $4.11 1/2 
a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures continued their broad retreat on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York as increased output from Brazil and 
Europe is being met by dwindling Russian purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian importers last month and in May were heavy buyers as  
they attempted to beat new tariffs being implement Aug. 1. With 
that deadline approaching, purchases from the world's largest sugar 
importing country have tailed off on the expectation new supplies 
would not make it in time. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, Brazil has begun shipping supplies from its bumper  
harvest and European inventories of refined white have been 
replenished. Analysts have said for months that bumper world 
production this year would ultimately lead to sharply lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
	October raw sugar fell .12 cent to 5.52 cents a pound.  
</P>
<P>
	Crude edged closer to $20 a barrel on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange after a report showed key oil producers met 91 percent of 
promised output cuts in June. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries succeeded  
in reducing 3.94 million barrels a day out of a targeted 4.32 
million barrels, the International Energy Agency reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The group also predicted the most serious crude shortage in a  
decade will occur later this year if the cutbacks remain in place 
and other factors do not disturb the balance. 
</P>
<P>
	Meantime, prices also were supported by word that Royal  
Dutch-Shell Group said civil unrest in Nigeria would halt 
deliveries through at least the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude prices have been stubbornly resistant, however, to  
finishing above $20 a barrel, analysts said, and could remain below 
that level unless supplies tighten even more sharply. 
</P>
<P>
	August crude rose 23 cents to $19.94 a barrel; August heating  
oil rose .40 cent to 50.80 cents a gallon; August unleaded gasoline 
rose .73 cent to 59.59 cents a gallon; August natural gas rose 1 
cent to $2.163 per 1,000 cubic feet.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon To Study NATO-Led Air War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even before it has brought home all the  
aircraft used to bomb Yugoslavia, the Pentagon has begun a war 
review to draw lessons for troop training and for shaping the U.S. 
military in the new millennium. 
</P>
<P>
	John Hamre, the deputy defense secretary, told a Pentagon news  
conference Thursday that the study's findings also would be used to 
adjust planning for the 2001 defense budget now being drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to figure out what worked and what didn't work'' in  
the 78 days of bombing, Hamre said. He said Defense Secretary 
William Cohen wants a ``quick look'' at the study's results by 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the questions to be answered, Hamre said, are why the  
Army's deployment of Apache attack helicopters from Germany to 
Albania took so long, how often NATO bombs hit Serb decoys instead 
of actual tanks, and what lessons can been learned from the 
mistaken bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	Hamre and Gen. Joseph Ralston, the vice chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, will oversee the study. 
</P>
<P>
	The air campaign has been described as the most accurate in  
history, yet it also was hampered by a slow building of consensus 
within the 19-member NATO ratcheting up the bombing after it became 
clear in late March and early April that Serbia would not fold 
quickly. U.S. generals wanted to hit Belgrade harder and earlier 
but had to wait for NATO's approval. 
</P>
<P>
	The difficulty of executing an air campaign by coalition  
consensus is to be another aspect of the Hamre-Ralston study. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also will consider the techniques used to destroy,  
defeat or evade Serb air defenses, which managed only two 
successful shootdowns among the more than 33,000 allied air 
missions during the war. 
</P>
<P>
	A senior Air Force officer, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said Thursday that the Serbs fired about 700 surface-to-air 
missiles at allied aircraft. ``We were both good and lucky'' to 
have lost only two planes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force officer also said his service was working with the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff to find a way to adjust Air Force commitments 
abroad so that pilots, planes and support crews can rest and 
recover from the intense 78 days of war. He said about 80 percent 
of the several hundred Air Force planes used in the air campaign 
have been returned to their home bases, and many need repairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Air Force units deployed for the war will need between 90 and  
240 days to recover, the officer said, and it may take as long as 
three years to fully replenish the Air Force's stock of missiles 
and bombs. He stressed that there are no shortages now, except for 
air-launched cruise missiles.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Rise a Bit; Dow Up 11.72 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were modestly higher today, but down from  
their earlier highs as interest rates rise in the bond market. 
</P>
<P>
	At noon on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up  
11.72 at 11,1138.61. The blue-chip index rose as much as 50 points 
in morning trading before pulling back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader market indicators were narrowly mixed. The Standard &AMP;  
Poor's 500 index was up 0.91 at 1,395.33. The Nasdaq composite 
index fell back from record-high territory and was down 1.07 at 
2,770.79 at midday. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks initially benefited from a recovery in the bond market  
that followed a volatile session on Thursday. But by mid-morning 
prices dropped again, pushing yields higher and reminding investors 
that higher interest rates are taking hold in the economy, and 
could threaten earnings in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond, which had fallen to  
5.96 percent in early trading, was back up at 6.03 percent at noon. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont led the Dow higher, rising 3 11/16 to 72 3/16 after the  
company unveiled some details of its spinoff of its Conoco unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Dell Computer led technology issues, rising 2 1/8 to 42 1/16 after  
Goldman Sachs raised its rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
	While stocks were mostly higher, many market participants were  
watching their moves ahead of next week, when the government's 
producer and consumer price indexes, which are key measures of 
inflation, are scheduled to be released. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 326.97 million 
shares, down from 377.59 million shares Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index was up 0.56 at 654.61, and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index was up 1.88 at 810.57.

<TEXT>
<P>
	TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Darryl Strawberry says he was so intent on  
resuming his career after colon cancer surgery that he lied about 
his chemotherapy and started drinking after the season began 
without him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wasn't mad at anyone. I was mad at myself more than  
anything,'' the suspended New York Yankees outfielder said. ``I 
expected more out of myself and felt I let myself down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry spoke Friday as he worked out at a team facility for  
the first time since his arrest on drug and solicitation charges 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he fell into a deep depression when the Yankees broke  
spring training and left him behind in Tampa to continue 
rehabilitation at the minor league complex. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he covered up the fact that he was still undergoing  
chemotherapy because he didn't want to hurt his chances of making 
the team. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body went through some changes, some changes I've never  
experienced before in my life. It was very hard for me,'' 
Strawberry said. ``I think I was really too hard on myself, 
pressing myself to do too much, instead of allowing myself to wait 
until my body started feeling better. I take a lot of that 
responsibility on myself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He also blamed his relapse with alcohol on himself, saying he  
``slacked off'' on attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The 
eight-time all-star spent four weeks in a rehab clinic for 
substance abuse in 1994 and was suspended for 60 days the following 
year after testing positive for cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
	``People have a tendency to come down on athletes, but we have  
people in very high positions that go through the same struggles I 
do with my alcoholism,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm clean and sober today, and that's the most important  
thing. I want to stay that way. I'm back on the right track.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry was arrested April 14 in Tampa and charged with  
possession of 0.3 grams of cocaine and offering an undercover 
female police officer $50 for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded no contest six weeks later and was placed on 18  
months' probation. He was ordered to stay out of bars and be tested 
for drugs twice a week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the 37-year-old outfielder stretched, ran, took fly  
balls and 15 minutes of batting practice at the Yankees minor 
league complex. He hit 18 balls out of the park before continuing 
the closed workout in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball placed Strawberry on administrative leave following his  
arrest. Commissioner Bud Selig said he could rejoin the Yankees 
Aug. 11, and possibly this month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the commissioner's hands,'' said Strawberry, who  
wouldn't speculate on how long it might take him to get into shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll let the team judge where I'm at, physically and mentally,  
as far as getting back,'' he said, adding he feels ``extremely 
healthy'' now that he's through with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
	Strawberry apologized to Yankees owner George Steinbrenner ``for  
any embarrassment, any pain and shame that I caused him because 
he's done so many great things for me as a person and helped me in 
so many ways.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Steinbrenner felt let down, yet ``realized all the  
things that I've been trying to overcome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a world of pressure on me. I felt very hurt about  
the situation April 14 because I had been such a good citizen ever 
since I've been over here with the Yankees,'' Strawberry said. 
</P>
<P>
	He was asked about those who think he doesn't deserve another  
chance. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things that have happened to me are things that I bring on  
myself. It's not anyone else,'' Strawberry said. ``I'm not going to 
criticize what others have to say. I just hope they wish me well.''

	Yugoslavia Mass Grave May Be Found  
</P>
<P>
	LJUBENIC, Yugoslavia (AP) -- NATO peacekeepers said today the  
bodies of as many as 350 people could be spread near this Kosovo 
mountain village in valleys and gorges where ethnic Albanians 
apparently tried to flee from Serb attackers. Human bones were 
scattered on the ground of the tiny western village of Ljubenic, 
the site of the reported mass killing, which if confirmed would be 
the worst in a month of grisly findings since NATO troops entered 
the province. Peacekeepers have been told by locals there could be 
up to 350 bodies of people massacred around Ljubenic, said Lt. 
Commander Louis Garneau, a spokesman of the peacekeeping force, 
known as KFOR.

	Cities Call For Milosevic's Removal  
</P>
<P>
	PROKUPLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Adding strength to a growing  
anti-government movement, two more cities -- including Serbia's 
third largest, Nis -- passed declarations today calling for the 
resignation of President Slobodan Milosevic. The move by city 
assemblies in Nis and Sombor, in southern and northern Serbia, 
followed similar declarations by local governments in other towns 
and cities, including Novi Sad, Serbia's second largest city. The 
president's hardline supporters, meanwhile, are intensifying a 
counter-campaign that accuses the opposition of treason and of 
attempting to provoke a civil war in Serbia.

	Patients' Rights Pressed by Clinton  
</P>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- With political maneuvering over a  
``patients' bill of rights'' intensifying on the airwaves and in 
the Senate, President Clinton pressed lawmakers to set rules for 
health maintenance organizations even if that would increase costs. 
``No one who believes in proper management believes you should 
sacrifice proper care,'' Clinton told a sympathetic group of 
medical professionals and educators at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, Medical Center facility in Torrance. The 
Senate is preparing to begin debate on the legislation when it 
returns from recess Monday, but Clinton criticized the GOP 
leadership for refusing to take up the bill for more than a year.

	OJAI, Calif. (AP) -- Former astronaut Charles P. ``Pete'' Conrad,  
who in 1969 became the third man to walk on the moon, uttering an 
exuberant ``Whoopie!'' as he stepped on the lunar surface, died in 
a motorcycle accident. He was 69. Conrad, who also flew two Gemini

informant in a major price-fixing investigation was sentenced today 
to 2 1/2 years in prison for his participation in the scheme. Mark 
Whitacre, 41, was sentenced by telephone. He is at a federal prison 
camp in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year sentence for swindling 
ADM out of $9 million. He and two other top ADM executives --

<HEADLINE> Chinese-Americans Torn in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chinese-American soccer fans have plenty to  
cheer about -- perhaps too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Their problem is which side to root for during Saturday's  
Women's World Cup championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Do they cheer for China, the country from where many of their  
parents, grandparents and other relatives hail? Or do they root for 
the United States, where many of the fans were born and make their 
home? 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Lee, a 32-year-old insurance agent whose grandparents  
immigrated to America from China, looked cautiously at his 
29-year-old Taiwanese wife, Hong, before answering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about it too much because if China wins,  
she will never let me hear the last of it,'' Lee said, nodding at 
his wife. ``But I'm for the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think China will win,'' she added as the couple left a  
Chinatown restaurant, ``and he's right, I'll will let him know 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With many Chinese-Americans expected to be in the sellout crowd  
of some 90,000 at the Rose Bowl for Saturday's game and many more 
watching on television, the Lees seem to provide a microcosm of the 
split allegiances across America. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Yee, 54, said China's appearance in the World Cup final  
has caused a buzz in the restaurant he runs in Boston's Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time in China that a woman's team has made  
it to the championship. It's on the front page of all the 
newspapers,'' Yee said. ``I'm proud of the team because I'm 
Chinese. It's a popular topic in the restaurant; it's on everyone's 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for choosing sides, Yee would like it both ways. He said he  
plans to root for the United States because he wants to be 
patriotic. But he added: ``I hope it's a tie. A zero-zero, double 
champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Yee, that can't happen. If the game is tied at  
the end of regulation, the teams decide the outcome with penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berkeley, University of California student Jennie Liu, 20,  
said she favors China because she is impressed by the team's soccer 
skills, not because of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about soccer, it's not about politics,'' she said. ``I  
like the Chinese team because I've seen them play and I like their 
style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Chinatown, Ya Qiu, a fishmonger from Guangdong  
province, said the matchup is exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is good for China and the Chinese people. It  
shows that we can compete and hold our own with anybody,'' Qiu said 
in Mandarin. ``I'm definitely going to watch the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Kenny Gong, a 61-year-old retiree who has lived in New  
York for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a very big fan; I've watched all the games so far,'' Gong  
said. ``It's very exciting that they are women and I think it is 
good for the spirit and integrity of the Chinese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Rowland Heights, one of several Los Angeles suburbs with a  
large ethnic Chinese community, 12-year-old Amy Chang said she 
plans to watch the game on television and has no question who she 
will be cheering for. 
</P>
<P>
	``USA,'' she said. ``I think they're awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not all Chinese-Americans are caught up in World Cup fever. In  
Los Angeles' Chinatown, Harry Yang, a 19-year-old clerk at Hill 
Street Cafe &AMP; Cigar, said he didn't think people his age were 
really into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of the game, saw maybe three minutes about the  
American team on TV. But I don't really care who wins,'' said Yang, 
who came from China to the United States 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street at It Pun Fortune Readings, proprietor Lau Hang  
Mee seemed only vaguely aware that the game was being played. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to predict the winner, Lau the fortune teller, with a  
friend translating, replied, ``I don't know.''

<HEADLINE>  McCarty Goes From NCAA Title to WNBA Bench </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) -- Stephanie McCarty scored more than 5,000  
points in her high school and college basketball careers. She's 
finding the basket to be a more elusive target in the WNBA. 
</P>
<P>
	Three months after McCarty led Purdue to the NCAA championship,  
the Charlotte Sting rookie has been benched, the result of a 
five-game stretch as a starter in which she shot just 23 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get it back,'' McCarty said. ``It's been challenging for  
me, and that's good. I like challenges.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty's rookie struggles mark a stark turnabout for someone  
who had perhaps the greatest prep career by a woman in Indiana 
history before becoming the second-leading career scorer at Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
	After scoring a state-record 2,869 points in high school,  
McCarty scored 2,182 in college, including a team-leading average 
of 20.4 as a senior. She was named an All-American and the top 
female athlete in the Big Ten, and she capped her college career by 
becoming the first player on her team to cut down the nets after 
the Boilermakers' 17-point victory over Duke in the title game. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sting, who made the playoffs in each of the WNBA's first two  
seasons, drafted McCarty with the hopes that the addition of a good 
outside shooter would help them challenge Houston for league 
supremacy. Early signs were that Charlotte made a wise choice. 
</P>
<P>
	Coming off the bench, McCarty made 55 percent of her field-goal  
attempts over the Sting's first three games and scored in double 
figures each time. So when small forward Tracy Reid went on the 
injured list with a sore knee, it seemed natural to fill her spot 
in the starting lineup with McCarty. 
</P>
<P>
	But McCarty scored just 17 points total over the next five  
games, missing 20 of her 26 field-goal attempts. After McCarty 
missed all eight of her shots in a two-game stretch, coach Marynell 
Meadors decided she had seen enough. She sent McCarty back to the 
bench. 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has made 5 of 8 shots in the two games since her  
demotion, and Charlotte has won both times to climb into second 
place in the Eastern Conference. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like having Stephanie come off the bench right now,''  
Meadors said. ``It seems to be good for her. She's more relaxed, 
and there's not as much pressure on her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty said there are no easy answers for her struggles.  
</P>
<P>
	``The biggest thing is just mental,'' said McCarty, whose  
scoring average has dropped from 13 points after three games to 
7.2. ``When I go out and I miss a couple of shots, I get down on 
myself. I'm my hardest critic. I know I can shoot the ball. I just 
need to go out and do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McCarty has had to make the usual adjustments that college  
players encounter in the jump to the pros: dealing with compressed 
schedules, more travel and players who are bigger, stronger and 
faster. 
</P>
<P>
	A big difference she has found is that she can't take as much  
time to shoot in the pros because the defenders can close on her 
faster. Meadors is working with McCarty in practice to help develop 
a quicker release. 
</P>
<P>
	``What it really comes down to is I just need to get more  
confidence,'' McCarty said. ``I'm not out here to do anything 
flashy. I just want to help this team win, and confidence is a big 
part of that.''

<HEADLINE> Patients' Rights Pressed by Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton urged lawmakers on  
Friday to set new rules for health maintenance organizations even 
if that would increase costs, saying the question is ``whether some 
people live and some people die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, the health insurance association might have some of its  
profit margins squeezed, and, yes, they may have to have modest 
increases'' in premiums, Clinton said. ``But isn't it worth it to 
allow the system to work?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president spoke at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center three days  
before the Senate is to open debate on HMO regulation. 
</P>
<P>
	He later played golf at the Riviera Country Club with actor  
Sylvester Stallone, wealthy California homebuilder and Democratic 
fund-raiser Bruce Karatz and Ray R. Irani, chairman of Occidental 
Petroleum Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's ``patients' bill of rights'' died in Congress last  
fall but he immediately pledged to revive the proposal this year. 
Democrats are again promoting the legislation, which would set more 
stringent rules on how managed-care organizations treat patients. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats want to give patients the right to sue and collect  
damages when HMOs withhold treatment. The Democrats would also 
force HMOs to pay for reasonable emergency room care and for care 
that doctors determine to be medically necessary. They would also 
guarantee patients a choice of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton sought to address Republican arguments that those  
measures would be too expensive and would force employers to drop 
coverage, swelling the ranks of the uninsured. The GOP has its own 
package of proposed new controls on managed-care firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton rejected the GOP proposals and suggestions that his  
legislation would drive up costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government has already extended many of the  
``patients' rights'' guarantees to people covered by Medicare, 
Medicaid, Veterans Administration plans and other federal programs, 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Health care costs have risen less than $1 per month, Clinton  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican proposal would benefit 48 million Americans who  
are in federally regulated, self-insured health plans, generally 
those offered by large companies. Clinton said the GOP bill would 
leave unprotected more than 100 million Americans and called its 
provisions ``insufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's remarks came as lawmakers and interest groups are  
maneuvering intensely on HMO regulation. Insurance and other 
business groups are running a $750,000 ad campaign this week aimed 
at undecided senators. 
</P>
<P>
	Both Democrats and Republicans have used parliamentary tactics  
to try to gain advantage in the impending debate. Democrats last 
month held a popular farm bill hostage to the ``patients' bill of 
rights'' to force debate next week. Republicans are planning to 
introduce a Democratic bill to make it more difficult for Democrats 
to offer amendments designed to highlight differences between the 
competing bills. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he learned of the maneuver and wondered ``what kind  
of a weird world am I living in?'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This is about whether some people live and some people die,''  
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Walter Zelman, a former Clinton ally who is now executive  
director of the California Association of Health Plans, was also in 
the Los Angeles area Friday, meeting with state lawmakers and 
cautioning the president on the proposed patients' rights bill. 
</P>
<P>
	Zelman, an architect of Clinton's plan to revamp health care,  
which died in 1994, said there is ``a lot of value'' in the 
legislation. But he said ``certain other provisions have much less 
value and a much greater cost.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the proposals to allow patients to sue, to obtain  
second opinions and to seek treatment from outside their HMO 
network of doctors.

<HEADLINE> Ohio Shootings Leave 4 Dead, 1 Hurt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- A factory worker killed three teen-age girls  
at his home, then gunned down his Bible study teacher five miles 
away, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers were searching for Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, who  
fled in his car and was believed to have several guns, including 
four rifles. 
</P>
<P>
	A 22-year-old woman escaped Hensley's home after being shot in  
the legs and shoulder. She was hospitalized in serious condition 
and was not identified. 
</P>
<P>
	``I saw her coming across the alley and crawling in the  
neighbor's back yard,'' said Donald Young, 85, a neighbor. ``She 
just kind of pulled herself up through the yard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Police were still trying to determine a motive for the  
shootings, which happened during the late afternoon Thursday in 
Sidney, a community of 19,000 people 40 miles north of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	The three teen-agers were found dead inside Hensley's one-story  
house, which he shared with his wife. 
</P>
<P>
	Officers found 24 Molotov cocktails lined up on a workbench in  
the basement. They appeared to contain gasoline, according to bomb 
squad members who detonated the devices. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Steven Wearly said Hensley knew the victims, although he  
did not say why they were at his house. 
</P>
<P>
	Sherry Kimbler and her cousin Tosha Barrett, both 16, had been  
shot several times at close range with a shotgun. Amy Mikesell, 14, 
was found stabbed and hidden in the basement. Police said Sherry 
was a neighbor to Hensley. 
</P>
<P>
	Brett R. Wildermuth, 37, was shot and killed at his house. He  
knew Hensley through home Bible study classes he taught, said the 
Rev. Ben Davis, pastor of First Church of God. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would have no reason to have contact with Mike or to even  
help Mike if it wasn't for his faith in Christ,'' Davis said. 
``Mike went to him for help.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davis said Hensley, a church member for about a year, had  
problems but he would not elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	``He certainly wanted to break from his past,'' the pastor said.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said the 22-year-old survivor identified Hensley as the  
gunman and said he left the house with his wife, Julie, in their 
car. Police believe the victims were shot before Mrs. Hensley 
arrived home and that she did not know the bodies were there. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Hensley remained at Wildermuth's house after he was shot.  
</P>
<P>
	Police said the Hensleys had been married two or three months.  
Hensley has a young son who doesn't live with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Hensley, a worker at the Glacier Daido America automotive parts  
plant in nearby Bellefontaine, was considered an employee in good 
standing, said Jeff Wheeler, quality assurance manager. 
</P>
<P>
	But a former co-worker described him as ``weird.''  
</P>
<P>
	``He made us stop one night to look at road kill on the road,''  
said Lisa Perin, 31, who lives across the street from the Hensleys. 
``He thought that was so fascinating. He started taking the parts 
out of the animal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He thought it would be neat to hurt somebody and watch them  
die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another neighbor, Donna Parisse, 24, saw a different side.  
</P>
<P>
	``He seemed to be a very nice guy. He was always out working in  
his yard, riding his bike,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	He once found some money and brought it to her house across the  
street to see if it belonged to her, Parisse said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never felt uncomfortable around him.''

<HEADLINE> Tour de France Stage Win Annulled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MAUBEUGE, France (AP) -- Tom Steels of Belgium was stripped of  
his victory in today's stage of the Tour de France for rough 
cycling. 
</P>
<P>
	The race jury awarded the sixth stage to Mario Cipollini,  
marking the third straight stage won by the Italian sprinter. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision came shortly after Steels' victory in a photo  
finish had been announced. 
</P>
<P>
	This stage was especially important to Steels because it brushed  
by his home country, and many Belgians had crossed the border to 
see him. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was ruled Steels pushed Jan Svorada of Slovakia with his  
hip during the final sprint and appeared to veer into Cipollini. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear ... that Tom Steels swerved sufficiently. He shut  
Jan Svorada out. He didn't stick to his line and that can get 
dangerous,'' said Jacques Sabathier, the jury president. 
</P>
<P>
	This was the first time a racer has won three straight stages at  
the Tour de France since Italy's Gino Bartali in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels had been seeking his third victory of the week. With his  
victory denied, Germany's Erik Zabel moved into second place 
overall. Estonia's Jaan Kirsipuu was third -- enough to hold the 
yellow jersey, 26 seconds ahead of Cipollini. 
</P>
<P>
	Steels is third in the overall standings, followed by Stuart  
O'Grady of Australia and Zabel. American Lance Armstrong is sixth. 
</P>
<P>
	Every stage this week has been marked by unsuccessful early  
breakaways followed by a furious sprint to the finish, and today's 
was no exception. 
</P>
<P>
	This time, the longest breakaway was led by Francois Simon, the  
French national champion, who was trying to win a Tour de France 
stage, as each of his three older brothers did. 
</P>
<P>
	But Simon's group was caught by the pack 5 miles before the  
finish. 
</P>
<P>
	The 107-mile route began at Amiens in the Somme region where the  
famous World War I battle was fought. War cemeteries remain today, 
including some for Australian and British soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
	The riders passed fields of potatoes and sugar beets as the  
route headed to the town of Maubeuge, just near Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirteen riders broke out after 4 miles from the starting point  
of Amiens, a city known for its massive cathedral. But they were 
soon swallowed by the pack. 
</P>
<P>
	The second breakaway came at about 16 miles and featured 18  
riders. Among them were Armstrong and Tyler Hamilton. But the 
Americans were caught 9 miles later. 
</P>
<P>
	The main breakaway came after 46 miles, when Simon and fellow  
Frenchmen Frederic Guesdon, and Gilles Maignan, as well as Spaniard 
Francisco Cerezo, broke loose. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, heading north from the Loire valley to the Picardy  
region, the riders passed tantalizingly close to Paris. The 
sprinters may have been tempted to take a shortcut to the finale at 
Champs Elysees. 
</P>
<P>
	But the finale isn't for two more weeks. Before then, there are  
grueling mountain stages in the Alps and Pyrenees. That's when the 
sprinters will stop shining -- and maybe even drop out altogether. 
But for now, Cipollini is the hero. 
</P>
<P>
	All this when some had started to grumble about his sluggish  
performances and Cipollini had joked about soon being unemployed 
because his team, Saeco, was unhappy with him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have resumed about my future,'' he said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Solar Wind Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 37 years, solar physicists have wondered  
how charged particles streaming from the sun could reach a speed of 
almost 2 million mph. A new study solves the puzzle: The particles 
catch a magnetic wave and surf across space. 
</P>
<P>
	Existence of a high speed flow from the sun, called the solar  
wind, was first confirmed in 1962, but experts were startled at the 
wind's velocity. They had expected it to poke along at a mere 1 
million mph, and the higher speed has been a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	New measurements by two satellites have provided the answer,  
researchers said Thursday, by showing that the solar wind's speed 
is boosted by magnetic waves that spiral out from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is accelerated out of the sun by magnetic waves  
in much the same way a surfer rides the waves to the shore,'' said 
John L. Kohl of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings have revolutionized our understanding of the  
sun's outer atmosphere and the solar wind,'' said George Withbroe, 
a director in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
office of space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The solar wind is composed of electrically charged particles --  
atoms and electrons -- constantly flowing from the sun's outer 
atmosphere, or corona. The 1 million to 2 million degree heat of 
the corona strips electrons from oxygen and hydrogen atoms, 
creating the charged particles. The stream of gas and electrons 
streak across the solar system, blasting unprotected planets, and 
racing outward into deep space, reaching a point, experts say, 
about 9 billion miles from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnetic field surrounding the Earth protects it from the  
erosion of the solar wind, but most other planets are not as lucky. 
For instance, scientists believe it was the solar wind that 
stripped away any atmosphere from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is staggering in size. Every eight hours, the  
sun puts out gas equal to all of the gases in the Earth's 
atmosphere,'' said Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had speculated about the solar wind, but its  
existence was not confirmed until the Mariner spacecraft took 
measurements in 1962, the same year that John Glenn made his first 
spaceflight. But the discovery raised the question about why the 
wind was moving faster than experts say was possible from ordinary 
solar radiant energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the high-speed mystery was solved with the help of a  
robot spacecraft hauled into orbit aboard the space shuttle that 
returned Glenn to space last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution came from measurements taken by the Spartan 201  
spacecraft, carried into orbit by the shuttle, and by the SOHO, a 
sun-observing spacecraft jointly owned by NASA and the European 
Space Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartan and SOHO instruments detected oxygen and hydrogen  
atoms spiraling along vibrating magnetic fields that stream out 
from the corona. The atoms pick up speed from the push of the 
wavelike motion of the magnetic fields, Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two solar diameters out from the sun's outer atmosphere, the  
oxygen atoms are traveling at more than 1 million mph, said Leonard 
Strachan, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory. He said the hydrogen atoms travel at a lower speed, 
about 600,000 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the solar wind reaches the vicinity of the Earth, he  
said, it is traveling at more than 500 miles per second, almost 2 
million mph. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate this speed, Strachan said it takes the space  
shuttle about 90 minutes to orbit the Earth. The oxygen atoms in 
the solar wind, he said, could complete an Earth orbit in one 
minute.

<HEADLINE> Four Dead in Ohio Shootings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- Authorities were searching today for a man  
suspected of shooting three teen-age girls to death in his home and 
then killing a man in a neighborhood five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the suspect might have several guns, including four  
rifles. Officers detonated 24 Molotov cocktails found inside his 
house. 
</P>
<P>
	The teen-agers' bodies were found Thursday inside the home of  
Lawrence Michael Hensley, 30, in this western Ohio city about 40 
miles north of Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	Police Chief Steven Wearly said the gunman knew the three girls,  
ages 14, 16 and 17, although the motive was unclear. The 
14-year-old appeared to have been stabbed as well, Wearly said. 
</P>
<P>
	A 22-year-old woman who was wounded by the gunman was found by  
officers outside the house. She said she got out by breaking a 
window in the basement. She was listed in serious condition at 
Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. Her name wasn't released. 
</P>
<P>
	She identified Hensley as the gunman and said he had left the  
house with his wife in the family car, a purple Chevy Cavalier, 
Wearly said. 
</P>
<P>
	About a half-hour after the shootings were reported, 37-year-old  
Brett R. Wildermuth was shot at his house. A police statement said 
authorities believe Hensley was responsible for that shooting, too. 
</P>
<P>
	The relationships between Hensley, Wildermuth, the dead girls  
and the wounded woman were unclear. Wearly said only that some of 
the teens knew each other, but he didn't know how.

<HEADLINE> Jagger, Hall Agree To Separate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rolling Stone lead singer Mick Jagger and his  
Texan-born wife Jerry Hall have ``amicably and formally agreed to 
separate,'' their attorneys said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two reached a ``mutually acceptable legal and financial  
settlement'' after a 12-minute hearing in the High Court in central 
London, their lawyers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall are determined that their  
friendship and mutual respect will endure. They will always be 
linked through the great shared love they have for their four 
children and their determination to both play their full part as 
parents,'' the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
	Datails of the financial settlement were kept secret. British  
tabloid newspapers have reported that Hall was seeking a $50 
million settlement from Jagger's estimated fortune of $240 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall filed for divorce in January after a Brazilian model  
claimed she was pregnant after a fling with Jagger. Jagger's 
publicity agents had said the singer would contest Hall's petition 
on the grounds that their Indonesian marriage was not legally 
valid. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their wedding ceremony took place in 1990, Jagger, 55,  
and Hall, 43, have been together for 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's hearing had been scheduled to arrange an agenda for a  
full hearing of Hall's divorce petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall was represented by Mishcon de Reya, the same law firm that  
acted for Princess Diana in her divorce from Prince Charles.

<HEADLINE> Lovelytobehold Wins Delvin Miller </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Lovelytobehold came charging down  
the stretch Friday to win the $400,000 Delvin Miller Memorial for 
3-year-old fillies by a head over Dream Valley OM. 
</P>
<P>
	The lightly raced Lovelytobehold, driven by Jim Doherty, trotted  
the mile in a career-best 1:54 3-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Doherty kept his filly near the lead through the first  
half-mile, then challenged Oolong on the far turn. Oolong held onto 
the lead until the top of the stretch, when Lovelytobehold took 
command and held off a late challenge from Dream Valley OM. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a little green so I had to be careful with her  
leaving,'' Doherty said. ``Once I hit the top of the stretch I 
thought I had a pretty good chance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The victory was the second in six career starts for  
Lovelytobehold, who raced only once as a 2-year-old. This year she 
has run five times, finishing first twice and second twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's a late comer,'' trainer-owner Tom Gonsalves said. ``She  
raced only once last year. I saved her for her 3-year-old season. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know now she can go with the best,'' said Gonsalves, who  
plans to enter Lovelytobehold in the Hambletonian Oaks. ``She can 
make anyone look good, even me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The $200,000 winner's purse is the first big payoff for  
Gonsalves and was 10 times more than Lovelytobehold had won in her 
previous five starts. 
</P>
<P>
	Rum Boogie, who was sent off as the 4-5 favorite, finished  
fourth and was never a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	``She wasn't right. She wasn't herself tonight,'' driver Mike  
Lachance said. ``I got pushed out a little at the top of the 
stretch, but that's racing. She was making noises during the race 
and was breathing very heavy after the wire so I knew she wasn't 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lovelytobehold paid $13.40, $6.20 and $4.60. Dream Valley OM was  
worth paid $9.20 and $5.60 and Poster Princess returned $8. 
</P>
<P>
	In other races, CR Renegade and Self Possessed won their  
respective Beacon Course eliminations. CR Renegade came roaring 
down the stretch to nip Starchip Enterprise by a head in 1:54 in 
the first elimination while Self Possessed pulled away for a 
13 1/4-length victory while equaling his track-record 1:52 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
	Also qualifying for next Friday's $430,000 Beacon Course final  
which will match many of the best horses for this year's edition of 
the Hambletonian were Angus Hall, Enjoy Lavec, Fortuna Winner, 
Davanti, Supershade, CR Commando and Cherry Hills.

</P>
<P>
	OJAI, Calif. (AP) -- Charles P. ``Pete'' Conrad, one of NASA's  
pioneering astronauts and the third man to walk on the moon, died 
Thursday after a motorcycle accident near Ojai. He was 69. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Conrad formed several companies with the goal of  
commercializing space. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA selected Conrad, an aeronautical engineer and Navy test  
pilot, as an astronaut in 1962. He piloted the eight-day Gemini 5 
mission in 1965, which set an endurance record in orbiting the 
earth. A year later, Conrad commanded Gemini 11, which docked with 
another craft during orbit and set a space altitude record of 850 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
	As commander of the Apollo 12 mission in 1969, Conrad walked on  
the moon after bringing the lunar module down in the Ocean of 
Storms. He and astronaut Alan Bean spent seven hours and 45 minutes 
on the lunar surface. 
</P>
<P>
	Conrad, who graduated from Princeton University in 1953, also  
flew in the first manned Skylab mission. During the 28-day flight 
in 1973, he established a personal endurance record for time in 
space by bringing his total flight time to 1,179 hours and 38 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
	After retiring from NASA and the Navy in 1973, he worked as  
chief operating officer of American Television and Communications 
Corp. in Denver and later for McDonnell Douglas Corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	Among his numerous awards are the Congressional Space Medal of  
Honor, two NASA Distinguished Service Medals, two NASA Exceptional 
Service Medals, two Navy Distinguished Service Medals and two 
Distinguished Flying Crosses. He was enshrined in the Aviation Hall 
of Fame in 1980.

	CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) -- Kenneth K. Hall, whose 47-career as a  
state and federal judge included a decision to allow female cadets 
at The Citadel, died Thursday after a long illness. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall became a circuit judge in Boone County in 1952 at age 33.  
He was appointed to a federal judge's post in Charleston in 1971 by 
President Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
	Five years later, Hall was named to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court  
of Appeals in Richmond, Va. The district comprises West Virginia, 
Virginia, Maryland, North Carolina and South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, Hall wrote the majority decision that rejected efforts  
by The Citadel, a Charleston, S.C., military college, to ban women. 
</P>
<P>
	During his years in West Virginia, Hall outlawed the state's  
existing abortion law and presided over a violent school textbook 
controversy. He also presided over a class-action lawsuit against 
Pittston Coal Co. concerning the 1973 Buffalo Creek dam break, 
which resulted in a 125 deaths. The lawsuit ended with a $13.5 
million settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall took senior status on the appeals court when he turned 80,  
hearing a limited number of cases.

	SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Sola Sierra, a prominent human rights  
activist during the military dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, 
died July 1 of a heart attack while recovering from back surgery. 
She was 63. 
</P>
<P>
	An active member of the Chilean Communist Party, Sierra joined  
the opposition to Pinochet after her husband, Jorge Pizarro, 
disappeared after being taken away by Pinochet's security agents. 
</P>
<P>
	She organized an association for the relatives of hundreds of  
Chileans who vanished during Pinochet's 1973-90 dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
	With her husband's black-and-white photograph pinned to her  
chest, Sierra was a familiar figure at protests. 
</P>
<P>
	Prominent visitors to Chile, including European politicians and  
rock stars, often made a point of meeting her. Among them were the 
Irish rock group U2 and British singer Sting, who wrote a song 
about her group called ``They Dance Alone.''

	BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) -- Shafik Wazzan, who as prime minister  
oversaw the 1982 withdrawal of Palestinian guerrillas from 
Israeli-beseiged Beirut, died Thursday of a heart attack. He was 
74. 
</P>
<P>
	Wazzan was thrust into the nation's second-most powerful office  
as a compromise prime minister on Oct. 25, 1980, after Lebanon had 
been without a government for 137 days at the height of the 1975-90 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
	When Israel invaded Lebanon in June 1982 and besieged Beirut to  
force out Palestine Liberation Organization guerrillas, Wazzan's 
government acted as intermediary between the United States and the 
PLO. 
</P>
<P>
	Wazzan's government negotiated an Israeli withdrawal from  
Lebanon in 1983, but the deal was never implemented and Israeli 
troops remained in a border zone in southern Lebanon. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal earned Wazzan wrath within his Muslim community. He was  
boycotted by Muslim leaders and forced from office in 1984.

<HEADLINE> Alleged Racist Killer Kept Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOKIE, Ill. (AP) -- A journal filled with white supremacist  
views and apparently written by racial killings suspect Benjamin 
Smith was found inside his car, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who knows the history of this plague upon humanity who  
calls themselves the Jews will know why I have acted,'' reads the 
opening passage in at least three or four pages of writings, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Skokie Police Sgt. Michael Ruth said investigators have not  
determined if the journal was written during last weekend's 
shooting spree. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith allegedly killed two people and wounded nine others -- all  
either Jews, blacks or Asians -- in Illinois and Indiana, before his 
suicide near Salem on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth would not release the journal to the media or discuss the  
writings in detail, but said there is nothing in them that 
specifically refers to any of Smith's victims. He said the words 
that follow are ``very caustic and venomous anti-Semitic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The writings are in a school notebook.  
</P>
<P>
	The notebook was found inside the blue Ford Taurus the  
21-year-old Smith was driving until he carjacked a minivan at a 
truck stop in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth said the handwriting appears similar to handwriting on  
other papers that police know are Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	Also found in the car was a bullet proof vest and military-type  
bullet proof helmet. A substantial amount of cash was found, but 
Ruth said he did not know how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also have recovered a $6,100 receipt dated June 15,  
showing Smith spending the money to print literature for the World 
Church of the Creator, an East Peoria-based white supremacist 
organization to which he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one of six Chicago residents wounded in the weekend  
shooting spree -- Ephraim Wolfe, a 15-year-old Orthodox Jew shot in 
the leg -- has filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the 
Creator; the group's leader, Matthew Hale; Smith's parents; and 
Donald Fiessinger, who has been charged with selling guns to Smith 
without a license.

	SEATTLE (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore urged Americans on Friday  
to reject ballot initiatives that chip away at affirmative action 
and to examine the attitudes that make such efforts popular. He 
said he would ``fight for fundamental fairness'' as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking to a convention of minority journalists, the vice  
president decried I-200, a Washington state initiative that wiped 
out affirmative action programs in public education, employment and 
contracting. Voters approved it in November. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some will try to convince you that we need to go back to the  
broken policies of the past,'' Gore said. ``I never, ever want to 
go back and I never want to see this country go back. I will lead 
the fight for fundamental fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore, who is hoping to succeed President Clinton, originally  
focused on the ``digital divide'' that locks many minorities out of 
the high-tech economy. But he wound up elaborating on affirmative 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	Without offering specifics, Gore said he believes ``we have to  
continue the use of tools that accelerate the removal of these 
barriers that come from the kind of tragic history that slavery 
represented, and that the injustices against other groups have 
represented.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Americans sometimes look at indicators such as increased  
high school graduation rates and conclude minorities have 
surmounted the discrimination that led to affirmative action in the 
first place. He said family wealth better indicates how far behind 
minorities lag. 
</P>
<P>
	``The average wealth of African-American families and Hispanic  
families is less than one-tenth the average wealth for majority 
families. For Native American families, it would be much worse 
still,'' Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	``If a young African-American or Latino child graduates from  
college, wants to become an entrepreneur in this new innovation 
economy and has a great idea, how do you raise the capital? In a 
majority family, I'll tell you what the first move is: Pick up the 
telephone and call a member of the family and start working that 
network to find some capital that can be invested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore then told of a Hungarian village that sounds a trumpet to  
commemorate a 600-year-old tragedy. Yet, he said, some Americans 
wrongfully feel the country is ``colorblind'' so soon after the 
1954 Supreme Court ruling that struck down segregation in public 
schools and removed other racial barriers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I pledge to you I will do all I can to close the opportunity  
gaps,'' Gore said. ``We don't need more scapegoats or more phony 
ballot propositions like I-200. We need to all examine the kinds of 
attitudes that crop up in response to national problems and 
national debates.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was responding to Derrick Jackson of the National  
Association of Black Journalists. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of ... calling I-200 phony, which is easy to do, would  
you do something that Clinton did not do, which is fight for 
affirmative action in the white communities and the white 
boardrooms of America?'' Jackson asked. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore defended Clinton, saying the president took an active role  
in trying to preserve affirmative action programs in California's 
colleges and universities. ``My recollection is he did speak out,'' 
Gore said. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president also sought to modify his statement that all  
Americans ``are immigrants to this land, it just depends on how 
many generations back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson reminded Gore that as descendants of slaves, blacks  
``were not willing immigrants coming through Ellis Island.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Well, I hope I didn't imply that I thought otherwise,'' Gore  
replied. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore was the fourth presidential candidate to appear at Unity  
'99, an umbrella gathering of groups representing African-American, 
Asian-American, Hispanic and American Indian journalists. About 
6,000 people are attending the convention, which ends Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore's Democratic opponent, Bill Bradley, addressed the  
gathering on Thursday. Republican candidate George W. Bush 
initially declined an invitation to speak, but showed up Thursday 
to work the crowds. Republican candidate John McCain spoke to the 
group Thursday.

<HEADLINE> DNA Probed in Boston Strangler Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Police are looking for DNA evidence to determine  
once and for all whether Albert DeSalvo really was the Boston 
Strangler, the sadist who killed 13 women in a string of attacks 
that terrorized the city in the early 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
	DeSalvo admitted to the murders, which took place between 1962  
and 1964, but police lacked the evidence to bring the factory 
worker to trial. Instead, he was tried in series of unrelated 
assaults, convicted and sentenced to life in prison. He was stabbed 
to death in his cell in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
	The DNA probe began last summer, when scientists in the police  
department's Cold Case Squad began looking at 14 boxes of evidence 
from two of the strangler's victims, said Kevin Jones, a police 
spokesman. Those tests were inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
	Capt. Timothy Murray told The Boston Globe: ``The Strangler case  
is one of the most notorious in the country. If we can solve this, 
it might spark other cities to use DNA to solve old crimes. There's 
no statute of limitations on murder.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the lead investigators, as well as the chief pathologist  
who performed the victim autopsies, are dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Several other obstacles stand in investigators' way. Police know  
evidence exists -- case logs describe sperm samples swabbed from 
some of the victims -- but have been unable to locate the items. And 
they think the knife used to kill DeSalvo was preserved, but they 
haven't been able to find it either. 
</P>
<P>
	The knife could provide a clean DNA sample, so investigators  
wouldn't have to exhume DeSalvo's body. But police said they are 
willing to dig up the body if they find DNA samples that need to be 
matched. 
</P>
<P>
	No physical evidence tied DeSalvo to the crimes. A 1995 book by  
Susan Kelly claimed that DeSalvo could have learned all the details 
about the killings -- information with which he impressed 
investigators -- by reading the newspapers. Kelly also said DeSalvo 
could have learned the information from the real killer in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney F. Lee Bailey, who defended DeSalvo, said he believes  
his client committed the murders, and was insane at the time. DNA 
tests should confirm DeSalvo's guilt, he said in a telephone 
interview from Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	If they don't, ``you've got a real news story, because every cop  
and the attorney general bought into his story,'' Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Casey Sherman, a Rockland man whose aunt, Mary Sullivan, was  
killed by the Strangler in 1964 when she was 19, said: ``Our family 
believes Albert DeSalvo was not the Boston Strangler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I've spoken with the DeSalvo family themselves, and what they  
say is Albert told them he wasn't the Strangler,'' Sherman said, 
adding he believes there were several killers. 
</P>
<P>
	Some psychiatrists have noted that serial killers typically  
choose victims with similar characteristics, but the Boston victims 
ranged from Sherman's 19-year-old aunt to several elderly women. 
</P>
<P>
	The Strangler often tied bows around the necks of his victims,  
as if they were wrapped presents.

<HEADLINE> Children's Hero Still Entrances </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- The latest magical adventure of Harry Potter -- a  
bestseller before it even hit the bookstores -- reached the hot 
little hands of hordes of waiting youngsters in Britain on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Don't tell anyone, but some grown-ups were waiting too.  
</P>
<P>
	And American readers can catch the third book in this red-hot  
series by ordering it via the Internet -- two months before it goes 
on sale in U.S. bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the release of ``Harry Potter And The Prisoner Of  
Azkaban'' in Britain, the bespectacled young hero's latest 
adventures had already captured the No. 1 spot on Amazon.co.uk's 
Internet bestseller list. 
</P>
<P>
	Harry, an orphan who hones his magical skills at Hogwarts School  
for Witchcraft and Wizardry, is also a huge hit in the United 
States, where the first two books in author J.K. Rowling's series 
hold the No. 3 and No. 6 spots on the New York Times bestseller 
list this week. 
</P>
<P>
	But 10-year-old Charlie Parkyn, waiting at Waterstone's  
bookstore in Kensington to pick up his new Harry Potter 
installment, wasn't interested in publishers or their fancy lists. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting, how he has all these adventures,'' Charlie said  
Thursday, trying to explain why he loved the first two stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to be like him,'' he said before he hurried away  
clasping his book -- a 10th birthday present. 
</P>
<P>
	Scholastic Inc., the U.S. publisher, is due to bring the book  
out on Sept. 8. But Harry Potter fans who can't wait that long can 
order a British version with a zap of the computer mouse. 
</P>
<P>
	To cope with the demand and placate U.S. booksellers, Scholastic  
has repeatedly moved up publication dates for the Harry Potter 
series. 
</P>
<P>
	While there was a full year's lag between the British and  
American versions of the first book, that was narrowed to seven 
months for the second book and two months for the third. Scholastic 
spokeswoman Kris Moran said Thursday that ``in response to customer 
demand'' the fourth book in the series will be published 
simultaneously with its British edition. 
</P>
<P>
	So far, Scholastic has sold 1.7 million Harry Potter books in  
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In Britain, publisher Bloomsbury said advance sales of the  
latest Potter adventure numbered more than 200,000. ``Many of the 
bookshops have massive lists full of pre-orders from customers,'' 
spokeswoman Rosamund de la Hey said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eleni Xanthis, still in her red-and-white gingham school  
uniform, was at Waterstone's on Thursday with her mother, who had 
double-parked to run in and buy a copy of the latest Harry Potter 
book. 
</P>
<P>
	``I like Harry because he's kind, and he's nice and he's  
brave,'' said Eleni, who is 10. ``And the way they were written, 
it's like it was happening in real life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harry has wormed his way into the hearts of quite a few parents  
as well, prompting a special piece of marketing whimsy from 
Bloomsbury. 
</P>
<P>
	The publishing house brought out an ``adult'' version of Harry  
Potter's first adventure in paperback with a sober cover that 
wouldn't embarrass grown-up readers. 
</P>
<P>
	Jehanne Wake, with her 8-year-old son David in tow, said the  
Potter books were the first he has wanted to read. 
</P>
<P>
	``I read the first one to David and we got so excited we kept  
right on reading,'' she said. ``He read it again himself, and now 
he's desperate for the next one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	When Harry Potter burst upon the publishing scene in 1997, the  
first thing he did was rescue his creator. 
</P>
<P>
	Joanne Rowling, now 33, was an unemployed single parent when she  
wrote the first Harry book. She did her writing in a cafe in 
Edinburgh, Scotland, because it was warmer than her home in winter. 
</P>
<P>
	An immediate hit, ``Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone,''  
--published in the United States as ``Harry Potter and the 
Sorcerer's Stone''-- was Britain's 1997 Children's Book of the Year 
and won a Smarties Book Prize, which is judged by children. And the 
second volume, ``Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets,'' also 
won a Smarties prize. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. has bought the film rights of the first two books  
in a deal reportedly worth more than $1 million, so Harry is 
destined to be a star. 
</P>
<P>
	Rowling plans to write a total of seven books about her hero,  
ending when he leaves school at 17 -- that is, of course, if her 
fans let her stop there.

<HEADLINE> Marlins Trade Closer to D-Backs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- The Arizona Diamondbacks, in desperate need of a  
closer, got Matt Mantei from the Florida Marlins on Friday night 
for reliever Vladimir Nunez, top pitching prospect Brad Penny and a 
player to be named. 
</P>
<P>
	Although manager Buck Showalter downplayed the impact of the  
trade, Mantei provides an immediate upgrade to a struggling 
bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Diamondbacks, challenging for the NL West title in only  
their second season, were 1 1/2 games behind San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	But Arizona relievers had blown 14 of 29 save chances, prompting  
the team to explore trades for either Mantei or Montreal's Ugueth 
Urbina. And the club did not want to wait until the July 31 trading 
deadline to make a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Diamondbacks owner Jerry Colangelo said the deal was worthwhile  
despite the cost. 
</P>
<P>
	``He can throw up to 100 mph,'' Colangelo said. ``That's pretty  
good for starters. He's a legitimate closer, and he has something 
we don't have, so I think it's going to be a big addition to this 
team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei turned 26 on Wednesday, and general manager Joe Garagiola  
Jr. said youth was a prerequisite in considering available closers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's very much part of the long term for us, but at the same  
time he brings top-level closer stuff to our situation 
immediately,'' Garagiola said. ``And with 80 games to go in the 
season, we think that a very important piece has been put in 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arizona's most recent blown save was Thursday night, Houston  
scored one run in each of the ninth, 10th and 11th innings before 
Arizona won 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was pushing for this long before last night's game,''  
Colangelo said. ``Last night's game just created a late night or 
early morning for all of us. This thing was well in progress, and 
fortunately we just kept it moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei was to join the Diamondbacks in time for Saturday's game  
against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just spoke to Buck, and he said I can help them very much in  
the pennant race and that's very exiting,'' Mantei said in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	Mantei was 1-2 with 10 saves and a 2.72 ERA. The hard-throwing  
right-hander had struck out 50 in just 36 1-3 innings, allowing 
opposing hitters a composite .186 batting average. 
</P>
<P>
	The trade was made on Matt Mantei pin night at Pro Player  
Stadium. The Marlins, last in the NL East, announced the deal 
before playing Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm excited in a way, it can't do anything but make me  
happy,'' Mantei said, ``but it's still sad to leave this 
organization, they've been great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nunez, a 24-year-old right-hander, was 3-2 with one save and a  
2.91 ERA. He was one strike away from closing out a win Thursday 
night when he gave up a tying double to Houston's Derek Bell in the 
ninth. He was one of the first free agents the Diamondbacks signed 
after he defected from Cuba in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a hard decision for us,'' Marlins general manager Dave  
Dombrowski said. ``Matt has done a good job. We've watched his 
growth as a player and a person but it has been hard for us to get 
to the closer. We believe we've received a quality guy in Nunez.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dombrowski said the minor league player to be named was also a  
good prospect, but did not identify him. The Marlins have until 
Oct. 15 to make the choice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Colangelo said it would not be left-hander Nick Bierbrod or  
right-hander John Patterson, a pair often grouped with Penny in 
discussions about Arizona's rotation of the future. 
</P>
<P>
	Five different pitchers have combined to get Arizona's 15 saves.  
Gregg Olson leads with 11, but has been shaky for most of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Showalter declined to discuss Olson's future, but left no doubt  
about who would get the nod down the stretch from now on. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was somebody that a lot of clubs were trying to acquire,  
and we were lucky enough to put something together,'' Showalter 
said. ``It's a real tribute to our minor league system to develop 
two players like Vlade and Brad to the point that we were able to 
make this deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Penny, a 21-year-old right-hander, was 2-7 with a 4.70 ERA as a  
starter at Double-A El Paso. Nunez was the Diamondbacks' 
organizational pitcher of the year in 1996, and Penny won the same 
award in 1997 and 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	``The hardest position to find is a quality starting pitcher and  
Brad Penny is one of those quality young prospects,'' Dombrowski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins (11) and Kansas City (13) were the only teams in the  
majors with fewer saves than the Diamondbacks entering Friday 
night's game.

<HEADLINE> Nevada Flood Control Saved Lives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS VEGAS (AP) -- A flood control program that won't be finished  
for another 25 years prevented widespread disaster from storms that 
in two hours dumped nearly as much rain as the city sees all year, 
flood experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.4 billion project is only 20 percent complete, but if  
Thursday's storm had happened a few years ago, ``it would have been 
a disaster to end all disasters,'' Las Vegas Mayor Oscar Goodman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two deaths were blamed on the flash floods that sucked up cars,  
destroyed three mobile homes and damaged a casino, businesses and 
homes throughout the Las Vegas area. Three inches of rain fell in 
an area that sees an average 4.1 inches a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Police and firefighters rescued 163 people from raging waters.  
Eight of those rescues had to be done by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't begin to estimate what would have happened if these  
flood controls were not in place,'' said Gale Fraser, general 
manager of the Clark County Regional Flood Control District. ``I 
know it would have been a lot worse. Prior to our being here, there 
was no place for that water to go.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The system consists of 30 massive flood detention basins ranging  
in size from 10 acres to 80 acres. Fraser said one of the basins 
collected water equal to an amount that would cover a football 
field 400 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
	``That water would have run rampant through the valley,'' Fraser  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The basins collect water pouring off mountains surrounding the  
city, then release it slowly along channels and into Lake Mead. 
</P>
<P>
	The flood control project was initiated after devastating floods  
in 1975 and 1984. About $400 million has been spent so far, while 
another $1 billion worth of work is planned. 
</P>
<P>
	Summer floods are not unusual here, where normal annual rainfall  
is 4 inches and a downpour of an inch or more can swamp streets and 
fill usually dry washes that crisscross the valley. Thursday's 
flood damaged a part of Caesars Palace, forcing operators to close 
part of its casino until midday Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Miracle Mile trailer park on Boulder Highway, residents  
began digging out of the mounds of mud and gravel left behind by 
the flooding. One home was mangled beyond repair, but most of the 
damage was limited to the aluminum skirting that surrounds the 
bottom of trailers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I lost everything on the outside of my trailer,'' said Tom  
Lowe, gesturing at the broken planter and mangled vacuum cleaner 
lying half buried in mud outside his home. 
</P>
<P>
	``One shovel full at a time, just one shovel full at a time,''  
he said, launching another scoop of mud out of his driveway and 
into the street.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler, Volvo Said Talking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo AB and DaimlerChrysler AG are  
considering a merger and are negotiating the price, the Swedish 
business daily Dagens Industri reported Friday. The companies 
declined comment on the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Dagens Industri, citing sources it did not identify by name,  
said Volvo's board rejected an unofficial bid from the German-U.S. 
automaker of about $17 billion for the Swedish company's truck, 
bus, heavy equipment, marine, aviation and other divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. bought Volvo's passenger car division last  
January for $5.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the newspaper, a main obstacle is the price. The  
unofficial bid amounted to 330 kronor ($38.70) per share. Volvo is 
holding out for 400 kronor a share -- a hefty premium over its 
recent valuation. Volvo shares rose six kronor to 246 kronor a 
share in trading Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Volvo's reported asking price amounts to $20.8 billion.  
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman at DaimlerChrysler in Frankfurt, Germany, said the  
company ``won't comment on any market speculation'' and that 
includes Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
	In Sweden, Volvo spokesman Stefan Lorentzon was similarly  
noncommittal. ``It's our policy not to comment on speculation and 
we will stick to that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said DaimlerChrysler approached Volvo last week  
with a bid indication but reportedly won't make an official bid 
unless it has the support of Volvo's board. 
</P>
<P>
	Two weeks ago, after another Dagens Industry report,  
DaimlerChrysler responded, ``We strongly deny the report. We are 
not in talks and don't plan a merger with Volvo.''

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Down on Outlook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
        CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures continued their retreat  
Friday on the Chicago Board of Trade, tumbling to new lows amid a looming 
farm crisis caused by too many supplies and too few buyers. 
</P>
<P>
        Midwest farmers, faced with few alternatives this spring despite  
the potential for sharply lower prices, planted large tracts of corn 
and soybeans. Near-ideal growing weather so far has virtually assured 
bumper fall production, which will add to already ample stockpiles, 
agronomists said. 
</P>
<P>
        While demand from Asia and other key importing countries is  
on the rise following a year of relatively low U.S. purchases, it is 
not expected to improve enough to correct the imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
        The government is predicting farmers will harvest 9.45 billion  
bushels of corn this year, but market participants now suspect the 
figure will rise close to or above 10 billion bushels. Farmers are 
expected to harvest a record 2.88 billion bushels of soybeans, and 
that figure also is expected to go higher unless crops are affected 
by an early frost. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat futures were pressured by active harvesting of what is  
expected to be a large winter wheat crop. 
</P>
<P>
        Wheat for December delivery fell 2 1/4 cents to $2.60 a bushel;  
December corn fell 3 cents to $1.96 1/2 a bushel; December oats fell 
1/4 cents to $1.08 3/4 a bushel; November soybeans fell 3 3/4 cents 
to $4.11 1/2 a bushel. Beef futures advanced on the Chicago Mercantile 
Exchange, while most pork futures contracts finished sharply lower. 
</P>
<P>
        August live cattle rose .70 cent to 62.82 cents a pound; August  
feeder cattle rose .67 cent to 77.12 cents a pound; August lean hogs 
rose .05 cent to 46.12, while other contract months retreated; August 
pork bellies fell 2.67 cents to 33.80 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Continental Flight Hits Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Bermuda (AP) -- The weather seemed to be clear, with  
few clouds in the sky, when Continental Airlines Flight 743 hit a 
pocket of turbulence -- and plunged 500 feet. 
</P>
<P>
	A food cart hit the ceiling. Passengers began praying. Children  
screamed in terror. 
</P>
<P>
	``In one minute, I saw people flying: It was like an S-shape in  
the air, up and down. I saw one man flip right over the seat,'' 
passenger Diana Munoz, of Newark, N.J., said when the plane landed, 
safely, to give passengers medical attention in Bermuda on Thursday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a lot of blood ... a lot of neck injuries,'' said  
Miguel Vargas, also from Newark. 
</P>
<P>
	Police in Bermuda said 16 of the 159 people aboard the flight  
from Newark to Puerto Rico were hospitalized with serious injuries, 
most to the head and neck. Another 45 passengers suffered minor 
injuries, according to police spokeswoman Evelyn James Barnett. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most of the injured are complaining of minor injuries,  
although four people are in beds,'' said nursing supervisor Doreen 
Richardson at King Edward VII Hospital in Hamilton, the capital of 
the British territory of Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement from Continental Airlines headquarters in Houston,  
said the Boeing 737-800 flying encountered turbulence when it was 
about 29,000 feet high and 180 miles south of Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was flying through fairly clear skies with just a few  
clouds when it suddenly dropped 500 feet, then quickly recovered 
its height, spokeswoman Karla Villalon said. 
</P>
<P>
	The sudden drop terrified passengers.  
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people were crying and praying,'' said an arriving  
passenger who would not give his name. He said he saw one child 
with an arm in a sling. ``People were screaming and there were 
babies crying. It was like the plane just jumped up, and I hurt my 
arm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda police said none of the few children on board were hurt.  
</P>
<P>
	The plane was carrying 153 passengers and a crew of four flight  
attendants and two pilots, Villalon said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bermuda police said two of the flight attendants were in neck  
braces when they were put into an ambulance at the airport, but 
Villalon said that was normal practice. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane left Newark at 12:20 p.m. and landed in Hamilton about  
4 p.m., Barnett said. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane suffered only a superficial crack in an overhead area  
in the rear, she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Villalon said another plane would be flown into Bermuda to fly  
unhurt passengers to Puerto Rico on Friday afternoon. They spent 
the night at local hotels.

<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Duke Energy will build and operate a $1.3  
billion natural gas pipeline to markets in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sawgrass Energy Transmission System will have a capacity of  
about 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and will begin 
near Coden, Ala., cross southern Mobile Bay and continue into the 
Florida Panhandle and down the peninsula, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke plans to have it in service by 2003. Customers will include  
electric generation facilities, as well as large industrial and gas 
distribution customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's projected need for new generating plants over the next  
10 years has risen 20 percent over 1997 estimates, Duke said, 
making it the fastest-growing market in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Energy is headquartered in Charlotte and has more than $26  
billion in assets worldwide. It provides electric service to some 2 
million customers in North and South Carolina and operates other

<HEADLINE> Patients' Rights Pressed by Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- With political maneuvering over a  
``patients' bill of rights'' intensifying on the airwaves and in 
the Senate, President Clinton pressed lawmakers to set rules for 
health maintenance organizations even if that would increase costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The president said it was time for the government to ensure that  
HMO accountants don't short-change patients on care in order to 
fatten their bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one who believes in proper management believes you should  
sacrifice proper care,'' Clinton told a sympathetic group of 
medical professionals and educators at the University of 
California, Los Angeles, Medical Center facility in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate was prepared to begin debate on the legislation when  
they return from recess on Monday, but Clinton criticized the GOP 
leadership for refusing to take up the bill for more than a year. 
He said they had good reason for not acting. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're not for it, but they know they can't afford to be  
caught being against it,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that all patients should have a right to emergency  
room care and should never be forced to change providers in the 
middle of treatment. He said he had been moved by his meetings with 
nurses who were forced by HMOs to deny care. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are not just isolated anecdotes,'' he said. ``This is a  
systematic problem in American health care.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president's own proposal to increase patients' rights died  
on Capitol Hill last year, and he has dismissed an alternative 
offered by Republicans as being too limited in scope and in terms 
of the people it would cover. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that changes he instituted in health care plans for  
federal workers raised premiums by less than $1 month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Isn't it worth it to allow the system to work to keep the  
benefits of managed care without having to shoulder ... these 
heartbreaking burdens?'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The political strategizing over the measure intensified this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Business and insurance groups launched a $750,000 ad campaign  
aimed at undecided GOP senators, while Republican leaders 
positioned themselves to limit debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton found the maneuvering surreal: ``I thought to myself,  
`What kind of a weird world am I living in?''' he said. ``This is 
about whether some people live and some people die.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same groups that helped defeat Clinton's plan for  
universal health care are now trying to beat back the patients' 
rights bill with a TV ad blitz arguing that it would raise the cost 
of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the debate has been over the limited choices patients  
have for care. But the counter-argument could gain some traction as 
the number of uninsured Americans continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite prosperous economic times, there were 43.4 million  
uninsured Americans in 1997. That was up 4 million since Clinton 
proposed his universal health insurance plan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants legislation that would ensure patients have access  
to health care specialists and emergency room services, and protect 
them from being forced to switch doctors in the midst of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial -- and most expensive -- provision that  
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health 
plans and collect damages when treatment is withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said the Democratic measure is too expensive  
and could lead employers to drop coverage. Senate Republicans have 
their own legislation on health maintenance organizations that 
would cost less but would cover fewer Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Senate Republicans said they would use a  
Democratic-written bill as the vehicle for opening the debate, thus 
limiting the number of politically sensitive amendments Democrats 
might offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But under an agreement reached last week, the GOP gets to offer  
the final amendment after four days of debate. They are expected to 
use that penultimate vote to substitute their own bill for the 
entire Democratic measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats decried the move, but Republicans made no apologies.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter where you start out. It matters where you  
end up, which is Republicans will pass a Republican bill,'' said 
Eric Ueland, a top aide to Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who is 
leading the GOP on the issue.

<HEADLINE> SureTrade Customers Suffer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Suretrade Inc. has had trouble living up to its  
name this week. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer problems have plagued the company's Web site since  
Monday, forcing many customers to trade stocks the old fashioned 
way -- by calling a broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Suretrade, a division of Quick &AMP; Reilly/Fleet Securities Inc.,  
upgraded its computer system over the weekend to expand capacity, 
but software glitches have shut out many online investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never been able to get on the last three days,'' said  
Jeff Kozera, a Suretrade customer in Boston. ``I just talked to a 
trader, and he said it's been up temporarily today, but it keeps on 
crashing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Suretrade typically processes almost 98 percent of its 13,000  
daily trades over the Internet. Customers pay $7.95 for an online 
trade, $11.95 for a trade placed via an automated phone system, and 
$32.95 for an order with a broker. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokesman Charles G. Salmans said Suretrade would post a  
notice on the site Thursday evening offering to waive the extra 
fees for phone or broker trades if the customer couldn't execute 
the order online. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some irony,'' Salmans said. ``You do some changes  
designed to enhance capacity, and ... software problems cause 
bottlenecks.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Companies like Suretrade are expanding their computer systems  
because more than 7 million Americans are trading online, and more 
than one-third of individual trades are made online. And the 
numbers are rising daily. 
</P>
<P>
	Suretrade is one of the nation's smaller online brokers;  
industry leader Charles Schwab conducts 137,000 trades a day. 
</P>
<P>
	While other brokers like E-Trade and Ameritrade have had their  
share of technical difficulties, they are usually fixed within 
hours, not days. 
</P>
<P>
	Suretrade said its Web site was never completely shut down, but  
just operating very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
	That distinction, however, was lost on customers like Norman  
Nithman in Chicago, who hasn't been able to access the site all 
week. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't even get in to trade, it blows up my browser,'' he  
explained. 
</P>
<P>
	Suretrade said it hoped the Web site would be operating smoothly  
by Friday. ``We're working on this 24 hours a day,'' Salmans said.

<HEADLINE> Tribes Seeks Protection for Symbols </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- To the Zia Indians of New Mexico, the  
sun is a sacred symbol. Their stylized version is painted on 
ceremonial vases, drawn on the ground around campfires and used to 
introduce newborns to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	But the symbol -- a red circle with groups of rays pointing in  
four directions -- also adorns the state flag, the governor's 
stationery and the yellow pages, peddling items from pest control 
to portable toilets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zias and other tribes are looking to the U.S. Patent and  
Trademark Office to stop commercial exploitation of their sacred 
symbols. 
</P>
<P>
	An 8-year-old Zia girl, her father and grandfather at her side,  
was among 150 tribe members and others who testified Thursday to a 
panel of patent office officials about the misuse of such symbols. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm one of the 146 tribal members under 12 years old,'' said  
Sabrina Pino, who just finished the third grade. ``We represent the 
future of the pueblo and we hope you will protect it from being 
trademarked from anyone in the private sector.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by a law passed last year, the patent office is asking  
Indians to suggest how to establish a list of official insignia 
that would be protected from trademark, as are flags, coats of arms 
and other official symbols. It would offer tribes no protection 
from outside use. 
</P>
<P>
	Similar meetings are scheduled next week in Arlington, Va., and  
San Francisco, where five California tribes will seek protection of 
symbols of their heritage, such as pictographs, basket designs, 
dance regalia and tribal songs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We all have a common thread about preserving our cultural  
heritage,'' said Reba Fuller of Tuolumne Band of the Me-Wuk tribe 
in California. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've talked to various groups all over the country to let them  
know about this law and that we need Native American input as it 
will have a direct impact on the Native American community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Zia Pueblo, which is seeking $74 million in compensation  
from the state, Fuller's tribes are not seeking monetary 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The Zias are asking for $1 million for every year the symbol was  
used as the flag's emblem. The tribe doesn't expect it will 
actually receive that amount, but it would like the state to 
acknowledge the emblem belongs to the Pueblo, said Peter Pino, the 
tribe's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Tribes are not asking that businesses rid their products of  
Indian references, such as product names: Jeep Cherokee or 
Winnebago. What they want is for the government to prohibit 
businesses from trademarking symbols, just as they do with 
insignias of municipalities, states and foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tribes should be able to protect their symbols in the same way  
as states, cities and counties do,'' University of New Mexico law 
professor Kenneth Bobroff said. ``And especially so. Because unlike 
non-Indian symbols, these are religious.''

<HEADLINE>  Theo Fleury Signs With Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Theo Fleury has always lived and played out  
West. Now, he'll take his considerable hockey skills to the Big 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move they hope will help fill the void created by the  
retirement of Wayne Gretzky, the New York Rangers announced on 
Thursday the signing of Fleury, a 31-year-old, six-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really spent any quality time out East,'' said  
Fleury, a 5-foot-6 right wing who is the Calgary Flames' career 
scoring leader. ``The West is all I know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a western Canadian kid and I feel at home there. But it  
didn't take a lot of convincing. In the end, the Rangers showed the 
most interest and, as a player, that's what you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury said he talked with Gretzky about playing for the  
Rangers, who have missed the playoffs the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pointed out the good things about New York and talked about  
his experiences of playing in New York,'' said Fleury, who played 
all or part of 11 NHL seasons with the Flames before being traded 
to the Colorado Avalanche in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is reportedly for three years and $24 million, with  
the Rangers holding an option for a fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of three years it will give me a good idea if I can  
keep playing,'' Fleury said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there was a no-trade clause in the contract  
``because I'm a guy, who likes to know where I'm going to be from 
year to year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The no-trade clause is reportedly for the first two years of the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche did not want to give Fleury a no-trade deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no bitter feelings against Colorado at all,'' he said.  
``I was excited to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury had five goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games for the  
Avalanche, who were beaten by Dallas in seven games of the Western 
Conference finals. He had 40 goals and 53 assists in 75 games 
during the regular season. He has 374 goals and 480 assists in his 
regular-season career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also signed 33-year-old Valeri Kamensky, a left wing  
from the Avalanche, and 30-year-old Stephane Quintal, a defenseman, 
who played for the Montreal Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Cipollini Wins 5th Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMIENS, France (AP) -- Heading north from the Loire Valley to  
Amiens in the Picardy region, the riders of the Tour de France 
passed tantalizingly close to Paris. 
</P>
<P>
	Mario Cipollini, Tom Steels, Jaan Kirsipuu and the other  
sprinters in Thursday's fifth stage may have been tempted to take a 
short cut directly to the Champs-Elysees, where the finale of the 
grand cycling race is always held. 
</P>
<P>
	But the finale isn't for more than two weeks. Before then, there  
will be grueling mountain stages in the Alps and Pyrenees. That's 
when the sprinters will stop shining -- and maybe even drop out 
altogether -- and the climbers will have their moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The first week of the Tour de France, with its flat stages,  
always favors sprinters. This year, every one of the first five 
stages has ended in a mass sprint to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu, from Estonia, won the first stage and has maintained  
the leader's yellow jersey since Monday. Steels, a Belgian, won 
stages two and three, and now Cipollini, the Italian also known as 
``King of the Sprints'' and the ``Lion King,'' has won two 
straight. 
</P>
<P>
	As befits his regal nicknames, Cipollini clearly is inspired by  
grandeur. With the race passing a royal palace one day and three 
stunning cathedrals the next, the Italian has come alive. 
</P>
<P>
	All this when observers had started to grumble about his  
sluggish performance, and Cipollini had joked about soon being 
unemployed because his team, Saeco, was unhappy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Discussions have resumed about my future,'' he said Thursday  
after edging Steels to win the fifth stage. 
</P>
<P>
	Kirsipuu was third, Robbie McEwen of Australia fourth and German  
Erik Zabel fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	The stage was one of the longest of the Tour, a 145-mile ride  
through rolling wheat fields and occasional bursts of sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
	It approached three grand cathedrals: the Gothic masterpiece at  
Chartres, with its famed stained-glass windows; a graceful one at 
Beauvais, and France's biggest at Amiens, where the stage ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Riding north to the Somme region, where the famous World War I  
battle was fought, Paris was only some 30 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike Wednesday, when a favorable tailwind led to a record  
speed for the stage, the riders faced a headwind Thursday and the 
average speed was almost 6 mph slower, or 25.85 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	In the overall standings, Steels moved up to second and  
Australian Stuart O'Grady was in third. American Lance Armstrong, 
on the comeback from testicular cancer, was in fourth, and 
Cipollini was in fifth. 
</P>
<P>
	Again the stage was marked by an early breakaway, this time at  
the four-kilometer mark. A group of 10 riders made the break and 
gained as much as a 6-minute, 15-second lead, but that soon was 
whittled down by the advancing pack. 
</P>
<P>
	Sweden's Magnus Backstedt broke out for a brief lead near the  
end. But he was soon overtaken and the race was set for another 
furious, wide-open sprint. Cipollini's Saeco teammates again moved 
him into position, and the Italian sprinted to victory. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the talk at the Tour has been mostly about cycling, not  
drugs, which developed into such a monumental scandal last year 
that the Tour was almost scuttled. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Thursday, the sport's governing body had to deny a  
published report that a Tour cyclist tested positive for a banned 
drug after the race's prologue. 
</P>
<P>
	The French sports daily L'Equipe said one of four riders tested  
was found to have taken corticosteroids, anti-inflammatory drugs 
that are not classed as steroids but are banned except when used 
for legitimate medical needs. 
</P>
<P>
	That charge was denied by the International Cycling Union.  
</P>
<P>
	``There was not one positive case,'' UCI spokesman Enrico  
Carpani said.

<HEADLINE> US Not Ready for Nuclear Threat </HEADLINE>

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A government panel proposes yet another role  
for the vice president: stopping the threat of weapons of mass 
destruction. 
</P>
<P>
	Describing ``a chilling new reality'' for Americans, the  
commission set up by Congress to assess federal response to the 
threat of nuclear, chemical and biological attack concludes that 
the top levels of government are ``not effectively organized to 
combat proliferation.'' 
</P>

	In a report to be issued next week, it proposes a ``special  
role'' for the vice president in overseeing federal response to the 
danger and appointment of a ``national director to combat 
proliferation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The director would coordinate diplomatic steps to stop the  
spread of such weapons and direct a high-level, heavily funded 
program to prevent the targeting of Americans and respond 
adequately to any attack. 
</P>
<P>
	Carefully avoiding criticism of the current or any other  
administration, the panel headed by former CIA Director John Deutch 
recommends strong presidential and vice presidential leadership, a 
single budget for the effort and changes in several federal 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The Commission to Assess the Organization of the Federal  
Government to Combat the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass 
Destruction presents its 140-page report to Congress next 
Wednesday, but commission members discussed their findings in 
interviews Thursday after press reports on some of their 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think the threat is much more severe than commonly  
appreciated by the American people, and government is not 
well-organized to deal with it,'' Deutch said. 
</P>
<P>
	The most critical weakness is the lack of central direction in  
preparing federal agencies for such a major crisis, he said. ``We 
have to be prepared to deal with it, and we're not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., commission vice chairman, said the  
report proposes a strong role for the vice president in redirecting 
funding and authority to combat proliferation. Other panel members 
suggested, however, the effectiveness of that idea might depend on 
how much authority future presidents give to their second in 
command. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are discoordinated and unprepared -- somewhere between  
anarchy and bedlam,'' said Specter. ``I think the report is 
tremendously important and has to be acted upon before we have to 
react to terrible situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Daniel Poneman, former NSC proliferation expert, said the  
commission stressed the need to have a coordinated effort against 
proliferation -- an effort now divided among several federal 
agencies, each with separate budgets. 
</P>
<P>
	``We would like to see all the budget chunks put in one place,  
counted up and analyzed to see if they are optimally directed,'' 
Poneman said. The vice president would have the influence to do 
this by dealing directly with cabinet secretaries, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed national director would then coordinate efforts at  
diplomacy, export control and domestic preparedness with a new 
Combating Proliferation Council made up of deputy-level officials 
from various agencies. 
</P>
<P>
	A summary of the commission's conclusions calls for ``the most  
effective and efficient organization this country can muster.'' The 
law creating the commission, however, prevented it from assessing 
or recommending specific police and military response capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	Henry F. Cooper, former head of the Strategic Defense Initiative  
and a panel member, said he wished the commission could have gone 
further. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't separate prevention and response,'' he said.  
``There's a real deterrent value associated with our ability to 
deal with these situations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed national director would coordinate protection of  
Americans against any attack aimed at causing widespread 
disruption, destruction and death, as well as measures for dealing 
with the crisis should it occur at home or abroad. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposal got a cool response from one Pentagon official.  
Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre said the existing lines of 
authority are sufficiently clear and do not require the appointment 
of a special coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	Threats analyzed in the report include terrorist use of weapons  
of mass destruction, possession of such weapons by rogue states, 
diversion of weapons materials from Russia and China and the 
``destabilizing consequences of (nuclear and other) programs in the 
Middle East, South Asia and East Asia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report does not rank the dangers to Americans but stresses  
the possibility of new threats emerging without notice, Deutch 
said.

<HEADLINE> Cargill Acquisition Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department on Thursday approved  
the acquisition by Cargill Inc., North America's second-largest 
grain trader, of the Commodity Marketing Group of No. 5 Continental 
Grain Co., provided the companies sell several grain and soybean 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division said the original deal,  
estimated to be worth $300 million, would have illegally reduced 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who had asked the department  
to review the deal, estimated the two companies control 42 percent 
of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold overseas and at 
least 20 percent of wheat exports. The National Farmers Union and 
some senators also had questioned the impact of the original deal. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here to block the  
original deal, the department said it would have eliminated an 
important competitor for the purchase of crops from U.S. farmers 
and elevator operators. The two companies annually move millions of 
tons of grain and soybeans through nationwide distributions 
networks to customers here and abroad. A proposed agreement to 
settle the lawsuit was filed simultaneously for court approval. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the divestitures, many American farmers would have  
faced lower prices for major crops they produce, such as wheat, 
corn and soybeans,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice decision comes on the heels of approvals by  
regulatory agencies in Canada and the European Union and clears the 
way for completion of the deal, Cargill said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been a long, arduous process,'' said Frank Sims,  
president of Cargill's North American Grain Operations. ``We look 
forward to getting down to the business of melding our operations 
to reduce costs and improve service to our farm, feed, food 
manufacturing and overseas customers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minn., is the largest  
privately owned business in the United States. In 1998, it has 
total revenues of $35 billion, including grain revenues of $9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 80,600 employees, Cargill sells, processes and  
distributes agricultural, financial and industrial products in 65 
countries and has business activities in 130 additional countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental, based in New York, had grain revenues of $5.5  
billion in 1998 and total revenue of $16 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said the ability of farmers and other suppliers  
to sell wheat, corn and soybeans to storage elevators in the 
country, at rail terminals, along rivers and at ports would have 
been harmed by combining competing Cargill and Continental 
elevators in the Pacific Northwest, central California and the 
Texas Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also alleged the original deal would have reduced  
competition to buy grain and soybeans from farmers in Midwestern 
states, including Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Ohio, where 
Cargill and Continental operate competing river elevators and rail 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	And, the consolidation of Cargill and Continental elevators  
along the Illinois River with the Continental elevator in the port 
of Chicago would have concentrated ownership of delivery points 
authorized by the Chicago Board of Trade for settlement of corn and 
soybean futures contracts under the control of Cargill and another 
firm. This would have increased the risk that prices for Board of 
Trade futures contracts could be manipulated, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually the government worries that merging companies will boost  
prices, but here, Klein said, ``we were concerned about the ability 
of the combining companies to artificially depress the price they 
pay suppliers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Continental operates six elevators in ports, 27 along rivers and  
14 at rail terminals. The companies agreed to sell: 
</P>
<P>
	--Four port elevators, in Seattle; Beaumont, Texas; Stockton,  
Calif.; and Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	--Four river elevators, in East Dubuque, Morris and Lockport,  
Ill., and Caruthersville, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
	--One rail terminal, in Troy, Ohio.  
</P>
<P>
	The agreement also provides that Cargill will:  
</P>
<P>
	--Make one-third of the loading capacity at its Havana, Ill.,  
river elevator available to an independent grain company. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be barred from acquiring the Birds Point, Mo., river elevator  
in which it used to have a minority share. 
</P>
<P>
	--Be prohibited from acquiring the Salinas, Kan., rail terminal  
facility formerly operated by Continental. 
</P>
<P>
	--Abide by restrictions if it enters an agreement to use part of  
the Seattle port elevator.

<HEADLINE> Smoky Mountains Site of Ozone Study </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Government scientists are launching a research  
program to measure the ozone in the Great Smoky Mountains on the 
Tennessee-North Carolina border. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said the  
two-year effort is aimed at finding the reason for recent increases 
in ozone in the popular tourist region. Once the source is 
identified, they will look for ways to reduce the pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Ozone can be produced by industrial gases and can cause  
breathing problems for the elderly and people with asthma and 
respiratory illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	About a dozen new weather stations, including continuously  
operating ozone monitors, will be installed in Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park for the first phase of the study. Next 
year, Phase 2 will focus on improving ozone forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the region had more than 40 days of public ozone  
warnings and so far this year, there have been eight days with 
ozone concentrations that required public warnings. 
</P>
<P>
	The research is being conducted by NOAA's Air Resources  
Laboratory in Oak Ridge, Tenn., in cooperation with the National 
Park Service, the state of Tennessee, the University of Tennessee, 
East Tennessee State University, Knox County, Tenn., the Air 
Pollution Control Department and the Chattanooga-Hamilton County, 
Tenn., Air Pollution Control Board.

<HEADLINE> Defense Contractor May Escape Fines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Lockheed Martin faced millions of  
dollars in fines for failing to provide a working missile system to 
the Pentagon on time, but it appears the company was given an 
escape clause by the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Lockheed Martin was fined $15 million by the Pentagon after its  
Theater High-Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, missile defense 
system failed in March for the sixth time to intercept a flying 
target missile. 
</P>
<P>
	But company and Pentagon officials said Friday that the contract  
for the $3.8 billion system was changed after the fifth failure to 
allow it to escape penalties. 
</P>
<P>
	Keith Ashdown, spokesman for the Washington-based Taxpayers for  
Common Sense, criticized the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are allowed to fail as long as they get it right in the  
end,'' Ashdown said. 
</P>
<P>
	In July 1998, Lockheed Martin's contract was changed to say it  
could be excused from up to $35 million in penalties for future 
failures. 
</P>
<P>
	Under those changes, the $15 million penalty for the March  
failure would be waived if it manages three successful intercepts 
by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Penalties from failures after March would also be erased if the  
intercepts are made, company spokesman Jeff Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest flight test, on June 10 at the Army's White Sands  
Missile Range in southern New Mexico, was successful. The next 
test, originally set for July 16, has been delayed about 10 days, 
said Jennifer Canaff, spokeswoman for the Pentagon's Ballistic 
Missile Defense Organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Canaff said the contract modification was needed to give  
Lockheed Martin more time to fix problems with THAAD and to provide 
an incentive to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The intent was not to penalize them,'' Canaff said. ``The  
attempt was to gain more information and more data on how to make 
this missile system work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Rear Adm. Eugene Carroll, deputy director for the  
Washington-based Center for Defense Information, was critical of 
the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems to be bureaucratic posturing, which doesn't change  
the fact that as long as the company can bring in a third hit by 
December 31, they're off the hook for any penalties whatsoever,'' 
he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Presses for Patients Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With political maneuvering over a ``patients'  
bill of rights'' intensifying on the airwaves and in the Senate, 
President Clinton is pressing lawmakers to set rules for health 
maintenance organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton was addressing a group of medical professionals and  
educators at the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical 
Center today as senators in Washington prepared to begin debate on 
the legislation when they return from recess on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's own proposal to increase patients' rights died  
on Capitol Hill last year, and he has dismissed an alternative 
offered by Republicans as being too limited in scope and in terms 
of the people it would cover. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must do more to make sure that when health care plans cut  
costs, they don't cut quality, and that the bottom line never 
becomes more important than patients' needs,'' Clinton said in a 
radio address last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The political strategizing over the measure intensified this  
week. 
</P>
<P>
	Business and insurance groups launched a $750,000 ad campaign  
aimed at undecided GOP senators, while Republican leaders 
positioned themselves to limit debate on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the same groups that helped defeat Clinton's plan for  
universal health care are now trying to beat back the patients' 
rights bill with a TV ad blitz arguing that it would raise the cost 
of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Recently, the debate has been over the limited choices patients  
have for care. But the counter-argument could gain some traction as 
the number of uninsured Americans continues to grow. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite prosperous economic times, there were 43.4 million  
uninsured Americans in 1997. That was up 4 million since Clinton 
proposed his universal health insurance plan in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants legislation that would ensure patients have access  
to health care specialists and emergency room services, and protect 
them from being forced to switch doctors in the midst of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	The most controversial -- and most expensive -- provision that  
Democrats are pushing would give patients the right to sue health 
plans and collect damages when treatment is withheld. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans have said the Democratic measure is too expensive  
and could lead employers to drop coverage. Senate Republicans have 
their own legislation on health maintenance organizations that 
would cost less but would cover fewer Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Senate Republicans said they would use a  
Democratic-written bill as the vehicle for opening the debate, thus 
limiting the number of politically sensitive amendments Democrats 
might offer. 
</P>
<P>
	But under an agreement reached last week, the GOP gets to offer  
the final amendment after four days of debate. They are expected to 
use that penultimate vote to substitute their own bill for the 
entire Democratic measure. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats decried the move, but Republicans made no apologies.  
</P>
<P>
	``It doesn't matter where you start out. It matters where you  
end up, which is Republicans will pass a Republican bill,'' said 
Eric Ueland, a top aide to Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who is 
leading the GOP on the issue.

<HEADLINE> Women's World Cup Making History </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- On the eve of the most anticipated game  
in women's soccer history, several players felt it was time to sit 
back, look around and give their impressions of the incredibly 
successful Women's World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States meets China on Saturday at the Rose Bowl for  
the third women's world championship. A sellout crowd approaching 
90,000 and including President Clinton will be there. Many of the 
fans will have painted faces or will be wearing U.S. flags. Or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
	Television ratings should be strong, even on a Saturday  
afternoon and considering this is women's soccer, after all. With 
the exception of the 1996 Olympics, mainstream America generally 
has ignored the sport. 
</P>
<P>
	This U.S. team, with lots of help from China, Brazil, Nigeria,  
Norway and the other nations in the tournament, has created 
something very special out of the World Cup. The Americans 
recognize that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am proud of this team and the way we have handled ourselves  
since Day 1 in residency camp,'' star forward Mia Hamm said as she 
sat with her left leg wrapped in ice and leisurely spoke with the 
mass of media in a Rose Bowl locker room. ``The way we have carried 
ourselves on and off the field has been awesome. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been asked to do a lot off the field, and we've pretty  
much done all of it with the understanding of how important it is 
for women's soccer. We've pretty much done it with a smile and, in 
the same arena, we have been trying to prepare to play the best 
teams in the world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	They've prepared well enough to have gone 5-0 and allowed only  
three goals while scoring 18. China has been even more impressive, 
scoring 19 and yielding two. 
</P>
<P>
	And now, fittingly, the two best teams in the world meet for the  
crown. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are still getting better,'' China coach Ma Yuanan said.  
Then he got mystical. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've learned the meaning of soccer. Soccer itself has its  
own nature. 
</P>
<P>
	They have mastered the nature of soccer. They have confidence,  
which comes from the three games with the USA and winning two.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While China's journey has been longer in miles, U.S. forward  
Tiffeny Milbrett doesn't think anyone has spent more time or more 
effort getting this far than the Americans. Nor has anyone spent 
more time or effort in helping this World Cup exceed all 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Saturday, though, things change.  
</P>
<P>
	``We felt that pressure of getting to the final and what it  
would mean for the tournament. We did that for America, for the 
fans,'' Milbrett said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is all about the players now. This is our trophy, it's  
for us. Hopefully, we can allow Americans to share it with us. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting to the finals was for the fans. This is for us.''  
</P>
<P>
	Will it be victory for them? While that has been the goal all  
along and a defeat will be a bitter disappointment, the Americans 
comprehend just how much good work they have done -- and how much 
goodwill they have created. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think if we win or lose will have that much of an  
impact, because this tournament has been a tremendous success 
already,'' Hamm said. ``And this team has been able to bring about 
a lot of excitement and recognition for women's sports. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I think people also realized how well the other teams play  
and how entertaining our game is. The World Cup has achieved what 
all of us wanted it to.''

	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) -- An 88-year-old man who was told he  
would have to wait a few minutes to see a doctor pulled a steak 
knife and stabbed a physician's assistant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meir Gotlieb was charged with assault and other offenses in the

complained of back problems. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, he pulled a knife and jabbed it 2 inches  
into Ms. Ashley's abdomen as she worked with another patient, 
witnesses told police. It was not clear why he attacked Ms. Ashley.

<HEADLINE> Police in Calif. To Be Investigated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Riverside Police Department, which is  
already being investigated for the shooting death of a black woman 
in her car, now faces a federal probe into whether it has engaged 
in repeated civil rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The new investigation is ``not an indictment of the  
department,'' U.S. Attorney Alejandro Mayorkas said Thursday. ``It 
is a reasoned response to concerns that have been raised.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department said the investigation will determine  
whether the department ``has engaged in a pattern or practice of 
law enforcement misconduct, including using excessive force and 
discriminating in the way it provides police services.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The agency is investigating 10 police departments nationwide,  
including those in New York City and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
	Bill Lann Lee, acting assistant U.S. attorney general, said the  
Riverside department has pledged to cooperate fully. Police Chief 
Jerry Carroll said he believes the review will confirm the 
department ``neither practices nor condones unprofessional behavior 
or racial discrimination in any form.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officials would not discuss specific complaints, but said they  
involved incidents in the city 60 miles east of Los Angeles before 
and after the Dec. 28 shooting of Tyisha Miller, 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Police found her apparently unconscious in a locked car parked  
at a gas station. Four white officers fired 23 bullets at her, 
hitting her 12 times, when she suddenly reached for a gun after an 
officer broke into her car to remove the weapon, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Riverside County district attorney criticized the officers'  
tactics but decided there was no criminal intent. That decision has 
prompted repeated demonstrations in Riverside and a separate 
federal civil rights investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers involved have been notified that the police chief  
intends to fire them. Their lawyer claims they are being made 
scapegoats.

<HEADLINE> Mystery of Solar Wind Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For 37 years, solar physicists have wondered  
how charged particles streaming from the sun could reach a speed of 
almost 2 million mph. A new study solves the puzzle: The particles 
catch a magnetic wave and surf across space. 
</P>
<P>
	Existence of a high speed flow from the sun, called the solar  
wind, was first confirmed in 1962, but experts were startled at the 
wind's velocity. They had expected it to poke along at a mere 1 
million mph, and the higher speed has been a puzzle. 
</P>
<P>
	New measurements by two satellites have provided the answer,  
researchers said Thursday, by showing that the solar wind's speed 
is boosted by magnetic waves that spiral out from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is accelerated out of the sun by magnetic waves  
in much the same way a surfer rides the waves to the shore,'' said 
John L. Kohl of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. 
</P>
<P>
	``These findings have revolutionized our understanding of the  
sun's outer atmosphere and the solar wind,'' said George Withbroe, 
a director in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's 
office of space science. 
</P>
<P>
	The solar wind is composed of electrically charged particles --  
atoms and electrons -- constantly flowing from the sun's outer 
atmosphere, or corona. The 1 million to 2 million degree heat of 
the corona strips electrons from oxygen and hydrogen atoms, 
creating the charged particles. The stream of gas and electrons 
streak across the solar system, blasting unprotected planets, and 
racing outward into deep space, reaching a point, experts say, 
about 9 billion miles from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A magnetic field surrounding the Earth protects it from the  
erosion of the solar wind, but most other planets are not as lucky. 
For instance, scientists believe it was the solar wind that 
stripped away any atmosphere from Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	``The solar wind is staggering in size. Every eight hours, the  
sun puts out gas equal to all of the gases in the Earth's 
atmosphere,'' said Kohl. 
</P>
<P>
	Scientists had speculated about the solar wind, but its  
existence was not confirmed until the Mariner spacecraft took 
measurements in 1962, the same year that John Glenn made his first 
spaceflight. But the discovery raised the question about why the 
wind was moving faster than experts say was possible from ordinary 
solar radiant energy. 
</P>
<P>
	Ironically, the high-speed mystery was solved with the help of a  
robot spacecraft hauled into orbit aboard the space shuttle that 
returned Glenn to space last October. 
</P>
<P>
	The solution came from measurements taken by the Spartan 201  
spacecraft, carried into orbit by the shuttle, and by the SOHO, a 
sun-observing spacecraft jointly owned by NASA and the European 
Space Agency. 
</P>
<P>
	The Spartan and SOHO instruments detected oxygen and hydrogen  
atoms spiraling along vibrating magnetic fields that stream out 
from the corona. The atoms pick up speed from the push of the 
wavelike motion of the magnetic fields, Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
	Two solar diameters out from the sun's outer atmosphere, the  
oxygen atoms are traveling at more than 1 million mph, said Leonard 
Strachan, an astrophysicist at the Smithsonian Astrophysical 
Observatory. He said the hydrogen atoms travel at a lower speed, 
about 600,000 mph. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the solar wind reaches the vicinity of the Earth, he  
said, it is traveling at more than 500 miles per second, almost 2 
million mph. 
</P>
<P>
	To illustrate this speed, Strachan said it takes the space  
shuttle about 90 minutes to orbit the Earth. The oxygen atoms in 
the solar wind, he said, could complete an Earth orbit in one 
minute.

<HEADLINE> Russell 2000 Kicks Out 375 Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- E-Trade is out. BarnesandNoble.com is in.  
</P>
<P>
	After weeks of speculation, the benchmark Russell 2000 stock  
index on Thursday released the list of small companies that will 
make up its roster for the coming year, knocking out 375 companies 
that had grown too large over the past 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Also out are Ameritrade, CMGI, Doubleclick, Lycos, RealNetworks  
and many other sexy Internet companies that help drive the Russell 
2000's 7.28 percent return in 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	In their place are companies such as 24/7 Media and Bebe Stores.  
</P>
<P>
	Money managers across the country, many of whom measure their  
performance against the Russell 2000 index, have been anxiously 
waiting for the closely guarded list to be revealed. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, The Russell 2000 eliminated all companies with a market  
value of more than $1.3 billion. A total of 513 companies were 
added to the index. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 starts every July with 2000 companies, but many  
companies get acquired or go out of business, so more companies are 
added than axed each summer. The changes took effect July 1, but 
were announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. equity market is a very dynamic creature,'' said Paul  
Greenwood, senior research analyst at Frank Russell Co., the 
Tacoma, Wa.-based company that runs the indexes. ``Once again, the 
large number of initial public offerings, mergers and acquisitions 
were responsible for a significant number of the changes to our 
indexes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The largest company in the index is American Management Services  
with a market value of $1.3 billion and the smallest company is 
Towne Services with a market value of $178.2 million.

<HEADLINE>  Chinese-Americans Torn in World Cup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Chinese-American soccer fans have plenty to  
cheer about -- perhaps too much. 
</P>
<P>
	Their problem is which side to root for during Saturday's  
Women's World Cup championship game. 
</P>
<P>
	Do they cheer for China, the country from where many of their  
parents, grandparents and other relatives hail? Or do they root for 
the United States, where many of the fans were born and make their 
home? 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Lee, a 32-year-old insurance agent whose grandparents  
immigrated to America from China, looked cautiously at his 
29-year-old Taiwanese wife, Hong, before answering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want to talk about it too much because if China wins,  
she will never let me hear the last of it,'' Lee said, nodding at 
his wife. ``But I'm for the U.S.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I think China will win,'' she added as the couple left a  
Chinatown restaurant, ``and he's right, I'll will let him know 
about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With many Chinese-Americans expected to be in the sellout crowd  
of some 90,000 at the Rose Bowl for Saturday's game and many more 
watching on television, the Lees seem to provide a microcosm of the 
split allegiances across America. 
</P>
<P>
	Jimmy Yee, 54, said China's appearance in the World Cup final  
has caused a buzz in the restaurant he runs in Boston's Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time in China that a woman's team has made  
it to the championship. It's on the front page of all the 
newspapers,'' Yee said. ``I'm proud of the team because I'm 
Chinese. It's a popular topic in the restaurant; it's on everyone's 
minds.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As for choosing sides, Yee would like it both ways. He said he  
plans to root for the United States because he wants to be 
patriotic. But he added: ``I hope it's a tie. A zero-zero, double 
champion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately for Yee, that can't happen. If the game is tied at  
the end of regulation, the teams decide the outcome with penalty 
kicks. 
</P>
<P>
	In Berkeley, University of California student Jennie Liu, 20,  
said she favors China because she is impressed by the team's soccer 
skills, not because of her heritage. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about soccer, it's not about politics,'' she said. ``I  
like the Chinese team because I've seen them play and I like their 
style.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In New York's Chinatown, Ya Qiu, a fishmonger from Guangdong  
province, said the matchup is exciting. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think that it is good for China and the Chinese people. It  
shows that we can compete and hold our own with anybody,'' Qiu said 
in Mandarin. ``I'm definitely going to watch the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So is Kenny Gong, a 61-year-old retiree who has lived in New  
York for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am a very big fan; I've watched all the games so far,'' Gong  
said. ``It's very exciting that they are women and I think it is 
good for the spirit and integrity of the Chinese.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Rowland Heights, one of several Los Angeles suburbs with a  
large ethnic Chinese community, 12-year-old Amy Chang said she 
plans to watch the game on television and has no question who she 
will be cheering for. 
</P>
<P>
	``USA,'' she said. ``I think they're awesome.''  
</P>
<P>
	Not all Chinese-Americans are caught up in World Cup fever. In  
Los Angeles' Chinatown, Harry Yang, a 19-year-old clerk at Hill 
Street Cafe &AMP; Cigar, said he didn't think people his age were 
really into the game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm aware of the game, saw maybe three minutes about the  
American team on TV. But I don't really care who wins,'' said Yang, 
who came from China to the United States 12 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Down the street at It Pun Fortune Readings, proprietor Lau Hang  
Mee seemed only vaguely aware that the game was being played. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked to predict the winner, Lau the fortune teller, with a  
friend translating, replied, ``I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Sen. Smith Likely To Resign From GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Sen. Bob Smith of New Hampshire is expected  
to announce next week that he will leave the Republican Party and 
continue his campaign for the presidency as an independent or 
third-party candidate, a source close to the campaign said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Smith was  
talking to Republican Party leaders, friends and supporters about 
leaving the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican State Rep. Tom Rice said he got a call from Smith's  
office telling him that the senator would make his announcement 
Tuesday. ``But whether he was forming a third party or going with 
an existing one, I don't know,'' Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith was vacationing and not taking media calls Friday, said  
Karen Hickey, his campaign spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't confirm, I can't deny,'' Hickey said.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith was planning to leave the party not because of his  
campaign, which has garnered little support, but because of his 
philosophical objection to the direction of the party's mainstream, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
	He has threatened to leave the Republican Party several times in  
recent weeks, saying many Republicans have abandoned their 
conservative base by softening their positions on abortion and gun 
control. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican National Committee Chairman Jim Nicholson sent Smith  
a letter telling him leaving the party would be a ``serious mistake 
for you personally, with only a marginal political impact -- and a 
counterproductive one at that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Said Steve Duprey, New Hampshire Republican state chairman,  
``This is a selfish move and is doomed to failure. It signals the 
end of his political career in New Hampshire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington, some of Smith's GOP presidential rivals were  
quick to react. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Bauer said, ``It would be a tragedy for the Republican  
party to start splitting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. John Kasich, R-Ohio, said, ``He's got strong convictions,  
maybe he's thinking that is what he's got to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, the first New Hampshire lawmaker publicly to endorse  
Smith, said he has not decided whether he will continue to support 
his presidential campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm still very supportive of Bob Smith because he says the  
things I want to hear,'' he said. ``But I will say I'm disappointed 
he's going to take his shot from outside the party rather than 
inside, because I'm very concerned the only thing he will be able 
to do is elect Al Gore.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has said he might form his own party, or run as a  
candidate for either the Reform Party or U.S. Taxpayer Party. He 
supports low taxes, a strong national defense and school prayer. He 
strongly opposes abortion and gun control. 
</P>
<P>
	Pat Benjamin, national vice chairwoman of the Reform Party, said  
Smith had talked to party Chairman Russell Verney a while ago about 
how the Reform Party primary works, as well as what forming another 
party would involve. 
</P>
<P>
	She said he was welcome to pursue the Reform Party nomination.  
``The more people who come in and try to become our nominee, the 
better,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the No. 1 challenge he would face is that he tends to  
emphasize social issues, and in the Reform Party, we've chosen our 
membership to not address social issues. There's nothing in our 
platform about social issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our issues focus on economics, political reform,'' she said.  
``I'd want to know, and I think our members would want to know, 
where he stands on the issues we focus on, like trade, a balanced 
budget, reducing the size of government, campaign finance reform.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith has criticized other Republicans for saying the party must  
soften its hard-line position on gun control and other conservative 
issues to have a chance of winning the White House in 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	In the latest CNN/Gallup poll, he was supported by 1 percent of  
Republicans, well behind virtually every other candidate in a field 
dominated by Texas Gov. George W. Bush. 
</P>
<P>
	A second-term senator, Smith has said he would not resign his  
Senate seat even if he runs as a member of a third party and loses. 
</P>
<P>
	New Hampshire Democratic Chairwoman Kathy Sullivan predicted  
that Democrats would win Smith's Senate seat if he bolts the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sen. Smith has long been a leader in the fight for lower  
taxes, a stronger defense and smaller government,'' said John 
Czwartacki, spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. ``I 
trust if the reports are true that this issue will be discussed by 
the Senate Republican conference with Sen. Smith.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It would be up to the GOP conference to decide whether to  
protect his seniority rights on committees. 
</P>
<P>
	His chairmanship of the ethics committee could be at risk. And  
as a further example of the stakes involved, the New Hampshire 
conservative is in line to become chairman of the environment 
committee in the next Congress if Republicans hold their majority.

<HEADLINE> Famous N.C. Lighthouse Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUXTON, N.C. (AP) -- Workers gently pushed the Cape Hatteras  
Lighthouse over the threshold of its new home Friday to the cheers 
of hundreds of tourists and the relief of lighthouse lovers. 
</P>
<P>
	The 129-year-old lighthouse, renowned for its spiraling black  
and white stripes, was relocated slowly but steadily from its 
original location over a course of three weeks to spare it from the 
pounding surf, which had eroded the structure's shorefront. 
</P>
<P>
	``To see something like this actually happen, it's a momentous  
event,'' said tourist Myra Musialkiewicz, who drove from northern 
Virginia to watch the historic moment. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's tallest lighthouse began its journey June 17 after  
months of preparation. Resting on a nest of steel beams mounted on 
rollers, it was pushed along rails by seven hydraulic jacks. 
</P>
<P>
	The 208-foot-tall tower traveled 2,900 feet from its old home,  
which had wound up 150 feet from the crashing Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
	After workers nudged the lighthouse over a stop sign tacked to a  
post at the end of the moving rails, it was officially at its new 
home -- 1,600 feet from the ocean's edge. 
</P>
<P>
	Moving subcontractor Jerry Matyiko of Expert House Movers of  
Virginia Beach, Va., exchanged high fives and handshakes with 
surveyor John Mayne. Construction workers and spectators cheered, 
then the workers climbed on the lighthouse to pose for pictures and 
to toss their hard hats in the air. 
</P>
<P>
	National Park Service officials said the move will keep the  
lighthouse safe for at least a century. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service planned Friday night to test the lighthouse's  
twin beams, which were extinguished March 1 for the first time in 
50 years. They are scheduled to be re-lighted on Labor Day and 
officials plan to reopen the lighthouse to visitors next Memorial 
Day. 
</P>
<P>
	Those who urged moving the lighthouse said a strong hurricane  
might one day topple it into the Atlantic. Opponents of the move 
advocated building up the beach and installing groins to stabilize 
the shoreline. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some that will say we've destroyed history,'' said  
Park Service spokesman Bob Woody. ``I'm not going to make those 
judgments. The people who will visit this lighthouse 100 years from 
now will give us the answer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Much work remains to be done before the lighthouse opens again  
to visitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Travel beams have to be removed and replaced with steel  
supports. Then masons will build a foundation in the 5-foot-4-inch 
space between the lighthouse base and the pad with 140,000 bricks.

<HEADLINE> Indian Account Control Defended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt testified  
today in a civil trial that it would be a mistake to take 
responsibility for Indian trust funds way from the Bureau of Indian 
Affairs, although the government has conceded the money has been 
badly mismanaged for decades. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt was called as the final witness by the government in the  
trial that has focused on a history of shoddy and incomplete record 
keeping by the agency responsible for maintaining more than 300,000 
personal Indian trust accounts worth more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the Indian account holders who brought the class-action  
lawsuit against the government have argued that the Bureau of 
Indian Affairs has shown it is incapable of handling the money and 
over the years has deprived account holders of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	But Babbitt, questioned by Justice Department attorney Tom  
Clark, said he has instituted plans to modernize the accounting 
system and that the Indian tribes themselves want the trust 
accounts to remain where they are. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the love-hate relationship they (the tribes) view the  
Bureau of Indian Affairs as their imperfect piece of the 
government,'' said Babbitt. 
</P>
<P>
	The monthlong trial before U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth  
has exposed the vexing and long-standing problems the Interior 
Department has had in trying to deal with the Indian trust 
accounts. Incomplete receipts and disbursement records are 
scattered in more than 100 BIA offices and many of the accounts are 
only a few dollars -- a few pennies in some cases -- because holdings 
over the years have been splintered as inheritances moved through 
generations of Indian families. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from rent, royalties and other income from 11  
million acres of land owned by individual Indians, many of whom are 
very poor. The lawsuit address only accounts held by individuals. 
The BIA also controls an additional $2.5 billion in trust funds 
that belong to tribes, but that is not at issue in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The government was expected to rest its case after Babbitt's  
testimony. With the trial nearing conclusion, a key question was 
whether Lamberth will order the trust accounts to be taken out of 
BIA hands. The lawsuit asks that management of the trust accounts 
be reformed and that accounts be reconciled. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this year, Lamberth held both Babbitt and then-Treasury  
Secretary Robert Rubin in contempt for failing to produce records 
sought by the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has argued that the problems with the trust accounts go  
back decades and that he has made progress in correcting the 
problems. Recently the Interior Department installed a $60 million 
computer system aimed at better management of the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt described steps dating back several years that he has  
taken to try to clean up the tangled records of the trust accounts 
and said the effort is ``basically on the right track. ... We've 
got to keep this thing moving.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the plaintiffs in the lawsuit have argued the current  
administration has tried to avoid the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Babbitt has spent seven years in office denying justice to  
Indian account holders and covering up his role in the debacle,'' 
charged Elouise Cobell, a member of the Blackfeet tribe and the 
lead plaintiff in the lawsuit, in a statement distributed to 
reporters shortly before Babbitt took the witness stand.

	Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM  
</P>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A jury today ordered General Motors Corp. to  
pay $4.9 billion to six people who were severely burned in 1993 
when the fuel tank of their Chevrolet Malibu exploded in flames 
during a rear-end collision. The huge verdict came after a 10-week 
Superior Court trial that focused on an internal GM study that the 
plaintiffs' lawyers said demonstrated the carmaker had known for 
years its gas tanks were unsafe, but was unwilling to pay the cost 
of a recall. GM stock was up 7/16 at 68 3/16.

	Ex-ADM Executive Sentenced

	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former executive of food-processing giant  
Archer Daniels Midland Co., who served as the FBI's undercover 
informant in a major price-fixing investigation, was sentenced 
today to 2 1/2 years in prison for his participation in the scheme he 
probed. Mark Whitacre, 41, was sentenced by telephone. He is at a 
federal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year 
sentence for swindling ADM out of $9 million. He and two other top 
ADM executives were convicted last September of conspiring to fix 
the $600 million world market in lysine, a soybean-based additive 
that promotes growth in hogs and poultry. ADM stock was up 1/16 at

	IEA Sees Possible Oil Shortage  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- OPEC's cutback in crude production and a rising  
demand for gasoline and other refined products could lead this 
winter to the biggest oil shortage in more than a decade, a 
respected industry survey warned today. But the report by the 
International Energy Agency acknowledges that a further spike in 
prices, which have almost doubled since December, would probably 
tempt oil-producing countries to break ranks and boost output. ``A 
more plausible scenario is that, before the end of the year, there 
will be an 'upward adjustment' of production,'' the agency said.

	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- Hoping to overcome the cronyism and  
mismanagement that has plagued the European Union's executive arm, 
its incoming president promised a new era today and named the team 
he wants to run Europe's affairs for the next five years. Former 
Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who is taking over as 
president of the 20-member European Commission, has only four 
holdovers on the team of 20 he has chosen. The commission resigned 
in March after a panel of experts found widespread nepotism and 
financial mismanagement at the EU's head office. Of the four, only 
Agriculture Commissioner Franz Fischler of Austria will keep his 
old job.

	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Many companies are having trouble finding  
skilled workers as the nation's unemployment rate hovers at its 
lowest levels in three decades, top economic forecasters said. The 
National Association for Business Economics' survey found 61.8 
percent of the companies polled in June reported difficulty finding 
skilled workers to fill vacancies. In an April survey, 59.2 percent 
of the companies said they were short of skilled workers, and in a 
January poll, 52.5 percent reported problems. However, only 9.8 
percent of the companies polled reported problems finding unskilled 
workers, down from 11.7 percent in April and 12.5 percent in 
January.

	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A jury cleared two tobacco companies of  
any responsibility today for the cancer a lifelong smoker suffered 
before he died in 1993. After less than four hours of 
deliberations, the jury voted 11-1 in favor of R.J. Reynolds and 
American Tobacco, ending a three-week trial. Robert Gilboy's wife

dangerous product and sought $840,000 in damages -- $10,000 for 
every month of the seven years he lived after being diagnosed with 
lung cancer.

	SINGAPORE (AP) -- An assistant vice president for Banque  
Nationale de Paris in Singapore was sentenced to a year in jail 
after losing nearly $2 million in unauthorized trades, a newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Hew Keong Chan, a Malaysian living in Singapore, pleaded guilty  
Thursday to three charges of fraud, The Straits Times said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hew, 39, lost more than $1.8 million while trading in shares and  
foreign exchange under accounts opened in the names of his wife and 
brother-in-law, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	The accounts were reportedly opened without the family members'  
knowledge, and Hew's trades were unauthorized because he might have 
had a personal interest in them. 
</P>
<P>
	He was suspended last year after the bank discovered  
irregularities in payment for accounts, the report said.

	U.S. Opposes Asylum for Milosevic  
</P>
<P>
	COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The United States opposes a move  
among Serb opposition forces to find political sanctuary for 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic, Defense Secretary William 
Cohen said today. He said the Serb leader's only place of asylum 
will be a war crimes tribunal in the Netherlands. The comments came 
as senior Clinton administration officials were analyzing reports 
that opposition groups are considering options for finding 
political asylum for Milosevic in Belarus or Iraq as a quick path 
to the Serb leader's removal from power. But Cohen predicted 
Milosevic would launch a crackdown on opposition forces before 
considering yielding power.

closer in its sporadic, 13-year effort to join global trade's

the United States and the European Union. Obuchi urged China to 
restart WTO talks with the United States that Beijing suspended

Ojai Valley Community Hospital. Conrad, who lived in Huntington

the Yangcheng Evening News said in a report seen today in Beijing. 
It said 82.9 percent of HIV carriers were men and that more than 
half were between 20 and 29 years old. Earlier reports in the state

<HEADLINE> Alleged Racist Killer Kept Journal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SKOKIE, Ill. (AP) -- Police are analyzing racist notations in a  
journal apparently owned by Benjamin Smith, hoping to learn more 
about the deadly shooting rampage in the Midwest last weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	A journal filled with white supremacist views and apparently  
written by Smith was found inside his car, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Anyone who knows the history of this plague upon humanity who  
calls themselves the Jews will know why I have acted,'' reads the 
opening passage on several pages of writings, police said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're continuing to try to piece together all the chain of  
events -- anything that may give us a better picture of exactly what 
happened,'' said Skokie police Sgt. Michael Ruth. ``We believe that 
Benjamin Smith acted alone. However, we need to be absolutely 
positive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Investigators have not determined if the journal was written  
during last weekend's shooting spree, Ruth said. But he said 
Smith's entries do include a ``reference to a revolution on the 
Fourth of July.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is believed to have killed two people and wounded nine  
others -- all either Jews, blacks or Asians -- in Illinois and 
Indiana before his suicide near Salem on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth would not release the journal to the media or discuss the  
writings in detail, but said there is nothing in them that 
specifically refers to any of the victims. He said the journal 
contains ``caustic, venomous, anti-Semitic'' language. 
</P>
<P>
	The writings are in a spiral notebook found inside the blue Ford  
Taurus the 21-year-old was driving until he carjacked a minivan at 
a truck stop in southern Illinois. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruth said the handwriting is similar to handwriting on other  
papers that police know to be Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
	Also found in the car was a bulletproof vest and military-type  
bulletproof helmet. A substantial amount of cash was found, but 
Ruth said he did not know how much. 
</P>
<P>
	Police also have recovered a $6,100 receipt dated June 15,  
showing Smith spending the money to print literature for the World 
Church of the Creator, an East Peoria-based white supremacist 
organization to which he belonged. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, one of six Chicago residents wounded in the weekend  
shooting spree -- Ephraim Wolfe, a 15-year-old Orthodox Jew shot in 
the leg -- has filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the 
Creator; the group's leader, Matthew Hale; Smith's parents; and 
Donald Fiessinger, who has been charged with selling guns to Smith 
without a license.

<HEADLINE> Palmer Sees The End Coming  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Arnold Palmer sees the end coming.  
</P>
<P>
	Frustrated by his two rounds in the U.S. Senior Open, Palmer  
said Friday he could not see himself continuing in competitive golf 
much longer unless he starts playing better. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer never used the word retire and named some tournaments in  
which he planned to play. But he noted, ``Well, I guess everything 
has to come to an end somewhere.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps the most popular golfer in history, Palmer failed to  
make the cut in the Senior Open after shooting rounds of 81 and 84. 
Friday's 84, which included a two-stroke penalty for an illegal 
putting stance as he was tapping in on No. 18, was his worst score 
ever in the Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	The last time he didn't make the cut was 1991.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is terrible, the last two days,'' Palmer said. ``I don't  
know that I will play much more competition like this. I may play a 
few tournaments, a Masters or something like that. But unless I 
start hitting it a lot better in Latrobe, I am not going to take it 
anywhere else. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have some commitments this year which I will finish, some  
events that I have committed to, but other than that, that is about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer said he'll play in a seniors tournament in Boston in  
August and probably will play in next year's Senior Open at Saucon 
Valley in his home state of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am happy to be here. I am not happy about the way I  
played,'' Palmer said. ``But I am not saying I am not going to play 
again, either.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 69, has four Masters championships and two British Open  
titles among his 92 victories worldwide. His last victory on the 
senior tour came in 1988, but he remains one of the game's most 
enduring figures -- a fact that was evident in this tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Huge crowds followed Palmer during his rounds at the Des Moines  
Golf and Country Club and applauded his every step. At times, it 
seemed as if he spent more time tipping his cap than wearing it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I enjoy playing golf and I will probably never give up  
playing,'' Palmer said. ``So that tells you the answer to that. I 
have always said when I can't enjoy playing out here and having the 
competition as a part of my existence, then I will discontinue the 
competition and play at home with my foursome.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer has played in five other senior events this year and in  
three tournaments on the PGA Tour, including the Masters. He didn't 
make the cut in any of the PGA Tour events. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, Palmer has been bothered by a pulled muscle in his rib  
cage. Organizers weren't sure if he would show for the Open, but 
Palmer said he had intended to play no matter how he felt. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel fine,'' he said. ``I get a little tired on days like  
the last two where I have been working pretty hard prior to coming, 
and then getting here and trying to play a big round of golf and 
not being able to. I get frustrated. When I get frustrated, I get 
tired.''

<HEADLINE> Opera With 400-Year Ban To Be Staged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``The Peony Pavilion,'' a 20-hour Chinese opera  
branded ``feudal, superstitious and pornographic'' in China, is 
getting its first full-length performance anywhere in the world in 
nearly 400 years. 
</P>
<P>
	A $1.5 million production sponsored by Lincoln Center's annual  
arts festival began this week at a high school across the street 
from the complex. 
</P>
<P>
	On three stages extending over a pond where the orchestra pit  
would be, 33 actors and musicians are telling the story of a young 
woman who meets her lover in a dream but dies longing for him. When 
her ghost finds the man, she is brought back to life and they 
marry. 
</P>
<P>
	Getting all that across is no mean feat. ``The Peony Pavilion''  
-- 90 minutes longer than the four ``Ring Cycle'' operas by Wagner -- 
has 55 acts and more than 160 characters. Its script weighs more 
than two Manhattan phone books. 
</P>
<P>
	The opera is broken into six segments, each three hours-plus  
without intermission. The first two were performed Wednesday and 
Thursday nights, and the last four were being staged Friday and 
Saturday. The entire cycle will be shown again twice this month. 
</P>
<P>
	An English translation is projected above center stage.  
</P>
<P>
	There is no nudity, merely references to sexual tension and an  
implied sex scene in which the lovers disappear behind a screen. 
All walks of Chinese life are lampooned, from prostitutes to 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	One member of the audience, Martin Siegel of New York, noted how  
the instrumental music and high-pitched singing at first might 
grate on Western ears but begin to sound sweetly melodic. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you get into it,'' he said, ``it's very beautiful.''  
</P>
<P>
	The opera, written in 1598, was enormously popular in China in  
its time. But it hasn't been performed since the death of the 
author, Tang Xianzu, in 1617. The complex operas that were popular 
during the Ming Dynasty fell out of favor and ``The Peony 
Pavilion'' was largely forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, the production was headed for a rebirth, as a  
Shanghai opera company prepared a $500,000 production for last 
year's Lincoln Center Festival, which consists of two weeks of 
plays, concerts and panel discussions all over New York City. 
</P>
<P>
	But at the last minute, the director of the Shanghai Bureau of  
Culture wouldn't let the opera company travel, saying ``The Peony 
Pavilion'' was ``feudal, superstitious and pornographic.'' 
Officials also blocked a performance in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, director Chen Shi-Zheng, who left China in 1987, put  
``The Peony Pavilion'' together again in the United States and 
brought his leading lady, Qian Yi, 23.

<P>
	Tickets to see the entire cycle are $210; seats for individual  
installments are also available.

	On opening night, a few dozen people in the crowd of 600 left  
after two hours. The second night, only four or five left before 
the end. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought it was very honestly presented, with a clear sense  
of history and theatricality -- beautifully done,'' said Larry Reed, 
who traveled from San Francisco with his wife to attend the second 
episode. ``I think it's a significant event.''

<HEADLINE> Boy Convicted of Murdering Neighbor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARTOW, Fla. (AP) -- The boy never denied killing his 8-year-old  
neighbor, saying he hit and stabbed her in a panic to stop her 
screams after he accidentally hit her with a baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors, however, said there was no evidence that Maddie  
Clifton had been playing with 15-year-old Joshua Phillips. Jurors 
sided with that story, quickly finding the youth guilty Thursday of 
murdering the girl who lived across the street and stuffing her 
body under his waterbed. 
</P>
<P>
	``This case was open and shut,'' said prosecutor Harry  
Shorstein, adding there was no clear motive. ``There aren't any 
great explanations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips was tried as an adult and could be sentenced to life in  
prison. Florida law bars the death penalty for killers under 16 and 
Phillips was 14 at the time of the murder. 
</P>
<P>
	Testimony in the trial lasted just one day -- the defense  
presented no witnesses or evidence -- and the waterbed where 
Maddie's body was hidden for seven days was reconstructed in the 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Maddie disappeared Nov. 3, 1998, and the search of her  
Jacksonville neighborhood was joined by hundreds of volunteers, 
including Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips told police he accidentally hit Maddie in the eye with  
a baseball while they played in his back yard. He panicked at her 
screams, fearing his father would punish him. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he dragged Maddie into his bedroom and, when she  
wouldn't stop screaming, hit her in the head with a bat. When she 
kept moaning, he stabbed her in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorstein said the story was unlikely and suggested the murder  
may have been sexually motivated. There was no blood on the ball, 
no blood in the yard and no dirt on Maddie's body or clothes. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Maddie's pants and underpants were removed and Phillips  
had previously talked to Maddie and her sister about sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Phillips showed no emotion as the verdict was read. Maddie's  
parents, Steve and Sheila Clifton, blinked back tears. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a day of justice for Maddie,'' Mrs. Clifton said after  
the verdict, clutching a bracelet with Maddie's name on it. ``That 
piece of my heart that's gone is waiting on the other side, waiting 
on the other side for us.''

<HEADLINE> First Lady Meets With NY Homeowners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME, N.Y. (AP) -- A group of local residents asked Hillary  
Rodham Clinton on Friday to help them fight land claims against 
their property filed by the Oneida Indian Nation. 
</P>
<P>
	On the third day of her Senate campaign swing, Mrs. Clinton said  
she takes ``to heart'' the concerns of the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
	``There should be some just and equitable solution that does not  
disadvantage existing land owners,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ``And I 
hope that that comes to pass.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Oneidas filed a lawsuit in 1970 seeking to recover 250,000  
acres of lost land. The Supreme Court ruled in 1985 that the 
Oneidas were entitled to compensation because most of their land 
was seized in questionable transactions with the state and private 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
	Negotiations over a settlement stalled, and the Justice  
Department intervened, siding with the Oneidas. 
</P>
<P>
	A handful of local residents carried signs outside Mrs.  
Clinton's campaign event in Rome. ``Please help us, Mrs. Clinton,'' 
read one sign. 
</P>
<P>
	Told by a farmer that the homeowners feel threatened by the  
possibility of losing land to the Oneidas, Mrs. Clinton said, ``I 
will certainly take that to heart. I know this has been going on 
for 20 years or more.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tina Bombardo, who owns 26 acres in Verona claimed by the  
Oneidas, said she felt Mrs. Clinton ``could help us resolve'' the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a registered Republican, but I would vote for her if she  
would help us,'' Bombardo said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Wants Education Tax Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republican tax relief packages are beginning  
to take firm shape in Congress, with the House GOP offering new tax 
breaks for education and a key senator preparing to release some 
parts of his plan. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate's top tax writer, Republican William Roth of  
Delaware, is scheduled to give this week's GOP radio message and 
likely will focus on the income tax cuts in his draft bill, 
estimated at $792 billion over a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	House Republicans, meanwhile, have spent this week sketching out  
pieces of their tax cut estimated at $850 billion over 10 years, 
but some of the biggest items are yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
	Another part of the House plan was outlined today by Rep. Bill  
Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. He said it 
would include a measure to gradually phase down and eventually 
repeal estate and gift taxes at a cost of about $70 billion over a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Archer did not release details, sources familiar with  
the draft proposal said it would reduce tax rates in increments of 
1 percentage point in the early years, then increase the annual 
cuts to 2 percentage points. Repeal would come at the end of the 
10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	The education proposal Thursday from Archer sets the GOP on a  
collision course with Clinton, who vetoed a bill with similar 
private school benefits last year. 
</P>
<P>
	But Archer, R-Texas, said the measure -- a priority for  
Republican conservatives -- would ``lighten the education tax bite'' 
and give parents ``more choices as they design the best education 
for their children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, a version of which is already moving in the Senate,  
would allow private universities for the first time to offer 
prepaid tuition programs like those currently used by 19 states for 
public universities. It would also make both types of plans 
completely tax-exempt instead of deferring taxes, as current law 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer also wants to expand IRA-like savings accounts for  
education so that they apply to the costs of public or private 
elementary and secondary schools, not just higher education. The 
maximum annual amount that could be contributed would rise from 
$500 to $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, the proposal would change rules for revenue bonds  
so that state and local governments could more easily raise money 
for public school construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, the three proposals would cost about $8 billion over  
10 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats said the private school benefits would divert too much  
federal money away from public schools and would do less than a 
Clinton alternative to help needy public schools modernize or 
replace dilapidated buildings. 
</P>
<P>
	``While they purport to provide assistance to millions of  
families, the benefit is a pittance to all but the very wealthy,'' 
said Rep. Charles Rangel of New York, top Democrat on the Ways and 
Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer has previously announced plans to cut top capital gains  
rates from 20 percent to 15 percent and create new tax breaks for 
people who care for an elderly relative at home. 
</P>
<P>
	Still to come are some of the most costly pieces of the plan,  
including a broad reduction in income taxes, cuts in inheritance 
taxes and elimination of the ``marriage penalty'' in which millions 
of two-earner couples pay more tax than if they were single. 
</P>
<P>
	Aides say Archer is considering three alternatives for the cut  
in income taxes: adjusting one or more brackets so that more income 
is taxed at lower rates, an across-the-board rate reduction that 
would gradually reach 10 percent over a decade and a 
``bottom-line'' cut in which taxpayers could take a certain 
percentage off their taxes on Internal Revenue Service forms. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee plans to begin moving its tax  
package next week. Its greatest significance may be as a Republican 
political statement, since Clinton is unlikely to sign it into law 
and wants some of the money used for Medicare and increased 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	It also faces uncertainty in the Senate, where there are likely  
to be significant differences with the House. For instance, Roth is 
less likely to include a cut in capital gains taxes and more likely 
to advance major proposals to expand private retirement savings in 
his Finance Committee bill.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Higher, Japanese Stocks Fall / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar drifted higher against the yen today  
amid a lingering expectation that Japan's central bank will 
intervene to keep the Japanese currency from rising. Japanese 
stocks fell on profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 122.66 yen in late afternoon, up 0.28 yen from  
late Thursday in Tokyo and slightly higher than its late New York 
level of 122.61 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 29.92 points,  
or 0.17 percent, closing the week at 17,937.73. On Thursday, the 
average gained 8.75 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar edged higher against the yen in Asia as investor  
sentiment turned slightly bullish after the greenback climbed above 
a key resistance level of 122.50 yen Thursday, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trading remained extremely thin as many market participants held  
back ahead of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	``The dollar's upside has been ... supported by bids from U.S.  
funds to hedge Japanese equity holdings and by fears of Bank of 
Japan intervention,'' said a dealer at a European bank who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Bank of Japan intervened to halt the yen's rise  
against the U.S. currency as Japanese financial authorities were 
concerned a stronger yen would slow the nation's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
	A higher yen forces Japanese exporters to either raise prices  
abroad or face dwindling earnings on overseas sales in terms of 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar ranged between 122.47 yen and 122.74 yen in today's  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	In other currencies, the euro was quoted at 124.97 yen, up from  
124.94 late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, prices started lower following an overnight  
drop on Wall Street, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 
60.47 points to 11,126.89 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at Nikko Securities, said the  
Tokyo stock market was adjusting after the Nikkei average has risen 
about 2,000 points between May and July. On Monday, the Nikkei 
index hit nearly a two-year high of 18,135.06 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nikkei has entered a consolidation period after closing  
above its near-term target of 18,000,'' said Tatsuo Kurokawa, 
deputy general manager at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	Volume on the exchange's first section totaled about 691 million  
shares, up from Thursday's turnover of 597 million shares. Much of 
today's volume was related to the ``special quotation'' cash 
settlement of July Nikkei options contracts. Despite the Nikkei's 
decline, rising shares outnumbered declines 618 to 587, with 126 
issues unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section fell 4.69 points, or 0.32 percent, to 1,464.40. The 
TOPIX fell 7.93 points, or 0.54 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the benchmark No. 214 10-year Japanese government  
bond rose to 1.6650 percent from Thursday's finish of 1.6350 
percent, driving its price down to 101.17 yen from 101.43 yen.

<HEADLINE> DVDs Getting Filmmakers' Attention </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The latest DVD film may not be coming to a  
theater near you. 
</P>
<P>
	Offering striking evidence that the high-capacity digital video  
disks are catching on, filmmakers say they are shooting footage for 
them that viewers won't get to see in theaters or on videotape. 
</P>
<P>
	Top directors, including Robert Altman, Werner Herzog and Bill  
Condon, said Friday they are enthralled with the possibilities of 
DVDs, which allow studios to enhance films with commentary, 
widescreen and TV-formatted versions and documentaries on the 
making of the movies. 
</P>
<P>
	``Most directors nowadays, even those who haven't paid much  
attention to video, now are forced to,'' said movie critic Leonard 
Maltin, who moderated a panel at the Video Software Dealers 
Association convention. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of them are thinking ahead about video even as they're  
making the film,'' Maltin said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the set of ``Gods and Monsters,'' a writer worked on a  
documentary about the film's subject, James Whale, who made the 
classic version of ``Frankenstein'' in the 1930s, director Condon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Likewise, while shooting ``Kansas City,'' Altman worked up a  
75-minute documentary on the jazz music used in the movie. Altman 
said he hopes to include the documentary in the DVD release. 
</P>
<P>
	The DVD release for Herzog's 1982 film ``Fitzcarraldo'' allowed  
him to enhance the sound and add a German-language version. 
</P>
<P>
	DVDs resemble compact disks but can hold far more information,  
with room for such added footage as director and actor interviews, 
movie trailers and scenes from the cutting-room floor. They offer 
sharper sound and images than VHS videos, and viewers can skip 
around easily, without having to fast-forward or rewind a tape. 
</P>
<P>
	DVDs are expected to eventually displace videotapes in the same  
way CDs replaced vinyl records. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of DVD players in U.S. homes has quadrupled in the  
last year to about 2 million, according to the Consumer Electronics 
Manufacturing Association. Some industry analysts say the number 
could reach 4 million by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	Sales of DVD movies are running at about 10 percent of the $8  
billion videotape market, according to industry estimates, while 
DVD rentals lag behind that. 
</P>
<P>
	DVD critics say that until an affordable player that also can  
record comes on the market, videotapes will not go the way of vinyl 
records. Low-end DVD players cost $300 or less, but those that can 
record onto disks remain out of most consumers' price range. 
</P>
<P>
	Some retailers also say customers will not trade in their  
videotape libraries as readily as they did vinyl records. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've got customers who own thousands of videos,'' said Ray  
Hoving, who owns Rodeo Video in Victorville, Calif. ``They're not 
going to dispose of them just like that because of a new format.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some in the industry say there could be a peaceful coexistence  
between videotapes and DVDs for a number of years, with consumers 
having both types of machines wired to their televisions.

<HEADLINE> Meadowlands Pace Adjusts Draw </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- A state appellate court ordered the  
Meadowlands Racetrack to redraw three Meadowlands Pace eliminations 
Friday after a horse owner complained that officials unfairly 
divided six horses trained by Brett Pelling. 
</P>
<P>
	The Meadowlands said on Thursday it would redraw two of the  
three races after a Bergen County Superior Court judge refused Bob 
Glazer's request to redraw all three races. Glazer appealed on 
Friday to the appellate court, and a two-judge panel sided with 
him. The Meadowlands issued new draws of each $35,000 divisions 
Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	The top three finishers in each division of Saturday's  
eliminations, plus the fastest fourth-place horse, will advance to 
the $1 million Meadowlands Pace final on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Glazer, who races as the Peter Pan Stables, complained after  
Tuesday's draw put three Pelling-trained horses in one race, two in 
another and one in a third. The draw reduced Pelling's chances of 
getting three first-place finishers in the final. Glazer owns 
Pelling-trained Spic N Pan and The Panderosa. 
</P>
<P>
	The new draw places two Pelling horses in each heat. Spic N Pan  
and Grinfromeartoear will race against each other, while Cypress 
Creek and Art's Conquest will be in a second elimination and 
Dieberspace and The Panderosa will race in a third.

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Tobacco Company in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- A jury cleared two tobacco companies of  
any responsibility today for the cancer a lifelong smoker suffered 
before he died in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	After less than four hours of deliberations, the jury voted 11-1  
in favor of R.J. Reynolds and American Tobacco, ending a three-week 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gilboy's wife and three children claimed that cigarettes  
are an unreasonably dangerous product and sought $840,000 in 
damages -- $10,000 for every month of the seven years he lived after 
being diagnosed with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The verdict came two days after a jury in Florida handed the  
tobacco industry a major setback by finding them responsible for 
making thousands of Florida smokers sick. The industry could be 
forced to pay billions in damages. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Louisiana case, a Gilboy family attorney argued that  
Gilboy was so hooked on cigarettes that he kept smoking even after 
the lung cancer had spread to his brain and he had to use a 
wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the act of a person in control of his  
facilities,'' said attorney Gere Covert. ``Cigarettes had control 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco company attorneys said Gilboy knew the risks and chose  
to smoke. They also said he would have died whether he smoked or 
not because a scar on his lung caused his cancer -- not smoking, as 
the family contended. 
</P>
<P>
	They also noted that Gilboy was cancer-free when he died at 64.

<HEADLINE> Gephardt Withdraws Muslim Nominee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt has  
withdrawn his appointment of a Muslim leader to a congressional 
panel assigned to review U.S. policy on terrorism. Jewish groups 
and several members of Congress said the nominee had justified acts 
of terror against Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., Gephardt  
said Salam Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs 
Council in Los Angeles, had been recommended to him as having 
extensive public service experience and being involved in 
interfaith dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
	The Missouri Democrat said, however, the appointment was  
subsequently questioned and since a security check could take a 
year, twice as long as the life of the commission, he was 
withdrawing the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite these circumstances, Mr. Al-Marayati is prepared to  
provide input to the commission on matters of interest and concern 
to the American Muslim community,'' Gephardt said in the letter, 
obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Gephardt told Hastert he hoped the panel would ``listen to the  
voices of this community and address the issues of civil rights for 
all Americans consistent with a strong U.S. anti-terrorism 
policy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven House members wrote FBI Director Louis Freeh they had  
received information of statements by justifying terrorism against 
Israel and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``These assertions cause us great concern as it is essential  
that all members of the commission be unequivocally committed to 
the prevention and prosecution of terrorism directed at the United 
States or our ally Israel,'' they said. 
</P>
<P>
	The appointment had been challenged by the Zionist Organization  
of America, the American Jewish Congress, the Anti-Defamation 
League and by the American Jewish Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	David A. Harris, executive director of the American Jewish  
Committee, said Al-Marayati for a number of years had justified and 
minimized acts of terrorism against Israel and against the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Morton A, Klein, national director of the Zionist Organization  
of America, said in a statement that ``these anti-Israel and 
pro-terrorist individuals and groups should be condemned and 
relegated to the margins of society, not granted credibility by 
being given government appointments and meetings at the White 
House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Council on American-Islamic Relations denounced Gephardt's  
decision and said he had bowed to political pressure. 
</P>
<P>
	``This reversal by Rep. Gephardt will only serve to  
institutionalize discrimination against American Muslims and their 
leaders,'' the council said in a statement. ``Muslims have been 
widely stereotyped using the issue of terrorism and it is therefore 
essential that a credible Muslim voice be heard.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Marayati told The New York Times he would not withdraw. ``I  
think that if there is a political will, there is a way to expedite 
these security clearances and get down to the business of the 
country,'' he was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Film Celebrates Disco </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SINGAPORE (AP) -- Many Americans associate Singapore with  
discipline, stodginess and flogging. But the city-state's first 
movie export to the United States is a tribute to disco, of all 
things. 
</P>
<P>
	The first Singaporean film shown commercially outside the tiny  
country is set for its U.S. premier on Aug. 6, director Glen Goei 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Called ``That's the Way I Like It,'' the film deals with the  
1977 arrival of the Western disco craze in Singapore and its impact 
on the straight-laced Asian society. 
</P>
<P>
	Goei said he hopes the film will counter Singapore's reputation  
as a dull country famous for its ban on chewing gum sales and its 
1994 caning of American teen-ager Michael Fay for vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
	``It shows that Singapore is not that sterile. They don't really  
live in a totalitarian regime. There's disco there,'' Goei told The 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	The film portrays a tough guy who takes to worrying about his  
hair, wearing satin shirts and entering dance contests. 
</P>
<P>
	It was released in Singapore last year under the title ``Forever  
Fever.'' Some critics said it was a blatant knockoff of the 1977 
American film ``Saturday Night Fever,'' but Goei makes no 
apologies. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an obvious homage to Saturday Night Fever and all things  
disco,'' he said. ``We don't try to pretend it's completely 
original.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After premiering in Los Angeles and New York on Aug. 6, the film  
will be shown in the rest of the United States and 29 other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Disney's Miramax paid $2.65 million for the rights.

<HEADLINE> Disney, ABC Consolidate Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Walt Disney Co. is folding its television  
production operations into ABC, a cost-cutting move that also 
reflects the growing importance of network ownership of TV 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``The business is heading in this direction and we all felt the  
timing was right for us to do this now,'' said Lloyd Braun, 
chairman of Disney's Buena Vista Television Productions. 
</P>
<P>
	Braun and Stu Bloomberg, chairman of ABC Entertainment, will be  
co-chairmen of the new division and will report to Patricia 
Fili-Krushel, ABC Television Network president. Jamie Tarses will 
continue as president of ABC Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation will allow Disney to eliminate redundancies  
that exist ``at every level,'' from casting to research to the 
legal departments, following the 1997 merger of Disney and Capital 
Cities-ABC, Braun said. 
</P>
<P>
	Networks have increasingly been trying to own the shows that  
they air instead of buying them from independent production houses. 
It keeps costs down if the shows become hits and allows the 
networks to reap huge profits in syndication that they would 
otherwise miss. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Disney would still be in the business of supplying TV  
programs to other networks, the emphasis would be on creating shows 
for ABC, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
	Executives said they could not predict how many people would  
lose their jobs, although Braun said he hoped to make the 
transition in ``as painless a way as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation is logical, said industry analyst Larry  
Gerbrandt of Paul Kagan Associates. Executives learned their lesson 
when NBC was forced to pay an unprecedented $12 million an episode 
to the studio that produces ``ER.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``You hear them vowing, `Never again,''' Gerbrandt said. ``The  
only way to prevent being in that position is to own your own 
shows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Disney spent $19 billion to buy Capital Cities-ABC, partly to  
ensure a distribution outlet for the shows it produces. The 
purchase came after federal rules changed, allowing networks to own 
more of their own programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to other networks, however, Disney has faltered in  
cultivating shows for ABC. Fox supplies nine of its own shows, 
while Buena Vista will supply only five to ABC in the coming 
season.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Up Vs. Euro; Down Vs. Yen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro and the British  
pound Friday on speculation that European interest rates could fall 
below U.S. rates. 
</P>
<P>
	In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at $1.0176, down  
from $1.0214 late Thursday. The dollar also was quoted at 122.38 
Japanese yen, down from 122.61. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar has been rising against the euro on signs of relative  
strength in the U.S. economy versus the European economy. 
Expectations that the European Central Bank or the Bank of England 
may lower interest rates have also been weakening those currencies. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar also was quoted at 1.5793 Swiss francs, up from  
1.5713, and 1.4733 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4720. The British 
pound fell to $1.5480 from $1.5588. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Friday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9220 German 
marks, up from 1.9150; and 6.4475 French francs, up from 6.4226.

<HEADLINE> Leno Hosts Candidate Bradley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential candidate Bill Bradley withstood  
a flurry of gibes Friday from talk show host Jay Leno on NBC's 
``The Tonight Show,'' but managed to get in a dig at his 
front-runner rival for the Democratic nomination, Vice President Al 
Gore. 
</P>
<P>
	When Bradley, a former senator from New Jersey, joined Leno on  
stage, the comedian said he was amazed the candidate showed up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've done a few Bill Bradley jokes ... about your speaking,''  
Leno explained. ``I think I said, Bill Bradley is so boring, his

	Bradley smiled innocently amid laughter from the audience and  
replied, ``Is it really that bad?''

<HEADLINE> House Split on Satellite Launches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Members of Congress concerned that China and  
other countries may be learning U.S. scientific secrets by 
rocketing civilian satellites into space want the United States to 
expand its launch capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
	There's one key problem with the plan: Upgrading Air Force  
launch pads at Cape Canaveral, Fla., and Vandenberg Air Force Base, 
Calif., could cost up to $600 million and, for now, there's little 
money in the federal budget to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is in the national security interest of the United States  
to increase U.S. domestic launch capacity,'' said Rep. Christopher 
Cox, R-Calif., chairman of a select House committee that urged an 
increase in U.S. commercial launch capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	That key recommendation was part of the panel's far-reaching  
report in May on technology-transfers to China and alleged nuclear 
espionage by Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
	Cox, in an interview, conceded that his committee ``did not  
refine that recommendation'' in terms of financially achieving the 
goal, including how the costs would be shared between the private 
space industry and government. 
</P>
<P>
	Both chambers of Congress have passed defense spending  
legislation calling for a greater U.S. share in launching 
commercial satellites as part of a package to restrict satellite 
technology transfers. But those measures contain few specifics -- 
and no money. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who is going to pay for it?'' asks Rep. Dana Rorhbacher,  
R-Calif., chairman of the House Science subcommittee on space and 
aviation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rohrbacher's panel, along with other subcommittees from the  
Science and Armed Services committees, is holding a series of joint 
hearings on the subject. A government-industry roundtable is 
planned for the fall ``to see if we can come up with any kind of 
consensus'' on what to do, he added. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are vested interest groups who will thwart any  
restructuring and reform,'' he said. ``And we've also got to 
overcome the inertia of bureaucracy, which can be harder than 
overcoming the force of gravity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, funds for a program for the Air Force to modernize  
its launch operations has suffered from delays and cuts of some 
$100 million over the past four years, the Aerospace Industries 
Association estimates. 
</P>
<P>
	It recently called on Congress to increase spending in 2000 by  
$40 million to automate the radar, computer networks and 
communications equipment associated with launches. 
</P>
<P>
	The Air Force concedes improvements are needed. ``Much range  
equipment is aging and increasingly difficult and expensive to 
operate and maintain,'' said John Borky, vice chairman of the Air 
Force Scientific Advisory Board. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, launching of private-sector satellites is steadily  
increasing, and since 1997 has accounted for more than half of all 
launch payloads. According to the Aerospace Industries Association, 
space launch activity in the United States has increased from 18 
launches in 1988 to 36 launches in 1998. U.S. policy, meanwhile, 
allows former U.S. foes, China, Russia and Ukraine, to each launch 
up to 20 U.S. commercial geostationary satellites a year and an 
unlimited number of orbiting satellites through the end of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
	Some 1,700 satellites are being prepared for launch over the  
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. government, through the Air Force, provides a de  
facto subsidy to commercial launches,'' Borky said. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics say the government recovers 10 percent to 15 percent of  
these costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Davis, former deputy undersecretary of defense for space  
and now a private consultant, said launch ranges should be operated 
like businesses. ``It is time to create private national U.S. 
spaceports,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. policy makers are divided on whether to upgrade Cape  
Canaveral and Vandenberg and keep them under U.S. government 
control or to privatize them. 
</P>
<P>
	Retired Lt. Gen. Richard Henry, who led a study for the Air  
Force space command into launch problems, said many aerospace 
companies use foreign launch sites instead of U.S. government ones 
because of a ``general frustration'' with scheduling delays, 
``antiquated equipment and budget constraints.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among his panel's recommendations: spaceports established and  
operated like airports with launch complexes leased to the launch 
provider. 
</P>
<P>
	Citing a recent spate of launch failures, Henry said, ``One has  
to wonder whether the $3 billion lost in these mishaps could have 
been better spent on building launch vehicles that are more 
reliable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In May, President Clinton ordered an investigation into six  
rocket failures that occurred in fewer than nine months. The failed 
rockets were carrying three military satellites, two commercial 
communications satellites and a privately owned satellite capable 
of taking military-quality pictures of Earth. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa., said there is another problem in  
keeping commercial launches in the United States -- some foreign 
countries require American companies to conduct work onsite in 
order to be involved in the local economy. ``Some of these launches 
are over there because the Chinese are demanding it for access to 
their markets. To some extent, that's also true of Russia.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Congress seems likely to shell out only $7.5 million  
for a short-term fix -- equipment upgrades and more manpower to 
increase commercial launches.

<HEADLINE> Jury Awards Family $4.9B Against GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- In the biggest personal-injury award in U.S.  
history, a jury ordered General Motors Corp. to pay $4.9 billion 
Friday to six people severely burned when the gas tank of their 
1979 Chevrolet Malibu exploded in flames in a rear-end collision. 
</P>
<P>
	The huge verdict came after a 10-week state court trial that  
focused on an internal GM study. The plaintiffs' lawyers said the 
study demonstrated that GM had known for years that the tanks were 
unsafe, but found it cheaper to settle lawsuits than to pay for a 
recall. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury awarded Patricia Anderson, her four children and family  
friend Jo Tigner $107 million in compensatory damages and $4.8 
billion in punitive damages for injuries they suffered in the 1993 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just thank God that me and my kids survived,'' Ms. Anderson  
said. ``I thank him for allowing me to be an example to the public 
to put an end to this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM spokesman Terry Rhadigan said the verdict will be appealed.  
He said the crash was the fault of a drunken driver. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a very severe crash and we estimate the speed of the  
driver who struck this vehicle at 70 mph. Unfortunately they (the 
victims) were sitting still at a stoplight,'' Rhadigan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Harrison, publisher of Lawyers Weekly USA, said the GM award  
is the largest personal injury verdict in the nation's history. 
</P>
<P>
	The enormous punitive award is unlikely to stand on appeal,  
Harrison said. Even with awards in the tens of millions of dollars, 
it is rare for a plaintiff to actually get anything close to the 
jury's verdict, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tigner and the Andersons were driving home from church services  
on Christmas Eve when the Malibu was struck from behind and 
exploded in flames. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the children were burned over 60 percent of their  
bodies. The two adults and remaining child suffered second- and 
third-degree burns over a lesser percentage of their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
	The plaintiffs' lawyers said that the gas tank was placed too  
close to the rear bumper and that a better design would have placed 
it over the axle or incorporated a shield. 
</P>
<P>
	They said GM's own study of the gas tanks showed that it would  
cost $2.40 per auto to settle lawsuits involving deaths. 
Plaintiffs' lawyer Brian Panish said it would have cost $8.59 per 
car to fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the risk of juries holding companies accountable for  
their reprehensible conduct, GM and other automobile manufacturers 
would have little reason to put passengers' safety first,'' Panish 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The current Malibu is a vastly different design from the '79  
model.

<HEADLINE> Network Translates Cancer Language </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- It was supposed to be a routine physical, but  
then Frank Luton's doctor felt the lump. Prostate cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm only 46,'' Luton thought in a panic. ``I thought this was  
an old man's disease.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But as the shock wore off, the Georgia man faced a more  
immediate problem: Doctors were racing him from biopsy to treatment 
decisions, yet he didn't understand his options -- often because the 
doctors used medical jargon that even highly educated laymen, like 
Luton, don't know. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like somebody picked me up out of my real life and  
dropped me onto another planet, where I didn't understand the 
language people spoke,'' Luton recalled. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't have to be a man's experience anymore.  
</P>
<P>
	The National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a collection of top  
cancer hospitals, and the American Cancer Society are translating 
into patient-friendly language the actual cancer 
testing-and-treatment guidelines doctors use -- so that patients can 
better understand their care. 
</P>
<P>
	Just completed: Prostate cancer guidelines.  
</P>
<P>
	They're not only for cancer patients. They also guide healthy  
men facing prostate checkups. 
</P>
<P>
	If I'm a healthy 55-year-old, how often do I need a PSA test? Do  
I also need a rectal exam? 
</P>
<P>
	My doctor ordered a biopsy -- does it hurt?  
</P>
<P>
	Why did my doctor advise radiation instead of surgery?  
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines answer those kinds of questions, offering  
comprehensive information that experts say men have had to struggle 
to find until now. The idea is to help men choose their care, and 
know when they may need a second opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Any well-informed patient should have access to this  
information,'' said Dr. Richard Babaian of M.D. Anderson Cancer 
Center, who helped write the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
	The cancer groups last spring offered similar guidelines for  
breast cancer that proved popular with women. Guidelines for other 
cancers, including colorectal, lung, ovarian and non-Hodgkins 
lymphoma, are planned. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, about 184,000 American men will be diagnosed with  
cancer of the prostate, a walnut-sized gland that sits under the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
	While more than 39,000 of them will die this year, prostate  
cancer often grows very slowly. So just how aggressively to treat 
it is a complex decision based on how advanced the cancer is and 
the man's age and overall health. 
</P>
<P>
	Men seldom consider prostate cancer until the day a doctor  
suggests PSA testing, a blood test that measures a protein that 
rises when cancer is present. 
</P>
<P>
	Annual prostate testing is usually advised for men starting at  
age 50, although black men, who are at higher risk, and men with 
close relatives who had the cancer are urged to get tested sooner. 
</P>
<P>
	The guidelines stress that men given PSA tests also need a  
digital rectal exam, where doctors feel the prostate, because the 
PSA alone isn't perfect. 
</P>
<P>
	Abstain from sexual activity for two days before a PSA test, the  
guidelines advise, because ejaculation could falsely raise PSA 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
	The baldness pill Propecia or the herb saw palmetto could mask  
PSA results so cancer is missed? 
</P>
<P>
	PSA results come in numbers. Less than 4 is normal; higher than  
10 requires a biopsy to check for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But between 4 and 10 has been a gray zone. Often doctors tell  
men their PSA was slightly abnormal but they'll just retest next 
year -- a discomfiting response, Babaian said. The new guidelines 
instead suggest these men get an additional test called the ``free 
PSA,'' which more accurately determines who needs a biopsy and who 
can wait. 
</P>
<P>
	If you do have cancer, the guidelines explain how to pick  
therapy. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, an 80-year-old may be advised not to treat early  
prostate cancer, if doctors determine he's likely to die of heart 
disease before ever having cancer symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
	Other men might choose surgery, radiation, or hormonal  
treatments. Each has different side effects and is considered 
better for different stages of cancer.	   ''You have some time to do adequate research in understanding 
what the situation is, and what your options are,'' advised Luton, 
the Stone Mountain, Ga., man who has survived prostate cancer for 
10 years -- and who helped ensure the guidelines are understandable 
to non-doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	For copies of the guidelines, called 1-888-909-NCCN or  
1-800-ACS-2345; or check http://www.nccn.org on the Internet.

<P>
	SUN VALLEY, Idaho (AP) -- High rollers from Hollywood to Wall  
Street to Silicon Valley converged in this resort town for the 17th 
annual media and technology conference organized by investment 
banker Herbert Allen Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	While stars like Oprah Winfrey and Candice Bergen were on hand,  
the real spotlight this year was on top executives of companies 
like Amazon.com, America Online, and Yahoo! The Internet is 
changing the media and entertainment landscape, and nowhere was 
that more evident than at this year's conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Indeed, missing from this year's list of attendees were Time  
Warner chairman Gerald Levin, Seagram's chief executive Edgar 
Bronfman Jr. and Walt Disney's chairman Michael Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years ago, Eisner and Thomas Murphy, head of Capital Cities  
Communications, got together at the conference and hatched a plan 
to combine their companies in a $19 billion deal. 
</P>
<P>
	Since then, interest and speculation around the annual event has  
soared. This year, however, traditional media companies are more 
likely to be on the prowl for hot Internet properties. 
</P>
<P>
	The conference, which ends Sunday, had a series of discussions  
and seminars aimed at blending new technology with old. One meeting 
on Thursday featured Steve Jobs and his Pixar animation company, 
which gained fame in the movie industry for its role in the making 
of Antz and Toy Story. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the schedule included the topic ``The Internet And

<HEADLINE> Tigers' Pitcher Could Avoid Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Reliever Matt Anderson, sent last month from the  
Detroit Tigers to Triple-A Toledo, has been declared fit for a 
program that could keep felony counts in an Arizona drug case off 
of his record. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, 22, was arrested last October in Scottsdale, Ariz.,  
while playing in the Arizona Fall League. Police said he accepted 
an overnight package containing marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities said the package -- addressed to a name police think  
was fictitious -- contained two packs of marijuana. Todd Larson, a 
Scottsdale police detective who arrested Anderson, said Friday that 
Anderson told him the package had been ordered by his roommate, a 
Tigers prospect who was not home at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was charged with possessing marijuana and  
paraphernalia. His then-roommate has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
	When arrested, according to Larson, Anderson said he had used  
marijuana at least six times, including two days beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month in Maricopa County, Ariz., prosecutors declared  
Anderson fit for a diversion program for first-time drug offenders, 
a worker for that office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	If he completes the six-month program -- in which he could be  
randomly tested for drug use -- no charges will appear on his 
record. Failing to complete the program could mean Anderson could 
be prosecuted for the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	The Maricopa County prosecutor handling Anderson's case could  
not be reached Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson was the first player taken in the 1997 amateur draft  
and signed for a $2.5 million bonus. He spent two months in the 
minors before reaching the majors with a fastball clocked at 103 
mph. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson did not return a message left Friday at the Toledo  
club's front office. 
</P>
<P>
	As a Tigers rookie last season, Anderson went 5-1 with a 3.27  
ERA. This season, he was 1-0 with a 2.18 ERA in his first 19 
appearances, striking out 22 in 20 2-3 innings. But he allowed 11 
runs in three innings during his last five outings with the Tigers 
before being optioned to Toledo.

<HEADLINE> US Oil Cos. Request Travel to Libya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Two U.S. oil companies are seeking permission  
to travel to Libya to survey assets they were forced to leave 
behind because of U.S. economic sanctions, the Treasury Department 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Treasury spokeswoman Beth Weaver said the requests were pending  
before the department's Office of Foreign Assets Control, which 
must decide on travel permits because of a law passed by Congress 
in 1985 to punish Libya for its support of international terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
	Weaver refused to provide the names of the companies involved or  
say when Treasury might rule on the two requests. 
</P>
<P>
	The applications have raised concerns among relatives of the  
victims of the bombing of a Pan Am jetliner over Scotland in 1988. 
They worry it could be one more step toward normalization of 
relations with the government of Moammar Gadhafi. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosemary Wolfe, whose 20-year-old stepdaughter was one of the  
270 people killed in the Pan Am bombing, said approval of the oil 
companies' travel applications would ``send the wrong signal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Why do this now? It is another step in telling Gadhafi 'Don't  
worry. Down the road we will be lifting sanctions,''' said Ms. 
Wolfe, of Alexandria, Va., who is president of Justice for Pan Am 
103. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations in April suspended its seven-year  
restrictions on trade with Libya after Tripoli agreed to hand over 
two of its citizens suspected of blowing up the Pan Am jet over 
Lockerbie, Scotland, for trial by a Scottish court in the 
Netherlands next year. 
</P>
<P>
	American oil companies forced out of Libya in 1986 after  
Congress passed the U.S. sanctions law have also expressed an 
interest in resuming operations in Libya. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in constant dialogue with the State Department about  
what is appropriate,'' said Sondra Fowler, a spokeswoman for Conoco 
in Houston. ``As soon as the government gives us the go-ahead, we 
would very much like to get reconnected with our assets.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said that since leaving Libya 13 years ago, Conoco has had  
to forgo production and sale of 300 million barrels of oil worth $5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Conoco was one of three American oil companies that were part of  
a consortium with the Libyan National Oil Co. The others were 
Marathon Oil and Amerada Hess. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Pyner, a spokesman for Marathon in Houston, said, ``We are  
interested in pursuing our interests in Libya. We are hopeful that 
the lifting of the U.N. sanctions will lead to suspension of the 
U.S. unilateral sanctions so that we can pursue our interests 
there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Ms. Fowler nor Pyner would discuss whether their  
companies had petitioned for the travel permits. Ms. Fowler said 
Conoco wanted to keep the nature of its discussions with U.S. 
government officials confidential. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain this week announced it was restoring normal relations  
with Libya after Tripoli accepted responsibility for the 1984 
shooting death of a British policewoman outside the Libyan embassy 
in London. 
</P>
<P>
	British officials announced they were sending a trade delegation  
to Libya to see if the newly restored diplomatic relations will 
lead to more business for British firms.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged Polygamist Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A judge on Friday sentenced a prominent  
polygamist to up to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence, for 
having sex with his 16-year-old niece. 
</P>
<P>
	Third District Judge David S. Young ordered David Ortell  
Kingston, who is thought to be a leader in Utah's most prominent 
polygamist clan, to serve two consecutive terms of up to five years 
each on conviction for incest and unlawful sexual conduct with a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Young also fined Kingston $10,000 and ordered him to pay court  
expenses. Kingston, 33, mouthed ``I love you'' to his legal wife 
and five children as he was led out of the courtroom in a red 
prison jumpsuit and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted June 3 after his niece testified that she  
married him in a secret ceremony complete with a wedding dress, 
ring and a honeymoon at a Park City hotel. She said that she was 
his 15th wife and that they had sex four times. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Young tried to keep polygamy out of the case.  
But Friday he changed his tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this sentencing, polygamy is an issue,'' he said. To deny  
that is ``sort of like saying that we can ignore the 500-pound 
elephant in the living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case thrust polygamy back into the Utah spotlight and  
already sent Kingston's brother -- the girl's father -- to jail. John 
Daniel Kingston is serving 28 weeks for beating his daughter for 
running away from her uncle. He pleaded no contest to reduced 
charges of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The two brothers are sons of John Ortell Kingston, the late  
leader of the Latter Day Church of Christ, a Mormon splinter group 
with about 1,000 members and a $150 million business empire in six 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston's attorney Susanne Gustin-Furgis said her client is not  
a typical sex offender. She asked the judge to ignore the 
prosecution's recommendation for the maximum, suggesting five 
months of jail time, followed by two years of supervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is a polygamist, as has been alleged, this is really a  
religious practice,'' she said. ``This is not a compulsion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge soon interrupted her as she tried to compare  
Kingston to other sex cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects I believe that Mr. Kingston has been a victim  
of misguided family instruction,'' Young said. But, he added later, 
``He's shown no indication that he knows it was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dane Nolan said that he was pleased with the  
sentence, but insisted Kingston should not be seen as a victim, 
because ``he chose to engage in this lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 25,000 to 35,000 polygamists live in Utah and other  
parts of the West. Most belong to offshoots of the Mormon Church, 
which renounced polygamy in 1890 under pressure from Congress and 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kingston clan stands apart from other polygamous groups,  
former members say, in practicing incest.

<HEADLINE> Bengals Sign Ohio St.'s Rob Murphy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- Rob Murphy, an All-American offensive lineman  
at Ohio State, signed a two-year contract as a free agent with the 
Cincinnati Bengals on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Contract terms weren't disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, who would have been a senior this fall, was dropped from  
Ohio State for poor grades. The 6-foot-5, 300-pound guard was 
passed over Thursday in the NFL supplemental draft, which made him 
eligible to sign with any team as a free agent. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bengals, his hometown team, are trying to rebuild an  
offensive line which had aged and become less effective in recent 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy played at Moeller High School in suburban Cincinnati  
before going to Ohio State. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy, 22, was a starter all three years he played for the  
Buckeyes. He was an AP first-team All-America selection last fall.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Train Hits Truck, Derails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- To Marie Smith, the derailment of  
Amtrak's Sunset Limited was like a bump in the road, no big deal. 
It was much, much worse at the front of the passenger train. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the cars in front of us banging into each other and  
then saw the car in front of us tilt and go flying sideways,'' said 
Ann Johnson, 51, of Glendora, Calif., traveling with her 
21-year-old daughter, Kristen. ``When we looked out the window, we 
saw the engine coming toward us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eighteen of the 235 people aboard were taken to the hospital  
Thursday afternoon after the train collided with a truck at a rural 
crossing about 60 miles west of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, on its way from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., slammed  
into the truck carrying a salt water disposal tank, tearing its two 
engines and eight of 13 cars from the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead locomotive was thrown onto its side, and rescuers broke  
its windshield to pull the engineer and a trainee from the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer was the most seriously injured, and remained  
hospitalized early today with a head injury. David Keith, an 
administrator of the Rice Medical Center, said the man's condition 
was not life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers were released after being treated for minor bumps and  
bruises, joining others on buses bound for Houston, the train's 
next scheduled stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, whom police identified as Jason Bubela, 21,  
was not seriously hurt. Police were looking into potential charges 
against him, but none were immediately filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers in the front of the train fared worst.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, the train jerked back and forth, back and  
forth, and there were big noises,'' said Fatima Talebi, 52, of 
Irvine, Calif. ``I knew something was going to happen. I heard a 
lot of yelling and praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those at the back seemed as if they had been aboard another  
train. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fairly calm,'' said Ms. Smith, 24, of Dublin, Ireland,  
who was seated near the end. ``We just walked to the exit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the uninjured passengers was Cindy McCain, wife of  
Republican presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John McCain, and 
their son, Jack, 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranes tried to right the derailed cars and crews tried to  
repair 800 feet of damaged track to reopen one of the country's 
main east-west rail links. About 28 trains use the track daily, 
railroad officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in  
Amtrak's 28-year history. On Sept. 22, 1993, 42 passengers and five 
crew members died when the train plunged off a bridge into a bayou 
near Mobile, Ala. The bridge had been damaged minutes earlier by a 
towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into a truck at a  
crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more 
than 100.

<HEADLINE> Middle Class Troubled by Bills </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Luanne Shirling didn't think of herself as  
someone on the financial edge. She and her husband had good jobs 
and not much debt and were starting to fix up their house. 
</P>
<P>
	But she didn't have health insurance, and she unexpectedly  
became pregnant. She ended up with complications, a Caesarean 
section and $20,000 in medical bills. Before long, she had missed 
several mortgage payments and even had to use food stamps for a 
short while. 
</P>
<P>
	She's not alone. Some 49 million Americans -- or 20 percent of  
the nation -- had trouble meeting basic needs at least once in 1995. 
That includes paying rent, mortgages, food and utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The poorest, of course, were most likely to have trouble. But  
many, like the Shirlings, are solidly middle class. And 8.1 million 
were in families earning more than $45,700 a year, the Census 
Bureau said in a report being released today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were not really saving when all of a sudden -- bam! -- this  
hit,'' said Mrs. Shirling, of Warrenton, Va., whose family income 
was about $35,000 -- putting them near the national average. ``I 
think a lot of people out there think they're getting by and doing 
fine and don't realize how devastating it can be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, about 19.5 million of those who had trouble meeting  
basic needs had household incomes in the bottom 20 percent of the 
nation, meaning less than $16,800 per year. Another 12.2 million 
were below $30,400. 
</P>
<P>
	But 5.2 million people had incomes above $45,700, and another  
2.9 million were above $68,700 -- in the wealthiest fifth of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts explain that many families with healthy incomes are  
still living close to the financial edge, without enough saved for 
an emergency. It's particularly dangerous for families living in 
expensive cities or carrying large mortgages or personal debt. 
</P>
<P>
	That makes them vulnerable to unexpected financial hits -- a  
layoff or large medical bill, for instance. Or divorce can often 
push a family into financial crisis, with the people who used to 
pay one rent or mortgage now forced to pay two. 
</P>
<P>
	The Census Bureau also asked Americans who would help them if  
they had trouble. More than three in four said they expected to get 
help if they needed it, mostly from family and friends. 
</P>
<P>
	But only 17 percent of those who ran into trouble actually got  
help, mostly from family but also from government. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the difference in who needs help may be family  
stability, said Census demographer Kurt J. Bauman, who wrote the 
report. He noted that the elderly, who often live near the poverty 
line, were the age group least likely to report trouble meeting 
basic needs. But the elderly generally have fixed incomes and 
stable expenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The most vulnerable group was children, who are also the poorest  
Americans. Nearly 30 percent of children lived in a family that had 
trouble meeting basic needs. Blacks and Hispanics were more likely 
to report trouble than whites, as were female-headed families -- all 
groups that are more likely to be poor, as well. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report's more surprising findings dealt with those who  
are not poor, but firmly in the middle class or above. 
</P>
<P>
	The problem is that many of these families do not save enough  
money, said Joanne Kerstetter, president of the Consumer Credit 
Counseling Service, which helps consumers restructure their debt. 
</P>
<P>
	``They haven't been taught how to handle their finances. When  
any type of crisis hits, they don't have savings to fall back on,'' 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 55 percent to 60 percent of households carry some  
credit card debt, said Stephen Brobeck, executive director of the 
Consumer Federation of America. Interest payments and fees quickly 
add up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even small differences can determine whether a lifestyle is  
sustainable or not,'' he said. ``Eventually it catches up with 
them.''

<HEADLINE> Indian Funds Said To Need Oversight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said Friday  
he would welcome a court-appointed advisory committee to oversee 
reforms in the troubled Indian trust funds accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	But he added that responsibility for the accounts should not be  
taken away from his department's Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt testified in a class-action suit brought by a group of  
Indians who claim the government has deprived them and other Indian 
trust account holders of billions of dollars in trust fund proceeds 
over many years because of shoddy and incomplete recordkeeping. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing as the government's closing witness in the month-long  
trial, Babbitt defended his efforts to overhaul management of the 
trust fund and to straighten out the quagmire of shoddy and 
incomplete records used to keep track of the more than 300,000 
personal Indian trust accounts valued at more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	When questioned by the plaintiffs' lawyer, Babbitt acknowledged  
that his plan, unveiled a year ago, would not resolve all of the 
problems with the complex trust fund accounting system. ``It's a 
working document,'' he said, although insisting, ``If all of these 
things get done, we're almost there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The trial, limited to issue on how to correct problems in the  
trust fund system, is winding toward conclusion with Babbitt 
expected to be questioned further in an unusual Saturday session. 
Final arguments are likely next week, although it's uncertain when 
a ruling will be made. 
</P>
<P>
	A separate trial will address the issue of whether the  
government must reimburse Indians any money. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress directed in 1994 that the management problems be  
corrected. Babbitt said despite past problems he is ``confident we 
are heading toward a safe harbor of compliance'' and vowed to have 
a better accounting system in place when he leaves office in 
January, 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	But the plaintiffs in the class-action lawsuit are asking U.S.  
District Judge Royce Lamberth to appoint a special master to take 
over the program long run by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and 
eventually turn management of the accounts over to a private 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The BIA has a poor track record,'' Elouise Cobell, a member of  
the Blackfeet Nation and the lead plaintiff in the case, said 
during a break in the trial Friday. She said that she has no 
confidence in Babbitt moving aggressively to correct the problems. 
</P>
<P>
	Cobell said that the government, in addition to straightening  
out the trust fund records should reimburse Indian account holders 
the money that has been lost over the years because of the poor 
record keeping. ``It's at least into the billions of dollars,'' she 
maintained, although the government has argued such estimates are 
broad exaggerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt, wrapping up his testimony before cross-examination,  
urged that the court ``not run the (trust fund) system'' but still 
assert some involvement through a court-appointed ``advisory 
committee that would resolve disputes. Lamberth did not respond to 
the suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
	The government has acknowledged the Indian accounts are in  
disarray. Incomplete receipts and disbursement records are 
scattered in more than 100 BIA offices and many of the accounts are 
only a few dollars -- a few pennies in some cases -- because holdings 
over the years have been splintered as inheritances moved through 
generations of Indian families. 
</P>
<P>
	The money comes from rent, royalties and other income from 11  
million acres of land owned by individual Indians, many of whom are 
very poor. The lawsuit address only accounts held by individuals. 
The BIA also controls an additional $2.5 billion in trust funds 
that belong to tribes, but that is not at issue in the case. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt has argued that the problems with the trust accounts go  
back decades and that he has made progress in correcting the 
problems. Recently the Interior Department installed a $60 million 
computer system aimed at better management of the accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt in daylong testimony outlined how he had attempted to  
deal with the vexing problems with the trust fund accounts, but 
maintained he was stymied because of friction between a special 
trustee for trust fund reform and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	The trustee, Paul Homan, resigned last January after Babbitt  
moved to reorganize his office. Homan, a former bank executive and 
federal bank regulator who had been appointed by President Clinton, 
accused Babbitt of trying to undercut his authority. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt admitted clashing with Homan, but said he decided to  
reorganize the office because Homan's approach wasn't working ``and 
there was a federal district judge looking over my shoulder'' 
because of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had quite different views,'' Babbitt said of Homan, whom he  
described as having a ``disdain for the BIA. He was right up front 
about that.'' Babbitt said while Homan made clear he felt the BIA 
was incapable of correcting the management problems with the trust 
account, he believes removing the accounts from the agency would 
result in a backlash from Indian tribes. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the love-hate relationship they (the tribes) view the  
Bureau of Indian Affairs as their imperfect piece of the 
government,'' Babbitt told the court.

<HEADLINE>  Six Injured in Running of Bulls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PAMPLONA, Spain (AP) -- Six people including an American were  
gored by bulls Friday as more than 1,000 revelers ran through the 
streets of Pamplona during the third day of the annual San Fermin 
Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
	Justin Hammerback, 32, of Chicago, was hospitalized with a  
6-inch wound to his buttocks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Canadian man, Robert Stodola, was treated and released after  
being gored in his right elbow, and an Australian man was 
hospitalized with a gash in his thigh. Three Spaniards were also 
hospitalized with injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	Many others were trampled -- either by the stampeding bulls or  
their fellow runners -- during the race along the 825-yard route 
from the corral to the city's bullring. 
</P>
<P>
	One bull became separated from the pack and knocked a runner to  
the ground, ripping off his trouser leg. The bull finished the run 
with the remains of the trousers still stuck to his left horn. 
</P>
<P>
	The early-morning runs, or ``encierros'' as they are known in  
Spanish, are the highlight of the eight-day San Fermin Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
	Thousands of people test their bravery and agility by running  
alongside six fighting bulls and a handful of accompanying steers 
as they are herded from the corral to the bullring. 
</P>
<P>
	The bulls are invariably killed by professional matadors in  
bullfights later each day during the fiesta in this northern city. 
</P>
<P>
	The centuries-old festival, which features nonstop street  
partying, became internationally famous with Ernest Hemingway's 
1926 novel ``The Sun Also Rises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 10,000 Americans are among the tens of thousands of  
foreigners who flock to the northern Spanish city each year for the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
	Overcrowding, and the fact that many of the runners spend the  
night drinking, has made the runs more dangerous year by year. 
About 13 runners have been killed and more than 200 injured since 
records began being kept in 1924. The last fatality was an American 
in 1995, the first death since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Yellowstone Sewage System Strained </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo. (AP) -- Standing on historic  
Fishing Bridge, Cathy Cooper took in the view -- North America's 
largest mountain lake behind her, the longest undammed river in the 
country below her and majestic mountains of the world's first 
national park all around her. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of miles away, hidden along a service road, hundreds of  
thousands of gallons of treated sewage water were being dumped into 
a meadow. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess if I was close enough to where they put the sewage  
out, that would affect me,'' said Ms. Cooper, a camper from Twin 
Falls, Idaho. ``But it's still Yellowstone -- that's why I came 
here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ground water entering aged sewage pipes forced the National Park  
Service to dump 6.5 million gallons of treated sewage over a 15-day 
period last month. 
</P>
<P>
	The dumping was necessary to prevent failure of a system that  
treats sewage from crowded campgrounds and other visitor 
facilities, officials said. Last year, raw sewage leaked into 
Yellowstone Lake and into a creek near Old Faithful in separate 
incidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellowstone's exploding geysers, soothing hot springs, majestic  
mountains, abundant wildlife and roaring rivers lure 30,000 people 
a day this time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	``The park is one of the biggest towns in Wyoming in the  
summer,'' said Tim Hudson, the park's chief of maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
	The strain of 3 million annual visitors who create 270 million  
gallons of waste -- and use up to 18 rolls of paper a day per toilet 
-- has overwhelmed Yellowstone's antiquated plumbing system. 
</P>
<P>
	On July 2, several thousand gallons of raw sewage spilled into a  
meadow near Upper Falls. Park staff members discovered the broken 
line in an unstable geologic slump and shut it down. None of the 
raw sewage reached any water sources. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're always Band-Aiding,'' Hudson said. ``Some of those  
Band-Aids break, and that's when we have those problems.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service has identified 142 water and sewer problems in  
the park that would cost about $30 million to repair -- slightly 
more than the park's annual budget. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's probably the best example of how parks are being  
neglected for their infrastructure and how their infrastructure is 
falling apart,'' said Jerome Uher, spokesman for the private 
National Parks and Conservation Association, which this spring 
ranked Yellowstone among the top 10 most endangered parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Three of the park's six sewage treatment plants need to be  
replaced. Flush toilets at Norris Geyser Basin are inoperable 
because the Norris treatment plant has been shut down. Another 
plant is close to failing and the third, at Old Faithful, is to be 
replaced by 2003 for about $5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``You think of this as a very natural place, then you hear of  
things like that and you realize it isn't,'' said visitor Dina 
Brennan of Chippewa Falls, Wis. ``You would think this would be a 
top priority.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service says it has a $5 billion backlog of repairs and  
maintenance projects at its 378 parks. Besides sewer problems, 
Yellowstone needs $300 million in road repairs alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Uher said there is plenty of blame to go around in Washington:  
The Park Service lacks the management and business acumen in its 
hierarchy to detail its needs to Congress; Congress is aware of the 
general problem but there is no single leader to take up the parks' 
cause; and the Clinton administration has concentrated on 
high-profile projects that get headlines while eschewing day-to-day 
infrastructure problems. 
</P>
<P>
	The Park Service says it doesn't have enough money to fix the  
backlog of problems and maintain a park system that already demands 
some $1.5 billion in funding. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., said Congress has increased the  
agency's funding in the last couple of years and it is up to the 
agency to set priorities on what problems it must fix first. 
</P>
<P>
	Yellowstone's sewage problems threaten the very environment it  
was created in 1872 to preserve, but there are many other parks in 
need, said David Barna, the Park Service's chief spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you going to pick between the drums and guns of  
Gettysburg versus the bells at Independence Hall versus 
Yellowstone?'' Barna said. ``They are all in need. It's just very 
difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mike Clark, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone  
Coalition, a conservation group, said Congress should make a 
special appropriation just to fix Yellowstone's sewage system. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yellowstone ought to be looked at as a model of how the park  
system operates, and yet what we got is raw sewage potentially 
going into pristine waters,'' he said. ``That's simply not the way 
to do things.''

<HEADLINE> State Dept Gives Runners Advice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Here's a piece of advice, straight from the  
U.S. government, for any Americans running with the bulls of 
Pamplona: Keep your sneakers tied and your medical insurance up to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given today's security environment, no American can be  
considered safe from raging bulls,'' State Department spokesman 
James Foley said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Foley issued a few tongue-in-cheek recommendations for U.S.  
runners after at least one American was injured amid six stampeding 
bulls at the San Fermin Fiesta follies in Pamplona, Spain. Bruises 
have been the worst of the runners' injuries so far for the daily 
event, which continues through July 14. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you find yourself in a crowd of frenzied four-footed  
foreigners ... make sure your sneakers are tied, your valuables are 
safely stowed in your neck pouch and your medical insurance is 
thoroughly up to date,'' Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
	The centuries-old festival, which features a nonstop street  
party, became famous with the 1926 publication of Ernest 
Hemingway's novel ``The Sun Also Rises.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overcrowding has made the runs extremely dangerous. Since record  
keeping began in 1924, 13 runners have been killed and more than 
200 injured by the bulls. The last fatality was an American in 
1995, the first death since 1980.

<HEADLINE> Asian Central Bankers See Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asia is showing signs of recovery from its  
economic crisis, but reforms are needed to ensure a real return to 
financial health, central bankers said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are certain risks that the recovery will not be  
sustained,'' said Joseph Yam, the head of the Hong Kong Monetary 
Authority, after central bankers from the East Asia and Pacific 
region held a closed-door meeting that lasted much of the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Stock markets around Asia have been soaring in recent weeks,  
though some analysts worry that traders have been unrealistic about 
the prospects for a rebound in some economies. Some blue chip 
indexes have returned to levels unseen since the Asian crisis 
spread in the autumn of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers spent much of their time talking about Japan, the  
biggest economy in Asia that has been mired in recession, Yam told 
a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan needs more fiscal stimulus to restart its economy and  
reform its financial systems if it is to resume its place as the 
growth engine for the region, the bankers said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers said they were basically satisfied with the work  
Asian nations have done to prepare for Year-2000 bug computer 
glitches, but Yam said governments must now focus on boosting 
public confidence. 
</P>
<P>
	The bankers said they would like to see greater disclosure of  
the movement of private funds moving through the region, although 
the details of setting up a monitoring system are tricky. 
</P>
<P>
	``As to how we could achieve that is another matter,'' Yam said.  
``There is need for further discussion.''

<HEADLINE> Heat Relief Assistance Considered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORRANCE, Calif. (AP) -- President Clinton directed federal  
health officials Friday to determine which states might require 
federal aid to help low-income people keep cool during the summer 
heat wave. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that after experiencing blazing temperatures during  
this week's poverty tour, he asked the officials to canvass the 
need for emergency assistance through the Low-Income Home Energy 
Assistance Program. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Kharfen, a Health and Human Services Department  
spokesman in Washington, said HHS and White House officials this 
weekend will contact states that have suffered ``serious heat 
waves'' and report back to the president Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	The energy assistance program helps low-income people pay high  
utility bills resulting from increased home use of air conditioners 
and heating systems. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately clear which states would be eligible or  
how much the emergency heat relief would cost, though the recent 
heat wave has mostly affected the East and South. 
</P>
<P>
	A similar action to provide heat relief aid in 1997 in Texas and  
the Midwest cost $100 million, Kharfen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Eligibility is calculated through a formula measuring population  
and the number of days the temperature in a state is above the 
norm, he said.

<HEADLINE> War on Poverty Yields Few Victories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Like President Clinton, who has just finished  
a four-day poverty tour, President Johnson made a swing through the 
nation in 1964, allowing TV cameras to give comfortable Americans a 
glimpse of life in the poorest pockets of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	He considered the trip in 1964 while on the phone with Alex  
Rose, a union leader in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I could have a tour organized -- just go to the most  
poverty-stricken places in New York and let the press follow me and 
let me go there and visit with the people,'' Johnson said, 
according to transcripts of his White House tapes. ``Yeah, maybe 
I'll go out into Harlem. ... Maybe I'll go somewhere where we have 
the real slums and the lowest living conditions so we dramatize.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The publicity promoted Johnson's ``War on Poverty.'' But while  
the anti-poverty programs begun in the 1960s helped lift the 
incomes of millions of individuals above the poverty line, they and 
other initiatives since have had less success nurturing economic 
revival in impoverished places. 
</P>
<P>
	That's what Clinton aims to do. But historically, more progress  
has been made among poor people than poor places. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was never a war on poverty,'' said Housing Secretary  
Andrew Cuomo, who went with Clinton on his poverty tour. ``Maybe 
there was a skirmish on poverty for a brief period of time. We have 
done the broad people-based programs -- Social Security, Medicaid, 
welfare. But we have never done intensive geographically targeted 
work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said these ignored areas of America are the untapped  
markets of tomorrow. He wants Congress to give tax incentives, tax 
credits and loan guarantees to people who invest there. But the 
president had barely left Appalachia this week when cynicism began 
to seep into conversations in Barbourville, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the Clinton visit took people by surprise that he  
would come here, but I think now that it's over,'' said local 
historian Michael Mills, ``there's more people saying now `What 
will be the result? Will anything REALLY happen that's tangible 
because of his visit?''' 
</P>
<P>
	No, according to critics of Clinton's poverty initiative.  
</P>
<P>
	``You know how many times we've saved Appalachia?'' said Robert  
Rector, analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Doug Besharov, scholar at the American Enterprise Institute,  
said government money given to communities is sometimes spent 
unwisely. If it does improve people's status, they often pack up 
and move out, he said. ``I would aim for a people strategy, not a 
place strategy,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Poverty experts agree, however, that many programs aimed at  
helping individuals have worked. 
</P>
<P>
	When LBJ declared a war on poverty in his 1964 State of the  
Union address, 19 percent of the population was living in poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1997 -- the most recent data available -- that number had  
fallen to 13.3 percent of the population. That's one of every seven 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	Social Security drastically reduced the poverty rate among the  
elderly. Still, the poverty rate for children remains near 20 
percent, a bare improvement from Johnson's day. 
</P>
<P>
	Former Peace Corps Director Sargent Shriver was Johnson's ``Mr.  
Poverty.'' Many of the programs launched then remain today -- 
Medicare, Medicaid, Head Start and Job Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	Their efforts, however, stalled during the Vietnam War.  
Confidence in the government's ability to solve social problems 
waned. By the time Ronald Reagan became president, many Americans 
agreed with him that the government had gotten too big and 
solutions should come from the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Reagan said the war on poverty was a failure,''  
Shriver said in an interview. ``It was not a great success, that's 
true, because we didn't have the money. I told Lyndon Johnson 
myself that we needed two or three times the money we had to 
overcome the problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The problem has been the government's competing agendas, said  
Peter Dreier, a public policy professor at Occidental College in 
Los Angeles. While funds are spent to revitalize cities, the 
government built the federal highway system that made it possible 
for people and business to move out. The Federal Housing 
Administration focused its mortgage loans on middle-class 
homeowners in the suburbs, he said. Tax policies lured shopping 
malls, manufacturing centers and industrial parks to suburbia. 
</P>
<P>
	``All the programs that have sought to bring business and jobs  
into the poor areas have been swimming against the tide of the 
federal government's other policies, which have encouraged an 
exodus of business and middle-class people from those areas,'' 
Dreier said. 
</P>
<P>
	That's the idea behind Clinton's poverty plan, Cuomo said.  
</P>
<P>
	``If we can seduce the private sector with tax benefits the way  
we seduced them to the suburbs, if we can seduce them to these 
areas by infrastructure work, roads, houses etc. ... then that's a 
legitimate role for government,'' Cuomo said.

<HEADLINE> Brothers Arraigned in Gay Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	REDDING, Calif. (AP) -- Two brothers were arraigned Friday on  
stolen property charges connected to the shooting of a gay couple, 
whose deaths are being investigated as a possible hate crime. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29,  
were arrested late Wednesday in a shopping mall parking lot in Yuba 
City, sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson said Friday. Both were armed 
and one was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arraigned on charges of receiving stolen property.  
Prosecutors did not identify the alleged stolen property, but said 
it was connected to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Matson 50, and Winfield Scott Mowder, 40, were found shot  
in their bed July 1 in their home on five acres they owned in tiny 
Happy Valley, about 180 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the victims and the suspects knew each other.  
</P>
<P>
	Officers said there was no sign of forced entry, and would not  
say if anything of value had been taken. Matson's Toyota station 
wagon was gone, and police found it Wednesday about 50 miles south 
of the murder scene near Yuba City. 
</P>
<P>
	``The brothers were in the landscape business and one of the  
victims worked in a nursery at a big store and the other was a 
horticulturist at a local arboretum,'' Richardson said. ``We think 
that's how they crossed paths.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Richardson said officers found ``extremist type publications''  
at the brothers' home, indicating a belief in white supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
	Nursery owner Ed Smith said he employed Matthew Williams (both  
brothers went by their middle names) for about six months before 
Williams decided to sell plants on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a very bright individual, with very strong (religious)  
views, very strong,'' he said. ``I certainly, certainly hope it's 
not true.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Others were also surprised.  
</P>
<P>
	``Not the Matt that used to sell plants?'' said Margaret Jensen  
of the Good Work Organic Farm. ``Wow! He seemed like a very nice 
young man. That would be too, too strange.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mowder worked part-time in the Orchard Supply Hardware nursery  
in Redding while attending college at Chico State University. 
Matson co-founded Carter House Natural Science Museum and the 
Redding Arboretum. They were working together on an Internet site 
where they sold plants by mail. 
</P>
<P>
	``They had more of a zest for life that anyone that I know,''  
said Heidi Hatcher, a friend of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
	Matson's brother, Roger, found the couple in their home. He went  
to their house after getting a message on his answering machine 
from his brother, according to Lt. Bradd McDannold, who refused to 
say what was on the message.

<HEADLINE> All-Star Managers Want More Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Both Joe Torre and Bruce Bochy admit that  
several worthwhile players were left off the All-Star teams they 
will manage in next Tuesday night's game at Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Their solution is simple. Let the leagues bring more players.  
</P>
<P>
	All-Star rosters increased last year from 28 players to 30.  
Torre, who is managing the American League for the second time in 
three years, and Bochy, managing the NL for the first time, both 
would like the limit lifted to 35. 
</P>
<P>
	With elected starters expected to play three innings, it is  
increasingly difficult to squeeze 30 players into the game. Adding 
five more would just complicate that task even more, That is not 
the point, Torre said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting there, being there and recognized is the most  
important thing,'' he said. ``There are so many deserving players 
not on the club. I know Bruce is aching the same way I am.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he wrestled with several choices and was forced to  
leave deserving players off the roster. He pointed to Kansas City, 
where he chose pitcher Jose Rosado at the expense of catcher Mike 
Sweeney, outfielder Jermaine Dye and infielder Johnny Damon. 
</P>
<P>
	He left off perennial stars Edgar Martinez and Alex Rodriguez of  
Seattle and passed on Toronto's Carlos Delgado, all close calls, 
and was torn most of all by having to pass on Baltimore designated 
hitter Harold Baines. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was so tough with the great years he's had, with his  
reputation, to have to leave him off the team,'' Torre said. ``He's 
been around a long time and he's putting up terrific numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baines was batting .341 with 18 home runs and 60 RBIs as  
Baltimore's designated hitter going into Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy experienced the same problem filling out the NL team.  
</P>
<P>
	``I knew it would be difficult,'' he said. ``When you try to  
figure it out, you start thinking about players who deserve to go 
but you don't have a spot for them. It was a little tougher than I 
thought.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bochy said his toughest calls came assembling his pitching staff  
and passing on relievers like Armando Benitez of the New York Mets, 
Jeff Shaw of Los Angeles and John Rocker of Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Position players he had to pass on included outfielders Roger  
Cedeno of New York, leading the NL in stolen bases, and Henry 
Rodriguez of Chicago, the league's No. 4 hitter. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Mets were tough,'' he said. ``Their infield (John) Olerud,  
(Edgardo) Alfonzo, (Rey) Ordonez and (Robin) Ventura, all could 
have made it. But because of the parameters, they were left off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All-Star regulations require that every team have at least one  
representative on the team. By adding five more roster spots, Torre 
and Bochy said deserving players could be acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
	Torre said he was looking forward to Monday night's home run  
hitting contest in Boston's Fenway Park, where the close-in Green 
Monster should be an appealing target for sluggers like Jose 
Canseco, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``As high as those guys hit them, that should be a pretty  
awesome sight going over the Green Monster in left field,'' he 
said.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Secretary West Will Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veterans Affairs Secretary Togo West Jr.,  
under criticism from veterans' groups and under fire for his 
handling of travel funds, said Friday that he will step down before 
the Clinton presidency ends. He did not said when he will go. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not anticipate serving 'til the end of the  
administration,'' West told reporters Friday in Schuylerville, 
N.Y., where he was attending a dedication ceremony for the new 
Saratoga National Cemetery. ``What does that mean? Well, it doesn't 
mean that I have submitted my resignation. I have not, nor has it 
been requested.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some veterans groups, including the Disabled American Veterans,  
have criticized West for not pushing the administration to put more 
money in its budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
	No budget increases are planned for the VA in the fiscal year  
starting Oct. 1. President Clinton's budget request includes $18 
billion to provide medical care for America's veterans; some 
veterans groups say the figure should be at least $21 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	West has defended his work on the budget.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't cut the budget,'' West said. ``I haven't advocated  
cutting the budget. I haven't even advocated a flat line. I've 
advocated increasing it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The former Army secretary and Washington lobbyist, who plans to  
return to private life, would not say when he will resign. But he 
told reporters he will stay through fiscal year 2000 and long 
enough to advise Clinton on the budget for fiscal 2001. 
</P>
<P>
	``After that, I will consider that I have discharged some  
important responsibilities and can begin to consider myself,'' West 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Staying on to formulate the fiscal 2001 budget could mean  
staying until fall, when the agency is expected to submit that 
budget request to the White House, said Dennis Cullinan, 
legislative director for the Veterans of Foreign Wars. Or it could 
mean staying at least until February, when Clinton submits his 2001 
budget to Congress, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	John Sommer, executive director of the American Legion, said his  
group does not fault West for stagnant appropriations. West has 
repeatedly gone to the Office of Management and Budget and the 
White House to explain the agency's budget needs, Sommer said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he left a breakfast meeting with West on Thursday  
thinking that the secretary would not leave any time soon. ``I 
don't anticipate that he's going anywhere until sometime next year, 
if then,'' Sommer said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Harnage, national president of the American Federation of  
Government Employees, which represents 125,000 VA employees 
nationwide, said any time is a good time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would suggest that if he wasn't asked to leave, I think he  
thought it was coming,'' Harnage said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it was a mistake to put a general in charge of the VA.  
It's been a long time since a general had to stand in line or sit 
several hours in a waiting room waiting for treatment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harnage has been fighting for pay increases for VA nurses and  
against expected job cutbacks at VA hospitals and other medical 
service centers. He criticized West for running the VA as if he 
were still in the Army and for riding in a limousine with an 
``entourage that would put the vice president's to shame,'' Harnage 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	At a congressional hearing in April, Sen. Christopher Bond,  
R-Mo., chairman of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that 
oversees the VA, raised allegations of possible mismanagement at 
the agency. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm very disturbed about what appears to be a pattern of  
inappropriate practices at the highest level of the department,'' 
Bond said. ``We have heard numerous allegations about waste, 
excessive travel expenditures, the hiring of limousines, chartered 
aircraft, lavish parties ... and other actions which may or may not 
be illegal but certainly raise eyebrows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The VA inspector general is investigating West's use of travel  
funds, but an aide in Bond's office said a report would not be 
completed for at least a month. After Friday's dedication ceremony, 
West ignored reporters' questions about whether he was under 
investigation for misusing travel funds.

<HEADLINE> Cold Forces Opera Star To Cancel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HAMILTON, Ontario (AP) -- The second time wasn't the charm for  
opera fans in this Lake Ontario steel city. Luciano Pavarotti 
canceled a concert here in February because of a cold, and now he 
has canceled the make-up concert for the same reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``His doctors have advised him not to sing on Sunday and as a  
result Mr. Pavarotti feels he cannot perform his best for his fans 
in Hamilton and throughout Canada,'' his promoter, the Rudas 
Organization, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gabe Macaluso, spokesman for Copps Coliseum where the tenor was  
to perform, said there was no indication Pavarotti would reschedule 
a third time. 
</P>
<P>
	About 14,000 people -- some of whom paid as much as $240 for a  
ticket -- were expected to attend Sunday's show. It was arranged 
after Pavarotti backed out of a Feb. 14 performance -- minutes 
before the curtain was to rise -- when he came down with a cold. 
</P>
<P>
	Refunds will be given for the tickets.  
</P>
<P>
	Pavarotti is scheduled to sing at a Three Tenors concert with  
Placido Domingo and Jose Carreras at Detroit's Tiger Stadium on 
July 17. The tenor's next scheduled opera performance is in 
``Tosca'' at New York's Metropolitan Opera on Oct. 14.

<HEADLINE> Federal Judge Oliver Gasch Dies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Oliver Gasch, a long-time federal judge who  
presided over the trial of Lyndon Johnson's top Senate aide and who 
later ruled that President Carter had violated the Constitution, 
died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasch died following heart surgery at Georgetown University  
Hospital. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
	Active in Republican politics, Gasch was appointed a federal  
judge in 1965 by the Democratic President Johnson. Four years later 
he presided over the influence peddling trial of Senate Secretary 
Bobby Baker, who had been Johnson's top aide in the Senate. Baker 
was convicted and sentenced to one to three years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasch also presided over the government corruption trials of  
Rep. Charles C. Diggs Jr., D-Mich., and Rep. Daniel J. Flood, 
R-Pa., in the 1970s. In the case against Carter, he ruled that the 
president violated the Constitution in unilaterally terminating a 
mutual defense treaty between the United States and Taiwan. That 
decision was reversed by an appeals court.

<HEADLINE> Duke Energy Plans Gas Pipeline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Duke Energy will build and operate a $1.3  
billion natural gas pipeline to markets in the Southeast. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sawgrass Energy Transmission System will have a capacity of  
about 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and will begin 
near Coden, Ala., cross southern Mobile Bay and continue into the 
Florida Panhandle and down the peninsula, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke plans to have it in service by 2003. Customers will include  
electric generation facilities, as well as large industrial and gas 
distribution customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida's projected need for new generating plants over the next  
10 years has risen 20 percent over 1997 estimates, Duke said, 
making it the fastest-growing market in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke Energy is headquartered in Charlotte and has more than $26  
billion in assets worldwide. It provides electric service to some 2 
million customers in North and South Carolina and operates other 
gas pipelines.

<HEADLINE> Hate Crimes Summit Planned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Supporters of legislation to expand federal  
hate crimes law will meet at the White House next week, a little 
more than a week after a shooting spree targeted at minorities. A 
similar bill died last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Bills introduced in the House and Senate would give the federal  
government a stronger hand in investigating and prosecuting acts of 
hatred motivated by sexual orientation, gender and disability. 
</P>
<P>
	``The federal government can't continue to sit on the  
sidelines,'' said Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., who is sponsoring a 
bill with Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa. ``With each new tragedy, it 
becomes more and more difficult for Congress to claim there's no 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of dozens of civil rights groups are scheduled  
to meet with senior White House aides on Monday to discuss lobbying 
for that bill and a similar one introduced in the House, said 
Richard Socarides, President Clinton's civil rights advisor. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters believe there's less opposition to the bill than  
there was a year ago. Senate backers hope to attach the bill as an 
amendment to other legislation with a good chance of passage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the prospect for the bills now are better now. These  
regrettable incidents demonstrate why they are necessary,'' 
Socarides said. ``With each publicized incident more and more 
pressure is put on the opposition and those who say that this is 
not a problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Authorities say two people were killed and nine others injured  
in Illinois and Indiana during the Fourth of July weekend, 
apparently by a white supremacist who committed suicide Sunday 
after a police chase. 
</P>
<P>
	Socarides said planning for Monday's meeting began before the  
shootings, and the push for the law was inspired by a string of 
incidents, including the dragging death of a black man in Texas and 
the fatal beating of Matthew Shepard, a homosexual Wyoming college 
student who was lashed to a fence in October. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate bills would add acts of hatred motivated by  
sexual orientation, gender and disability to the list of hate 
crimes already covered by federal law, such as those acts sparked 
by prejudice based on race, religion, color or national origin. 
</P>
<P>
	The change would allow states and local governments to ask the  
federal government to help in investigating and prosecuting those 
crimes. Federal officials also would be able to intervene if they 
believe that a state or local government is not pursuing a hate 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
	The bills also would expand the definition of hate crimes. Under  
current law, the federal government may step in only if the crime 
in question occurred on federal property or during a federally 
protected activity, such as while a victim was voting or going to 
school. 
</P>
<P>
	Legislation now moving through Congress would loosen that  
definition to include any incident with a connection to interstate 
commerce -- use of a gun manufactured in another state, for example. 
</P>
<P>
	Opponents say the bill is unnecessary because states have not  
avoided prosecuting such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics also say the bill itself would discriminate by creating  
special classes of victims such as gays, would greatly expand the 
federal government's power and jurisdiction and would have a 
``chilling effect'' on free speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't need more laws. What we need is stricter enforcement  
of the laws we have,'' said Janet Parshall, spokeswoman for the 
conservative Family Research Council. ``Those who believe we need 
to federalize legislation on hate crimes are in fact lobbying for 
super prosecution for certain kinds of crimes as opposed to 
succinct application of the law in all crimes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But a spokesman for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights  
political group, said the bill simply provides more resources to 
fight violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has nothing to do with thought police and first-amendment  
rights,'' David Smith said. ``It has everything to do with 
protecting people from these violent crimes.''

<HEADLINE> Even in Bull Market, Yields Matter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- In these days of fast-moving securities markets,  
you practically never hear the terms ``mutual fund'' and ``yield' 
in the same sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	When prices of stocks and bonds are rocking and rolling the way  
they do these days, who cares what current yield a fund produces 
from the interest and dividends paid on the securities it owns? 
</P>
<P>
	Fund advisers always preach that what matters is total return --  
the combined result of income plus appreciation, or depreciation, 
in the net asset value per share. 
</P>
<P>
	There's no disputing that NAV fluctuations have been the big  
story in recent years. Check out the wide swings in the performance 
of the average general bond fund, as tracked by the research firm 
of Morningstar Inc.: Up 9.45 percent in 1993, down 2.92 percent in 
1994, up 15.64 percent in 1995, up 3.63 percent in 1996, up 8.25 
percent in 1997, and up 6.86 percent in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the first five months of this year, average general bond  
fund performance turned negative again, with a loss of 0.71 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	But while the world watches prices in the markets bouncing up  
and down, yields quietly make a big difference. Last year, for 
instance, they accounted for almost all of the positive return a 
typical bond-fund investor received. 
</P>
<P>
	For investors who depend on regular payouts from their assets to  
meet their day-to-day living expenses, the importance of yields is 
constant, no matter what is happening with market prices. 
</P>
<P>
	Even in the current environment of relatively low interest  
rates, by the standards of the past 30 years or so, yield 
differences can be surprisingly wide among the choices available to 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
	``The popular view is that current yields are relatively  
uniform, that there aren't great yield differences among maturies 
or even among asset classes,'' says Norman Fosback, editor-in-chief 
of the newsletter Income Fund Outlook in Deerfield Beach, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	But actually, Fosback says, ``the true range of yields is  
many-fold. Some junk bond funds sport yields significantly more 
than 9 percent and many banks and thrifts offer yields as little as 
2 percent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Of course, there are also big differences in the risks that go  
with these investments. Experts can tell you their opinion about 
relative risk-reward ratios -- for example, arguing that junk-bond 
yields are currently so much higher than those of safer 
alternatives that they are worth the extra risk. 
</P>
<P>
	After that, it's up to individual investors to decide what point  
along the scale of risk and reward best corresponds to their needs 
and temperaments. 
</P>
<P>
	You don't have to go to extremes either way to find yield  
differences worth heeding. A money-market mutual fund currently 
yielding, say, 4.4 percent, is not drastically riskier than a bank 
money-market deposit account yielding, say, 3 percent (even though 
the bank account is covered by federal deposit insurance and the 
money fund isn't). 
</P>
<P>
	As of late June, said Fosback, an average mutual fund investing  
in short-term corporate bonds offered a yield of about 5.6 percent, 
besting one-year certificates of deposit (4.4 percent) by more than 
a percentage point and three-month CDs (3.8 percent) by almost two 
percentage points. 
</P>
<P>
	Then there's the comparative edge that funds investing in  
tax-exempt municipal bonds have lately enjoyed over comparable 
funds that invest in taxable corporate or government bonds. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, muni-bond yields have hovered a bit above 90 percent of  
taxable bond yields. That makes them relatively appealing to 
typical investors whose 28 percent marginal tax bracket means they 
must pay 28 cents of each extra dollar they earn on taxable 
investments to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the numbers cited above have been category averages. If  
you do some comparison-shopping among individual funds and 
financial institutions, you may well find choices that give you 
even greater yield advantages. 
</P>
<P>
	There's a potential bonus in all this for many people's  
investment plans: The slow-and-steady yield component of a 
portfolio can serve as a valuable stabilizer any time market 
fluctuations go against you.

<HEADLINE> Trucker in Amtrak Accident Ran Sign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- The tractor trailer involved in an  
Amtrak accident that injured dozens of people ran a stop sign 
before it was struck, investigators said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was headed from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla.,  
when it slammed into a truck Thursday, tossing 10 of its 13 cars 
off the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty of the 235 passengers and an engineer were injured. Most  
were treated for bumps and bruises. Four people who remained in a 
hospital overnight had been released by Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	``He saw the train coming, but it was too late,'' Department of  
Public Safety spokesman Tom Vinger said of 21-year-old truck driver 
David Bubela. ``Apparently he did try to brake at some point. ... 
We think in essence he ran the stop sign.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bubela was pulling a saltwater disposal tank. There were no  
warning lights or gates at the rural crossing about 62 miles west 
of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Vinger said Bubela will be charged on Monday with failure to  
stop for an approaching train. He faces possible citations for 
failure to have a log book and an equipment violation for faulty 
brakes. An attorney for Bubela's employer declined comment.

<HEADLINE> Adopted Pets to Get Microchips </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	OMAHA, Neb. (AP) -- Pet ownership in Douglas County just jumped a  
notch on the X-Files scale. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nebraska Humane Society plans to implant microchips into  
every animal adopted from its shelter. The society said the chips -- 
about the size of a grain or rice -- will ensure lost pets get 
returned to their owners. 
</P>
<P>
	But the implants won't come cheap.  
</P>
<P>
	To cover the cost, people who adopt a dog or a cat from the  
Humane Society, which serves Omaha and Douglas County, will see a 
``significant'' fee increase for adoptions later this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Humane Society officials say the fee hike will pay not only for  
the microchip implants, but also cover added health services 
provided for animals prepared for adoption. Those include spaying 
and neutering, vaccinations and screening for feline leukemia or 
heartworm in dogs. 
</P>
<P>
	The chips, implanted between the animals' shoulder blades, can  
be read by a hand-held scanner. 
</P>
<P>
	Nationwide, only 4 percent to 5 percent of the roughly 6,000  
humane societies nationwide use microchip implants, but support for 
the new technology is on the rise, said Cindy Stitely of the Humane 
Society of the United States in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a sure-fire way to identify lost animals,'' said C.J.  
Raffensperger, the president of the society's Board of Trustees. 
``We're doing it as a favor to the animals who get lost and are 
returned to us.''

<HEADLINE> Bud Selig's First Year Was Calm </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bug Selig's life had changed in his first year  
as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
	He ventures from Milwaukee to pitch for new ballparks, to lobby  
politicians and to attend meetings and funerals. Yet, he's 
essentially the same old Bud. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think Bud's changed in the 22 years I've known him,''  
union head Donald Fehr said this week as Selig's first anniversary 
as commissioner approached. ``Obviously, he's more knowledgeable 
about things. But he's basically the same person.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That means decisions are still made later rather than sooner,  
and that he sometimes tells people on opposite sides of issues what 
they want to hear rather than his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
	But it also means he still has a passion for the game and the  
desire to address its problems. 
</P>
<P>
	And it means that few people were surprised when he smacked his  
Lexus into a construction vehicle one morning while admiring Miller 
Park, the Brewers' new stadium in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm at least comfortable a year later that the ship is headed  
in the right direction,'' Selig said Wednesday, two days before the 
first anniversary of his election. 
</P>
<P>
	Selig, who entered baseball as controlling owner of the  
Milwaukee Brewers in 1970, was made acting commissioner from 
September 1992, when Fay Vincent was forced out. After years of 
saying he wouldn't take the job, two days after last summer's 
All-Star game Selig was voted to five-year term and became the 
first owner-commissioner. The Brewers were put in a trust and are 
now run by his daughter, Wendy Selig-Prieb. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past year, baseball went to Mexico for its first  
international opener and played an exhibition game in Cuba for the 
first time in 40 years -- the image of Selig sitting next to Cuban 
president Fidel Castro is still memorable. 
</P>
<P>
	Off the field is where most of the controversy remained. World  
Series ticket prices doubled to $150, the average salary shot up 19 
percent to $1.72 million, there was talk of putting advertisements 
on uniforms, baseball and ESPN sued each other, Darryl Strawberry 
was given a 120-day suspension after a cocaine-related arrest, and 
the Dodgers were fined $200,000 for breaking rules on signing Cuban 
players. 
</P>
<P>
	There's been no evident progress on Selig's desire for  
realignment or on minority hiring, despite a directive from him to 
teams to consider minorities when they fill top jobs. And there's 
been no decision on whether to ban androstenedione and other 
testosterone boosters, with owners and the union awaiting results 
of a medical study. 
</P>
<P>
	``You go from one emergency to the other,'' he said. ``The  
pressure in unrelenting.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Buoyed by last year's home run race, baseball attendance is  
drawing closer to its average before the 1994-95 strike. Through 
Wednesday, games averaged 27,919, just under the 27,967 average at 
a similar point last year. It's up 10.5 percent from its 25,260 
average in 1995 but down 11.7 percent from its '94 average of 
31,612. 
</P>
<P>
	Ratings for the Saturday telecasts on Fox averaged a 17 percent  
increase from 2.4 to 2.8. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe baseball is more popular today than ever before,''  
Selig said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, small-market owners complain they can't compete, even  
with the poorest clubs receiving $12 million to $13 million from 
revenue sharing this year. Selig formed an economic study committee 
and expects its report in 6-9 months. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to solve our internal problems,'' he said. ``We need  
to deal with disparity. We need to study what we have now, what we 
think we need in the future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The labor agreement with players is expected to expire after the  
2001 season. Some owners already are clamoring for a salary cap, 
which would only trigger the ninth work stoppage since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	While the players' association has heard rumors management might  
want to discuss an extension of the current deal with minor 
tweaking and that Selig's key aides favor an extension, there have 
been no proposals. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, Fehr says owners and players are getting along better  
than ever. Fehr and Selig, who bitterly criticized each other from 
1994-96, seem able to talk these days. 
</P>
<P>
	``The relationship between Bud and I certainly had some  
flashpoints, certainly around the time when they at first refused 
to ratify the draft agreement, but it's never been personally, 
hostile. It certainly isn't now,'' Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of focusing on players, owners seem to be looking toward  
marketing, Seattle opens a new stadium July 15, and new ballparks 
open next season in Detroit, Houston, Milwaukee, San Francisco. It 
seems a month doesn't go by when Selig doesn't go to a city and 
proclaim: ``Baseball can't survive here without a new ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Montreal Expos, averaging just 8,789 at Olympic Stadium, are  
the most pressing problem. But the futures of the Minnesota Twins 
and Oakland Athletics remain uncertain. Tuesday's All-Star game in 
Boston will focus attention on the desire of the Red Sox for a new 
Fenway Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Also up ahead is starting the 2000 season in Japan, with the New  
York Mets and St. Louis Cardinals the top choices for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	And while Selig isn't likely to grant Pete Rose's petition to  
end his lifetime ban, he may give serious consideration to the case 
of Shoeless Joe Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	Most disturbing is the likely confrontation with umpires, whose  
labor contract expires after this year. Selig wants to shift 
control of umpires from the leagues to Sandy Alderson in the 
commissioner's office, and the three-way relationship among owners, 
players and umpires has deteriorated significantly. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one thing we learned by all the past confrontation is  
the public just doesn't want to hear about it,'' Selig said. ``You 
hope that any differences of opinion can be settled quietly. That 
is in all parties' best interests.''

<HEADLINE> Reggae Fans Lobby for Special Burial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) -- Friends and family of Jamaican reggae  
star Dennis Brown are petitioning the government for permission to 
bury him in an exclusive cemetery reserved for the Caribbean 
island's most notable political leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	The government is considering the petition to bury Brown at  
Heroes Park, Local Government Minister Arnold Bertram said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, Prime Minister P.J. Patterson said the  
government would help pay for the funeral, which is scheduled for 
July 17. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown died of pneumonia on July 1 at the age of 42. Dubbed the  
``crown prince of reggae,'' he rose to prominence during the 1970s 
wave of reggae singers that included Bob Marley, who introduced the 
musical form to listeners worldwide. Brown released a string of 
hits, beginning with ``No Man is an Island,'' which he recorded in 
1969 at the age of 12. 
</P>
<P>
	The last person to be buried at Heroes Park was former Prime  
Minister Michael Manley, the son of Jamaica's founding father, who 
died two years ago.

<HEADLINE> Plan: No Fed Contracts to Violators </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration is proposing to  
blacklist companies from federal contracts based on their labor, 
tax and environmental track records, business leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
	A White House proposal, which Vice President Al Gore promised to  
labor leaders 2 1/2 years ago, would allow the government to 
disqualify companies from federal contracts along those guidelines. 
It has resurfaced as Gore tries to woo unions to support his bid 
for the Democratic Party's 2000 presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you want to do business with the federal government you had  
better maintain a safe workplace and respect civil, human and union 
rights,'' Gore said during a February 1997 AFL-CIO meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	Business representatives are vowing to fight the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``The U.S. Chamber of Commerce will do whatever is necessary to  
block this politically motivated policy,'' chamber President Thomas 
J. Donohue said. ``The chamber is dedicated to defeating 
blacklisting and protecting the integrity of the federal 
contracting process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the Clinton administration defended the plan.  
</P>
<P>
	``The overarching principle behind this proposal is that it  
makes good sense for the American government to do business with 
good citizens who comply with the law,'' replied Linda Ricci, 
spokeswoman for the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
	The long-awaited administration initiative is expected to be  
published as a proposed regulation in today's Federal Register, 
opening a period of public comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new rules would clarify ``the existing principle that the  
federal government should not enter into contracts with contractors 
who do not comply with the law,'' according to a copy the 
administration proposal obtained by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the regulations, government contractors also could not  
charge taxpayers for the cost of activities intended to influence 
whether or not workers join labor unions or for some legal costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Union officials praised the proposal.  
</P>
<P>
	``Taxpayer dollars should not go to chronic lawbreakers,'' said  
AFL-CIO president John Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
	Other than Gore's comments, little on the subject has been heard  
from the administration since the spring of 1997, when Republican 
senators, including Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., threatened 
to hold up confirmation of Labor Secretary Alexis Herman because of 
their objections to the proposed contracting standards. 
</P>
<P>
	According to administration documents, the proposal the White  
House ultimately settled on would go beyond the scope of federal 
contractors' compliance with labor laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the new rules would elaborate more generally on  
existing regulations that simply require federal contractors to 
have ``a satisfactory record of integrity and business ethics.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to labor laws, that standard would explicitly apply  
to a companies' record of compliance with employment discrimination 
laws, tax laws, environmental laws, antitrust laws and consumer 
protections laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The proposed rules would allow the government to take into  
account not only confirmed wrongdoing by a company, such as court 
convictions, but also ``persuasive evidence of substantial 
noncompliance with a law or regulation,'' when awarding contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Such evidence could not be ``isolated or trivial'' but would  
have to show ``repeated and substantial violations establishing a 
pattern or practice by a prospective contractor,'' in order to 
affect the companies chances of winning contracts. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal contractors also could no longer bill the government for  
any expenses associated with activities intended to influence 
workers' decisions to unionize, such as hiring legal consultants or 
printing pamphlets. Expenses associated with maintaining good labor 
relations, such as hiring shop stewards or printing employee 
newsletters would be allowed, however. 
</P>
<P>
	Finally, contractors could not charge the government for their  
legal fees in cases where federal regulatory agencies, such as the 
National Labor Relations Board or the Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission, find wrongdoing -- even if there is no punishment 
associated with the finding. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, companies can get their legal fees reimbursed by the  
government unless they have faced punishment such as a criminal 
court sentence or civil fine.

<HEADLINE> Reds' Casey, Villone Visit The Jake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Surrounded by camera crews and reporters in  
front of the Cincinnati Reds' dugout, Sean Casey's head spun around 
when he heard another familiar voice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hey, Sean Casey, is that you?'' Indians first base coach Brian  
Graham shouted. ``Get out there and take some ground balls.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, Cincinnati's All-Star first baseman, was back at Jacobs  
Field for the first time since 1997, when he was one of the 
promising stars in the Indians' organization. Cleveland traded 
Casey to the Reds on the eve of opening day in 1998 for 
right-hander Dave Burba, the Indians' starter Friday night when 
they opened a three-game interleague series against the Reds. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back a lot of great memories being here,'' said the  
25-year-old Casey, drafted by the Indians in 1995. ``It's special 
to be back here. This place will always be a special place for 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ron Villone didn't exactly share Casey's fondness for the Jake.  
</P>
<P>
	The left-hander, released by the Indians during spring training,  
has flourished in his short time with the Reds. Used exclusively as 
a reliever by Cleveland, Villone who will start Saturday's game, is 
3-0 in his last three starts with a 0.82 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wished I could have pitched better here,'' he said. ``But I  
didn't. Anyway, I can't worry about what was. I have to worry about 
tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Casey, who entered Friday's action leading the NL with a .373  
average, said he has always been confident he would be a solid 
major leaguer. However, not even he could anticipate having a first 
full major league season like this one. 
</P>
<P>
	His 17 homers are already five more than he ever had at any  
level, and Casey is among the league leaders in hits, doubles, 
total bases, slugging percentage, on-base average and extra-base 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
	In Cincinnati, he's been nicknamed ``The Mayor.'' In Cleveland,  
he's ``The One Who Got Away.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I expect a lot of myself as a player, but I never thought  
about being an All-Star,'' said Casey, who visited with several of 
his ex-teammates before the game. ``It has just been a matter of 
getting an opportunity to play every day and that's what I got in 
Cincinnati.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same has been true for Villone.  
</P>
<P>
	The Indians didn't have a spot for him after spring training,  
but before letting Villone go outright, Cleveland general manager 
John Hart said he tried to work out a deal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I called 28 or 29 teams at the end of spring training,'' Hart  
said. ``I didn't get one nibble on the guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Reds took a chance on Villone, who always had plenty of  
velocity of his pitches, just little control of them. After 
appearing in the first 162 games of his career as a reliever, 
Villone became a starter. 
</P>
<P>
	He'll take a 4-2 record and 2.78 ERA into his Saturday start.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't dwell on the things that happened here,'' he said.  
``Things happen for a reason. It's a business. I moved on.''

<HEADLINE> Gordon Hopes To Keep Momentum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ELKHART LAKE, Wis. (AP) -- Before he left the CART FedEx Series  
to give NASCAR stock cars a try in 1997, Robby Gordon was on track 
to become an open-wheel star. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years later, Gordon is struggling to regain that status.  
</P>
<P>
	After struggling through the early part of the season, the  
30-year-old Gordon showed some of his old prowess two weeks ago in 
Cleveland in the rain, running near the front, dicing with the 
leaders and finishing ninth only because a cut tire forced him to 
pit late in the race. 
</P>
<P>
	``To finish the way we did was especially sweet because we had  
our share of struggles earlier in the weekend at Cleveland,'' said 
Mike Held, team manager and co-owner of Team Gordon. ``We've gotten 
into a bit of a slump on Fridays and Saturdays the last few races. 
But, sure enough, we've come out strong for the Sunday-morning 
warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's a good thing, to come out strong on race day, but it's  
also frustrating because you wish you could've found the right 
package two days earlier, when practice began on Friday.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those frustrations are particularly difficult to take for  
Gordon, considering the situation he was in before his failed 
attempt to race in Winston Cup. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon, a Californian with movie star looks, had won two races  
and four poles and appeared ready to blossom into a serious Champ 
Car contender. Then he went South to drive for stock cars, an 
experiment that ended abruptly late in the season with Gordon out 
of a ride after finding very little success. 
</P>
<P>
	He quietly returned to CART last year, replacing retiring  
veteran Hiro Matsushita at Arciero-Wells Racing and finishing 23rd 
in the season points. 
</P>
<P>
	At the end of 1998, Gordon joined forces with longtime friend  
Held and Midwestern home improvement mogul John Menard to form Team 
Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	It hasn't been an instant return to success in the very  
competitive CART series. 
</P>
<P>
	``But this is what you sign up for when you start a brand new  
race team,'' Held said. ``We all bought into that when the season 
started. The key is to keep looking forward, build on your 
successes, learn from your mistakes, and remember that this is all 
supposed to be fun. Racing has its ups and downs. If it was easy, 
everybody would do it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon actually began the turnaround in May when he drove in the  
rival Indy Racing League's Indianapolis 500 -- the only CART regular 
to take part in that event. And he nearly won, running out of fuel 
while leading less than two laps from the end. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon will try to keep the momentum going today in practice and  
provisional qualifying for the Texaco/Havoline 200 at Road America. 
</P>
<P>
	``Road America has always been a homey place to race -- very  
beautiful, very comfortable surroundings, and one of the world's 
most classic road courses,'' Gordon said. ``The food's great, the 
people are very nice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Besides, Gordon is feeling very positive after his showing at  
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
	``We left there feeling like we had about as much fun as we had  
all year,'' Gordon said. ``We slid off the track several times. It 
was a mess. But it was a lot of fun. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll be able to come back strong this weekend on a  
totally different kind of racetrack. We go from the wide open 
spaces of an airport road course to a more traditional four-mile 
road course that's got all kinds of challenges. It's got its fast 
parts and its slow parts, so finding the right balance as quickly 
as possible will be the key.''

<HEADLINE> Hall of Famer Brown Pleads Innocent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Hall of Fame football star Jim Brown pleaded  
innocent Friday to misdemeanor charges related to a violent 
argument with his wife in June. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, who set NFL rushing and scoring records for the Cleveland  
Browns in the 1960s, faces one count of making terroristic threats 
and one count of vandalism. Brown was arrested June 15 after his 
wife, Monique Brown, called police. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Brown threatened to kill his wife and broke out  
the windows of her car with a shovel, said Lara Bloomquist, who 
supervises the domestic violence unit for the Los Angeles city 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown, 63, is scheduled for trial Aug. 17.  
</P>
<P>
	Bloomquist said Monique Brown, 25, is on the witness list for  
the proceedings, but ``whether she'll be for the prosecution 
remains to be seen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Monique Brown has recanted her original accusation, saying this  
week the case was overblown. Bloomquist said that isn't unusual, 
and that about two-thirds of victims in domestic violence cases her 
office handles take back their stories. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's nothing at all unusual about Ms. Brown's present  
posture,'' Bloomquist said. 
</P>
<P>
	If convicted, Brown could face as much as a year and a half in  
county jail, three years' probation and domestic violence 
counseling.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says Mir May Be Evacuated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia warned Kazakstan that the three crew  
members aboard the Mir space station may have to come home early if 
a ban on launches from the Baikonur Cosmodrome is not lifted, a 
news report said today. 
</P>
<P>
	If Russia isn't able to launch a Progress cargo ship on July 14,  
``the crew of the Mir orbital station ... will have to be 
evacuated,'' Russian First Deputy Prime Minister Viktor Khristenko 
said in a telegram to Kazak Prime Minister Nurlan Balgimbayev, 
according to the ITAR-Tass news agency. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Russian media, the Mir's crew -- cosmonauts Viktor  
Afanasyev, Sergei Avdeyev and French astronaut Jean-Pierre Heignere 
-- will have to leave the station July 17 if they don't get fresh 
supplies of food and equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Space officials warned that the ban may also disrupt plans to  
gradually lower the Mir's orbit and let remains of the station fall 
into the ocean. Russia planned to leave the Mir unmanned in August, 
and discard it early next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If that equipment isn't delivered at a certain time, the crew  
obviously won't be able to install it ... the procedure of lowering 
the station's orbit will be broken,'' Russian space agency 
spokesman Sergei Gorbunov was quoted as saying by ITAR-Tass. 
</P>
<P>
	He insisted that the station won't come crashing down to Earth,  
but said Kazakstan's ban would make it much more difficult to 
ensure a safe return. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan abruptly banned all launches from Baikonur on Tuesday  
after a Proton booster rocket carrying a Russian Defense Ministry 
satellite exploded shortly after takeoff Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazakstan said the explosion showered central Kazakstan with  
toxic rocket fuel. It shut down the launch site until a commission 
figures out the extent of the damage and determines whether other 
launches will be ecologically safe. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia leases the cosmodrome for cargo flights to the Mir space  
station and commercial and military satellite launches. 
</P>
<P>
	Russia has argued that launches of other types of booster  
rockets should be allowed to go ahead because they don't use the 
same highly-toxic fuel as the Proton booster rocket. 
</P>
<P>
	If Kazakstan agrees, Russia would be able to send up the cargo  
ship, which will use a Soyuz rocket. It would also be able to 
launch a weather satellite aboard a Zenit rocket whose liftoff was 
set for Thursday but has been pushed back because of the ban. 
</P>
<P>
	But Kazak Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Pavlov, who is heading  
the investigation, criticized Russia during a news conference for 
failing to pay its debts for renting Baikonur, and demanded that 
Moscow at least pay damages for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	Khristenko, the Russian deputy premier, told the Echo of Moscow  
radio station that damages will be paid, and expressed hope the 
dispute would be resolved soon.

<HEADLINE> Stolen Rockwell Paintings Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- George Turak said all seemed normal when a  
man walked into his art gallery last December with a couple of 
original Norman Rockwell paintings and asked for an appraisal. 
</P>
<P>
	``He wanted to sell the paintings,'' said the owner of George  
Turak Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	But a background check showed the paintings were stolen 21 years  
ago from a Minneapolis gallery. 
</P>
<P>
	The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Thursday announced the  
recovery of the works worth $175,000, two of seven paintings taken 
in the largest theft of Rockwell originals in American history. Two 
paintings had already been recovered and negotiations are under way 
for the return of the remaining three. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been charged and the man who had the paintings, a  
Brazilian visiting relatives, is not a suspect, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``He had obtained the paintings in lieu of a debt,'' said FBI  
spokeswoman Linda Vizi. ``He brought them into the gallery, which 
ran a check and found them to be stolen.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The seven art works were taken Feb. 17, 1978, from the Elayne  
Galleries in Minneapolis. Two, valued at $300,000, were recovered 
in April after gallery owner Bonnie Lindberg found them at a 
gallery in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a huge relief,'' Lindberg said. ``I couldn't believe the  
timing of it in terms of them all surfacing at relatively the same 
period of time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said the three remaining paintings, valued at more than  
$700,000, were found at the same Rio de Janeiro art dealer and she 
is negotiating for their return. FBI officials could not confirm 
that, but said the three paintings are believed to be in South 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	The two paintings found in Philadelphia, ``She's My Baby'' and  
``Lickin' Good Bath,'' will be returned in a few weeks to their 
respective owners, a private collector and St. Paul, Minn.-based 
Brown &AMP; Bigelow company, the FBI said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She's My Baby'' appeared on the cover of the June 4, 1927  
issue of The Saturday Evening Post and depicts a boy painting a 
heart on the back of a girl's coat. ``Lickin' Good Bath'' was used 
in a calendar designed by Brown &AMP; Bigelow. It shows a dog licking 
the face of a boy who is bathing.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Up 4.19; Dow Up 31.66 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened higher today, led by a rally in  
technology shares that lifted the Nasdaq composite index into 
record territory for the sixth time in seven days. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Nasdaq was up 4.19 at 2,776.05.  
The index has climbed nearly 5 percent since it began its 
record-setting climb June 30. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average also advanced today, rising  
31.66 to 1,1158.55, which erased half of its 60-point loss on 
Thursday and moved the blue-chip index closer to its closing high 
of 11,187.36 that it hit on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq's strength came from a range of technology shares.  
Dell Computer led the rally, rising 2 1/8 to 42 1/16 after Goldman 
Sachs raised its rating on the company. 
</P>
<P>
	DuPont led the Dow higher, rising 2 13/16 to 71 5/16 after the  
company unveiled some details of its spinoff of its Conoco unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks also benefited from a recovery in the bond market. On  
Thursday, bond prices fell, while the yield on the 30-year Treasury 
bond rose. The rising yield served as a reminder to investors that 
higher interest rates are taking hold in the economy, and could 
threaten earnings in future quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	This morning, however, prices were higher and the yield fell to  
5.96 percent, down from 5.99 percent late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 10-to-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 91.53 million 
shares, down from Thursday's early pace. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.04 at 1,396.46, the  
NYSE composite index was up 1.48 at 655.53, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index was up 1.34 at 810.03. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.17 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.9 percent, France's 
CAC-40 was up 0.58 percent, and Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.05 
percent.

<HEADLINE> IMF Planning Gold Reserves Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The International Monetary Fund said Friday it  
is going ahead with plans to sell part of its gold reserves to 
finance debt relief for poor countries. But mounting opposition in 
Congress casts doubt on whether a sale will take place. 
</P>
<P>
	A statement issued after a meeting of the IMF's 24-member  
executive board said they hope to decide how the sale will be 
handled by the time of the IMF's annual meeting at the end of 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	An IMF spokeswoman said the directors ``reiterated their full  
commitment to provide appropriate financing'' for the IMF-World 
Bank's Highly Indebted Poor Country relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	``Directors stressed that the gold sales will be handled in a  
transparent way, without disrupting the gold market, '' the 
spokeswoman said, speaking on the customary condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the IMF staff will discuss during the summer how the  
sale will occur. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and other leading industrialized nations  
agreed last month at a summit in Cologne, Germany, that the IMF 
should sell up to 10 percent of its $26 billion gold reserves to 
pay for the debt relief initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	But the proposal, which has the backing of the Treasury and IMF  
Managing Director Michel Camdessus, is running into heavy 
opposition from gold-producing countries and powerful members of 
Congress, which must approve any IMF gold sales. 
</P>
<P>
	They include House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, and  
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., and several 
representatives from gold-mining states. 
</P>
<P>
	Conservative Republicans, long hostile to the IMF, are demanding  
that if any gold the IMF rids itself of should go back to the 
countries that provided it. They say the IMF should borrow money 
from capital markets, as does its sister institution, the World 
Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	Other opponents of the IMF sale include South Africa, the  
world's leading gold producer, and the World Gold Council. The 
council worries that gold sales by Britain, other nations and the 
IMF will drive down the metal's price. 
</P>
<P>
	South Africa is sending a mission to Europe to lobby against the  
sale. Among its arguments is that gold-producing nations who might 
qualify for debt relief will be hurt by falling gold prices. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of gold dipped below $257 an ounce in the past week,  
its lowest level since May 1979. It closed Friday in New York at 
$257.70. 
</P>
<P>
	Among sales methods the IMF board considered were direct  
off-market deals with central banks trying to build up gold 
reserves or a public auction similar to the one the Bank of England 
carried out this week for the sale of 25 tons.

<HEADLINE> NASA Clears Telescope Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA has cleared the Chandra X-ray  
Observatory for a July 20 launch aboard space shuttle Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	Managers approved the launch date yesterday. Coincidentally,  
July 20 is the 30th anniversary of man's first moon landing. 
</P>
<P>
	Launch time will be 12:36 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
	The five-day shuttle mission, led by Eileen Collins, NASA's  
first female commander, had been surrounded in uncertainty since an 
Air Force rocket left a military satellite in the wrong orbit back 
in April. The problem was traced to an upper-stage motor. 
</P>
<P>
	The $1.5 billion Chandra has the same type of motor, and NASA  
wanted to be sure there was nothing wrong with it. The Air Force 
made corrections to the motor intended for the telescope and 
declared it safe to fly; NASA concurred. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA officials said they cannot discuss the changes made to  
Chandra's motor until the Air Force completes its investigation 
into the April rocket accident. 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra is the largest and most powerful X-ray telescope ever to  
be launched. The attached motor is supposed to place it in an oval 
orbit, with a high point one-third of the way to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
	The mission was originally scheduled for last August, but  
various problems with the telescope delayed it.

<HEADLINE> 2 Inmates Eyed in Synagogue Arsons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO (AP) -- Two men held on stolen property charges  
related to the slaying of a gay couple are being investigated in 
the arson attacks at three area synagogues, The Sacramento Bee 
reported Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Benjamin Matthew Williams, 31, and James Tyler Williams, 29,  
were arrested late Wednesday in a shopping mall parking lot in Yuba 
City, sheriff's Capt. Ron Richardson said Friday. Both were armed 
and one was wearing a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
	They were arraigned on charges of receiving stolen property.  
Prosecutors did not identify the alleged stolen property, but said 
it was connected to the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman Nick Rossi refused to say whether there was a link  
between the murders of the gay couple and the arson attacks at the 
synagogues. The Bee based its report on sources close to the arson 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
	Gary Matson 50, and Winfield Scott Mowder, 40, were found shot  
in their bed July 1 in their home on five acres they owned in tiny 
Happy Valley, about 180 miles north of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Police said the victims and the suspects knew each other.  
</P>
<P>
	The men, arrested Wednesday on charges unrelated to the fires,  
had access to ``substantial armament and ammunition,'' said James 
Maddock, head of the Sacramento FBI office. 
</P>
<P>
	``At present we don't know the purpose of collecting these names  
but obviously we are concerned about their safety and the public 
safety,'' Maddock said. ``We have no evidence of any specific plan 
of any violent action against any specific individual or group.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fires caused more than $1 million in damage at the  
Congregation B'nai Israel near downtown Sacramento, the 
Congregation Beth Shalom in suburban Carmichael and the Knesset 
Israel Torah Center in northeastern Sacramento County. 
</P>
<P>
	The fires, all set within minutes of each other early June 18,  
are being investigated as hate crimes.

<HEADLINE> Former ADM Executives Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Three senior executives of food-processing giant  
Archer Daniels Midland Co. have been sentenced to multiyear prison 
terms in a price-fixing case prosecutors called one of the largest 
antitrust conspiracies ever brought to court. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andreas, 51, whose father Dwayne Andreas built ADM into  
a global agribusiness, was sentenced Friday to two years in prison 
along with 60-year-old Terrance Wilson, the retired head of ADM's 
corn division. 
</P>
<P>
	They also were fined $350,000 by U.S. District Judge Blanche  
Manning for conspiring with competitors in Japan and Korea to fix 
the $600 million world market in lysine, a feed additive that 
promotes growth in hogs and poultry. They were convicted in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Whitacre, 49, former head of ADM's bioproducts division,  
was sentenced to 30 months -- 20 of that to be served on top of a 
nine-year sentence he is currently serving for swindling ADM out of 
$9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre, who wore a wire as an undercover FBI informant at ADM  
but later fell out with the government, heard his sentence from a 
federal prison camp in Edgefield, S.C. He waived his right to be in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
	``Life in prison is actually better than life at ADM,'' the  
Ohio-born biochemist told the court. He bitterly denounced not only 
the company but the FBI, saying, ``I risked my life and my career'' 
to help them. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his sentence, Manning directed Whitacre to seek  
mental health treatment once he is released from prison. His 
attorney, Bill Walker, says that he has bipolar disease and is on 
medication. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas apologized to the court but stopped short of admitting  
any wrongdoing. Andreas' and Wilson's attorneys said they would 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this country, your honor, and I thought I knew its  
rules,'' Andreas told Manning before he was sentenced. ``I did not 
want to commit a crime, and I did not think that I had committed a 
crime.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said the sentences should serve as a deterrent to  
any would-be price fixers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not the longest sentence ever imposed but it's a long  
sentence under the antitrust guidelines,'' said Justice Department 
lawyer James Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM, based in Decatur, deep in central Illinois' corn and  
soybean country, has paid a $100 million fine and settled three 
antitrust lawsuits for an additional $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas and Wilson are to report to prison in September.

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Colombia's trade minister should have  
minded her own business when she criticized Venezuelan trade 
policy, her Venezuelan counterpart said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The Colombian minister, Martha Lucia Ramirez, this week  
criticized a Venezuelan law requiring Colombian truck drivers to 
hand their cargo over Venezuelan drivers at the border. 
</P>
<P>
	In an interview with the Caracas daily El Nacional, she said  
Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez ``talks about integration, but the 
measures applied by some of his officials are just the opposite.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ramirez's comments were an ``undue interference in the internal  
affairs of the country,'' Venezuelan Trade Minister Gustavo Marquez 
said in a radio interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela said the law was necessary because its drivers were at  
a disadvantage. Few Venezuelan drivers venture into Colombia 
because of the presence of leftist rebels and paramilitary squads.

lending, Thailand's central bank on Friday cut its discount rate to 
4 percent from 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The rate cut was the third in less than six months. On Feb. 1,  
the discount rate -- the interest the central bank charges 
commercial banks for loans -- was cut to 7 percent from 12.5 
percent. On June 25, the rate was reduced to 5.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Nitaya Pibulratana, deputy director of the Bank of Thailand's  
banking department, said at a news conference that the reduction in 
the discount rate -- known locally as the bank rate -- was intended 
to reduce the costs of financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
	The minimum prime lending rate at top commercial banks currently  
is 8.75 percent. To keep the momentum of economic recovery going, 
the central bank wants lending rates to come down further. 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank acts through the discount rate window as a  
lender of last resort to private financial institutions. Government 
bonds are deposited as collateral for loans with terms of no longer 
than seven days.

<HEADLINE>  Alleged Polygamist Gets 10 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- A judge on Friday sentenced a prominent  
polygamist to up to 10 years in prison, the maximum sentence, for 
having sex with his 16-year-old niece. 
</P>
<P>
	Third District Judge David S. Young ordered David Ortell  
Kingston, who is thought to be a leader in Utah's most prominent 
polygamist clan, to serve two consecutive terms of up to five years 
each on conviction for incest and unlawful sexual conduct with a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
	Young also fined Kingston $10,000 and ordered him to pay court  
expenses. Kingston, 33, mouthed ``I love you'' to his legal wife 
and five children as he was led out of the courtroom in a red 
prison jumpsuit and handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
	He was convicted June 3 after his niece testified that she  
married him in a secret ceremony complete with a wedding dress, 
ring and a honeymoon at a Park City hotel. She said that she was 
his 15th wife and that they had sex four times. 
</P>
<P>
	During the trial, Young tried to keep polygamy out of the case.  
But Friday he changed his tune. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this sentencing, polygamy is an issue,'' he said. To deny  
that is ``sort of like saying that we can ignore the 500-pound 
elephant in the living room.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The case thrust polygamy back into the Utah spotlight and  
already sent Kingston's brother -- the girl's father -- to jail. John 
Daniel Kingston is serving 28 weeks for beating his daughter for 
running away from her uncle. He pleaded no contest to reduced 
charges of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	The two brothers are sons of John Ortell Kingston, the late  
leader of the Latter Day Church of God, a Mormon splinter group 
with about 1,000 members and a $150 million business empire in six 
Western states. 
</P>
<P>
	Kingston's attorney Susanne Gustin-Furgis said her client is not  
a typical sex offender. She asked the judge to ignore the 
prosecution's recommendation for the maximum, suggesting five 
months of jail time, followed by two years of supervised probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he is a polygamist, as has been alleged, this is really a  
religious practice,'' she said. ``This is not a compulsion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But the judge soon interrupted her as she tried to compare  
Kingston to other sex cases. 
</P>
<P>
	``In some respects I believe that Mr. Kingston has been a victim  
of misguided family instruction,'' Young said. But, he added later, 
``He's shown no indication that he knows it was wrong.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Dane Nolan said that he was pleased with the  
sentence, but insisted Kingston should not be seen as a victim, 
because ``he chose to engage in this lifestyle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 25,000 to 35,000 polygamists live in Utah and other  
parts of the West. Most belong to offshoots of the Mormon Church, 
which renounced polygamy in 1890 under pressure from Congress and 
the courts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Kingston clan stands apart from other polygamous groups,  
former members say, in practicing incest.

<HEADLINE> Canada Court: Boy Can't Sue Mom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- Canada's Supreme Court ruled Friday that a  
6-year-old boy cannot sue his mother for permanent disabilities 
caused when she crashed her car while pregnant with him. 
</P>
<P>
	Lobby groups on both sides of the abortion debate in Canada had  
followed the case closely, wondering if the high court might -- for 
the first time -- move toward extending full legal recognition to 
unborn children. 
</P>
<P>
	However, the court, in a 7-2 ruling, stuck by its previous  
stance: that an unborn child is one with its mother and has no 
distinct legal rights. 
</P>
<P>
	The case involves Ryan Dobson, who was delivered 13 weeks early  
by emergency caesarean section hours after his mother, Cynthia, was 
involved in a head-on collision in New Brunswick in 1993. Ryan was 
born with cerebral palsy, walks with a limp and cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan's maternal grandfather brought the case on his grandson's  
behalf, suing his daughter for damages in amicable litigation aimed 
at receiving money from her insurance company to cope with the high 
costs of Ryan's care. 
</P>
<P>
	Two lower courts ruled the boy indeed had a right to sue, but  
the Supreme Court overturned those decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Peter Cory, in the majority opinion, noted that the  
court had allowed suits to be filed on behalf of unborn children 
for injuries in the womb caused by a third party. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said that right does not extend to suing their mothers.  
</P>
<P>
	``In light of the very demanding biological reality that only  
women can become pregnant and bear children, the courts should be 
hesitant to impose additional burdens upon pregnant women,'' wrote 
Cory. 
</P>
<P>
	``There can be no meaningful analogy between a child's action  
for prenatal negligence against a third party ... on the one hand, 
and against his or her mother on the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the court dealt with similar issues when it ruled that  
a woman addicted to sniffing glue could not be detained 
involuntarily to protect her unborn child from harm. 
</P>
<P>
	Women's rights and abortion rights groups were pleased by  
Friday's decision. They feared a ruling in Ryan's favor would open 
the door to a flood of suits against women who had accidents or 
engaged in unhealthy behavior during pregnancy and might increase 
pressure to ban abortions. 
</P>
<P>
	Canada's Parliament has given no sign that it might consider  
changing current law, which doesn't recognize a fetus as an entity 
with legal rights. Abortion is legal throughout Canada, although 
less readily available in some provinces than others. 
</P>
<P>
	Cynthia Dobson's insurance company has paid an undisclosed sum  
to help with Ryan's care. Had the boy won the case, additional 
money would have been demanded.

<HEADLINE> Judge Throws Out Lawsuit Over Yo-Yo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNION CITY, Tenn. (AP) -- A judge has thrown out a lawsuit filed  
by the father of an 11-year-old boy whose yo-yo was confiscated by 
school teachers. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnny Johnson of Samburg sought $7 for the yo-yo plus $73.25  
for the cost of filing suit against two teachers at Black Oak 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Raymond Morris, of Obion County General Sessions Court,  
dismissed the suit Wednesday, saying it was frivolous. He ordered 
Johnson to pay court costs plus the teachers' legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
	School Principal Tommy Carpenter said students were told not to  
bring toys on a field trip in April but several did. 
</P>
<P>
	Teachers confiscated four yo-yos and told the youngsters their  
parents could pick up the toys or they could wait to have them 
returned at the end of the school year, Carpenter said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Johnson declined the invitation to retrieve his son's  
yo-yo.

<HEADLINE> Utility Sued Over NYC Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The power failure that left thousands of upper  
Manhattan residents without electricity may have destroyed 
important research at hospitals and labs affiliated with Columbia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
	Power problems continued to plague New York Presbyterian  
Hospital on Thursday. The pathology chairman at Columbia said 
lapses in refrigeration may have harmed research tissues. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brain banks have been gathering tissue for over 15 years, but  
we don't know for sure how much was lost,'' said Dr. Michael 
Shelanski. 
</P>
<P>
	Other affected banks included DNA, breast cancer, and tumor  
research tissue. ``Once they thaw out, they're useless,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Consolidated Edison has estimated that 200,000 residents were  
affected when the utility cut power to the area Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One woman who lost power during this week's heat wave sued the  
utility Thursday, saying it should have been prepared to meet the 
heavy demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Adeline Tegnazian contends negligence by Con Ed forced her and  
other customers to brave life without electricity as temperatures 
pushed past the century mark Tuesday. The suit seeks class-action 
status. 
</P>
<P>
	The three days of record-breaking heat that began on Sunday  
arched power lines, shuttered subway stops and contributed to 19 
deaths citywide. 
</P>
<P>
	Tegnazian's suit claims Con Ed should have been aware that hot  
weather might cause power problems because of similar blackouts in 
1965 and 1977. 
</P>
<P>
	Con Ed spokeswoman Joy Faber said she had not seen the lawsuit  
and could not comment. The utility has said it will reimburse 
residential customers for food spoiled during the outage.

<HEADLINE> Study: Few Dropouts Repay Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Historically black colleges can cut high rates  
of student loan default by making sure more students graduate, says 
a report by the nation's leading financer of student loans. 
</P>
<P>
	A high proportion of students at black colleges leave during  
their freshmen or sophomore years, increasing the likelihood they 
will not repay college loans, Sallie Mae reported Thursday in 
releasing a yearlong study on loan defaults. 
</P>
<P>
	Sallie Mae studied 14 black colleges that had 25 percent or more  
of student loans in default. 
</P>
<P>
	Those schools have since filed management plans with the  
Education Department and will continue to be able to offer loans, 
department officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Historically black colleges often have three times more students  
who do not repay federal loans than other institutions -- about 21 
percent compared with 7 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The black colleges usually offer open enrollments to encourage  
minority attendance, but suffer from lower retention rates. 
</P>
<P>
	And unlike other universities, the black colleges also lack  
institutional support, such as large endowments and other 
donations, to help students pay for their educations, said Sara 
Davis, director of Sallie Mae's government relations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The students end up depending more on loans,'' she said,  
adding that Sallie Mae will study defaults at non-black colleges 
next. 
</P>
<P>
	Sallie Mae, officially named the Student Loan Marketing  
Association, was a federally chartered enterprise and the nation's 
largest buyer of government-guaranteed student loans from banks 
before it became a private company. It still buys many student 
loans from banks but also competes with banks by making loans 
directly to students and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The report suggested that black colleges troubled by bad loans:  
</P>
<P>
	--Increase mentoring, academic advising, peer counseling and  
tutoring to keep students in school. 
</P>
<P>
	--Counsel students on debt management and consumer finance  
issues. 
</P>
<P>
	--Create a single manager or team to address the issue on campus  
and acquire the technology to accurately track student data. 
</P>
<P>
	The report also recommended more federal grants for low-income  
students' preparation and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
	Congress in 1992 required that any institution of higher  
learning with the 25 percent rate of loan default lose its 
eligibility to participate in the federal student loan program. 
These institutions received extensions from lawmakers citing the 
schools' special mission of educating minority and disadvantaged 
students. 
</P>
<P>
	Sallie Mae, which owns or manages student loans for 5.3 million  
borrowers, also published ``A Guide to Default Prevention'' for 
these and other institutions with high default rates. 
</P>
<P>
	William H. Gray III, president of The College Fund/UNCF, said,  
the colleges ``award nearly 28 percent of all bachelor's degrees to 
African-American students, and without them, many deserving 
students' educational and lifetime opportunities would be greatly 
diminished. It is reassuring that Sallie Mae recognized a need in 
the higher-education community and immediately came forth offering 
its knowledge, expertise and resources.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There are 104 historically black institutions with a total of  
281,000 students. In 1995, students at those institutions received 
about 3 percent of the more than $26 million in federal student 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The colleges studied were: Allen University, Columbia, S.C.;  
Arkansas Baptist College, Little Rock, Ark.; Barber-Scotia College, 
Concord, N.C.; Central State University, Wilberforce, Ohio; 
Huston-Tillotson College, Austin, Texas; Jarvis Christian College, 
Hawkins, Texas; Lane College, Jackson, Tenn.; Mary Holmes College, 
West Point, Miss.; Miles College, Birmingham, Ala.; Paul Quinn 
College, Dallas; Southwestern Christian College, Terrell, Texas; 
Texas College, Tyler, Texas; Texas Southern University, Houston; 
and Wiley College, Marshall, Texas.

<HEADLINE> Leif Garrett Faces Drug Charges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Former teen idol Leif Garrett showed up in  
court a day early in hopes of avoiding jail time on cocaine and 
heroin charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Garrett, 37, was scheduled to be arraigned this morning, but he  
and his attorney made a surprise appearance in court late 
yesterday. They asked the court to order a report to determine 
Garrett's eligibility for a diversion program that would mean drug 
counseling instead of jail time. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge set an Aug. 13 hearing.  
</P>
<P>
	The former child actor and '70s singing sensation was one of  
several people arrested June 29 during a sting at an apartment 
building known for drug activity. He was charged with cocaine and 
heroin possession. 
</P>
<P>
	He is free on $10,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
	Garrett recently finished work on a film called ``Art of the  
Bullet,'' scheduled for release next month.

<HEADLINE> GOP, Democrats to Debate HMO Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Catching Democrats off guard, Senate  
Republicans say they'll introduce a Democratic bill when debate 
opens next week on increasing patients' rights against HMOs. 
</P>
<P>
	That might seem unusual, but it's only the latest in a series of  
procedural maneuvers that are a daily occurrence in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The GOP goal is to make it more difficult -- and certainly more  
awkward -- for Democrats to offer amendments designed to highlight 
differences between competing Republican and Democratic bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The Democrats are hoping to force Republicans into casting some  
politically unpopular votes. To do that, the Democrats will have to 
offer amendments to their own legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, it won't matter what bill is on the table when  
debate begins. Under an agreement reached last week, Republicans 
still get to offer the final amendment after four days of debate. 
And they are expected to use it to substitute their own bill for 
the entire Democratic measure -- nullifying any amendments that 
might have been approved along the way. 
</P>
<P>
	``It matters where we begin ... but it's where we end up that  
really counts,'' Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., said Thursday in 
announcing the move. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats scoffed at the GOP move but promised to find ways to  
get the votes they want. 
</P>
<P>
	``This kind of maneuvering demonstrates the bankruptcy of the  
Republican position on this issue,'' said Massachusetts Sen. Edward 
Kennedy, an author of the Democratic measure. ``Parliamentary 
tactics won't allow members to duck this issue any longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Republican tactic puts the GOP on the offensive in the  
patients' rights debate for the first time in weeks. Democrats had 
forced them to schedule next week's debate after refusing for more 
than a week to let the Senate conduct any other business. 
</P>
<P>
	With polls showing that large majorities of Americans fear that  
their health insurance company may someday deny them needed care, 
Democrats believe the issue could be pivotal in the race over which 
party will control the next Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton, who regularly pushes the Democratic HMO plan,  
was hammering the issue again today on a California trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the provisions in the GOP plan only cover the 48 million  
people who are in federally regulated health insurance plans, 
mostly people who work for large companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats say they want their bill written into federal law and  
applied to all Americans. Among the provisions would be forcing 
HMOs to pay for reasonable emergency room care, giving patients a 
choice of doctors, and allowing women direct access to 
obstetricians and gynecologists. 
</P>
<P>
	They also want to force insurance companies to pay for care that  
doctors determine to be medically necessary and allow patients who 
are harmed by denials of care to sue their HMOs or other managed 
care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	And they want a prohibition on insurance companies allowing only  
short hospital stays after mastectomies. 
</P>
<P>
	The new GOP strategy would allow Republicans to vote for some of  
the more popular provisions when they first come up and then vote 
to substitute the narrower Republican bill when the final amendment 
comes up, said a Senate GOP leadership aide, speaking on condition 
of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Because this was a political exercise from the very  
beginning,'' he said, ``we had no choice but to factor in the 
political consequences and craft our bill accordingly.''

<HEADLINE> Druckenmiller Rape Case Won't Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHRISTIANSBURG, Va. (AP) -- A judge denied a prosecutor's request  
Friday to move the rape trial of San Francisco 49ers reserve 
quarterback Jim Druckenmiller out of the community where he was a 
Virginia Tech football star. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller will stand trial July 19 in Montgomery County  
Circuit Court, one week before he is scheduled to report to the 
49ers training camp, Judge Ray W. Grubbs ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller is accused of forcing sex upon a Virginia Tech  
student who passed out on a bed at a party in nearby Blacksburg in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller could face five years to life in prison if  
convicted of rape. 
</P>
<P>
	Assistant commonwealth's attorney Peggy Frank told Grubb the  
trial should be moved because Druckenmiller is still widely admired 
in Montgomery County, where he starred for Virginia Tech. Tech had 
a 20-4 record when he was the quarterback, including a 28-10 Sugar 
Bowl victory over Texas in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are as entitled to a fair trial as much as Mr.  
Druckenmiller,'' Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
	Grubb said he would begin jury selection as scheduled and  
consider moving the trial if he has trouble seating an impartial 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge said the motion to move the trial was highly unusual  
for prosecutors, at least in Montgomery County. ``I do believe this 
is a first,'' Grubb said. Such requests are usually made by defense 
lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller sat expressionless during the brief hearing with  
his lawyer, Deborah Caldwell-Bono of Roanoke. He refused to answer 
reporters' questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Caldwell-Bono has said Druckenmiller's accuser aggressively  
pursued him and that the sex was consensual. 
</P>
<P>
	Druckenmiller was the 49ers' top pick and the 26th selection  
overall in the 1997 draft. Coach Steve Mariucci called him the 
team's quarterback of the future, but he has played little. 
</P>
<P>
	As a rookie, Druckenmiller played in four games, one as a  
starter, and completed 21 of 52 passes for 239 yards and one 
touchdown. But he also threw three interceptions, two inside the 
opponent's 20. 
</P>
<P>
	Last season, he did not throw a pass, and Ty Detmer became the  
No. 2 quarterback behind Steve Young.

<HEADLINE> Phoenix Coyotes Sign Safronov </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) -- The Phoenix Coyotes signed 18-year-old  
Russian defenseman Kiril Safronov to a three-year contract Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	He was one of the team's two first-round selections in the entry  
draft last month. 
</P>
<P>
	General manager Bobby Smith believes Safronov has a shot at  
playing in the NHL this season. The native of St. Petersburg was 
the youngest player on Russia's gold medal-winning team in the 1999 
World Junior Championships. 
</P>
<P>
	If he isn't ready, Safronov will play for Coyotes' Springfield  
affiliate in the AHL or the Quebec Ramparts of the Quebec Major 
Junior Hockey League. He became eligible to play for the Ramparts 
when they drafted him in the first round of the Canadian Hockey 
League import draft Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Safronov had one goal, two points and 26 penalty minutes in 35  
games with St. Petersburg of the Russian League last season. The 
season before, he played in nine games with St. Petersburg and had 
one assist.

lead has no intention of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as getting conservative, I don't think it's going to  
happen,'' he said, pondering his approach to both the Jiffy Lube 
300 on Sunday and the second half of the season. ``We want to get 
as big a lead as we can, enjoy it and hopefully the end of the 
season will come real soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Not so soon, but with a 177-point lead over Bobby Labonte after  
17 of 34 races, Jarrett knows the title is his to lose. But if the 
second half is anything like the first, he will join his father as 
a champion. 
</P>
<P>
	Ned Jarrett, now a TV racing commentator, won NASCAR titles in  
1961 and 1965. Right now, his 42-year-old son has the air of 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got a lot of confidence right now,'' Jarrett said.  
</P>
<P>
	He got his third victory this season last Saturday night in the  
Pepsi 400 at Daytona International Speedway -- his 13th top-five 
finish in his last 15 starts. 
</P>
<P>
	The pedal will stay on the floor, even though Jarrett realizes  
there is some risk to going hard. 
</P>
<P>
	``Things may blow up in our face,'' he said. ``Who knows?''  
</P>
<P>
	But Jarrett isn't drunk with adventure. He knows the quality of  
his closest pursuers. There's Labonte, who has matched him nearly 
finish for finish, defending Jiffy Lube 300 champion Jeff Burton 
and his Roush Racing teammate Mark Martin, and three-time series 
champion Jeff Gordon. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have to make sure that we finish in the top five every  
race, or at least in 75-80 percent of the races, because we realize 
the 18 (Labonte), the 99 (Burton), the 6 (Martin) and the 24 
(Gordon) are going to finish in the top five week in and week 
out,'' Jarrett said. ``If we don't do our share, a lot of people 
are going to be right there'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon and Burton would be the best bets Sunday. Each has won  
twice over the last two years at New Hampshire International 
Speedway -- Burton in this race, Gordon in the second of the summer 
events at the track. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had a lot of success at New Hampshire,'' said Gordon,  
the only three-time winner at the track. ``But we've also had our 
share of problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, those problems are behind us now -- both at New  
Hampshire and for the rest of the season.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Gordon leads the circuit with four victories, he's  
only fifth in the standings because he's had five terrible 
finishes. Last year, he breezed to the title with a record-tying 13 
victories and virtually no breakdowns or accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, who won a career-best seven times in 1998, has just one  
victory this year. He's also is running well, but luck as not been 
with him. A second-place finisher in both NHIS races last summer, 
he ordinarily would be a threat. 
</P>
<P>
	But Martin broke his right wrist and left leg, and cracked a rib  
when he cut a tire and hit the wall last Friday in the final 
practice session for the Pepsi 400. The next night, he finished 
17th. 
</P>
<P>
	He underwent arthroscopic surgery Wednesday for a tibia plateau  
fracture. A screw was inserted at the kneecap. The severity of the 
injury was detected a day earlier during an MRI. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no doubt in my mind that I will drive this weekend,''  
said Martin, who will wear a brace on the knee. 
</P>
<P>
	He will have Busch Series ace Matt Kenseth standing by should he  
need relief. Martin, a top-five finisher in six of eight races 
since NHIS came on the circuit in 1993, is felling better about the 
other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got a new cast for my wrist that should be more comfortable  
to wear when I drive,'' he said. ``It is adjustable and softer than 
a normal cast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But, given the normal cast of characters, his best might not be  
good enough.

<HEADLINE> Trump Plans To Build Casino in N.J. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- Donald J. Trump is going into the  
casino-building business. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump, who owns three casinos here but didn't build any of them,  
said Friday he will demolish Trump World's Fair casino and build a 
new casino on the 12-acre Boardwalk site next to Convention Hall. 
</P>
<P>
	The new casino-hotel could have up to 4,000 rooms and would cost  
about $750 million. Construction could begin in early 2001, said 
Nicholas L. Ribis, chief executive of Trump's company, Trump Hotels 
&AMP; Casino Resorts Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump World's Fair, a 21-story building that was built as a  
Playboy casino and taken over by Trump in 1989, will be closed in 
the fall to prepare for demolition. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new property will incorporate the best of everything we  
have ever developed before,'' Trump said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his existing Atlantic City properties ``were principally  
designed by others or with partners. They are great properties. But 
they do not fully reflect a Trump signature property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trump Hotels owns Trump Taj Mahal, which was originally built by  
Resorts International; Trump Marina, which was built by Hilton 
Hotels Corp., and Trump Plaza, which was developed in partnership 
with Holiday Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump World's Fair, which opened in 1996, is considered an  
extension of Trump Plaza and operates under its license. 
</P>
<P>
	Trump also owns a Gary, Ind., riverboat casino and has agreed to  
buy the Flamingo Hilton riverboat casino in Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
	How Trump intends to finance the deal is unclear. The company  
has $1.8 billion in relatively high-interest bond debt. 
</P>
<P>
	One possibility is a joint venture, but Ribis declined to  
discuss would-be partners.

<HEADLINE> Fort Dix Closes Refugee Village </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FORT DIX, N.J. (AP) -- U.S. officials marked the closing of the  
refugee village here with a special ceremony Friday as ethnic 
Albanians who fled the Kosovo war expressed their gratitude for the 
sanctuary they received. 
</P>
<P>
	``All you did for us was so great, precious and tremendous. May  
God bless all of you, your families and America. Thank you,'' said 
Aqim Shaqiri, speaking for the refugees through an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
	His words drew a standing ovation from the 500 people who  
attended the hourlong ceremony in the post's muggy Doughboy 
Gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
	A video with refugee children singing ``to you with friendship  
and thanks ... for you have been our refuge of strength'' was shown 
as well as photos of their journey from Kosovo to safety here. 
</P>
<P>
	Military and government officials praised the soldiers,  
government workers and volunteers for their efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been an incredible experience,'' Gen. Thomas A. Schwartz  
said. ``You've done a magnificent job, everybody in this room, and 
I'm proud of you. You gave them hope.'' 
</P>
<P>
	David J. Scheffer, the U.S. ambassador-at-large for war crimes  
issues, said about 200 of the 4,000 refugees who went through Fort 
Dix provided detailed accounts of war crimes, leading investigators 
in Kosovo to a mass grave with 30 to 50 bodies. Scheffer said that 
information is being turned over to U.N. prosecutors in The Hague 
and may lead to additional indictments of war criminals. 
</P>
<P>
	Fort Dix began taking in the refugees on May 5. They were later  
matched with relatives, sponsor families or charity organizations 
for resettlement. Twenty-five departed the post Friday morning to 
meet with sponsoring families in Worcester, Mass., Richfield, 
Minn., and Seattle. The 225 refugees who remain are expected to 
depart for other American communities within the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The refugees have a year to apply for permanent residence if  
they decide they want to stay. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of the families created new American citizens during their  
stay at Fort Dix. Seven babies were born, including a boy who was 
named Amerikan. 
</P>
<P>
	One of those new citizens, dressed in a Winnie the Pooh outfit,  
slept through the whole ceremony Friday in a stroller parked by her 
mother. Marita Bajgora, 27, gave birth to her daughter, Adea, here 
one month ago. Mrs. Bajgora, here with her husband, Agron, and 
their 3 1/2-year-old son said the family hopes to join a brother 
living in Pittsburgh the last two years, learn more English and 
work in this country for a while before returning to their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
	Refugees who have left Fort Dix are adjusting to their new lives  
in America, and many are finding jobs and taking English lessons, 
according to Lavinia Limon, director of the Department of Health 
and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, 700 military personnel and 400 government and  
volunteer workers participated in the resettlement operation. The 
cost of the Fort Dix effort was estimated at less than $25 million, 
according to HHS spokesman Michael Kharfen. 
</P>
<P>
	After all of the refugees leave Fort Dix, the village will  
revert to normal military use, mostly housing and other facilities 
for the thousands of Army reservists who train here each year.

<HEADLINE> Two Mexicans Expelled for Doping </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ASUNCION, Paraguay (AP) - Two Mexican players tested positive  
for performance-enhancing drugs and were expelled from the America 
Cup on Friday by the governing body of South American soccer. 
</P>
<P>
	Routine testing showed traces of anabolic steroids in the urine  
of Paulo Cesar Chavez and Rodrigo Lara after Mexico's 2-1 loss to 
Brazil in the first round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	The Confederation's executive board is to determine the players'  
punishment in its next meeting. The Confederation said Lara showed 
traces of testosterone/Epitestosterone, while Chavez's sample 
contained Nadrolone. 
</P>
<P>
	Team doctor Jose Luis Serrano said the substances also were used  
to fatten cattle and poultry, and suggested that the players may 
have ingested the substances during a recent tour of Brazil, South 
Korea and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	``They are players with a clean and brilliant background. They  
never had any problems,'' Serra said, adding that players are 
submitted to regular testing with their clubs and the national 
team. 
</P>
<P>
	Hugo Kiese, head of the Mexican delegation, requested that the  
Confederation submit the entire team to doping tests. 
</P>
<P>
	The Confederation said that Luis Moreira of Ecuador also had  
tested positive but would not be punished because the banned 
substance was nosedrops, which he used with his doctor's 
permission. Ecuador was eliminated in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Mexico plays Peru on Saturday in the quarterfinals of the  
bienniale tournament, the championship of South American soccer.

<HEADLINE> Ads Aim To Change Image of HMOs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hoping to repair their battered image, HMOs  
are launching a $9 million ad campaign featuring doctors who swear 
their patients get excellent care. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign begins Monday, just as the Senate starts  
considering legislation to impose new government mandates on health 
maintenance organizations and other managed care providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Organizers insist the ads are not aimed at influencing the  
debate in Congress, but rather convincing people that the HMO 
horror stories they've heard do not represent everyday reality. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is standing up for ourselves and saying, `Hey, we've got  
a good product that's serving the consumer,''' said Chip Khan, 
president of the Health Insurance Association of America, one of 
several industry groups that have come together under the Coalition 
for Affordable Quality Healthcare. 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition waged a similar ad campaign last year, comparing  
managed care with traditional insurance plans, suggesting that 
managed care was just as good but cheaper. 
</P>
<P>
	This year's campaign is the first to use doctors to make the  
case, even though many physicians and their associations have 
protested loudly about managed care's restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	The five doctors featured in the ads talk about the strengths of  
managed care, including its emphasis on encouraging preventive care 
and helping patients properly manage their diseases. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think one of the strong points of managed care is not taking  
away care, but in fact giving the right care,'' a California doctor 
says in one ad. Viewers see feel-good images, including children 
playing and a doctor with a baby. 
</P>
<P>
	Each ad ends with the tag line: ``Today's managed health care --  
there's a lot to feel good about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The coalition has already raised $9 million from its members but  
hopes to raise another $ 1 million to $3 million for the campaign, 
said Roger Bolton, an official of Aetna U.S. Healthcare and the 
coalition's president. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the group plans to extend the campaign for at least one  
or two more years, possibly more. 
</P>
<P>
	Others involved in the issue are skeptical that the campaign is  
not intended to influence Congress as debate opens on legislation 
to give consumers and doctors more power in dealing with HMOs and 
other managed care plans. 
</P>
<P>
	``The timing speaks for itself,'' said Dr. Nancy Dickey of the  
American Medical Association, which is lobbying lawmakers on behalf 
of doctors. 
</P>
<P>
	But she also said there is nothing wrong with doctors talking  
about managed care's benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a lot of doctors and some patients out there who  
really do like managed care,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The HMO campaign is similar to one produced by the  
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturing Association, a group of 
drug companies that has been running ads for six years touting the 
benefits of new medicines. 
</P>
<P>
	That drug campaign, which costs about $20 million a year,  
features patients and researchers talking about their positive 
experiences. The group says polling and focus groups have proved 
that the ads are quite effective. 
</P>
<P>
	But the HMO ads has more of an uphill climb, said Jack Trout,  
who runs an advertising and marketing firm in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're out to change people's minds, which is probably one of  
the most difficult things,'' he said, adding that most campaigns 
try to push people in a direction they are already headed. 
</P>
<P>
	The best strategy, he said, is to acknowledge the concerns up  
front and then try to attack them. Some of the HMO adds do just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's taking a while for doctors to warm up to managed  
care,'' a doctor says in one ad. ``It's a change and I think change 
is always frightening.''

<HEADLINE> Brokerage Indicted in Stock Fraud </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- A Florida securities firm and 33 people cheated  
thousands of elderly investors out of nearly $100 million through 
massive stock fraud, prosecutors allege. 
</P>
<P>
	Indictments announced Thursday by city prosecutors contend A.S.  
Goldmen of Naples, Fla., and the individual defendants bilked 
investors by lying to them, performing unauthorized trades, 
ignoring sell orders, forgery and theft. 
</P>
<P>
	One man was cheated out of his life savings of $400,000 and a  
73-year-old retiree lost his life savings and had to return to work 
as a bus driver, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some investors were persuaded to get as much cash as possible  
from their credit cards, or withdraw money from retirement 
accounts, to invest with Goldmen, Morgenthau said. Virtually all of 
that money was lost. 
</P>
<P>
	The defendants, all from New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and  
Florida, face charges including enterprise corruption, grand 
larceny, scheme to defraud, falsification of business records and 
money laundering. 
</P>
<P>
	A.S. Goldmen is no longer in business. The defendants, who are  
all in custody, were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgenthau said A.S. Goldmen was created in 1988 to steal money  
from investors. At its peak in 1994-95, it had more than 300 
brokers and 50,000 customer accounts.

<HEADLINE> Ted Williams and `Jimmy Fund' Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- ``How are you doing, Jimmy baby?'' a smiling Ted  
Williams bellowed. 
</P>
<P>
	The baseball great finally met the man who 51 years ago inspired  
one of the largest cancer funds in the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Jimmy'' was a name used to protect the anonymity of Einar  
Gustafson, then a 12-year-old cancer patient in Boston. The Jimmy 
Fund began after he sang ``Take Me Out To The Ball Game'' on 
national radio from his hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
	The mystery of Jimmy's identity was cleared up last year after  
his sister sent a letter with her annual donation to the Jimmy 
Fund, a Boston Red Sox' charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, Gustafson is a 63-year-old truck driver from New Sweden,  
Maine. On Friday, he couldn't wait to meet the former Red Sox 
great. 
</P>
<P>
	``Who wouldn't want to see Ted?'' said Gustafson, who admitted  
he was a Boston Braves fan until they left town in 1953. 
</P>
<P>
	A few minutes later, Gustafson finally saw him. Williams, a  
supporter of the fund who frequently visited cancer patients, 
walked into the room at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute. 
</P>
<P>
	``After all these years!'' Gustafson said as they chatted for  
about five minutes while minicams rolled, cameras clicked and young 
patients waited to meet Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustafson was one of the earliest patients to be treated with  
chemotherapy. Today, money raised by the Jimmy Fund for research 
has improved youngsters' chances of survival -- youngsters like 
those Williams met Friday at the institute, a mile from Fenway 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is Sheila, Ted,'' said Mike Andrews, Jimmy Fund chairman  
and former Red Sox infielder as he introduced a girl in sunglasses 
who wore a blue mask over her mouth. 
</P>
<P>
	``How are you, sweet thing?'' Williams said. ``I thought you  
were coming in here trying to disguise yourself.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One by one, youngsters walked up to Williams for a handshake, a  
smile and an encouraging word from the Hall of Famer who will throw 
out the ceremonial first pitch at Tuesday night's All-Star game at 
Fenway. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who turns 81 Aug. 30, has problems with his sight and  
sometimes walks unsteadily. But on Friday, he was in a lively mood. 
</P>
<P>
	On the wall behind him and Gustafson was a hand-printed sign in  
blue, orange, brown, pink and purple letters that said, ``Welcome 
Ted!'' and signed, ``Love; The Jimmy Fund Clinic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andrews seemed to put special emphasis on another youngster  
Williams greeted. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ted, this is Ted,'' Andrews said, introducing a boy who had a  
shirt with Red Sox ace Pedro Martinez's last name and No. 45 on the 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	At that, Williams seemed to perk up even more.  
</P>
<P>
	``Look at him. Big, good-looking guy,'' said Williams, wearing a  
red baseball cap and blue polo shirt. 
</P>
<P>
	Several times, he turned his attention back to Gustafson as they  
talked about Maine, where Williams used to fish. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do you know the big warden up there, fish warden?'' he asked.  
``His first or last name is Stanley. What a guy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's how Gustafson feels about Williams.  
</P>
<P>
	``He was a super-duper player,'' Gustafson said. ``Then, when he  
got off the field, he was a super-duper player for the Jimmy 
Fund.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Williams tried to play down his role despite the many  
unpublicized visits he made to patients. But Dr. David Nathan, 
president of Dana-Farber, wouldn't go along. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the greatest guy for watching the ball in the history of  
sport,'' Nathan said. ``All he's ever asked us to do here is keep 
our eye on the ball and the ball is children with cancer and get 
rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
	``And, you know Ted, we're doing that.''  
</P>
<P>
	The Jimmy Fund has played a big role in research into cancer  
treatment for youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
	Gustafson said that when he was treated for non-Hodgkin's  
lymphoma, the survival rate was about 5 percent and now it's about 
85 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, meanwhile, had one question for Ted, the patient who  
bears his name. 
</P>
<P>
	``You're going to be here how long?'' Williams asked. ``You  
don't know yet? Well, I'll bet you're not here too long. It's sure 
nice to see you.''

<HEADLINE> Anderson, Falcons Talk Tough </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- As the Atlanta Falcons' three-day mini-camp  
concluded Friday, coach Dan Reeves issued a deadline in the team's 
contract negotiations with Pro Bowl running back Jamal Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves and Falcons general manager Harold Richardson spoke with  
Anderson's agent, Jim Sims, Thursday night. The Falcons made what 
Reeves described as a final offer, giving Anderson until the 
opening of training camp at the end of this month to accept it. 
</P>
<P>
	``If it isn't done before training camp, then the offer's going  
to be off the table,'' said Reeves, also the Falcons' executive 
vice president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've got to get ready to play. We've got some things we have  
to address and get the people ready who are going to be there. Like 
I said, it's not like he (Anderson) doesn't have a contract.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Falcons open training camp late this month at Greenville,  
S.C. Following a 14-2 regular season and a first appearance in the 
Super Bowl, the franchise is coming off its best season in a mostly 
disappointing 33-year history. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson, due to be paid $2.6 million in the final year of his  
contract, led the NFC with 1,846 yards rushing and 14 touchdowns in 
1998. A five-year veteran and a Falcon his entire career, Anderson 
has rushed for more than 1,000 yards the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Sims are seeking a deal that includes a $10 million  
signing bonus. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've studied those (other NFL) relevant running backs'  
signing bonuses, and we just feel the signing bonus dollar is not 
at a level that is acceptable right now,'' Sims said Friday. 
Atlanta's offer, he added, ``stands at $6 million.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Within the last few years, such NFL running backs as Terrell  
Davis, Barry Sanders, Curtis Martin, Emmitt Smith and Heisman 
Trophy winner Ricky Williams, the top pick in the April NFL draft, 
reportedly received signing bonuses ranging between $9 million and 
$12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We haven't seen a deal (from the Falcons) that isn't  
backloaded,'' said Sims, who is based in Oakland, Calif. ``And it's 
obviously backloaded when you look at the signing bonus and it's 
only $6 million.''

<P>
	Anderson, who has remained home in Salt Lake City, could not be  
reached for comment, though he posted a message Thursday on his 
personal web site. 
</P>
<P>
	``Is Jamal selfish? No,'' Anderson wrote. ``If I was, believe  
me, I would have been using the Super Bowl or the NFC championship 
as a stage to air my contract concerns. What better place to get 
people to listen? 
</P>
<P>
	``Folks, the point is I did not create a market for running  
backs. I just know I belong with them.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims seemed displeased when told how Reeves described the team's  
latest offer as ``take it or leave it'' -- adding that Anderson is 
prepared to stage a holdout during training camp, and possibly the 
entire season. 
</P>
<P>
	As he was preparing to fax another proposal to the Falcons, Sims  
said discussion of the contract's length has fluctuated between 
five and six years. He declined to reveal the terms of the Falcons' 
latest offer. 
</P>
<P>
	``If the deal they have on the table is guaranteed, then we  
might accept that,'' Sims said. ``The problem with the deal on the 
table is that it's severely backloaded. 
</P>
<P>
	``We just want a fairly structured deal,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Reeves pointed out that other Falcons entering the last year of  
their contracts -- like receiver Terance Mathis, center Robbie 
Tobeck and defensive ends Chuck Smith and Lester Archambeau -- are 
negotiating deals while participating in mandatory team workouts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Hopefully, we'll be able to come together at some point,''  
Reeves said, ``but we'll have a difficult time moving much farther 
than where we are right now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sims, who has represented Anderson since his rookie year, also  
indicated his next proposal might be his last. 
</P>
<P>
	``He (Jamal) has laid it down for them on the field for the last  
five years, and he'd like to be rewarded,'' Sims said. ``He's a guy 
that's never, ever received a signing bonus other than his 
seventh-round money, the $23,000. Put it this way: He goes out 
there and bangs heads.''

<HEADLINE> South Pole Researcher To Get Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- A bundle of medical supplies hurtled toward the  
South Pole today aboard an Air Force jet, set to be dropped this 
weekend to a researcher who has discovered a lump in her breast but 
can't get away from the bottom of the world until at least October. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the dead of winter at the South Pole, with constant  
darkness, temperatures as low as 80 degrees below zero and winds of 
more than 60 mph. A landing to evacuate the woman from the 
Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station would be impossible, military 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, a 19-member crew will attempt a precarious air drop  
from the Air Force C-141 Starlifter, shoving six pallets of 
supplies out a side door as they make two or three passes near the 
station. The material will float by parachute 700 feet to the icy 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
	The Starlifter flew Thursday from McChord Air Force Base near  
Seattle to Hawaii, where it refueled at Hickam Air Force Base in 
Honolulu. Then it headed toward Christchurch, New Zealand, 
accompanied by a Hawaii Air National Guard KC-135 aerial refueling 
tanker. 
</P>
<P>
	It was expected to make the eight-hour flight to the pole  
sometime on Saturday, U.S. time. 
</P>
<P>
	The 47-year-old woman, whose name was not disclosed, works for  
Antarctic Support Services, a company that provides services for 
the National Science Foundation station. 
</P>
<P>
	Company spokeswoman Valerie Carroll and others familiar with the  
mission would not give details of the woman's job or say whether 
the lump is cancerous. Ms. Carroll said that the woman had 
undergone a battery of tests, including X-rays and a biopsy, and 
that the results were sent to doctors in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the woman underwent rigorous physical exams before  
leaving in November for a yearlong stint at the station, and would 
not have been allowed to go in ill health. 
</P>
<P>
	The station is 838 miles from the nearest people, at another  
research station. The station is comprised of laboratories and 
living quarters and covered by a geodesic dome; 31 men and 10 women 
are there this winter. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Carroll said she did not have a cost for the Air Force  
mission, but called it ``significant. The supplies are being 
transported halfway around the world,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	She said the drop would also include ``as much fresh food and  
mail to them as we can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Rick Clarfeld, a surgeon at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer  
Research Center in Seattle, has not reviewed the case, but said 
possible treatments could include the anticancer drug tamoxifen or 
intravenous chemotherapy. Both methods can cause a breast tumor to 
stop growing and, in some cases, shrink.

<HEADLINE> Navy May Restore Ties to Tailhook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is considering restoring official  
ties to the Tailhook Association, the naval aviation booster group 
whose 1991 Las Vegas convention produced a sex scandal that focused 
attention on sexual harassment in the military. 
</P>
<P>
	Rehabilitating the Tailhook Association is a remaining piece of  
``unfinished business'' in the Navy's effort to put the scandal 
behind it, Adm. Jay Johnson, the chief of naval operations, said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he has set aside political considerations to weigh  
only the practical question of whether Tailhook belongs back in the 
Navy fold as an organization meant to foster camaraderie and 
professional enrichment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm seriously at work with the leadership of the Tailhook  
Association, working to make sure that we've learned the lessons we 
needed to learn -- which we have -- and that we've institutionalized 
those lessons,'' Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
	In response to the debauchery of the 1991 convention in Las  
Vegas, the Defense Department Inspector General implicated 117 
officers for sexual assault, indecent exposure and other acts, and 
faulted the Navy's leaders for failing to stop the behavior. 
</P>
<P>
	In October 1991 the Navy ended all support ``in any manner  
whatsoever, direct or indirect'' for Tailhook. For several years 
afterward, the Senate required that it be informed of any Tailhook 
participation by any Navy or Marine Corps officer whose nomination 
for promotion was before the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson said he has great confidence that Tailhook's new leaders  
will set the right course. 
</P>
<P>
	If the organization has really changed its ways, ``then I would  
be in a position to support it,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The admiral said he would make a recommendation to Navy  
Secretary Richard Danzig shortly. Other Navy officials, speaking on 
condition of anonymity, said Danzig may approve a modest level of 
official Navy participation in the 1999 Tailhook convention, 
scheduled for Aug. 19-22 in Sparks, Nev. 
</P>
<P>
	Lonny McClung, a retired Navy captain who has been president of  
the Tailhook Association since 1995, said in an interview Thursday, 
``We think the timing is right'' to get back in the Navy's good 
graces. His organization, named for the hook on a plane that snags 
an arresting cable on the landing deck of an aircraft carrier, has 
about 10,000 members -- down from its 1991 peak of about 16,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides its annual conventions, which include professional  
seminars, the group sponsors college scholarships for children of 
former naval aviators and publishes a magazine on carrier aviation 
called Hook. 
</P>
<P>
	The September 1991 convention of Tailhook members at the Las  
Vegas Hilton Hotel triggered the resignation of Navy Secretary H. 
Lawrence Garrett and the early retirement of Adm. Frank B. Kelso, 
then the chief of naval operations. It also led to lawsuits, 
multiple investigations and changes in the Navy -- including more 
emphasis on ethics and sexual harassment awareness and an opening 
of more aviation opportunities for women. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm looking at the organization itself, what their vision is,  
what their commitment is, how they view themselves as we go into 
the 21st century, and what that means for the United States Navy,'' 
Johnson added. 
</P>
<P>
	It is not clear how Congress will react, although Sen. John  
Warner, R-Va., chairman of the Armed Services Committee, wrote to 
Danzig on March 31 urging a restoration of official ties to 
Tailhook. He said it would boost morale and help encourage pilots 
to stay in the Navy and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
	``As long as they keep it clean, above-board and proper,'' then  
Tailhook conventions can be helpful to the Navy, Rep. Ike Skelton 
of Missouri, the ranking Democrat on House Armed Services 
Committee, said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nancy Duff Campbell, of the National Women's Law Center and an  
expert on issues involving women in the military, said in an 
interview she has mixed feelings. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's one thing for them to say it won't happen again, but are  
they treating women aviators with welcoming arms?'' she said. If 
the organization is sincerely committed to supporting women fliers, 
and not just men, then it probably will be beneficial to restore 
official Navy recognition, she said.

<HEADLINE> INS Automation Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Immigration and Naturalization Service  
inadequately managed an automation program slated to cost $2.8 
billion, leading to unexplained delays, spiraling costs and 
uncertainty over whether equipment will perform as required, the 
Justice Department inspector general said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Summarizing a follow-up audit completed this month, Inspector  
General Michael Bromwich said the immigration service ``still does 
not adequately manage these important programs. Consequently, costs 
continue to spiral upward with no justification for how the funds 
are spent.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During fiscal 1995 to 1997, INS spent $800 million on these  
programs, which include computers, cameras to photograph aliens and 
other equipment. Spending for these programs is expected to reach 
$2.8 billion by fiscal 2001. That total is up from the $2.6 billion 
estimate in March 1998, when the inspector general first audited 
the programs. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest dose of bad news for the INS followed quickly on the  
heels of two recent black eyes: Last week, six Cuban migrants 
alleged they were abused and mistreated in INS custody in Florida, 
and late last month the service admitted sending Rafael 
Resendez-Ramirez back to Mexico on June 2 although Houston police 
told INS officials last fall they were looking for him. He is 
wanted for questioning in connection with several murders along 
rail lines. 
</P>
<P>
	The INS' computerized IDENT system, used to check the  
fingerprints of captured aliens and to record lookouts for aliens 
sought by law enforcement, was among those criticized in the new 
audit, despite improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The inspector general found ``INS took significant steps since  
our previous audit to better manage its inventory of automated 
fingerprint identification system equipment; however, we did note 
that IDENT equipment costing $520,000 remained in the INS warehouse 
inventory for more than one year awaiting deployment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Responding to a draft version of the audit, INS Commissioner  
Doris Meissner wrote, ``We agree with all 17 recommendations.'' She 
said the service was moving to implement them. By the release of 
the final report Thursday, one was completed -- the replacement of 
old cameras with new ones. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the audit found three types of management problems:  
</P>
<P>
	--Senior managers had no consistent understanding of the list of  
projects for which they were responsible, so they could not ensure 
they were on time and under cost or met performance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	--Data on project status were not readily available, so neither  
were explanations for why planned tasks were not achieved. ``The 
repeated INS theme was that the real answers to the OIG's questions 
were just one more document, discussion or meeting away,'' the 
audit said. 
</P>
<P>
	--INS failed to implement basic control processes to ensure  
adequate management, so managers did not have schedules for project 
reviews at prearranged milestones or predetermined risk and dollar 
thresholds to identify troubled projects.

<HEADLINE> Cargill Acquisition Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department has approved the merger  
of two major grain traders, provided the companies sell off some of 
their facilities. Still, some lawmakers remain unhappy with the 
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, Sen.  
Tom Harkin of Iowa, called the divestitures ``helpful, but not 
sufficient.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It is obvious that the Department of Justice does not fully  
appreciate the enormous impact this merger will have on American 
agriculture,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department on Thursday approved the acquisition by  
Cargill Inc., North America's second largest grain trader, of 
Continental Grain Co.'s Commodity Marketing Group on the condition 
the companies sell an array of grain and soybean facilities in 
several states. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's antitrust division said the original deal,  
estimated to be worth $300 million, would have illegally reduced 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman, who had asked the department  
to review the deal, estimated the two companies control 42 percent 
of U.S. corn exports, a third of soybeans sold overseas and at 
least 20 percent of wheat exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Farmers Union and some senators also had questioned  
the impact of the original deal. Several senators hailed the 
Justice decision, but some felt the divestitures did not go far 
enough. 
</P>
<P>
	In a complaint filed in U.S. District Court here to block the  
original deal, the Justice Department said it would have eliminated 
an important competitor for the purchase of crops from U.S. farmers 
and elevator operators. 
</P>
<P>
	``Without the divestitures, many American farmers would have  
faced lower prices for major crops they produce, such as wheat, 
corn and soybeans,'' said Assistant Attorney General Joel I. Klein. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Kent Conrad, a North Dakota Democrat who took a group of  
farm state senators to meet Attorney General Janet Reno to protest 
the deal, said, ``I commend her for taking action, but it seems 
like pretty weak tea. ... There needed to be more dramatic 
requirements for divestiture to avoid further deterioration of the 
farmer's leverage in the market.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But another critic of the merger, Sen. Chuck Grassley, an Iowa  
Republican, said the divestitures ``will satisfy the antitrust 
concerns.'' Grassley urged Klein to visit Iowa to learn the impact 
of such mergers. Sen. Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., said, ``Even with 
the divestiture, ... this merger may bring yet more concentration 
to agriculture.'' He promised to study the revised deal and send 
comments to the judge who must approve it. 
</P>
<P>
	The Justice decision comes on the heels of approvals by  
regulatory agencies in Canada and the European Union and clears the 
way for completion of the deal, Cargill said. 
</P>
<P>
	The department said the ability of farmers and other suppliers  
to sell wheat, corn and soybeans to storage elevators in the 
country, at rail terminals, along rivers and at ports would have 
been harmed by combining competing Cargill and Continental 
elevators in the Pacific Northwest, central California and the 
Texas Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
	The government also alleged the original deal would have reduced  
competition to buy grain and soybeans from farmers in Midwestern 
states, including Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri and Ohio, where 
Cargill and Continental operate competing river elevators and rail 
terminals. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation of Cargill and Continental elevators along the  
Illinois River with the Continental elevator in the port of Chicago 
would have concentrated ownership of delivery points authorized by 
the Chicago Board of Trade for settlement of corn and soybean 
futures contracts under the control of Cargill and one other firm. 
This would have increased the risk that prices for Board of Trade 
futures contracts could be manipulated, the government said. 
</P>
<P>
	Usually the government worries that merging companies will boost  
prices, but here, Klein said, ``we were concerned about the ability 
of the combining companies to artificially depress the price they 
pay suppliers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cargill, headquartered in Minnetonka, Minn., is the largest  
privately owned business in the United States. In 1998, it had 
total revenues of $35 billion, including grain revenues of $9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	With about 80,600 employees, Cargill sells, processes and  
distributes agricultural, financial and industrial products in 65 
countries and has business activities in 130 additional countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Continental, based in New York City, is the fifth largest grain  
trader in North America. In 1998, it had grain revenues of $5.5 
billion, and total revenue of $16 billion.

	Some past Supreme Court rulings on police work:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Carroll vs. U.S., 1925: Law enforcement officers can search

	Storms remained over parts of the Great Lakes and Ohio Valley  
early today as a system moving east across those areas promised 
more wet weather later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong to severe storms, some with the potential for heavy  
downpours, damaging winds and hail, were expected over areas of 
Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, Ohio and into northern New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of Wisconsin and Minnesota on Thursday dealt with high  
winds that toppled trees and power lines. Residents in both regions 
reported tornado sightings as houses in many areas had their roofs 
ripped off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Look at all the damage,'' said Mark Sondergaard, surveying  
crushed campers and snapped trees at a campground in Medary, Wis. 
``The sky was green, the whole ground shook. I've never seen 
anything like it.'' 
</P>

of the Tennessee Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Areas of rain and scattered thunderstorms also were forecast  
across the Gulf States through the Carolinas and in east Tennessee. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan Tests Experimental Aerotrain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese researchers have begun testing an  
experimental model of a high-speed train they say will be easier on 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
	The new ``aerotrain'' has been developed at a cost of 10 million  
yen (about $81,900), Yasuaki Ohama, a professor of aerodynamics at 
Tohoku University, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The experimental train has four horizontal wings, similar to  
those on airplanes, and uses solar and wind energy. Researchers 
will try to run an unmanned model at a speed of 310 miles per hour, 
Ohama said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ohama said the train will be environmentally friendly, reducing  
emissions to near zero. It will run 6 inches above the ground at a 
speeds similar to magnetically levitated trains under separate 
development. 
</P>
<P>
	The team plans to conduct a test on a manned aerotrain in five  
years after repeating unmanned experiments on a test track in Hyuga 
in southwestern Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese railway officials have been testing a magnetically  
levitated linear motor train on a test track in central Japan, 
reaching speeds of 343 mph in one run in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Japan is home to some of the world's fastest passenger trains.  
The shinkansen ``bullet train'' run up to 186 mph and have reached 
maximum speeds of 275 mph in test runs.

	SIDNEY, Ohio (AP) -- Police today hunted for a suspect in the  
shooting deaths of three teen-age girls and that of a 37-year-old 
man in this western Ohio community. 
</P>
<P>
	The suspect, Michael Hensley, 30, was considered extremely

Toledo. to take over a staff with a 5.20 ERA and 35-50 record 
heading into its weekend series with Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tigers, 20 1/2 games behind Cleveland in the AL Central, are  
10th among AL teams in ERA and 12th in saves. The lead the league 
in hitting batters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't blame Rick for where we are,'' general manager Randy  
Smith said. ``But when you have a chance to make a change you do 
it, and then you deal with how the public reacts to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said he thinks Warthen, who is familiar with most of the  
Tigers' current pitchers, might be a more effective communicator. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not that Rick was a bad pitching coach, but I think  
sometimes a different perspective or voice can get through to these 
guys,'' Smith said. ``We felt we could be better, and when you 
think you can be better you make the move.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining the Tigers, Warthen, 46, spent five seasons  
coaching in the San Diego Padres organization, including two years 
as pitching coach for the major league club. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm elated to have the job,'' Warthen said. ``It's a nice  
situation because I know these guys.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Adair, 41, had been the Tigers' pitching coach since Sept. 12,  
1996, when he replaced Jon Matlack. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's tough,'' manager Larry Parrish said. ``Rick was a friend  
of mine and still is. I'm sure people will read (scapegoat) into 
it, but we don't feel that way. I don't think we can blame the 
season on Rick. That would be a total fallacy to say that it's 
Rick's fault.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Warthen said his first priorities were to get consistency from  
the staff's middle relievers and turn the starters into leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I firmly believe starters have to establish the inside part of  
the plate,'' Warthen said. ``With our starters there's no reason we 
can't get six or seven innings on a consistent basis.''

<HEADLINE> Alitalia Ends Deal With Controllers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ROME (AP) -- After six months of offering Italy's air traffic  
controllers and their families half-price tickets on all national 
and international flights, Alitalia said Friday it was ending the 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the accord, signed last December, the air traffic  
controllers national association Enav guaranteed that virtually all 
Alitalia flights would be punctual. 
</P>
<P>
	The previously unannounced agreement was reported toda in the  
Milan newspaper Corriere della Sera and confirmed by an Alitalia 
official who spoke on condition of anonymity. She declined any 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The newspaper said Alitalia's executive director Giovanni  
Sebastiani blamed the controllers for failing to keep Alitalia's 
planes flying on time and canceled the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Enav is in charge of regulating the air traffic in Italy's  
skies, for Alitalia as well as for any other airline flying in or 
out of the country. Enav officials failed to return several 
telephone calls by The Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Italy's transportation sector has been rocked by strikes in  
recent days, even though an air traffic controllers strike 
scheduled Saturday at Palermo's airport in Sicily was called off. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, many trains stood idle as railway workers' staged a  
strike to protest government plans to cut jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, Meridiana, Italy's main private airline, will cancel  
22 flights if its pilots and flights attendants stick to their 
plans to strike for four hours. Meridiana mainly links Sicily and 
Sardinia, both popular summer destinations, to the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Sunday, ground personnel in Milan's Malpensa, an  
international hub, and Linate are set to start a 48-hour strike 
that will go through Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	Premier Massimo D'Alema said Friday that the government will  
take all the necessary measures to guarantee regular flights for 
the rest of the summer, but he didn't elaborate.

<HEADLINE> SLA Fugitive Waives Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- A woman who for years lived the life of a  
``soccer mom'' admitted today she is Symbionese Liberation Army 
fugitive Kathleen Soliah and agreed to return to California to face 
24-year-old bombing conspiracy charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Jane Olson signed an extradition waiver in front of Ramsey  
County District Judge Kathleen Gearin. She signed the waiver: 
``Kathleen Ann Soliah/Sara Jane Olson,'' Gearin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson will not contest her identity, her attorney, Howard  
Bass, confirmed. Ms. Olson will be flown to Los Angeles on Monday 
or Tuesday. A bail hearing is set for Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think she is relieved to be going back to California and to  
be closing this chapter of her life,'' Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
	``She is Sara Jane Olson ... regardless of the name that she was  
born under,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson smiled and waved at her husband and three daughters  
and blew them a kiss before leaving the courtroom this morning. Ms. 
Olson's physician husband, Gerald Peterson, refused to comment 
outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say Ms. Olson, 52, is a typical ``soccer mom'' and  
occasional actress who has led an exemplary life of service to her 
family, church and community. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ms. Olson wants to put this matter behind her as quickly as  
possible so she can be reunited with her husband and daughters, 
return to St. Paul and resume her volunteer work in the 
community,'' Bass said. 
</P>
<P>
	Soliah was sought for murder conspiracy charges, accused of  
placing pipe bombs under two Los Angeles police cars in 1975. They 
did not go off. The bombs were allegedly in retaliation for a 
shootout with police the year before in which six members of the 
SLA -- the notorious leftist group that kidnapped newspaper heiress 
Patricia Hearst -- were killed. 
</P>
<P>
	She could face a life sentence if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	The FBI says the question of whether Soliah and Ms. Olson are  
the same person was answered by a fingerprint match four hours 
after she was arrested June 16 while driving near her St. Paul 
home. The arrest followed tips from viewers of ``America's Most 
Wanted,'' which had featured Soliah in May. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Olson was denied bail in Minnesota courts and Bass said he  
had received no assurances bail would be set in Los Angeles County. 
But he said he has ``every reason to believe'' reasonable bail will 
be set.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Buying American Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Allstate Corp., moving aggressively to  
expand beyond its core property and casualty business, is buying 
workers' insurance company American Heritage Life Corp. for $1.1 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest publicly traded insurer said Friday it  
would pay $32.25 in stock or cash for each American Heritage share 
-- a 20 percent premium over American Heritage's closing price on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate also will assume the Florida-based company's  
obligations for redeemable preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
	On the news, American Heritage shares shot up more than 15  
percent, rising $4.12 1/2 to $31.06 1/4 a share on the New York Stock 
Exchange, where Allstate rose 50 cents to $37.31 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate, based in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, has moved  
in recent months under the tenure of chief executive Ed Liddy to 
use its large independent agent network to sell items other than 
car and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock has trailed the market performance as  
investors note the heavy competition Allstate faces in the property 
and casualty business. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the company has announced plans to sell  
variable annuities in partnership with others and on its own. And 
it purchased the personal insurance division of CNA Financial Corp. 
for $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Liddy, in a recent interview with The Associated Press, said  
Allstate can compete with Internet rivals and fast-growing 
companies such as Geico by using its 15,000 agents' rapport with 
existing customers to expand beyond core lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sticking with our knitting, focusing on who and what we  
are,'' Liddy said. ``But we're also trying to reach more customers 
that we've not been able to reach before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There are some folks who believe you can sell products like  
ours over an 800 number and into a call center,'' he said. ``We 
would like an agent to know you and your neighborhood, to know your 
life cycle and (be someone) who can meet all your insurance needs 
on a value-added basis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existing management of American Heritage Life will continue  
to run the business under the present brand name, and the 
headquarters will remain in Jacksonville, Fla., Allstate said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Heritage had operating profits of $36.4 million last  
year on revenue of $480 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate expects the transaction to be completed by the end of  
the year. As part of the agreement, shareholders owning 
approximately 39 percent of the outstanding American Heritage 
common stock agreed to vote in favor of the acquisition and against 
any other proposed acquisition from a third party for six months. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said it would buy back an amount of its own shares  
equal to those issued to buy Heritage.

to deep left-center to drive in Womack and tie it at 7.

<HEADLINE> Poverty Programs Aimed At Places </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	America's war on poverty has been fought mostly with programs  
for poor people. But since the 1960s, some presidents also have 
launched an array of initiatives to revitalize depressed areas. 
</P>
<P>
	JOHNSON: Created the Department of Housing and Urban Development  
and the Office of Economic Opportunity. Started the Model Cities 
Program, which gave cities money to tear down old buildings and 
replace them with new housing and commercial projects. Funded urban 
renewal in ghetto areas by providing money for housing, social 
services, job training and community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
	NIXON: Started the Community Development Block Grant Program,  
which still provides lump sums to cities for redevelopment projects 
determined by local officials. 
</P>
<P>
	CARTER: The Urban Redevelopment Action Grant program gave  
assistance to targeted economic development projects in urban 
areas. Signed the Community Reinvestment Act, the first major 
program to fight discrimination by mortgage lenders. Set up an 
office at HUD to focus on revitalizing neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	REAGAN: Slashed funds for community development, triggering  
greater support from the private sector and foundations. Offered 
low-income housing tax credit that provided tax breaks for 
businesses to invest in low-income housing. During his two terms, 
many states set up enterprise zone programs to foster economic 
activity in poor neighborhoods with tax subsidies and regulatory 
relief for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	BUSH: Started a program of block grants to cities for housing  
rehabilitation and development. 
</P>
<P>
	CLINTON: Launched empowerment zones -- which are economically  
disadvantaged areas that offer tax relief to attract new business 
and provide housing redevelopment and enhanced local services. Gave 
extra funding to community development corporations. Gave cities 
approval to dismantle old public housing development projects and 
replace them with townhouses and single-family homes for the poor.

<HEADLINE> Former ADM Executives Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Mark Whitacre, a former Archer Daniels Midland  
Co. executive who secretly recorded his colleagues conspiring to 
fix prices of a widely used livestock feed additive, was sentenced 
to 2 1/2 years in prison Friday for his participation in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other executives, including the son of the chairman of the  
food-processing giant, were sentenced to two years in federal 
prison and fined $350,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Andreas, the executive vice president of the  
self-proclaimed ``supermarket to the world,'' and Terrance Wilson, 
the retired head of its corn division, were calm as the sentence 
was imposed by U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, Wilson and Whitacre were convicted in September of  
conspiring with Japanese and Korean rivals to fix the $600 million 
world market in lysine, a soybean-based feed additive that promotes 
the growth of hogs and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre, 41, is already in federal prison in Edgefield, S.C.,  
serving a nine-year sentence for swindling ADM out of $9 million. 
He was sentenced by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have no case without me, against ADM and its  
executives,'' Whitacre said in his call to the court. ``I risked my 
life and my career for them, and I have yet to see anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre, the former chief of ADM's bioproducts division, served  
as an undercover informant for the FBI to gather evidence against 
Andreas, 51, and Wilson, 60. He later broke with the FBI and the 
government accused him of taking part in the crime he had helped to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas' attorneys insisted that the tapes Whitacre made  
contained nothing to show he had taken part in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, whose father Dwayne Andreas built ADM into a worldwide  
agribusiness empire, said before he was sentenced that he was 
``truly sorry for everything that this trial has meant.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I love this country, your honor, and I thought I knew its  
rules,'' Andreas said. ``I did not want to commit a crime and did 
not think I had committed one.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Attorneys for Wilson, who is heard on tape discussing lysine  
prices with ADM rivals, argued that he was merely playing along 
with Asian manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM, based in Decatur, deep in central Illinois' corn and  
soybean country, has paid a $100 million fine and settled three 
antitrust lawsuits for an additional $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Manning made 10 months of Whitacre's term concurrent with  
the sentence he is serving. As a result, he will get 20 additional 
months in prison. Whitacre, who has tried several times to commit 
suicide, also must undergo mental health treatment upon release. 
</P>
<P>
	Manning could have sentenced Andreas and Wilson to as many as 2 1/2  
years in prison, but she told the court she gave them lower terms 
in part because of their community involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	``Both of them are wonderful family men, wonderful members of  
the community,'' the judge said.

<HEADLINE> House GOP Tax Cuts Outlined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Income taxes would drop modestly for all  
Americans under a broad package outlined Friday by the Senate's top 
Republican tax writer and intended to appeal to middle-class 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
	By proposing to cut the bottom 15 percent tax bracket to 14  
percent by 2001 and omitting House GOP-sought cuts in capital gains 
taxes for investors, Sen. William Roth, R-Del., hopes to attract 
some Democratic support -- or at least blunt attacks that 
Republicans favor the rich. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead of an across-the-board cut skewed heavily toward people  
with high incomes, Roth said his proposal would give people with 
modest incomes a greater percentage cut in taxes than it would the 
wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
	``My tax cut plan, which incorporates proposals that have  
significant bipartisan support, would cut taxes for millions of 
Americans and address the biggest financial challenges faced by 
individuals and families,'' said Roth, chairman of the Senate 
Finance Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The plan, using roughly $792 billion in budget surpluses over 10  
years, would make numerous other tax law changes: increasing 
individual retirement account contribution limits from $2,000 to 
$5,000 a year and removing income limits on those contributions, 
eliminating the ``marriage penalty'' that strikes millions of 
two-income couples and boosting tax breaks for people paying for 
care of a child or elderly relative. 
</P>
<P>
	Many items are similar to those in an emerging $850 billion  
House tax relief plan, but Roth did not include capital gains rate 
cuts or an education IRA for private elementary and secondary 
schools -- both opposed by Democrats and President Clinton. Roth 
also left out the eventual repeal of inheritance taxes sought by 
the House, but aides said the senator plans to add a less ambitious 
version. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bill Archer, chairman of the House Ways and Means  
Committee, which initiates all tax legislation, has dished out 
pieces of his bill this week and intends to announce the income tax 
component Saturday, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Ways and Means Committee is scheduled to begin moving the  
House tax bill next week, followed by the Senate Finance Committee 
a week later. GOP leaders hope to complete work on a compromise 
measure by early August, but avoiding a presidential veto will be 
much harder. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans insist that a big chunk of the budget surpluses  
projected at $2.9 trillion over 10 years should be used to cut 
taxes, with most of the rest going to shore up Social Security. 
Clinton and the Democrats agree on Social Security, but they favor 
using the surplus for a much smaller tax cut, reforms in Medicare 
and higher spending in such areas as education. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv called the Senate plan a  
``massive tax cut'' that would siphon money away from these 
``urgent national priorities,'' although he did not use the word 
veto. 
</P>
<P>
	Although every taxpayer would benefit some from Roth's proposed  
cut in the 15 percent income tax bracket, those currently paying 
only at that rate would gain the most. Roth estimated that those 
people would see an average reduction of 7 percent, or $450 for a 
family of four earning between $55,000 and $60,000 gross a year. 
</P>
<P>
	For 1999, the 15 percent rate applies to the first $25,750 in  
adjusted gross income for a single person, $43,050 for a married 
couple filing jointly. About 70 million people file tax returns at 
only that rate. 
</P>
<P>
	Archer said Friday that the House bill will include a measure to  
gradually phase down and eventually repeal estate and gift taxes at 
a cost of about $70 billion over a decade. This is a top priority 
for key GOP constituencies such as small business operators and 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Archer did not release details, sources familiar with  
the draft proposal said it would reduce tax rates in increments of 
1 percentage point in the early years, then increase the annual 
cuts to 2 percentage points. Repeal would come at the end of the 
10-year period. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clearly, no American should have to visit the undertaker and  
the IRS in the same week,'' Archer said.

<HEADLINE> Allstate Buying American Heritage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORTHBROOK, Ill. (AP) -- Allstate Corp. is buying workers'  
insurance company American Heritage Life Corp. for $1.1 billion as 
it continues to expand beyond its core property and casualty 
business. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest publicly traded insurer said today it would  
pay $32.25 in stock or cash for each American Heritage share -- a 20 
percent premium to American Heritage's closing price on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate also will assume the Florida-based company's  
obligations for redeemable preferred shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate, based in the Chicago suburb of Northbrook, has been  
moving aggressively this year under the tenure of chief executive 
Ed Liddy to use its large independent agent network to sell items 
other than car and life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock has trailed the market performance as  
investors note the heavy competition Allstate faces in the property 
and casualty business. 
</P>
<P>
	In recent months, the company has announced plans to sell  
variable annuities in partnership with others and on its own. And 
it purchased the personal insurance division of CNA Financial Corp. 
for $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Liddy, in a recent interview with The Associated Press, said  
Allstate can compete with Internet rivals and fast-growing 
companies such as Geico by using it 15,000 agents' rapport with 
existing customers to expand beyond core lines. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're sticking with our knitting, focusing on who and what we  
are,'' Liddy said. ``But we're also trying to reach more customers 
that we've not been able to reach before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The existing management of American Heritage Life will continue  
to run the business under the present brand name and the 
headquarters will remain in Jacksonville, Fla., Allstate said. 
</P>
<P>
	American Heritage had operating profits of $36.4 million last  
year on revenue of $480 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate expects the transaction to be completed by the end of  
the year. As part of the agreement, shareholders owning 
approximately 39 percent of the outstanding American Heritage 
common stock agreed to vote all in favor of the acquisition and 
against any other proposed acquisition from a third party for six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Allstate said it would buy back an amount of its own shares  
equal to those issued to buy Heritage.

<HEADLINE> KN Energy To Buy Kinder Morgen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKEWOOD, Colo. (AP) -- KN Energy Inc. is buying Houston-based  
pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc. for $506 million in stock. 
</P>
<P>
	If the deal announced yesterday is approved by regulators, the  
combined companies will operate under the name Kinder Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	It is unclear where the new company will be based or how  
employees from both companies will be affected. 
</P>
<P>
	``We will take a look at where people need to be and make  
decisions based on those evaluations,'' KN executive vice president 
Rick Wells said. 
</P>
<P>
	KN Energy is the nation's second-largest operator of natural-gas  
pipelines and storage, with 3,300 workers nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder Morgan operates one of the largest pipeline systems in  
the nation and has 1,100 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, KN will issue 41.5 million shares of new stock  
and assume $148 million in debt to acquire the outstanding shares 
of the privately held Kinder Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinder Morgan president Richard D. Kinder will become chairman  
and CEO of the new company when the merger closes. KN chairman 
Larry Hall has resigned and board member Stewart Bliss has been 
named interim chairman. 
</P>
<P>
	Since its proposed merger with Sempra Energy fell apart on June  
21, KN Energy has seen its stock drop from more than $20 a share to 
a 52-week low of $12.19 Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Wells said the deal with Kinder Morgan will help provide a  
strong cash flow and give KN ``an alternative source of earnings 
that is much more stable.''

<HEADLINE> Jury Clears Tobacco Cos. in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Two days after a jury in Florida found  
the tobacco industry responsible for making smokers sick, a 
Louisiana jury cleared two cigarette makers of any responsibility 
for the death of a lifelong smoker. 
</P>
<P>
	Robert Gilboy's widow and three children claimed that cigarettes  
are an unreasonably dangerous product and sought $840,000 in 
damages -- $10,000 for every month of the seven years Gilboy lived 
after being diagnosed with lung cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But the jury rejected the claims against R.J. Reynolds and  
American Tobacco on Friday after a three-week trial in state court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the jury just exercised common sense,'' said Reynolds  
attorney Ted Grossman. ``Mr. Gilboy smoked all of his life, having 
heard and believed that smoking could shorten his life. And, we 
proved he didn't develop the disease from smoking.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After the verdict, Gilboy's widow, Toni, walked over to Grossman  
and said with a smile, ``You were my worst nightmare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has not decided whether to appeal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I don't care what the jury said,'' Mrs. Gilboy said. ``I still  
think smoking caused his death.'' 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds called the verdict a significant victory that  
``confirms that juries are still able to apply common sense and 
reasonable judgment regarding tobacco lawsuits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, a Florida jury handed the tobacco industry a major  
setback by finding cigarette companies responsible smoking-related 
illnesses. The industry could be forced to pay billions in damages 
in the class-action case. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. juries have awarded damages in smoking liability cases only  
five times -- three were overturned on appeal. In the two others, 
the awards were reduced by judges and the verdicts are being 
appealed. 
</P>
<P>
	In the Louisiana case, Gilboy's family argued that he was so  
hooked on cigarettes that he kept smoking even after the lung 
cancer had spread to his brain and he had to use a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not the act of a person in control of his  
facilities,'' said attorney Gere Covert. ``Cigarettes had control 
of him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco company attorneys said Gilboy knew the risks and chose  
to smoke. They also said he would have died whether he smoked or 
not because a scar on his lung caused his cancer -- not smoking, as 
the family contended. 
</P>
<P>
	They also said Gilboy was cancer-free when he died in 1993 at  
age 64. 
</P>
<P>
	The judge instructed the jury to consider whether cigarettes  
caused Gilboy's death -- not whether smoking was a factor. 
</P>
<P>
	Jury foreman Albert Taylor said the ``evidence was too cloudy''  
to say that cigarettes were the only cause of death.

<HEADLINE> McEnroe To Enter Tennis Hall of Fame </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT, R.I. (AP) -- Love him or hate him, John McEnroe will be  
inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	An iconoclast who combined brilliant play with boorish behavior,  
McEnroe clashed with the authorities of tennis. He argued line 
calls and slammed his racquet. 
</P>
<P>
	Along with a temper, McEnroe had talent.  
</P>
<P>
	``You couldn't ask for a better partner,'' said Peter Fleming,  
who combined with McEnroe to win seven Grand Slam doubles titles. 
``There were several times that we disagreed, but as a whole he was 
a great team player. 
</P>
<P>
	``They say the reason Larry Bird, Magic Johnson and Michael  
Jordan were so great is that they made the players around them 
better. John was like that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe burst onto the tennis scene at the 1977 French Open,  
winning the mixed doubles with Mary Carillo as an amateur. 
</P>
<P>
	By 1980, at 21, he became the youngest player to achieve the  
world's No. 1 ranking. 
</P>
<P>
	During his career, the left-hander won 77 singles titles, 77  
doubles titles, seven Grand Slam singles titles, 10 Grand Slam 
doubles titles and was the world's No. 1 player from 1981-84. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not the biggest. I'm not the strongest. I'm not the  
fastest,'' McEnroe said when chosen for the Hall of Fame earlier 
this year. ``The effort and intensity and understanding of 
technique and doing something adventurous -- that's what I'd like to 
be remembered for. 
</P>
<P>
	``I bought some energy to the sport, a style of play not  
duplicated almost at all. I feel I was a good athlete, in some ways 
underrated. I had reasonable attributes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe left tennis in 1986 to concentrate on his personal life.  
</P>
<P>
	For all the wins, including a stellar Davis Cup career,  
McEnroe's most memorable match was his epic, five-set loss to Bjorn 
Borg of Sweden in the 1980 Wimbledon final. 
</P>
<P>
	Even McEnroe lists the match as his proudest moment,  
</P>
<P>
	``It showed me, but it also showed a lot of other tennis  
players, that even in losing, you can elevate your status,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	That match, along with his court flair and tantrums, elevated  
his worldwide popularity. 
</P>
<P>
	``Walking down the street with him in 1981, I doubt if there  
were five more recognizable people in the world,'' Fleming said. 
``In any country, people would react -- and they'd all react 
differently. The guy has an electricity about him that not many 
people have.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McEnroe is playing again. He teamed with Steffi Graf to reach  
the mixed doubles semifinals at Wimbledon this year before Graf 
pulled out to concentrate on singles. He is ranked third on the 
senior tour. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining McEnroe in the Hall of Fame will be Ken McGregor, the  
Australian Davis Cup star who also was part of the only duo to win 
a men's doubles Grand Slam. 
</P>
<P>
	The pair will boost the Hall of Fame membership to 172.  
</P>
<P>
	McGregor was the perfect gentleman, befitting the time in which  
he played. He was a Top 10 player from 1950-52, and won the 1952 
Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	But it was in doubles that he made his biggest mark, winning the  
Grand Slam with Hall of Famer Frank Sedgman in 1951 and narrowly 
missing a repeat in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
	McGregor also was an exceptional Davis Cup player, helping  
Australia win the Cup from 1950-52.

<HEADLINE> Austin Powers Banned in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- The Austin Powers sequel was too  
hot, baby, for the Malaysian censors. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Film Censorship Board in the predominantly Muslim  
country banned ``The Spy Who Shagged Me'' this week. Its members 
decided that there was too much sexual innuendo and that cutting it 
out would disrupt the flow of the movie, the Star newspaper 
reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The filmmakers couldn't have been surprised, since the comedy is  
packed with sex jokes and double-entendres. The word ``shag'' is 
British slang for sex. 
</P>
<P>
	Rolf Mittweg, head of international marketing at New Line  
Cinema, which released the comedy, said last month that the 
Malaysian censors wanted to change the title to ``The Spy Who ... 
Me.''

<HEADLINE>  Theo Fleury Signs With Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Theo Fleury has always lived and played out  
West. Now, he'll take his considerable hockey skills to the Big 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move they hope will help fill the void created by the  
retirement of Wayne Gretzky, the New York Rangers announced on 
Thursday the signing of Fleury, a 31-year-old, six-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really spent any quality time out East,'' said  
Fleury, a 5-foot-6 right wing who is the Calgary Flames' career 
scoring leader. ``The West is all I know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a western Canadian kid and I feel at home there. But it  
didn't take a lot of convincing. In the end, the Rangers showed the 
most interest and, as a player, that's what you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury said he talked with Gretzky about playing for the  
Rangers, who have missed the playoffs the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pointed out the good things about New York and talked about  
his experiences of playing in New York,'' said Fleury, who played 
all or part of 11 NHL seasons with the Flames before being traded 
to the Colorado Avalanche in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is reportedly for three years and $24 million, with  
the Rangers holding an option for a fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of three years it will give me a good idea if I can  
keep playing,'' Fleury said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there was a no-trade clause in the contract  
``because I'm a guy, who likes to know where I'm going to be from 
year to year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The no-trade clause is reportedly for the first two years of the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche did not want to give Fleury a no-trade deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no bitter feelings against Colorado at all,'' he said.  
``I was excited to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury had five goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games for the  
Avalanche, who were beaten by Dallas in seven games of the Western 
Conference finals. He had 40 goals and 53 assists in 75 games 
during the regular season. He has 374 goals and 480 assists in his 
regular-season career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also signed 33-year-old Valeri Kamensky, a left wing  
from the Avalanche, and 30-year-old Stephane Quintal, a defenseman, 
who played for the Montreal Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Morgan in Contention at Senior Open  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WEST DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- The bottom line is the best way to  
measure Gil Morgan's second round Friday in the Senior Open. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan shot a 1-under 71, one stroke higher than his opening  
round, moving him to 3-under for the tournament. He was tied for 
third with Leonard Thompson and Bob Duval, four strokes behind 
leader Ed Dougherty and one behind Dave Eichelberger. 
</P>
<P>
	With 13 victories in his first three years on the Senior PGA  
Tour, Morgan has more than $10 million in career earnings. While he 
hasn't needed to fall back on the optometrist's license he 
maintains, Morgan is eager to win again. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last month or two, I have had at least three tournaments where  
I was within a shot or two of the lead at the conclusion,'' Morgan 
said. ``It's just one of those situations where it hasn't worked 
out this year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This week, I'm beginning to feel more comfortable with my  
game,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan started two strokes off the lead Friday. He didn't  
exactly overhaul the leader board. 
</P>
<P>
	He made par on the first six holes before going to 3-under with  
a birdie on the par-4 seventh. He gave it back with a three-putt 
bogey on the par-5 ninth after hitting a wedge too fat on the 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
	At the 11th and the 15th, Morgan stood over eagle attempts that  
didn't fall but he still saved birdies each time. He got another 
birdie after sticking a 9-iron within four feet on the 160-yard 
14th. 
</P>
<P>
	``That is just way too far to hit a 9-iron most of the time,''  
Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
	On the 16th, a 383-yard par-4, Morgan's approach found the back  
of the green, leaving him about 45 feet to the hole. He chipped 
over a slight rise and into a wide gulley, and the ball rolled 12 
feet past the flag. Then his par putt came up an inch short. 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan, who also bogeyed the 13th, missed a 15-foot birdie putt  
on the 17th and a 12-footer on the 18th. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't a sexy round but this is Iowa, not Hollywood. So far,  
Morgan's effort has rivaled the work of a corn farmer: consistent, 
cautious, patient and ultimately productive. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a few opportunities that I couldn't cash in,'' Morgan  
said. ``But all and all, I think it was a pretty good day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Morgan credited a layout at Des Moines Golf and Country Club  
that he said is well suited to his game. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have given us a little bit of room in the fairways, which  
is good,'' he said. ``I think that plays to my strength of being 
able to drive the ball.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As many players had predicted after the practice rounds, par has  
turned out to be a solid score. If Morgan maintains his consistency 
through the weekend, he's got a good shot at winning. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senior Open champ gains an exemption to next year's U.S.  
Open at Pebble Beach. That's where, in the 1992 U.S. Open, Morgan 
led during the third round at 12-under but faded and finished 13th. 
</P>
<P>
	``My game is not nearly as good as it was at that point,''  
Morgan said. ``It would be fun to go back to Pebble Beach. At the 
same time, I wouldn't give myself a real good chance of playing at 
that caliber.''

<HEADLINE> Former ADM Executive Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- A former Archer Daniels Midland Co. executive who  
secretly recorded his colleagues conspiring to fix prices was 
sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison Friday for his participation in the 
scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Whitacre, 41, was sentenced by telephone. He is at a  
federal prison in Edgefield, S.C., serving a nine-year sentence for 
swindling the food-processing giant and self-proclaimed 
``supermarket to the world'' out of $9 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Two other top ADM executives, Michael Andreas and Terrance  
Wilson, awaited sentencing later Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, 49, is the son of Dwayne Andreas, the politically  
connected retired ADM chairman who in the 1960s built the company 
into a global empire. At one point, Michael Andreas was considered 
heir to the top spot at ADM. 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas, Wilson and Whitacre were convicted in September of  
conspiring with Japanese and Korean rivals to fix the $600 million 
world market in lysine, a soybean-based additive that promotes 
growth in hogs and poultry. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitacre, the former chief of ADM's bioproducts division,  
originally went undercover and wore a wire for FBI investigators 
but later broke with them. The government turned around and accused 
him of taking part in the crime he had helped to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM itself has paid a $100 million fine and settled three  
antitrust lawsuits for an additional $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would have no case without me, against ADM and its  
executives,'' Whitacre said in court over the phone. ``I risked my 
life and my career for them, and I have yet to see anything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andreas' attorneys insisted that the tapes Whitacre made  
contained nothing to show he had taken part in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
	Wilson, 60, is the retired head of ADM's corn division.  
Attorneys for Wilson, who is heard on tape discussing lysine prices 
with ADM rivals, argued that he was merely playing along with Asian 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Blanche Manning made 10 months of Whitacre's  
term concurrent with the sentence he is serving. As a result, he 
will get 20 additional months in prison. He has tried several times 
to commit suicide.

<HEADLINE> SLA Fugitive Waives Extradition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) -- The mother of three children acknowledged  
Friday that she is former Symbionese Liberation Army radical 
Kathleen Ann Soliah and agreed to be sent to Los Angeles to face 
conspiracy charges that could mean life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	The 52-year-old woman signed an extradition waiver with the  
names Kathleen Ann Soliah/Sara Jane Olson. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Soliah had spent 23 years as a fugitive before FBI agents  
acting on a tip from ``America's Most Wanted'' captured her last 
month in St. Paul, where she was living as an actress, a doctor's 
wife and the mother of three daughters. 
</P>
<P>
	She is accused of placing pipe bombs under two Los Angeles  
police cars in retaliation for a 1974 shootout with police in which 
six SLA members were killed. The bombs did not go off. The SLA was 
the radical group that kidnapped Patricia Hearst. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Theo Fleury Signs With Rangers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Theo Fleury has always lived and played out  
West. Now, he'll take his considerable hockey skills to the Big 
Apple. 
</P>
<P>
	In a move they hope will help fill the void created by the  
retirement of Wayne Gretzky, the New York Rangers announced on 
Thursday the signing of Fleury, a 31-year-old, six-time All-Star. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've never really spent any quality time out East,'' said  
Fleury, a 5-foot-6 right wing who is the Calgary Flames' career 
scoring leader. ``The West is all I know. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm a western Canadian kid and I feel at home there. But it  
didn't take a lot of convincing. In the end, the Rangers showed the 
most interest and, as a player, that's what you want.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury said he talked with Gretzky about playing for the  
Rangers, who have missed the playoffs the last two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``He pointed out the good things about New York and talked about  
his experiences of playing in New York,'' said Fleury, who played 
all or part of 11 NHL seasons with the Flames before being traded 
to the Colorado Avalanche in March. 
</P>
<P>
	The contract is reportedly for three years and $24 million, with  
the Rangers holding an option for a fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	``At the end of three years it will give me a good idea if I can  
keep playing,'' Fleury said. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said there was a no-trade clause in the contract  
``because I'm a guy, who likes to know where I'm going to be from 
year to year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The no-trade clause is reportedly for the first two years of the  
deal. 
</P>
<P>
	The Avalanche did not want to give Fleury a no-trade deal.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have no bitter feelings against Colorado at all,'' he said.  
``I was excited to be in the playoffs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Fleury had five goals and 12 assists in 18 playoff games for the  
Avalanche, who were beaten by Dallas in seven games of the Western 
Conference finals. He had 40 goals and 53 assists in 75 games 
during the regular season. He has 374 goals and 480 assists in his 
regular-season career. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rangers also signed 33-year-old Valeri Kamensky, a left wing  
from the Avalanche, and 30-year-old Stephane Quintal, a defenseman, 
who played for the Montreal Canadiens.

<HEADLINE> Report: Pentagon Police Force Flawed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The special police force that protects the  
280-acre Pentagon reservation along the Potomac River is beset with 
management problems, fuzzy lines of authority and low morale, 
according to a Defense Department evaluation. 
</P>
<P>
	The department's inspector general found, for example, that the  
Defense Protective Service does not comply with its own policies on 
firearms. It has no master inventory for weapons, and as a result 
the inspector general could not determine how many weapons were 
missing, lost or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
	The evaluation reported confusion among officers about their  
authority and how they should interact with other law-enforcement 
agencies. The Pentagon acknowledged the problems but said they have 
since been corrected. 
</P>
<P>
	Issued in May but only recently distributed, the report was  
based on an investigation done in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The service, created in 1987, has about 330 employees including  
about 265 officers. 
</P>
<P>
	In several cases, Pentagon officers exceeded their  
law-enforcement authority, according to the report. One involved a 
Pentagon officer stopping a car for speeding on a highway off the 
Pentagon's grounds. The officer was later arrested by Fairfax 
County police for impersonating a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
	The report noted that the Defense Protective Service took steps  
to improve its physical fitness requirements after Defense 
Secretary William Cohen complained in January 1998 that he was 
``frequently unimpressed with the personal appearance of some of 
the members of the force.'' The inspector general concluded a 
continuing physical fitness testing system was not needed. 
</P>
<P>
	The report applauded the Pentagon police service for its plan  
for dealing with civil disturbances and terrorist acts, saying the 
FBI has identified the plan as a model for all federal agencies. 
But it noted that one Defense Protective Service supervisor 
estimated if more than 100 protesters arrived at the Pentagon for a 
demonstration, outside law-enforcement help would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
	Morale among Pentagon police is ``generally low,'' the report  
found, in part because many are unsatisfied with the pay and 
retirement systems and because of racial and gender divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	In a written response to the inspector general's report, the  
Pentagon's director for administration and management, D.O. Cook, 
acknowledged that morale was low at the time the inspection was 
done in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``The very makeup of the force itself has undergone significant  
change since that time,'' Cook wrote. He noted that more than 20 
officers had taken voluntary retirement, and five others were 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe we are on the way to becoming a topnotch police  
force,'' he wrote.

<HEADLINE> Famous Chicken, Barney End Fight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN DIEGO (AP) -- A legal tug-of-war between Barney the purple  
dinosaur and the Famous San Diego Chicken may have finally come to 
an end. 
</P>
<P>
	A panel of three federal judges has upheld the dismissal of a  
patent infringement lawsuit brought by Barney's owners, Lyons 
Partnership LP, against Ted Giannoulas, who performs comedy skits 
at sporting events as the Famous San Diego Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons objected to a Giannoulas skit in which the chicken  
pretended to beat up a purple dinosaur. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney's people, who sought up to $100,000 in damages, claimed  
the performance was a trademark infringement because the dinosaur 
costume used in the act resembled the TV Barney. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was dismissed last year, with a judge saying the  
Chicken's routine was clearly a parody. The three-judge appeals 
panel unanimously rejected Lyons' appeal. 
</P>
<P>
	Lyons was also ordered to pay Giannoulas' legal fees. His  
attorney said Thursday they amount to about $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
	A spokeswoman for the partnership said the company has not  
decided whether to appeal to the Supreme Court.

<HEADLINE> Asian Delegates Stage FIFA Protest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Wanting another spot in the 2002 World Cup,  
Asian nations walked out of a FIFA meeting Friday and threatened to 
boycott qualifying for the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia had three automatic berths in last year's tournament and  
got another berth when Iran won a playoff with Australia, the 
Oceania champion. FIFA's executive committee gave Asia four spots 
for 2002: two for co-hosts Japan and South Korea, and two for 
qualifiers. 
</P>
<P>
	Asia complained, and FIFA was set to approve a deal in which the  
14th and final team in European qualifying would have a playoff 
against the third team in Asian qualifying. But the Asian Football 
Confederation is insisting on spots for its top three qualifiers 
and wants South America to give up a berth. 
</P>
<P>
	``FIFA as an institution can't give in to this kind of  
pressure,'' FIFA president Sepp Blatter said. ``If we do, we will 
die as an institution. This can not be accepted.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Europe received 15 spots (including one for defending champion  
France), Africa got five and the North-Central America and 
Caribbean region was given three. South America has four, and its 
fifth-place team plays the Oceania champion for another spot. 
</P>
<P>
	Lennart Johansson, president of the Union of European Football  
Associations, said he expects FIFA's executive committee to meet 
soon to address the matter. The 2002 World Cup qualifying draw is 
Dec. 7 in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have sufficient time to resolve this,'' AFC general  
secretary Peter Velappan said. ``This is not such a serious 
issue.''

<HEADLINE> Magazine Party Plans Afloat Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The party's back on for Talk magazine.  
</P>
<P>
	The city torpedoed plans to hold the magazine's coming-out gala  
at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, in part because the first issue's cover 
might feature Hillary Rodham Clinton, a potential rival for Mayor 
Rudolph Giuliani in next year's Senate race. 
</P>
<P>
	Now the event has been moved to Liberty Island, federal property  
that is home of the Statue of Liberty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're thrilled to have the Statue of Liberty,'' said Tina  
Brown, editor of the magazine owned by Miramax Films and Hearst 
Magazines. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials for the National Park Service said a permit for the  
Aug. 2 party would be issued in about five days. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a couple of things that need to be finalized, like  
timing and assurance that the event won't impact the regular 
visitor experience,'' said Michael Conklin, events coordinator for 
Liberty Island. 
</P>
<P>
	The 800-person guest list will include Giuliani, a Miramax  
spokeswoman said. The mayor has not said whether he will attend. 
</P>
<P>
	The original party plans were denied primarily because the  
Brooklyn Navy Yard is unsuitable for such an event, Deputy Mayor 
Randy Levine said last month. 
</P>
<P>
	But he admitted that Mrs. Clinton's involvement also played a  
part. ``There was the possibility that this thing would turn into a 
circus,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Miramax has said no decision had been made about who would be on  
Talk's inaugural cover. 
</P>
<P>
	This was not the first time the Giuliani administration has  
tussled with a magazine. In 1997, the city yanked ads from city 
buses that said New York magazine was ``Possibly the only good 
thing in New York Rudy hasn't taken credit for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	City lawyers cited a state law preventing people from having  
their names or faces in ads without their permission. The magazine 
sued, saying its free speech rights were violated. Courts sided 
with the magazine.

<HEADLINE> Red Wings Sign Goalie Wregget </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- The Detroit Red Wings, who have lost three  
goaltenders since March, on Friday signed free agent Ken Wregget to 
a multi-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Wregget, 35, began last season as Calgary's starting goalie. He  
missed much of the season with injuries, however, and compiled a 
10-12-4 record with a 2.53 goals-against average and a .906 save 
percentage. 
</P>
<P>
	Terms of the contract were not announced.  
</P>
<P>
	Wregget is a 15-year NHL veteran who has also played for  
Toronto, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where he was the backup when 
the Penguins won their second straight Stanley Cup in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings were looking for a veteran backup for Chris  
Osgood. 
</P>
<P>
	The Red Wings waived veteran Bill Ranford after the season  
ended, allowing the team to shed his $3.1 million salary for next 
season. Ranford played well in place of Osgood in two playoff games 
against Colorado, but played poorly in the next two. 
</P>
<P>
	Norm Maracle was picked by Atlanta in the expansion draft and  
Kevin Hodson was traded to Tampa at the trade deadline. The Red 
Wings have two other minor league goalies under contract.

<TEXT>
<P>
	STUTTGART, Germany (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG will put its  
Mercedes-Benz SLR high-performance sports car into production with 
British racing partner McLaren Cars Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLR, which blends styling cues from Mercedes' successful  
Formula One race cars and the German automaker's classic 
``gullwing'' roadster of the 1950s, will be built at a new plant in 
Woking, England. A concept version of the car was shown at this 
year's Detroit auto show. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler said Friday the two companies will invest $200  
million in the project. The car is scheduled to go on sale in 2003, 
with production limited to about 500 cars annually. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-seat SLR will be powered by a supercharged V8 engine  
rated at 544 horsepower. It will feature body panels made of carbon 
fiber and other high-tech materials, as well as gullwing doors that 
flip up rather than out. 
</P>
<P>
	Primary markets for the SLR are expected to be the United  
States, Europe, Japan and the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Leaves 166 Dead in Kashmir </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MUSHKOH VALLEY, India (AP) -- After weeks of fierce combat,  
Indian soldiers cleared nearly all Pakistan-based fighters from the 
mountains in one sector of northern Kashmir, a military spokesman 
said today. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first time Indian forces claimed to push the rebels  
back to the cease-fire line that divides Kashmir between India and 
Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ninety-nine percent of the intrusion has been cleared in  
Batalik,'' army spokesman Col. Bikram Singh said in New Delhi, 
referring to the easternmost of the four battle sectors in the 
Himalayan mountains of Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	Singh said about 90 percent of a second sector, Dras, had also  
been cleared. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, two days of fighting in fertile Muskhoh Valley, 65  
miles to the southwest of Batalik and some four miles from 
Pakistan's border, has left at least 120 guerrillas and 44 Indian 
soldiers dead -- the highest casualty in a single operation since 
fighting in the disputed province began in early May, Indian 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	The reports coincided with a statement by Pakistan's  
Cabinet-level defense committee asking Muslim insurgents to ``help 
resolve'' the crisis, which was seen as an implicit call for the 
rebels to withdraw from positions in Indian-controlled Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
	The statement said the guerrillas should allow ``the world  
community to play its role'' to solve the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	The meeting in Islamabad was chaired by Pakistani Prime Minister  
Nawaz Sharif, a day after he returned from Washington, where he 
promised President Clinton he would take ``concrete steps'' to end 
two months of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Religious groups staged rallies in major Pakistani cities today  
to protest Sharif's pledge. Shouting ``down with Nawaz Sharif'' and 
``traitor Nawaz Sharif,'' the protesters burned his effigies after 
beating them with their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	India captured the Muskhoh peak Thursday and held off a  
counterattack overnight, in a ferocious battle for crucial 
positions which the army says control the supply route from 
Pakistan to the fighters in the Indian mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee told reporters in the  
eastern city of Gauhati that troops have ``successfully repulsed 
most of the Pakistani intruders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The situation will become normal as soon as Pakistan decides  
to withdraw its people from the Kargil and Dras sectors,'' Vajpayee 
said. ``Our soldiers are alert and we shall see to it that they 
leave our land soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Air force jets pounded rebel positions in the Dras sector this  
morning, an air force spokesman said in New Delhi. He said the air 
strikes were successful, but gave no details. 
</P>
<P>
	He denied a statement by the Pakistani military that Indian jet  
fighters intruded twice into Pakistani territory, where Pakistani 
air force jets scrambled to engage them. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian soldiers suffered setbacks in the Kaksar region. Fighting  
has raged for days over the Bajrang Post, one of the barren 
mountains where resistance has been fierce. At least two dozen 
Indian soldiers have been killed in the Kaksar region in recent 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	India says Pakistani troops are leading the fighters in Kashmir,  
a region divided between the two countries and claimed in its 
entirety by both. Islamabad, however, denies that, saying the 
fighters are Kashmiri insurgents that receive only moral support 
from Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
	On Thursday, Indian army commanders showed The Associated Press  
three sacks of letters, maps of Indian army field guns and 
identification cards of Pakistan's Northern Light Infantry regiment 
that troops said they recovered from the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	India said Thursday that 639 Pakistani soldiers and more than  
150 Islamic guerrillas have been killed in the fighting so far, 
while 321 Indian soldiers have died, 451 were wounded and 10 were 
missing.

<HEADLINE> Crash Felt Calm for Some Riders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EAGLE LAKE, Texas (AP) -- To Marie Smith, the derailment of  
Amtrak's Sunset Limited was like a bump in the road, no big deal. 
It was much more frightening at the front of the train. 
</P>
<P>
	``We felt the cars in front of us banging into each other and  
then saw the car in front of us tilt and go flying sideways,'' said 
Ann Johnson, 51, of Glendora, Calif., traveling with her 
21-year-old daughter, Kristen. ``When we looked out the window, we 
saw the engine coming toward us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty of the 235 people aboard were taken to the hospital  
Thursday afternoon after the train collided with a truck at a rural 
crossing about 60 miles west of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	The train, on its way from Los Angeles to Orlando, Fla., along  
one of the nation's main east-west rail links, slammed into the 
truck carrying a salt water disposal tank. The train's two engines 
and eight of 13 cars were torn from the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
	The lead locomotive was thrown onto its side, and rescuers broke  
its windshield to pull the engineer and a trainee from the 
wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
	The engineer was the most seriously injured and remained  
hospitalized today in stable condition with a head injury. His 
condition was not considered life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
	Three train passengers were hospitalized overnight and were  
expected to be released today. Others were released Thursday after 
being treated for minor bumps and bruises and boarded buses for 
Houston, the train's next scheduled stop. 
</P>
<P>
	The truck driver, whom police identified as Jason Bubela, 21,  
was not seriously hurt. Police were looking into potential charges 
against him, but none were immediately filed. 
</P>
<P>
	Passengers in the front of the train fared worst.  
</P>
<P>
	``All of a sudden, the train jerked back and forth, back and  
forth, and there were big noises,'' said Fatima Talebi, 52, of 
Irvine, Calif. ``I knew something was going to happen. I heard a 
lot of yelling and praying.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But those at the back seemed as if they had been aboard another  
train. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was fairly calm,'' said Ms. Smith, 24, of Dublin, Ireland,  
who was seated near the end. ``We just walked to the exit.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the uninjured passengers were Cindy McCain, wife of  
Republican presidential candidate and Arizona Sen. John McCain, and 
their son, Jack, 13. 
</P>
<P>
	Cranes righted the derailed cars and crews repaired 800 feet of  
damaged track before it reopened today. The track is used daily by 
about 28 trains. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sunset Limited was involved in the worst accident in  
Amtrak's 28-year history. On Sept. 22, 1993, 42 passengers and five 
crew members died when the train plunged off a bridge into a bayou 
near Mobile, Ala. The bridge had been damaged minutes earlier by a 
towboat. 
</P>
<P>
	In March, Amtrak's City of New Orleans ran into a truck at a  
crossing in Bourbonnais, Ill., killing 11 people and injuring more 
than 100.

<HEADLINE> Running Hall of Fame To Induct Four </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UTICA, N.Y. (AP) -- Billy Mills, the surprise winner of the  
10,000 meters at the 1964 Olympics, and Francie Larrieu Smith, a 
five-time Olympian, head a class of four to be inducted into the 
National Distance Running Hall of Fame Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining them will be running pioneer Nina Kuscsik, the first  
women's winner of the Boston Marathon, and 91-year-old Johnny 
Kelley, a two-time winner of the Boston Marathon. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills produced one of the biggest upsets in Olympic history,  
winning the 10,000 at Tokyo. He defeated favorite Ron Clarke of 
Australia, setting an Olympic record of 28 minutes, 24.4 seconds -- 
46 seconds faster than his previous personal best. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills, an Oglala Lakota born on the Pine Ridge Reservation in  
South Dakota, helped form Christian Relief Services, which raises 
$15 million for American Indian youth, African charities and other 
causes. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrieu Smith, 46, ran on boys' teams in high school at Fremont,  
Calif., and never received a college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no such things as scholarships, and there were no  
programs in my high school,'' said Smith, who set 36 American 
records and 12 world bests at distances from 1,000 to 10,000 
meters. 
</P>
<P>
	Larrieu Smith, honorary chairwoman for the Susan G. Komen Breast  
Cancer Foundation ``Race for the Cure,'' was inspired in part by 
her brother, Ron Larrieu, who was a member of the 1964 Olympic team 
with Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	Kuscsik, who was the first two-time women's winner of the New  
York City Marathon, was instrumental in developing rules that paved 
the way for American and Olympic women's marathon championships. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a meeting in 1970,'' said Kuscsik, who was diagnosed  
with breast cancer 20 years ago. ``We decided our goal was to 
either have women be allowed to run, or they'd have to call it a 
men's marathon. I did what I did, and I'm glad I did it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley is the grand old man of road racing. He saw his first  
Boston Marathon in 1921, and ran the race for the first time in 
1928. He didn't finish, but he completed the Boston Marathons 58 
times in 61 starts. He won in 1935 and 1945 and finished second 
seven times. 
</P>
<P>
	Kelley, who ran Boston the last time in 1992 at 85, was a  
national champion 11 times in the marathon, 15,000 meters, 20,000 
meters and 25,000 meters from 1937-1954. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he competed long before it was possible to make a  
living as a distance runner, Kelley has no regrets. 
</P>
<P>
	``I never made any money running,'' he said. ``But I'm the  
richest athlete in the world.''

<HEADLINE> Manhattan Full of Football Players </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MANHATTAN, Kan. (AP) -- Instead of heading home and eating mom's  
cooking, more than 100 Kansas State Wildcats, members of the most 
disappointed major college football program of 1998, have elected 
to stay on campus and work. And work. And work. 
</P>
<P>
	They're lifting weights, running wind sprints and doing  
conditioning drills under the broiling Midwestern sun, all on a 
``voluntary'' basis because requiring them to stick around would be 
a violation of NCAA rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a lot of goals we want to achieve and it just shows  
you, with all these guys here, how serious we are,'' said kicker 
Jamie Rheem. ``We're working out together as a team, trying to 
achieve something as a team. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the lockerroom the other day on the board there was a  
message that said, `Please pick your towels. Yesterday there were 
111 towels picked up,'' said Rheem. ``So there were probably more 
than 100 people working out. That's good.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know how many people they have working out this summer  
at Kansas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While exact figures are not available, a Kansas spokesperson  
said between 60 and 75 players are spending the summer working out 
in Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
	What happened to the Wildcats in the last two games of what was  
almost a magical season was nightmarish. Had they held a 
fourth-quarter lead over Texas A&AMP;M in the Big 12 title game, they, 
and not Florida State, would have met Tennessee for the national 
title. But they lost in overtime and then lost to Purdue in the 
Alamo Bowl, again squandering a fourth-quarter lead. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding to their embarrassment, they had been saying they did not  
deserve to go all the way down to the Alamo Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	``The way I look at it now, no offense, but we bombed the last  
two games,'' said fullback Johnno Lazetich, a transfer from Oregon 
State who sat out last year. 
</P>
<P>
	``I go back home and people say, `Hey, you guys kinda blew those  
last two games.' That's how the whole darn nation looks at you,'' 
Lazetich said. ``Basically, people think we're losers. A lot of 
people think we were lucky. I'd like to go out there with something 
to prove. I'm really ready.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the Wildcats could hardly bring themselves to watch the  
Fiesta Bowl between Tennessee and Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was tough,'' said Rheem. ``I was just kind of in and out of  
the room. It was weird. I wanted to watch it, but then again I 
didn't want to watch it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the players working out in Manhattan is David Allen,  
who's moving over from kick returner to running back. 
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't left,'' he said. ``I've been here ever since school  
got out, on May 17. A few guys have gone home for a couple of days 
or a week. But most of us have been here the whole summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It means a lot when you see 100 guys working out, lifting  
weights during the course of the summer. That means a lot of guys 
are dedicated to this team.''

<HEADLINE> Abu-Jamal Said Admitted Killing Cop </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- A prison volunteer says death row inmate  
Mumia Abu-Jamal -- who has denied murdering a police officer -- told 
him he regretted killing the man, Vanity Fair magazine reports in 
its August issue. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Bloch, who befriended Abu-Jamal through his work with the  
prison reform organization Pennsylvania Prison Society, told the 
magazine he came forward because of his ``disgust'' with the 
tactics of those who believe Abu-Jamal was wrongly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Black Panther and radio reporter was convicted of  
killing Daniel Faulkner during a traffic stop in 1981. Police found 
the dying officer and a wounded Abu-Jamal lying near his own gun, 
and several witnesses identified Abu-Jamal as the gunman. 
</P>
<P>
	Abu-Jamal says he is innocent and blames his conviction on a  
biased judge and an ineffective lawyer. His effort to win a new 
trial has become a worldwide cause celebre. 
</P>
<P>
	During the early 1990s, Bloch said he and Abu-Jamal discussed  
subjects from prison life to philosophy. Once, Bloch said, while 
discussing whether violence was acceptable in the name of one's 
beliefs, he asked Abu-Jamal whether he regretted killing Faulkner 
and received a one-word reply: ``Yes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a long pause,'' Bloch told Vanity Fair. ``I think we  
probably realized what he had just done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch said he did not ask Abu-Jamal to elaborate.  
</P>
<P>
	``It wasn't something I planned in advance,'' he said. ``It was  
just in the flow of the conversation. The opportunity to ask such a 
question came up, and I asked it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bloch, 47, now a substitute teacher, did not discuss the  
conversation for seven years. He said he wanted to come forward 
because Abu-Jamal's supporters began to disturb him. 
</P>
<P>
	``Maureen Faulkner (the officer's widow) is being subjected to  
such calumny. They're trying to vilify the memory of her husband 
and make it seem like he was some rogue cop,'' Bloch told Vanity 
Fair. ``That's disgusting enough. I see the level of hatred that's 
being aroused in people towards the police. And I think it's just 
crossed a line.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Bloch nor Abu-Jamal's attorney, Leonard Weinglass,  
immediately returned telephone calls Thursday from The Associated 
Press. Police declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The development ``clearly restates what we have known all along,  
and that is that Mumia Abu-Jamal is guilty beyond all doubt and the 
evidence is overwhelming,'' said Cathie Abookire, spokeswoman for 
the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Faulkner, who said she has spoken to Bloch by telephone,  
praised him for his bravery in coming forward and said she has no 
doubts about his story. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been weighing on his conscience for many years,'' she  
told the AP from California, where she now lives. ``It wasn't easy 
for him to come forward, but he had the courage and the integrity 
to do it.''

<HEADLINE> Asian Stock Markets Close Mixed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian stock markets ended the week mixed  
Friday, with the key index slipping in Tokyo on profit-taking. 
</P>
<P>
	The Japanese benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average lost 29.92  
points, or 0.17 percent, closing the week at 17,937.73. On 
Thursday, the average gained 8.75 points, or 0.05 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices opened lower following an overnight drop on Wall Street,  
where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 60.47 points to 
11,126.89 at Thursday's close. 
</P>
<P>
	Hiroichi Nishi, general manager at Nikko Securities, said the  
Tokyo stock market was adjusting after the Nikkei average has risen 
about 2,000 points between May and July. On Monday, the Nikkei 
index hit nearly a two-year high of 18,135.06 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Nikkei has entered a consolidation period after closing  
above its near-term target of 18,000,'' said Tatsuo Kurokawa, 
deputy general manager at Nomura Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar was quoted at 122.66 yen  
in late afternoon, up 0.28 yen from late Thursday in Tokyo and 
slightly higher than its late New York level of 122.61 yen 
overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean shares rebounded sharply following Thursday's fall,  
with the key index rising above the 1,000-point mark on buying by 
local institutional investors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Korean Composite Stock Price Index rose 28.82 points, or 2.9  
percent, to 1,027.93, it highest level since Dec. 24, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Thai share prices also rebounded from sharp losses the previous  
day when the key index plunged 3.8 percent following an 
announcement by Thai Farmers Bank that it plans to raise capital by 
issuing more shares for sale. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, the Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 12.93  
points, or 2.6 percent, to 509.58. 
</P>
<P>
	In Hong Kong, share prices closed generally mixed in moderate  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	The Hang Seng Index, the Hong Kong market's key indicator of  
blue chips, slipped 3.73 points, or 0.02 percent, to close at 
14,222.57. On Thursday, the index had lost 31.14 points, or 0.2 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Brokers said the index moved up and down all day before slipping  
at the close on concerns about fund-raising activities by blue-chip 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors have been selling in the past two days on rumors that  
more companies are planning to tap the market for funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: Shares closed higher despite some late profit-taking.  
The Straits Times Index rose 21.77 points, or 1 percent, to 
2,181.63. 
</P>
<P>
	TAIPEI: Share prices closed lower on profit-taking. The market's  
key Weighted Stock Price Index fell 42.16 points or 0.5 percent, to 
8,550.27. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand share prices closed higher for a fourth  
straight day, led by commodity stocks on expectations of improving 
demand from Asia. The NZSE-40 Capital Index rose 15.78 points, or 
0.7 percent, to 2,209.99, the first time it has closed above the 
2,200-point mark since May 17. 
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine shares closed lower as investors took  
profits. The Philippine Stock Exchange Index of 30 selected 
companies fell 17.46 points, or 0.7 percent, to 2,594.72. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: The Australian stock market closed lower on  
profit-taking in most sectors following strong gains earlier in the 
week. The All Ordinaries Index fell 45.3 points, or 1.5 percent, to 
3,041.0. 
</P>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR: Malaysian share prices closed higher. The  
benchmark Composite Index rose 4.31 points, or 0.5 percent, to 
851.67. 
</P>
<P>
	JAKARTA: Indonesian shares closed lower, with market sentiment  
dampened by political uncertainty because of the slow vote count 
after the June 7 general election. The Composite Index fell 0.5 
percent, or 3.610 points, to 656.644.

<HEADLINE> Court Rejects Ballot-Label Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The California Supreme Court has closed the  
book on the ``scarlet letter,'' an initiative that would have 
declared on voting ballots whether lawmakers seeking election had 
supported term limits. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled unanimously Thursday that Proposition 225,  
approved by 52 percent of state voters in 1998, was 
unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure was a backdoor attempt to amend the U.S.  
Constitution, a task that is reserved for Congress and state 
legislatures, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
	The initiative ordered California legislators to support a  
federal constitutional amendment that would limit House members to 
three two-year terms, and senators to two six-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
	If they didn't support it, legislators and members of the  
state's congressional delegation would have an inscription 
alongside their names on future ballots reading, ``Disregarded 
voters' instruction on term limits.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Proposition 225 was scheduled to take statewide effect in the  
primary election next March. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonly known as ``scarlet letter'' laws because of the ballot  
brand, the initiatives have been struck down by courts in eight 
other states on a variety of grounds, including free speech, voting 
rights and interference with the constitutional amendment process. 
</P>
<P>
	Two years after California voters limited state legislators'  
terms in 1990, they approved another measure limiting terms of 
their congressional delegation, similar to laws in many other 
states. But the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a measure from 
Arkansas in 1995, ruling that states could not regulate 
congressional terms.

<HEADLINE> Keyshawn Seeks Major Commerce in LA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Tall and dapper in a tan business suit,  
Keyshawn Johnson stood quietly at the back of the crowd, listening 
to President Clinton talk about the need for inner-city investment. 
</P>
<P>
	Then the New York Jets wide receiver heard his own name uttered  
alongside Magic Johnson's as an example of someone effecting 
positive change on the rundown streets of south-central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Keyshawn Johnson is poised to launch a $53 million commercial  
retail center on 23 acres of neglected land. Along with his 
partners in Capital Visions Corp., Johnson has worked on the 
project in relative secrecy for months and plans to unveil it July 
20. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the only time I'll have a break,'' he explained. Before  
long, his football career will beckon. 
</P>
<P>
	``In South-Central L.A., this hasn't been done in decades,''  
Johnson said, a diamond earring glistening in his left ear. ``I'm 
doing it because it needs to be done. And I know what it takes to 
get this thing done. I was born and raised here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It is the kind of social investment from well-heeled athletes  
that Rep. Maxine Waters, D-Calif., said is desperately needed all 
over the country. She happily announced Johnson's retail 
development plan Thursday, during a panel discussion at Southwest 
College that closed out Clinton's four-day, cross-country tour on 
poverty. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are so proud of these athletes who are coming back to our  
community, who are investing in the community,'' Waters said. 
``Magic Johnson is doing a fabulous job, but he can't do it all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Magic Johnson, the former Los Angeles Lakers star who has been  
building multiplex movie theaters in inner cities, said he feels 
the focus that Clinton placed on poverty will make it easier to get 
the ears of corporate America about work like that he and Keyshawn 
Johnson are doing. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is not at all about talk anymore,'' Magic Johnson said.  
``For the first time, I know something is going to happen.'' He 
then gave a direct appeal to CEOs: 
</P>
<P>
	``The suburbs are all built out now. It's overbuilt. The only  
place you can go is the urban communities,'' he said. ``Train these 
young people. They want a job. They're hungry to work. ... Come 
into the inner city. You'll find that you'll make a lot of money, 
and you'll do a lot of good at the same time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said athletes also should be encouraged by the example  
of former All-Pro football star Mel Farr, now a Detroit car dealer 
who is helping create other minority-owned dealerships and 
establishing flexible leases so low-income people can have cars. 
</P>
<P>
	Anchored by nationwide companies such as Home Depot and  
McDonald's, Keyshawn Johnson said his proposed Chesterfield Square 
will bring 300 jobs to an area where the young people are 
especially hungry for opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what those kids are feeling like, what those kids are  
feeling inside,'' Johnson said, pointing to the 18- to 23-year-old 
single mothers and former gang members participating in a panel 
discussion with Clinton. He's experienced those same hard knocks 
they were describing to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	What they feel, Johnson said, is isolation from the mainstream  
of American life. He said they have a sense that nobody cares about 
their futures and are frustrated over not finding work that pays 
livable wages. They also want the nicer simplicities of life -- 
Starbuck's Coffee, for example -- without having to go all the way 
to the suburbs to find them. 
</P>
<P>
	So Johnson set out to give that to them. He cobbled together a  
bank loan, private funding, a government-backed loan from the Small 
Business Administration and some of his own money, then began 
dreaming about major retailers -- grocery stores, pharmacies, 
restaurants, coffee shops -- with small stores sandwiched between 
them, serving his home community. 
</P>
<P>
	The commitments from Home Depot and McDonald's are solid,  
Johnson said, but he's still negotiating with other major retail 
companies. He wants to be sure he can attract the right ones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't want just anybody coming here. I want to take what's  
in the suburbs and put it there,'' Johnson said. ``I mean, what's 
wrong with our dollars, you know?''

<HEADLINE> At Tall People's Meeting, Room Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GREEN TREE, Pa. (AP) -- Sure, they count supermodels and  
basketball stars among their kin. But tall people's lives aren't 
always a walk in the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
	Just ask 6-foot-3-inch Joan Carruthers -- or any of her 200 peers  
at this year's Tall Clubs International convention near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
	``Try doing the dishes on a regular basis when the sink only  
reaches your thighs,'' said Ms. Carruthers, whose 6-foot-10-inch 
husband has to hunch even further. 
</P>
<P>
	The five-day Tall Clubs event, which runs through Sunday, offers  
participants a chance to socialize, share their woes and urge 
businesses to do such things as reduce prices on custom-made 
clothing and shoes. Over the years, the group has also called for 
longer hospital beds, more leg room on planes and bigger cars. 
</P>
<P>
	``Car shopping is `Can I fit in it?''' Ms. Carruthers said.  
</P>
<P>
	``Who cares what it looks like?'' added Jan Bjornson, her  
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall people also have larger organs, which is why the club urges  
members to designate themselves as transplant donors. The group 
also sponsors scholarships for tall young people. 
</P>
<P>
	Tall Clubs began with a young woman named Kae Sumner, who was  
hired to paint dwarfs for the Disney studios but got ``tired of 
hitting her knees on the table,'' Carruthers said. In 1938, Sumner 
wrote a newspaper column about the problems of being tall, inviting 
others to contact her. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Tip Toppers Club was founded, and other groups  
sprang up around the country. Tall Clubs International has become 
the modern-day umbrella group, with 4,500 members in North America. 
</P>
<P>
	And no short people allowed: Women must be 5-foot-10 and men  
must be 6-foot-2 to join. 
</P>
<P>
	``It sure makes you comfortable in your own skin,'' Ms.  
Carruthers said of the club. 
</P>
<P>
	It's also great support in a world full of jabs at tall people.  
When people ask Ms. Carruthers if she plays basketball, she asks if 
they play miniature golf. 
</P>
<P>
	While there are some laughs, group members say the need for  
better accommodations for tall people is serious. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, when Sandy Allen, listed by th eGuinness Book of  
World Records as the world's tallest woman, arrived at the 
Pittsburgh airport for the convention, she had to get down on the 
plane's floor, scoot out backward and leave via a hydraulic 
catering lift. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had to go to the bathroom on that plane, forget it,'' she  
said. At 7 feet, 7 3/4 inches, she is now using a wheelchair because 
of poor circulation, atrophied leg muscles and other health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	As a teen, she was teased by boys and ignored by girls. Now, she  
talks with youngsters to offer a hopeful message: ``It's OK to be 
different. The people who stand back and point at me, they're the 
ones I feel sorry for.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's just one thing she really wishes for: a pair of  
pantyhose that fit. ``Thigh highs -- they don't even come above my 
knees,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Japan Said Buying Less US Auto Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Economic problems in Japan and the rest of Asia  
pushed the value of Japanese purchases of U.S.-made auto parts down 
5.3 percent in fiscal 1998, Kyodo News said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The decline is the first since the Japan Automobile  
Manufacturers Association began recording data in fiscal 1985, 
Kyodo News reported, citing association officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials could not be reached late Friday to confirm the  
report. 
</P>
<P>
	The association blamed the prolonged recession at home and weak  
domestic car production -- in part due to the Asian economic crisis 
-- for the decline. Officials also said a shift in production abroad 
by U.S. auto parts makers was also a factor, Kyodo said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Outlook Good For U.S. Kids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Statistically, things are looking up for  
American kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Vaccinations and preschool enrollment are up. Teen smoking,  
childbirth and youth violence are down, according to a government 
report. 
</P>
<P>
	``The trend is in the right direction. We're sailing with the  
wind,'' said Kristen Moore, president of Child Trends, a research 
group. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Moore notes that there's been no progress in reducing  
teen alcohol consumption or increasing health insurance coverage, 
and even the areas that have seen improvement are still disturbing. 
``We're not where we should be,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The annual report, released Thursday, is designed to be a broad  
assessment of the state of the nation's children, a collection of 
statistics from across the federal government. Backers hope it will 
someday reach the prominence of the annual economic report to the 
president. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would contend that our children are as important to the  
future of the country as the economy,'' said Dr. Duane Alexander, 
director of the National Institute of Child Health and Human 
Development. ``The stock market will never depend on it, but I hope 
the report will annually at least focus attention on the status and 
condition of our children.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the findings:  
</P>
<P>
	--Most children and teens had diets that needed improvement. For  
instance, in 1996, 24 percent of children ages 2 to 5 had a good 
diet and 8 percent had a poor diet. The rest needed improvement to 
meet federal recommendations. Those numbers generally got worse for 
older kids. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of 10th and 12th graders smoking dropped in 1998  
after gradually increasing since 1992. But 22 percent of high 
school seniors and 16 percent of sophomores still smoked. 
</P>
<P>
	--The birth rate for girls ages 15 to 17 fell from its peak of  
38.7 live births per 1,000 teens in 1991 to 32.1 percent in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	--Forty-eight percent of 3- and 4-year-olds were enrolled in  
preschool in 1997, up from 45 percent a year earlier, partly due to 
welfare reform pushing mothers into the workforce. The most 
dramatic rise was among black children, with the percentage rising 
from 45 percent to 55 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--The number of poor kids to get all their vaccines edged up in  
1997 to 71 percent, up from 69 percent in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Lately, much of the attention on teens has dealt with violence,  
as the nation struggles to understand school shootings in Colorado, 
Georgia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	But youth violence has actually been dropping since it peaked in  
1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public in general doesn't have a very accurate view of  
violent crime,'' said Margaret A. Zahn, a criminologist at North 
Carolina State University. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, there were 31 serious violent juvenile crimes committed  
for every 1,000 children ages 12 to 17. That's down from 52 per 
1,000 in 1993 and is the lowest rate since 1986, according to the 
Justice Department. Still, in 1997 there were 706,000 violent 
crimes involving one or more of these teens. 
</P>
<P>
	There are also fewer teen victims of crime. There were 27  
victims for every 1,000 people ages 12 to 17 in 1997. That's down 
from 44 in 1,000 in 1993, Justice said.

<HEADLINE> IEA Sees Possible Oil Shortage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- OPEC's cutback in crude production and a rising  
demand for gasoline and other refined products could lead this 
winter to the biggest oil shortage in more than a decade, a 
respected industry survey warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	But the report by the International Energy Agency acknowledges  
that a further spike in prices, which have almost doubled since 
December, would probably tempt oil-producing countries to break 
ranks and boost output. 
</P>
<P>
	``A more plausible scenario is that, before the end of the year,  
there will be an 'upward adjustment' of production,'' the agency 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Continued economic growth in the United States and the  
resurgence of activity in Asia should help boost global demand for 
oil by 1.84 percent in the third quarter of the year and 2.38 
percent in the fourth quarter, according to the Paris-based agency. 
The IEA is part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development, a group of the world's most developed nations. 
</P>
<P>
		   It predicted slower growth in world oil supplies as a result of  
OPEC's discipline so far in complying with output cuts agreed in 
March. The result could be a shortfall of 1.61 million barrels a 
day in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	A shortfall of that magnitude is ``unusual,'' and if current  
trends continue, it ``will trigger one of the biggest quarterly 
stock draws (shortfalls) in history,'' the agency said. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher oil prices would push up the costs of almost all aspects  
of daily life, from filling up at the pump to higher shipping costs 
for groceries and merchandise. Rising inflation would push up 
interest rates, which could cool off economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
	The fourth-quarter shortage could be as large as 3.24 million  
barrels per day -- a level last seen during the exceptionally cold 
winter of 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	Barney Gray, an analyst at the brokerage Williams De Broe,  
dismissed this forecast as a ``scare story.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting  
Countries, who agreed in March to trim output by 4.32 million 
barrels per day, would probably start cheating if prices rose much 
higher, Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
	``OPEC has been very disciplined since March, with very high  
compliance. We want it to stay that way,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The price for widely traded West Texas Intermediate crude has  
been rallying strongly as evidence mounts of OPEC's unusual 
discipline in production, climbing to 19-month highs this week and 
flirting with $20 a barrel. The gain in June alone was $2.97 per 
barrel, the agency noted. 
</P>
<P>
	Contracts for August delivery of West Texas Intermediate rose 23  
cents Friday to close at $19.94 a barrel on the New York Mercantile 
Exchange, almost twice the Dec. 11, 1998 low of $10.65. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of North Sea Brent crude increased last month by an  
even heftier $3.24 per barrel. Brent contracts for August finished 
trading Friday up 27 cents at $18.51 per barrel in London. 
</P>
<P>
	If prices rise beyond $20 per barrel, the temptation could  
become intense for OPEC members to exceed the quotas of their 
latest accord, said Mehdi Varzi, an analyst at the investment bank 
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. 
</P>
<P>
	Higher prices could also mean that non-OPEC exporters with  
higher production costs will once again find it profitable to pump 
oil, thereby increasing global supplies and dampening prices. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not all blue sky for OPEC. There are dangers in allowing  
the price to go too high,'' Varzi said. 
</P>
<P>
	OPEC's compliance rate with its targeted output levels was 91  
percent in June, up from 88 percent in May and 82 percent in April, 
the IEA said. 
</P>
<P>
	Saudi Arabia and Iran, OPEC's biggest producers, cut daily  
production last month by 40,000 barrels and 50,000 barrels 
respectively. Nigeria, considered one of the group's weaker members 
in terms of compliance, saw output fall by 30,000 barrels a day due 
to civil unrest in its oil-rich coastal areas.

<HEADLINE> Waste Mgt. Execs Cashed In Stock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- Waste Management executives made more than $50  
million from stock sales just two months before the company 
announced a $250 million earnings shortfall that sent the stock 
plummeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The company confirmed Friday that top officials sold more than 1  
million shares at $52 to $56 dollars per share. The announcement 
came one day after a lawsuit was filed in federal court in Houston, 
charging that executives made false public statements about the 
company's cash flow, competitive position and other factors to 
drive up the stock price before selling. 
</P>
<P>
	A company spokeswoman declined to comment Friday on the lawsuit,  
but she confirmed a report in The Wall Street Journal that Waste 
Management's No. 2 executive, president Rodney Proto, sold 300,000 
shares in May for $16.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Spokeswoman Cherie Rice said Proto was taking advantage of the  
first unrestricted trading window for Waste Management insiders 
since 1996. She said Proto had been prohibited from selling shares 
because the company went through a series of mergers and 
transactions. 
</P>
<P>
	Once free of those restrictions in May, Ms. Rice said, ``He only  
had two choices: Let his options expire, and they would be gone 
forever, or he had to buy them and hold them because he couldn't 
sell them at all.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Rice said the stock sale had no connection to the earnings  
shortfall disclosed this week. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, Waste Management's stock plunged 37 percent to  
$33.93 3/4 after the company warned that quarterly and year-end 
earnings would fall at least 10 percent short of expectations due 
to a $250 million shortfall in its core solid-waste business. 
</P>
<P>
	On Friday, Waste Management shares fell $1.37 1/2 to $32.56 1/4 in  
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Some experts have said the company might have been too  
optimistic about quickly integrating its new components after last 
year's $13.5 billion merger between Houston-based USA Waste 
Services and Waste Management, then based in Oak Brook, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
	The company retained the Waste Management name, though USA Waste  
effectively gained control of its larger but struggling former 
rival. The combined company bought Mt. Laurel, N.J.-based Eastern 
Environmental Services Inc. in late 1998.
