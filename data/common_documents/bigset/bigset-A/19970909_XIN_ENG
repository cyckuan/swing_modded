<HEADLINE> UN Chief's Report on Work of UN Governance (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan today presented his report on the work of governance of
the organization, in which he stressed that good governance was an
essential building block for meeting the objectives of sustainable
development, prosperity and peace.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general said that good governance comprised the
rule of law, effective state institutions, transparency and
accountability in the management of public affairs, respect for
human rights, and the meaning participation of all citizens in the
political processes of their countries and in decisions affecting
their lives.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief said that the United Nations Secretariat and
United Nations programs and funds had moved to provide extensive
governance-related support to large numbers of developing
countries and to countries in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth
of Independence States. That took the form of analytical work,
diagnostic research, needs assessment, policy advice, technical
assistance and advisory services, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said support was provided to strengthen the functioning of
specific institutions, such as judiciaries, parliaments and
electoral bodies, as well as sectorally, including public sector
financial management, privatization efforts, information
technology, civil service reforms and the empowerment of civil
society organizations.
</P>
<P>
He said that sustainable prosperity and stability could be
achieved without good governance. The United Nations development
Program (UNDP) had been increasing the funds dedicated to this
priority, he noted. It now accounts for more than one third of all
UNDP allocations.
</P>
<P>
He said that in July 1997, the UNDP convened the first ever
International Conference in Governance for Sustainable Growth and
Equity, bringing to United Nations Headquarters elected officials,
judges and community leaders from more than 100 countries. The
United Nations Children's Fund had focused increasingly on
strengthening on local capacity and promoting community
participation. The United Nations Development Fund for Women also
operated a governance program, promoting strategies for women's
empowerment and gender mainstreaming.
</P>
<P>
Annan stressed that expanding and enhancing the exchange of
knowledge and experiences among developing countries was of
growing importance. The United Nations Secretariat would
facilitate this process through its capacity as a cleaning house
for information and research on public administration, he said.

<HEADLINE> Record Number of UK TV Audience Watch Diana Funeral </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A record 31.5 million British
TV audience watched the funeral service of Diana, the Princess of
Wales, last Saturday, making it the biggest UK television event in
history.
</P>
<P>
Initial figures provided by the British Audience Research
Bureau showed that 59 percent of the country's population were
watching the service at the peak time. Millions more were
listening on radio in cars and at work.
</P>
<P>
The figures, which represent three quarters of the country's
adult population, exceeded the estimated 22 million who watched
the wedding in 1981 of Diana and Prince Charles, and the 19
million who watched Sir Winston Churchill's funeral in 1965.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that previously the highest television audience
was 26.2 million for the England v. Germany Euro 96 semi-final
last year.
</P>
<P>
Television executives said that it was "almost impossible" to
assess how many had watched around the world. The procession and
the funeral service were also broadcast to 187 other countries by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.

<HEADLINE> CPC's Foreign Exchanges Making Notable Progress (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Communist Party of China
(CPC) has been making "new and important" achievements in its
exchanges with foreign parties since 1992, the year of the CPC's
14th congress.
</P>
<P>
The claim was made by Dai Bingguo, head of the International
Department under the CPC Central Committee, in a speech today
aired on the Beijing-based China Radio International.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, CPC has made a lot of political
friends of many types and in various ways, according to the Party
official.
</P>
<P>
This has been scored under the guidance of Deng Xiaoping's
thinking on diplomacy, the leadship of the CPC Central Committee
with Jiang Zemin at the core, and the principle of "creating a
favorable international environment for China's economic growth,
and reform and opening-up program," Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
By adapting to the new situation after the Cold War and seizing
opportunities, the CPC has made new progress in foreign exchanges
over the years, Dai said.
</P>
<P>
In spite of the drastic changes in East Europe, the break-up of
the former Soviet Union, the changes of ruling parties and the
emergence of new parties in this region afterwards, Dai said, the
CPC has been steadfastly pursuing the principle of
non-interference in the internal affairs of other parties.
</P>
<P>
China respects these countries' choices of individual paths of
development, and has tried to cooperate with parties in these
countries on the basis of seeking common ground while reserving
differences, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Different types and degrees of contact have been established
between the CPC and various political organizations in these
countries, Dai noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC has forged ties with 50 major political parties
in 36 African countries, who are in power, or participating in
government or out of office.
</P>
<P>
The CPC set up and advanced ties with almost all the Japanese
parties promptly when many political bodies emerged after profound
changes in Japan's political structure in 1993, he continued.
</P>
<P>
The CPC has also befriended parties who have different
political attitudes and philosophies, Dai stressed.
</P>
<P>
While developing friendship with communist and labor parties
with same or similar political orientation, the CPC has increased
exchanges with other legal parties and political organizations of
various types, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
Dai attributed the improvement of party-to-party relations
between China and neighboring countries to the overall growth of
bilateral ties and mutual understanding and trust.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, the CPC has also been conducting
friendly cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual respect
and benefit with some right-wing, conservative and socialist
parties in developed countries, although they terminated or put a
freeze on exchanges with the CPC out of ideological reasons after
1989, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the CPC has made unremitting efforts to promote the
friendly cooperation between nations and safeguard national
sovereignty, Dai added.

<P>
"The CPC has contributed a lot to the enhancement of mutual
understanding and friendship between China and other countries,"
Dai said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, he noted, the CPC has helped step up
China's work to improve foreign relations by seeking support from
the ruling parties of developing nations in Asia, Africa and Latin
America on issues related to China's sovereignty, such as the
issues of human rights, Taiwan and Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Dai also stressed the important role of the CPC's exchanges
with major parties, either in or out of office, in maintaining
stable bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the contributions the CPC has made in developing
the party-to-party relations with countries that do not have
diplomatic ties with China.
</P>
<P>
For instance, Dai said, the CPC has links with over 20 parties
of most of the 15 Latin American countries that have not forged
diplomatic ties with China, and it has made friends with many
noted figures in these countries.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the CPC has attached great importance to economic
factors in its foreign relations, and helped promote China's
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He said the CPC has intensified the study and researches on
economic experiences in foreign countries.

<P>
The CPC has conducted field studies and seminars on
policy-making in such areas as sustainable agricultural growth,
reform in large and medium-sized enterprises, inflation control,
foreign investment, social security, environmental protection,
professional training and employment, according to Dai.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, China has achieved social stability
and economic growth, strengthened the overall national power, and
elevated the country's international status, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, he noted, the CPC has gained increasingly
higher prestige, and its strategies and experiences in handling
party and state affairs have drawn growing interest from foreign
parties.
</P>
<P>
Dai said the CPC Central Committee has attached much importance
to the Party's foreign affairs. Direct talks between leaders of
the CPC and foreign parties have strongly promoted CPC's
international image and helped foreign parties better understand
the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Finally, Dai noted, the CPC, at the turn of the century, will
strive to make the most of the advantages in its foreign
relationships, and to advance cooperation with foreign parties.
</P>
<P>
The CPC will make new contributions to the friendship and
mutually-beneficial ties between nations, and the everlasting
peace, stability and development of the world and the humanity,
Dai said.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Protest Against Bosporus Straits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus will protest against
Turkey's violation of the 1936 International Treaty of Montreux on
navigation in the Bosporus Straits, a government spokesman said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Telling a daily press briefing, Manolis Christofides was
referring to last week's incident in which Turkish authorities
stopped and searched a Cyprus-flagged vessel "Diamond H", as it
arrived to transit the Bosporus.
</P>
<P>
The vessel was reportedly bound from Ukraine to Alexandria,
Egypt, carrying a cargo of steel products.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish authorities have recently searched ships travelling
through the Bosporus Straits, suspecting they carry components of
Russian-made S-300 anti-aircraft missiles Cyprus has bought early
this year.
</P>
<P>
Another Egyptian ship was also reported to be searched last
week but nothing was found destined for Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Christofides said "we shall make representations after we hear
the legal opinion of international consultants and act
accordingly." "At this stage, we are not in a position to give
any further details about future moves," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Montreux Treaty, which governs
navigation in the Straits, incorporates provisions for the rights
of the contracting parties.
</P>
<P>
Article two of the Treaty stipulates "in time of peace,
merchant vessels shall enjoy complete freedom of transit and
navigation of the Straits, by day and by night, under any flag and
with any kind of cargo, without any formalities."
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides also said last Saturday
that the Cypriot government will lodge the protest to the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Russian Foreign Ministry spokesman Guennadi Tarasov said last
week that the search of commercial ships passing through the
Black Sea Straits, by Turkey, violates the Montreux convention.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus' decision to purchase Russian missiles has
triggered warning from Turkey that it will launch pre-emptive
strike against Cyprus if the missiles are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over 37 percent of the island in the wake
of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> Official: China Should Use Overseas Investment Wisely (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Sun Zhenyu, Vice-Minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, said today that China
should properly protect its domestic market while continuing
to open up to the outside world.
</P>
<P>
Sun told a forum attended by Taiwan business people, who are
here to take part in the '97 China Investment and Trade Talks,
that China will guarantee that the state-owned enterprises have a
reasonable share of the market for some important industries and
products, especially those which affect the national economy and
the people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
Sun emphasized that to protect the domestic market is not to
protect backwardness but to guarantee the healthy, orderly and
sustained growth of the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
To raise the amount and appropriateness of the use of overseas
funds, Sun suggested that China should optimize the industrial
structure into which overseas businessmen pour in funding.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China should better guide the direction of
overseas investments, and clearly define which fields are
available for overseas funding.
</P>
<P>
The country will further encourage overseas business people to
invest in infrastructural construction, fundamental,
export-oriented and hi-tech industries in addition to farming,
animal breeding and farm produce processing industries, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the country will properly increase overseas
investment in the energy and communication sectors.

<P>
Meanwhile, China plans to encourage overseas businesspeople to
invest in its central and western parts which fall far
behind the coastal areas in using overseas funds, Sun noted.
</P>
<P>
Sun stressed that those areas should emphasize the need to
introduce foreign investments as a means of developing the
regional economy.
</P>
<P>
While speeding up the infrastructural construction, those areas
can give overseas businesspeople priority in investing in the
communication, energy and raw materials industries, and encourage
them to fund the technological upgrading of large state-owned
enterprises, Sun said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that some big cities in the region can experiment with
using foreign funds in banking, insurance and retailing businesses
and encouraging overseas investors to develop tourism in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sun stressed that the legal system should be
beefed up to improve the investment environment. He said that the
country will speed up the reform in the field and improve the
service and efficiency of government departments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China will reinforce administrative control over
foreign-funded firms in a bid to protect the country's tax sources
and the legal rights of the employees.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved remarkable progress in using overseas
investment, with more than 290,000 foreign-backed firms
established and 197.2 billion US dollars used.

<HEADLINE> Women's Head Highlights Gender Equality at SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE (MALAWI), September 8 (Xinhua) -- Gertrude Mongella,
chairperson of the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women, today
highly praised Southern African Development Community (SADC) for
taking gender equality into its action plan.
</P>
<P>
Mongella, who presided over the women's conference in Beijing
in 1995, said here today that it is an important "milestone"
towards democracy and development for SADC to integrate gender
into its program of action.
</P>
<P>
Mongella, who is invited to the SADC summit by its Chairman
Nelson Mandela as an honored guest, said at the opening of the
summit that gender equality is an inalienable right and
pre-requisite for real development and true democracy.
</P>
<P>
The women's leader quoted a song by an African woman that "I
am not asking money although I am in need of it... I have only
one request: that the roadblocks be removed from my way."
</P>
<P>
The full empowerment of women in the region, Mongella said, is
what women here are demanding.
</P>
<P>
Gender equality, a basic human right which makes economic
development work, is the key to the progress of SADC, she said.
</P>
<P>
The SADC ministerial council has approved last week the
Regional Plan of Action on Gender to ensure equality between men
and women in the sharing of power and decision making at all
levels, Mongella said.
</P>
<P>
Adequate promotion and protection of the human rights of women
and children is also covered in the plan.
</P>
<P>
Mongella also called for sufficient resources to make a
"meaningful difference", as too often, similar institutions have
been marginalized, under-resourced and used as "dumping grounds
for gender issues.
</P>
<P>
SADC, a 12-member group officially launched in August 1992, is
aimed at promoting economic integration towards a fully developed
common market.
</P>
<P>
Protocals on gener equality, mining, education, ban on the
production, use and stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines in
the region is to be passed on the one-day SADC summit.

<HEADLINE> HKSAR Welcomes Norway's Proposal on Textiles Freeing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The government of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) welcomes the Norwegian
government's proposal to remove all the quantitative restrictions
for imports of restrained textiles and clothing products from Hong
Kong by the end of this year, an official spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman from the Hong Kong SAR government's Trade
Department said the early elimination of quantitative restrictions
by Norway ahead of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing (ATC) schedule is "a welcomed move," which
contributes to the goal of complete liberalization of the textiles
trade under the ATC.
</P>
<P>
"The HKSAR government fully appreciates the efforts made by
Norway towards this goal and is delighted to accept Norway's
proposal," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal recently put forward to the Hong Kong SAR
government by the Norwegian government, exports of woven trousers
(Category 2) and woven bed-linen (Category 7) from Hong Kong into
Norway will not be subject to quantitative restraint as from
January 1, 1998, and exports of woven jackets (Category 1) will
also be derestrained from one year later.
</P>
<P>
Now, all these three categories of textiles products, namely
woven jackets, woven trousers and woven bed-linen are subject to
annual quantitative limits.
</P>
<P>
The proposal by Norway is made under the ATC. Under the
document, members of the WTO are committed to liberalization
global trade in textiles in stages with the ultimate objective of
fully integration of trade in textiles into the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade by 2005, the spokesman noted.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Economy Weakening Again: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Barclays Bank Zimbabwe Limited
has said there are signs that Zimbabwe's economy is weakening
again following strong performance in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In its latest economic bulletin released here today, the bank
said indications of a slowing economy include the worsening terms
of trade as represented by the decline in projected values of
tobacco and gold, the leading export commodities.
</P>
<P>
"In addition, manufactured exports, the third largest export
category, are having to cope with a substantially appreciated
real exchange rate," the bank said.
</P>
<P>
Private sector credit growth is now negative pointing to a
decline in domestic investment levels, while there are also
predictions of a drought in the coming season, the bulletin
added.
</P>
<P>
While applauding the government for reducing the budget
deficit from an average 9.7 percent in the financial years
1992-96 to 6.7 percent in the last financial year, the bank
however, said there has been no adequate exchange rate or
monetary policy management to match the windfall.
</P>
<P>
"The latter policy shortcomings are now being left by way of
sluggish export performance, accelerated currency depreciation
and a return to dependence on foreign aid financing," the bank
said.
</P>
<P>
Barclays also warned that high nominal and real interest rates
will lead to subdued investment and output during the early
stages of the next economic reform cycle, particularly if this
coincides with drought.
</P>
<P>
The bank said Zimbabwe's efforts to bring down inflation to
seven percent by 1999 will be difficult while the local currency
unit will have to depreciate by at least 10 percent during the
next six months in order to support the export sector.

<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- People from Hong Kong's
industrial and commercial circles will hold a grand evening party
on September 30 to celebrate the 48th National Day of the People's
Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Some 200 industrial and business leaders of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (SAR) met today to discuss the
forming of the preparatory committee for the celebration.
</P>
<P>
Chairman of the preparatory committee Tsang Hin-chi said at the
meeting that Hong Kong has maintained its economic prosperity and
social stability after its return to the motherland. This is the
result of the central government's efforts in implementing "one
country, two systems" policy, and the result of the concerted
efforts by the HKSAR government and the whole of Hong Kong people.
</P>
<P>
He said the social stability and healthy economic development
of the motherland are a major factor supporting Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity. Now Hong Kong has returned to the
motherland, both Hong Kong and the interior areas will benefit
from the increasingly frequent economic and trade exchanges.
</P>
<P>
This year's National Day celebration bears special meaning and
everybody should feel excited at the first National Day after the
birth of the SAR, he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Criticize Israel for ID Cards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Ministry of
Jerusalem Affairs today criticized Israel for continuously
confiscating the ID cards of Palestinians living in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that during the last two
weeks, 182 cases of ID confiscations were reported and from
January to May this year, the Israeli authorities confiscated 787
ID cards of the Palestinians living in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"This act of Israel represents a blatant attempt by the
Israeli government to coerce the Palestinian residents of
Jerusalem into forced migration," the statement pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian residents of Jerusalem are being expelled from
Jerusalem through the revocation of their residential rights and
this policy of Israel amounts to an ethnic cleaning tactic as it
solely targets the people of Arab descent despite the
U.S. pressure, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
This Israeli policy is illegal according to international law,
it noted.
</P>
<P>
Since 1976, it said, a total of 4,661 ID cards of Palestinians
living in this city have been confiscated by the Israeli
authorities.
</P>
<P>
To protest against the ID confiscations, Palestinians have set
up a camp named Steadfastnes and Solidarity on the slope of Mount
Scopes in the city. At present, it houses 40 Palestinian
families, or 200 homeless individuals whose homes have been
demolished by the Israeli authorities recently.

<HEADLINE> HK to Hold Large-scale Electronics Fair Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) will stage its first large-scale
international electronics fair next month, with participation of
over 1,100 exhibitors from 19 countries and regions, the Trade
Development Council said today.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release circulated here, the participants
will occupy over 1,600 booths and an exhibition area of more than
33,000 square meters. This represents an increase of 15 percent
over the number of exhibitors in 1996, it added.
</P>
<P>
Organized by the council, the Hong Kong Electronics Fair 1997
will be held from October 14 to 17 at the Hong Kong Convention and
Exhibition Center Extension, the press release said.
</P>
<P>
Multimedia will be one of the highlights of the fair with a
wide array of innovative products being displayed under one roof.
Other exhibits include home entertainment and telecom products,
consumer electronics and gadgets, audio visual and home appliances
as well as security systems.
</P>
<P>
The council's assistant executive director C.S. Lee was quoted
as saying that "it will be a prime occasion for electronics
companies to acquire the latest market information of the
industry, and provide buyers with a one-stop-shop for souring."
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong has become an electronics souring center in Asia
because of its manufacturing strength and comprehensive trade
network," Lee said, adding that "the accomplishment is
demonstrated by our exports performance."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Hong Kong's total exports of electronics grew by three
 percent to 390 billion Hong Kong dollars. In the first six months
 of this year, the figure was 188 billion Hong Kong dollars, up
six percent compared with the same period of last year.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Tobacco Sales Set to Miss Target </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's tobacco marketing
season comes to an end in about two weeks with sales just
slightly below the targeted 196 million kgs, an industry official
said today.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe Tobacco Association's Public Relations Director Lal
Taylor said increased tobacco sales totaling 166.6 million kg
worth over 4.5 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (about 400 million U.S.
Dollars) were traded at the country's three auction floors as of
Friday last week.
</P>
<P>
Taylor said this volume was down from last year's and the
average price as well was not as high as that for last year.
</P>
<P>
"Tobacco marketing for this season comes to an end on
September 24, about 13 more selling days, and we may miss our
latest target of 196 million kgs by probably a small margin,"
Taylor said, adding they will have to watch sales closely in case
they shoot up significantly.
</P>
<P>
Last year, on the back of a good agricultural season and high
tobacco price, 202 million kg of tobacco earned the country over
8 billion Zimbabwe Dollars (more than 720 million U.S. Dollars).
Tobacco is Zimbabwe's biggest foreign currency earner.
</P>
<P>
The drop in this year's sales had been a result of reduced
yields due to excess rains, but still if this year's target is
met, the country will earn only about 5.6 billion Zimbabwe
Dollars (some 500 million U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> China Rejuvenated by Reform, Opening-up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Athens, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Some Greek figures said that
the reform and opening-up policy has rejuvenated China and the
forthcoming 15th Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
will decide the future course for China.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, President of Aegean
Television Station Peter Papaconstantinou said that because China
stuck to the right direction in the past decade, the once poor and
old civilized country is at last rejuvenated and witnessing great
developments and changes.
</P>
<P>
"A more prosperous and more powerful China serves as the
foundation for development of Asia and the world as a whole," said
Papaconstantinou, who is also the managing director of the
newspaper Morning News.
</P>
<P>
"Stability and peace in the Asian region will, in a large
degree, lie in on the stability of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
He wished the CPC's 15th congress a success.
</P>
<P>
The congress is drawing the attention of the world because it
will set a future course for China, whose future development and
that of the world is inter-related, he said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President of the Greek-Chinese Friendship Association
Georgios G. Tsakonas said that thanks to Deng Xiaoping's
opening-up policy, there has been unprecedented progress in the
Chinese economy and the 1.2 billion Chinese people have embarked
on the road to better lives.
</P>
<P>
He noted that China has a growing economy with a great
potential market, which is not only good for China but also
conducive to the development of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
Stavros Nikolakopoulos, chairman of Greece's Euro-Chinese
Center for Research and Development, has visited China 14
times.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has followed the entire process of China's
opening-up to the outside world, which has not only resulted in
China's unprecedented economic growth for more than a decade, but
also laid the foundation for China to become the world's leading
economic power.
</P>
<P>
For the world and China, Deng Xiaoping was a great man with
extraordinary vision, he said. The policy he initiated opened the
gate to prosperity and power for China.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Promises Israel to Fight Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat today promised Israel a
crackdown on terrorism to rescue the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat made the promise in a message conveyed by senior
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat to Israeli Foreign Minister
David Levy, saying that he would fight violence in any forms.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian leader also thanked Levy for telling the
weekly Israeli Cabinet meeting held on Sunday that Israel
should continue to honor the Oslo agreements so to push
forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat's pledge came despite Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's criticism against him early today that he should be
indirectly responsible for the recent suicide bombings in central
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I am not saying that Arafat told them (terrorists) to go
ahead and strike. I am saying that he facilitated the operations
within the territories. He has effectively turned the
Palestinian-controlled areas into safe heavens and bases of the
terrorist organizations," Netanyahu told Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that Arafat, during a recent national unity
conference, hugged and kissed leaders from the militant
organizations, such as the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas)
and the Islamic Jihad.
</P>
<P>
Hamas has claimed responsibility for both the July 30 twin
suicide bombings in Jerusalem's Mahane Yehuda market that killed
17 people and last Thursday's triple suicide bombings in Ben
Yehuda pedestrian mall that killed eight people so far.
</P>
<P>
Israel reacted swiftly and strongly to the latest bombings by
immediately imposing a total blockade of the Palestinian
territories, including an internal travel ban on Palestinian
residents in the West Bank, and even freezing further troop
redeployments.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli sanctions are apparently aimed at pressuring the
PNA to launch an all-out crackdown on the militant Islamic
organizations led by Hamas.
</P>
<P>
In a gesture made ahead of the September 10 visit to the region
by United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
Palestinian security forces arrested 35 Islamic militant
activists in an overnight crackdown in the West Bank. The PNA is
apparently trying to show to the Americans that it does make real
efforts to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the deterioration of the security situation in
Israel has sparked hectic debates throughout Israeli's political
spectrum, with lawmakers from the ruling coalition and the
opposition camp trading accusations over the responsibility for
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Nissan Slomoanski, lawmaker from the National Religious Party
(NRP), a coalition party, blamed the opposition Labor party for
the crisis. He said Arafat has never acted to fight terrorism, and
the former Labor government's leaders should be put on trial by
putting the nation under the risks of terror attacks encouraged by
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Slomoanski's charges drew fierce criticism from lawmakers from
the Labor and Meretz parties who demanded the attorney-general to
indict him for inciting violence against them.
</P>
<P>
Meretz leader Yossi Sarid urged Netanyahu to resign
immediately for failing to deliver his elections promises on
bringing about peace with security to the country.
</P>
<P>
Orren Shahor, former Coordinator of Government Activities in
the Territories who has just joined the Labor party, blasted the
Netanyahu administration for trying to abandon the Oslo peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Shahor expressed the concern that the end of the Oslo peace
process would push the region back into the abyss of bloody
confrontations and wars, not only with the Palestinians, but also
with Egypt and Jordan, with which Israel has maintained peace so
far.

<HEADLINE> British Banks Hold Holocaust Survivors' Savings: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- British banks hold millions of
pounds belonging to holocaust survivors or their heirs, according
to a report by the Holocaust Educational Trust (HET).
</P>
<P>
The report, published today, said that the British government
did not return all the assets confiscated during World War II from
thousands of Nazi victims.
</P>
<P>
HET Chairman Lord Janner was quoted by today's Financial Times
as saying, "I have asked the government and the banks to make full
restitution so far as it is possible."
</P>
<P>
The amount of money held by British clearance banks could be as
high as 35 million pounds at 1945 prices (about 56 million U.S.
dollars at the current price), according to estimates contained in
the report.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Midland Bank said, "The money is certainly
there. When the accounts were unfrozen at the end of the war, we
wrote to the customers at their last known addresses. Funds that
were not claimed were then recorded in branches' records."
</P>
<P>
Lord Janner has reportedly written to British Foreign Secretary
Robin Cook, demanding that where no heir can be found, the money
is paid into humanitarian fund for survivors and their families.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1939 Trading with the Enemy Act, all assests invested
in Britain by "enemy nationals," including victims of the Nazis,
were seized by the Custodian of Enemy Property.

<HEADLINE> UNESCO Workshop on Vocation for Girls Opens in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A five-day UNESCO sub-regional
workshop on scientific, technical and vocational education for
girls in Africa opened here today with a theme of "From Theory to
Action".
</P>
<P>
The workshop has attracted 30 participants from Zambia, South
Africa, Swaziland, Lesotho, Mozambique, Botswana, Malawi, Ghana,
Tanzania, Kenya, Namibia and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
In her opening remarks, Zimbabwe's Rural Resources and Water
Development Minister Joyce Mujuru said that scientific, technical
and vocational training is a special area which has until
recently been shunned by girls.
</P>
<P>
She said girls tend to take up traditional women's careers
such as teaching and nursing, yet it has been seen that girls
could perform just as well in non-traditional professions.
</P>
<P>
"In Africa, given our particular circumstances, we need to do
even more to ensure the participation of girls in scientific,
technical and vocational education so that they can realize their
full potential while at the same time contributing to the
development process," she said.
</P>
<P>
She said the challenge of participation of girls in
scientific, technical and vocational education is a big one in
Africa, which needs the involvement of all sectors of society.
</P>
<P>
Mujuru said a study in Zimbabwe of the participation of girls
in scientific, technical and vocational education focusing on
disciplines such as science and engineering has found out that in
some of the disciplines, the participation of girls is in some
cases as low as two percent or nil.
</P>
<P>
She said targets were set to bring up women's participation,
but these were not necessarily fulfilled because of various
factors in the socio-cultural environment.

<HEADLINE> EU Ministers likely to Make Little Progress on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The conference of European
Union (EU) finance ministers, due to be held in Luxembourg later
this week, is not expected to make marked progress over the
European Monetary Union (EMU), according to EU sources.
</P>
<P>
EU monetary officials, who declined to be named, said here
today that no concrete decisions on the planned single European
currency euro would emerge from this gathering.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the press speculation that the conference would
discuss the conversion rates between EU national currencies and
the euro, one official said, "I don't think there is any great
urgency to nail these issues down. Nobody really expects a
clear-cut agreement."
</P>
<P>
"I don't think there will be any discussion about (conversion
rates) at all," he said, adding that there was a strong desire
among EU members not to "rock the boat."
</P>
<P>
Some other officials noted that the EU was under no specific
mandate to come up with a concrete decision on conversion rates
this year.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Luxembourg meeting this weekend would
focus on future economic policy coordination in the euro area as
well as external foreign exchange policy issues.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Interested in Buying Mine Hunters: Navy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait is considering to
purchase mine hunters to add to its navy, an officer in Kuwait
Navy said today without specifying the number of the boats and the
potential selling countries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with official Kuwait News Agency (KUNA) on
board the U.S. "USS Dextrous" mine countermeasures ship carrying
out a mission in the Gulf waters, Colonel Hassan Zaidan Al-Enezy
said that "we are still studying the issue of buying mine hunters
through close consultations with our Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) counterparts."
</P>
<P>
GCC, as a regional political and economic organization, groups
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Qatar, Bahrain as
well as Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia, the heavyweight of the GCC organization,
recently received a third British-made mine-sweeping ship equipped
with modern mines detecting and destruction devices to complete
a defense agreement with Britain which stipulates to provide the
Gulf kingdom with three such ships.
</P>
<P>
Al-Enezy said "we need to carry out more studies on the mine
hunters appropriate for our region, waters and weather."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that there have been visits, missions and
training carried out by mine sweepers, clearers and hunters in
Kuwait from its allied countries including the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said units specialized in explosives and mines from the
Kuwaiti navy have undergone constant training since Gulf war
in 1991.
</P>
<P>
The officer said although no problems of sea mines occurred
recently, but "we should still be cautious."
</P>
<P>
"This is a problem we must face after the (Gulf) war and one
we must always be prepared to deal with," he said, adding that
the presence of mine sweepers in the area "gives us confidence
when we are out in the water."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, KUNA said the U.S. commander of the mine
countermeasures Squadron Two Forward, Captain Thomas Carlson, said
the purpose of the mission was "to keep the sea lanes safe and
open."
</P>
<P>
Carlson is on a one-day visit to Kuwait to brief and discuss
with Kuwaiti officials their operation and means of cooperation.

JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe has been given
task to coordinate a food security directorate of the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The assignment was approved by the Council of Ministers of the

<HEADLINE> Less Car Sales Forecast In Western Europe Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Car sales in Western Europe are
expected to fall to 12.5 million in 2000, compared with 12.8
million last year, according to a leading forecaster.
</P>
<P>
The gap of almost 300,000 vehicles amounts to the annual output
of one big factory or two medium-sized factories.
</P>
<P>
It is expected the chronic gap between excess capacity and
insufficient demand in Europe's motor industry will grow worse
because of higher taxes and rising environmentalism.
</P>
<P>
The economist Intelligence Unit blames the decline on fiscal
stringency as European Union countries attempt to meet the
convergence criteria for starting economic and monetary union in
January 1999.
</P>
<P>
It also blames the growing impact of environmental controls on
car use.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Volkswagen, Vauxhall/Opel and Citroen are
using this week's Frankfurt motor show to launch new models in the
lower-medium-sized car segment.
</P>
<P>
The report accepts industry forecasts that European sales will
rise by about 2.5 percent to slightly more than 13 million units
this year.
</P>
<P>
However, it predicts a steady decline in the subsequent three
years, with the biggest fall taking place in 2000.

<HEADLINE> British Telecom Cuts National Evening Prices 10 Pct </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- British Telecom (BT) is to
reduce the cost of national calls made during weekday evenings and
nights by a further 10 percent from October 1 -- a total 28
percent cut in a year.
</P>
<P>
BT announced today that as part of its latest price cuts, the
cost of these calls will come down from 4.7 percent a minute to
just 4.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, BT will reduce the cost of daytime calls made
to Cellnet and Vodafone cellular phones by 12 percent -- from 36.5
percent a minute to 32 percent -- reflecting reductions in
payments which BT makes to the two mobile operators.
</P>
<P>
BT cut national evening and night-time call charges by 20
percent -- from 5.9 percent a minute to 4.7 percent -- in October
last year. At the same time, national daytime calls were cut by 10
percent.
</P>
<P>
This was followed by a further 10 percent cut to national
daytime calls and a 3.8 percent cut to regional daytime calls in
May this year, also simplifying charging by creating a new single
rate for all long distance UK daytime calls.
</P>
<P>
In the past 18 months, BT has also cut the cost of calls to
every country in the world -- some by up to 44 percent.
</P>
<P>
Overall, BT's price cuts over the past four years mean that the
average residential call bill has come down by 32 percent in real
terms while the average business call bill has come down by 35
percent.
</P>
<P>
Local call charges have fallen by about 25 percent in real
terms in that time, regional calls by 27 percent, national calls
by 48 percent and international calls by 33 percent.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for BT said that the reduction in the cost of calls
to mobile phones would encourage people to make more calls, thus
creating a bigger market.

BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The first pencil factory built
with Chinese investment in Germany went into operation today in
the northeast German town of Neustadt-Glewe.
</P>
<P>
The North-German Pencil Factory, a subsidiary of the First

South America.
</P>
<P>
The First Pencil Co. Ltd. of Shanghai is the largest Chinese

<HEADLINE> Iran Calls for Diffusion of Tension in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran today called for
diffusion of tension in the world's most sensitive region of
Persian Gulf which boasts of 60 percent of global oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
Addressing foreign ambassadors and representatives of
international organization based in Tehran, Foreign Minister
Kamal Kharrazi said "the Persian Gulf area, having experienced
two consecutive destructive wars in the course of a decade, is
in dire need of urgent tension-diffusing measures."
</P>
<P>
This is the first official statement by the Iranian new
foreign minister since he won the vote of confidence from
Iranian Parliament on August 20.
</P>
<P>
The 53-year-old minister said that "diffusion of tension in
the Persian Gulf not only serves the cause of economic growth
and prosperity in the region but is also beneficial to the rest
of the world."
</P>
<P>
"In other words, peace and tranquility in the Persian Gulf,
which can be best secured through the regional states
themselves, also serve the legitimate interests of the world
community as regards the energy sources in this area," he said.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi noted that "we believe that the Persian Gulf states
are fully capable of arriving at an acceptable arrangement for
regional security through dialogue and cooperation..."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian foreign minister assured the international
community that Iran stands ready to engage in "a serious
dialogue with her neighbors in the Persian Gulf on these and
other similar issues."
</P>
<P>
These issues include establishment of the Persian Gulf as a
zone of peace free from weapons of mass destruction, he added.
</P>
<P>
Diffusion of tension is one of the five-point regional policy
of the new Iranian government headed by President Mohammad
Khatami.
</P>
<P>
However, Kharrazi did not mention what is the source of
tension in the region. Tehran regards the foreign forces led by
the United States in the region as the major threat to its own
national security.
</P>
<P>
The United States currently deploys 22,000 Air Force, Army,
Navy and Marine personnel on 14 ships or at facilities in Saudi
Arabia, Kuwait, Qatar and Bahrain, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military presence in the Gulf includes the Fifth
Fleet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about Iran's regional policies, Kharrazi told the
diplomatic corps that Iran's regional policies are formulated
with particular regard for the characteristics of the sensitive
region.
</P>
<P>
"Being situated, on the one hand, in the north of the world's
energy artery in the Persian Gulf and, on the other, to the
south of the newly independent states in the Central Asia, has
bestowed Iran with a particular geo-strategic position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said "our policy is based on good-neighborliness
and promotion and consolidation of mutual trust through adoption
and pursuance of confidence building measures."
</P>
<P>
He assured Iran's neighboring countries by saying that "the
new administration, in its resolve to further promote mutual
trust and confidence with the neighboring countries, will pursue
these proposals and undertake new initiatives in a more
energetic fashion."
</P>
<P>
To this end, Kharrazi called for cooperation of the regional
states in the field of disarmament and the establishment of the
Middle East as a nuclear weapon free zone.
</P>
<P>
"We are of the opinion that the regional states can further
advance their state of cooperation through confidence building
measures toward reducing arms expenditures and increasing
transparency in military programs," he added.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Pins Peace Hope on Albright's Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League (AL) today
pinned hope on U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright's
upcoming trip to the Middle East for reviving the stalled peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here on eve of Albright's visit, AL
Secretary General Esmat Abdul Meguid expressed the hope that the
visit will contribute to saving the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to arrive in Israel Wednesday in her
first trip to the region as secretary of state. She will also
visit Palestinian self-rule area, Jordan, Egypt, Syria and Saudi
Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Meguid's statement was commenting on the tripartite summit of
Palestinian, Jordanian and Egyptian leaders held here Sunday to
coordinate their stance during Albright's visit.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the summit envisaged a chance for salvaging the
peace process from the dangers that have jeopardized it as a
result of the current Israeli government's practices, he said.
</P>
<P>
The statement highlighted the importance of the signed peace
agreements to the peace process as stressed by Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat, Jordanian King Hussein
and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in their meeting.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after the summit, the three leaders urged
intensified international efforts to ensure accurate
implementation of all signed agreements and resuscitate the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
While condemning violence and terrorism against civilians, they
urged Israel to refrain from actions alien to the "spirit of
peace." The three leaders also pledged to continue contacts with
parties concerned to help break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Meguid also blamed Israel for foiling mediators' efforts in
reviving the deadlocked peace.
</P>
<P>
Albright's talks with the Palestinians and Israelis are
expected to cover security and political matters, with particular
focus on the transitional period and its terms included in deals
signed by both sides.
</P>
<P>
The peace process has been deadlocked since March when Israel
began to build Jewish settlements in East Jerusalem. The
stalemate has been deepened by the suicide bombing attacks in
Jerusalem on July 30 and last Thursday that altogether killed 20
people and wounded more than 360 others, following which Israel
imposed closure on the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Calls for International Pressure on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today
called on the international community to exercise pressure on
Israel to implement related U.N. resolutions and accused Israel
of causing escalation of violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Information Minister Fuad Faresi was quoted by
Kuwait News Agency as telling reporters in Jeddah after a
cabinet meeting that Israel's arbitrary actions against the
Palestinians and its aggressions against south Lebanon were the
cause of the current violence.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Saudi position that Israel must implement all
the U.N. resolutions concerning the Middle East peace process and
the peace accords signed with the concerned parties.
</P>
<P>
Faresi said that these are the only ways to end the turmoil of
violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the implementation of the U.N. resolutions,
especially resolution 425 which calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon, would help
ease the tension in the region and pave the way for the
conclusion of just and comprehensive peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Saudi minister said his country rejected terrorism in all
its forms.
</P>
<P>
He announced this Saudi position on the eve of a scheduled
visit to the region by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright this week, her first trip to the troubled region since
she took office in January.
</P>
<P>
Her visit is widely seen as a new U.S. effort to restart the
deadlocked Middle East peace process as a result of the
hard-line policy of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
such as the construction of a new Jewish settlement in East
Jerusalem and the attack against targets in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Tension escalated in the region since last Thursday's triple
suicide bombings in Jerusalem which killed eight people and
wounded 190 others.
</P>
<P>
The suicide attack was followed Friday night by an aborted
Israeli commando operation in south Lebanon during which 12
Israeli elite servicemen were killed and four others wounded.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Rules out Regional Conflict </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government today
rejected the talk of war or hot incidents for Cyprus or the region.
</P>
<P>
Telling reporters here today, Government Spokesman Manolis
Christofides was commenting on the U.S. views on the likelihood of
war in the region and the Turkish threats to strike Cyprus if
Russian missiles are deployed on the island.
</P>
<P>
"A superpower, with world interests, can prevent conflicts and
secure international peace, in cooperation with the U.N., and
study the situation as well as difference between states,"
Christofides said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman restated the Cypriot government's position that
there will be no need to deploy the missiles if Cyprus is
demilitarized or if there is sufficient progress to warrant its
annulment.
</P>
<P>
When these are seen, "neither side, Cyprus or Russia, will
insist on implementing the contract," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early this year, Cyprus contracted to purchase Russian
anti-aircraft missiles, a move which has sparked immense
international reaction.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed coup by the Greek Cypriots seeking union with Greece.

mission for the Cyprus issue, according to the semi-official
Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Miller said that his Ankara tour aims
to see how a Cyprus settlement could be achieved.
</P>
<P>
He said he would make further trips to Greece and the two
sides of the divided Cyprus to exchange views with the officials
there over the long-standing issue.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that no one should expect too much from the current
negotiations, the U.S. official said that it is extremely
important to understand that the settlement of the Cyprus
dispute is a long and hard process.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when the Turkish
troops invaded and took over the northern third of the island in
the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations and international community have been
working for decades to reunite the divided island, but so far no
concrete results have been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Miller said that he and U.S. Cyprus envoy Richard Holbrooke
would do all they can to push forward the talks, but all sides
concerned should lower their expectations slightly.
</P>
<P>
Cypriot President Glafoks Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktas met last month in Switzerland under the
U.N. sponsorship, but no progress was made.
</P>
<P>
Recently, media reports about delivery of the Russian-made
S-300 missiles to the Cypriot government caused a new wave of
tension on the divided island, also touching off a war of word
between Greece and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Refusing to comment on the S-300 missile deal between Cyprus
and Russia, Miller noted that public accusations could only make
the talks more difficult.
</P>
<P>
Miller is to meet Turkish Foreign Ministry Undersecretary
Onur Oymen and Deputy Undersecretary Inal Batu Tuesday,
media reports said.

<HEADLINE> World Illiteracy Rate Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- There is a fall of
illiteracy rate globally from 45 percent 50 years ago to 23
percent now, according to a UNESCO statement available here
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement was issued by Federico Mayor, Director General
of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
"This is a remarkable achievement since over the same period
the world population has continued to grow," said the statement
to mark the International Literacy Day that befalls today.
</P>
<P>
However, the statement said, "the trend in Africa, Asia and
Arab states should not be allowed to take hold."
</P>
<P>
It was referring to the fact that the number of illiterates is
rising in Sub-Saharan Africa, Asia and Arab states with the
illiteracy rate reaching more than 70 percent in 19 countries in
Africa and Asia.
</P>
<P>
The statement noted that although illiteracy could not be
equated with ignorance, it is a major obstacle to the acquisition
of the knowledge and know-how that are essential for daily life
in modern society.
</P>
<P>
UNESCO in the statement pledged to "continue to get engaged in
activities designed to motivate, coordinate and mobilize national
efforts" to increase the literacy rate of the world population.
</P>
<P>
It urged governments to re-double their efforts to spread
adult education and literacy and called for the strengthening of
solidarity between industrialized and developing countries in
this effort.

<HEADLINE> S. Leoneans Influx Arouses Concern in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Liberian President Charles
Taylor has ordered the security forces and the west African
peacekeeping force (ECOMOG) to man the border with Sierra Leone
so as to avoid possible problems along the side of Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The order followed the influx of thousands of Sierra Leoneans
into the country, particularly after the renewed fighting between
Sierra Leone's militia group Kamajors and government soldiers
near the border in the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Increasing tension in Sierra Leone since a coup that toppled
President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah's legitimate government on May 25
has forced many Sierra Leoneans to flee to neighboring Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Information Minister Joe Mulbah said today that over
100,000 Sierra Leoneans are coming across the border, quoted by
the British Broadcasting Corporation.
</P>
<P>
According to him, decision has been made in the view of the
government and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees
to move quickly to the border to relocate the refugees.
</P>
<P>
He said Liberia has no sympathy for any armed factions in
Sierra Leone, adding that the Liberian government is hoping to
see the crisis in that country can be resolved peacefully.
</P>
<P>
"Whether they (the Kamajors) are fighting to restore President
Kabbah or not, the mandate of the ECOWAS is that they should all
return to the peace table and find amicable solution in Sierra
Leone just as it was done in Liberia," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, President Taylor today told his
justice minister and commanders of the security forces that
Liberia never could be used as a spring board for recruiting a
force for the situation in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sierra Leone is under economic embargo ordered by the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS), a move of the
sub-regional body to force the junta to step down.

<HEADLINE> S. African Football Boss Optimistic About Hosting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 8 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's hopes of
hosting the soccer world cup will be strengthened following the
failure of Cape Town to secure the 2004 Olympic Games, South
African Football Association Boss Danny Jordaan said here today.
</P>
<P>
Cape Town, the legislative capital of South Africa and famous
scenic spot, lost the race to host the 2004 Olympic Games when
the International Olympic Committee gave Athens the nod on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jordaan, however, felt this could be to soccer's benefit. "We
have registered our bid with FIFA (International Federation of
Football Association), but did not want to talk about it while
Cape Town was bidding for the Olympic Games," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But now that the Cape Town bid is over. We will be discussing
it (soccer bid) at our international board meeting next week,"
Jordaan added.
</P>
<P>
South Africa can point to the success of the 1996 African
Nations Cup Tournament, which was staged at short notice after
Kenya withdrew as hosts in 1995, local football sources said.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is one of four countries bidding to stage the
World Cup finals in 2006 with Brazil, England and Germany also in
the race to stage the tournament.
</P>
<P>
France will host the finals next year, while South Korea and
Japan will jointly stage the tournament in 2002.
</P>
<P>
"We are convinced that we will have more than even chance to
get the World Cup to South Africa -- and the continent," Jordaan
said optimistically.

<HEADLINE> Greece Warns Turkey of Facing More Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Greece today warned Turkey of
more problems it will face in becoming a part of international law
and order.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas sent out the warning
while commenting on recent statements made by Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Reppas said that Turkey was marginalizing itself and would find
itself facing problems in becoming a part of international law and
order.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is not Greek-Turkish but a more general fact that
Turkey does not recognize the general jurisdiction of the court at
the Hague which has been recognized by the whole of the civilized
world," he said.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem reportedly said Sunday that
Ankara rejected a European Union (EU) proposal to take its
differences with Athens to the International Court at the Hague
and asked the union to press Greece to demilitarize the eastern
Aegean islands.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Greek Defense Minister Akis
Tsohatzopoulos today also warned Turkey that Greece would raise
the issue of demilitarizing the Bosporus straits if Turkey
persisted in its threat to take Greece to the International Court
at the Hague over the demilitarization of the eastern Aegean
islands.
</P>
<P>
In response to today's statements by Turkish Foreign
Undersecretary Inal Batu calling "irresponsible" Greek Prime
Minister Costas Simitis's response that any attack on Cyprus by
Turkey would be cause for war, Reppas said that Simitis had
outlined a clear position, repeating the positions of Cyprus
President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
As for the Madrid communique signed between Greece and Turkey
in recent months, Reppas said that the spirit of the joint
communique was alive but seeking a response from the Turkish side.
</P>
<P>
He also said that expert committees from both countries could
still meet but the scheduled meeting did not take place due to the
"negative climate" created by the recent statements of Turkish
officials.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton will

<P>
Details of the trip were not immediately released.

<HEADLINE> Iran Urges Israel to Return All Rights to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran's new government today
announced its stand toward the Middle East crisis, urging Israel
to return all rights to the Palestinian people.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said that the Middle East
crisis can be solved only through the realization of all the
rights of the Palestinian people and other Arab people, in
particular their right to self-determination, return of refugees
and the liberation of the occupied territories, including
Jerusalem, southern Lebanon and the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Addressing foreign ambassadors and representatives of the
international organizations based in Iran's capital of Tehran,
Kharrazi stressed that "there is no other way out (of the crisis)."
</P>
<P>
He attacked the Israeli regime for creating the crisis through
"decades of oppression of the Palestinian and Lebanese people"
and further aggravating it by carrying out expansionist policies.
</P>
<P>
Although he did not point his finger to a specific state, the
minister criticized some outside powers for seeking to maintain
and expand their influence in the region.
</P>
<P>
He stated that "we are also seeking peace and stability in the
Middle East; a just and lasting peace that would receive regional
consensus and would cure this chronic crisis once and for all."
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Iranian Parliament Vice-Speaker Movahedi Kermani
declared that Iran will continue to support Palestinians in their
struggle against Israel.
</P>
<P>
He said that the defeat of the Israeli commandos in southern
Lebanon would one day lead to the total collapse of the Israeli
regime.
</P>
<P>
Twelve Israeli soldiers were killed and four others wounded
last Friday when Lebanese army and resistance fighters of
Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the Shiite movement Amal ambushed a
16-member Israeli commando who landed on the village of Nsariyyeh,
about 45 kilometers north of the Israeli border in an attempt to
explode an Amal base near the village.

<P>
BLANTYRE (Malawi), September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic
Republic of Congo (former Zaire), and the Seychelles were given
greenlight to join the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) at the SADC summit here today.
</P>
<P>
SADC leaders agreed that the two countries which have formally
applied to join the regional group satisfied the criteria for
admission of new members, according to a communique of the
one-day SADC summit.
</P>
<P>
Their admission has increased the number of SADC member states
to 14.
</P>
<P>
Kaire Mbuende, SADC executive secretary said at the closing
ceremony of the southern African group summit that the two
members have tremendous potential to benefit the region through
their active participation in SADC programs.
</P>
<P>
Mbuende expressed optimism that efforts of Kabila government
to usher in a new era of political stability in the economic
reconstruction would be successful.
</P>
<P>
Nelson Mandela, SADC Chairman and President of South Africa,
said at the end of the summit that he is fully confident of the
democratic process in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where
election is expected in one or two years.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) has major strategic significance to the region as it
shares borders with several SADC countries and has potential to
cooperate with the group in key sectors such as energy, water,
tourism, transport and communications, the summit communique
said.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) which emerged more than three months ago after
Laurent Kabila forced out the newly-died former president Mobutu
Sese Seko, will make the natural rich region stronger with its
abundant mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the two new member countries are expected to attend
the 1998 SADC summit in Mauritius.

<HEADLINE> Eleven Million Children Die Each Year Worldwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- More than 11 million
children die each year before reaching the age of five all over
the world, according to a World Health Organization (WHO) report
released here today.
</P>
<P>
Around 8 million children, about 70 percent of the 11 million
little children dying each year, die from one or more of five
causes: pneumonia, dirrhoea, measles, malaria and malnutrition,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, WHO believes that many of these deaths can be
prevented through Integrated Management of Childhood Illness
(IMCI), an approach developed by WHO in collaboration with UNICEF.
</P>
<P>
WHO and UNICEF will highlight the urgent need to put the IMCI
strategy into practice at an international meeting in Santo
Momingo, Dominican Republic, from 9 to 12 September.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 countries have begun to implement the IMCI
strategy at regional and local levels since treatment guidelines
and training materials first became available in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of many of them will provide the conference
with successful case histories of using IMCI methods to improve
the care of sick children with the aim of reducing child
mortality.

<HEADLINE> OAU Calls on UNITA to Abide by Peace Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of African
Unity (OAU) today called on Angola's National Union for the Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA) to abide by a 1994 peace accord to
end the country's civil war, Zambia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
OAU Secretary General Salim Ahmed Salim told the delegates at
a Southern African Development Community (SADC) summit in
Blantyre, Malawi that economic integration in southern Africa
continues to be hampered by conflicts.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the southern African countries are seriously
disturbed by UNITA's refusal to fully comply with the provisions
of the Lusaka protocol signed in 1994, which constitutes a factor
of destabilization in Angola, he said.
</P>
<P>
Salim urged the UNITA to "scrupulously" abide by the Lusaka
protocol and operate in accordance with the spirit and letter of
the government of national unity established after general
elections at the end of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The UNITA and the government dominated by the People's
Liberation Movement of Angola (MPLA) signed a peace treaty in
November, 1994 in the capital of Zambia to end the country's two
decades of war.
</P>
<P>
Angola is the only country in southern Africa which is still
directly threatened by a civil war.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the U.N. Security Council has warned the UNITA to
honor its obligations in the peace plan or face sanctions from
September 30, which would include curbs on UNITA members' travel
outside Angola and closure of the organization's offices abroad.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the two-day SADC summit, Salim stressed that
conflicts are threatening to destroy the social fabric of the
societies with significant impact on the socio-economic
development of the African countries.
</P>
<P>
The SADC members hold a summit annually. This afternoon, the
summit made a declaration on gender equality, which emphasizes
that women should obtain equality, respect and dignity as men
through their full participation in social activities, according
to the report.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The United States new
stealth fighter, F-22 Raptor, made a test flight Sunday at speeds
up to 360 kilometers per hour, the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
After an hour of flying in the F-22 Raptor over northwestern
Georgia, pilot Paul Metz said that there was no problem with the
airplane.
</P>
<P>
The plane's maiden flight was closely monitored by two F-16s
which tailed the F-22 and 24 engineers on the ground as Metz
tested the craft's handling at various speeds and altitudes.
</P>
<P>
The jet was built by Lockheed Martin Aeronautical Systems in
partnership with the Boeing Company and Pratt &AMP; Whitney.
</P>
<P>
The F-22 has an innovative computer system that shows the pilot
all the data on one screen instead of presenting it on several
monitors. The plane also is much easier and cheaper to maintain.
</P>
<P>
The Air Force expects to get 339 of the planes to replace the
F-15C, currently its top fighter, at a cost of 43 billion U.S.
dollars. The first squadron is expected tobe in operation by
2005.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Major U.S. airlines raised
already record-high ticket prices by 5 percent nearly across-the
board, a sign of rebust bookings for the fall and the strong
economy, The Wall Street Journal reported today.
</P>
<P>
Business travelers will take the brunt of the increases. But
the newspaper also said many advance-purchase fares were raised
over the weekend.

Northwest Airlines initiated the industry-wide price hike when
it raised its unrestricted coach fares by 5 percent Thursday.
American Airlines and United Airlines quickly followed suit, as
did several other major carriers, including Delta Air Lines on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"There are some exceptions market-by-market, but the majority
of fare types are up 5 percent," an spokesman for American
Airlines told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Airline passenger traffic in the U.S. hit record high over the
Summer and carriers said that early fall bookings are at least
equal to last year, which was a strong travel period.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Extends Reserved Welcome to Albright's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa said today that Cairo welcomes U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's upcoming visit on the basis of her promised
balance in approaching the Mideast peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters today, Moussa said that Albright's visit,
which is the first since she assumed her post earlier this year,
is important, in light of Washington's role as a sponsor of peace.
</P>
<P>
She is expected to help revive the stalled peace process with a
major U.S. initiative. However, the six-month peace stalemate,
compounded by recent waves of suicide bombings and violence as
well as Israeli reprisals, threatens to make the high-profile
U.S. mission a flop.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said Egypt views Albright's visit in light of her recent
speech at the National Press Club that contained the promise of a
balanced approach in peace mediation.
</P>
<P>
"It is on this basis that we will receive Albright," he added.
</P>
<P>
In the August 6 speech in Washington, Albright reiterated that
the "sine qua non for progress is a mutual commitment to security
and against violence."
</P>
<P>
Israel held Palestinians responsible for Thursday's triple
bombing attack in Jerusalem, the second in five weeks, and
reimposed harsh closure on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. It has
also refused to hand over more land to Palestinians unless Arafat
cracks down on Muslim militants.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said the current situation was not created by only one
party, but is rather the result of Israeli policies that have
frustrated the Palestinian people and instigated the violence.
</P>
<P>
Washington is speaking in Israeli tune that before anything,
the PNA must exert itself "100 percent" -- in the word of the
State Department -- to combat terrorism.
</P>
<P>
An urgent Egyptian-Jordanian-PNA summit on Sunday was intended
to strike "the important balance in rejuvenating the peace process
to safeguard the rights of all parties," Moussa told reporters.
</P>
<P>
According to reports from Gaza, Arafat will meet with Albright
in the West Bank town of Jericho in the first stop of her
multi-leg tour that may also take her to Israel, Jordan, Egypt,
Syria and Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian chief negotiator Saeb Erekat said today the talks
in Jericho will cover security and political matters, with

<HEADLINE> SADC to Take Action in Mining, Education, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLNATYRE (MALAWI), September 8 (Xinhua) -- The one-day summit
of the Southern African Development Community (SADC), held here
in the southern Malawian city today, passed protocols on mining,
educaiton and eduction for future joint actions.
</P>
<P>
The protocol on mining provides for the harmonization of
national and regional policies, strategies and programs in the
mineral-rich sub-region, according to the communique issued after
the summit late this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The summit agreed that the ultimate objective of the protocol
was to promote inter-dependence and integration of the region's
mining industry with a view to enhancing its competitiveness and
increasing the regions's share in international mineral markets.
</P>
<P>
The education and training protocol, on the other hand,
provides a policy framework that allows the SADC region to
progressively move towards equivalence, harmonization and
eventual standardization of member states in education and
training systems, the communique said.
</P>
<P>
The group's summit decided that areas of cooperation will
cover the development and formulation of coherent education and
training policies, basic education, intermediate education and
training, high education and training, research and development,
as well as publishing and library services.
</P>
<P>
Education, as part of the human resources development plan,
got repeated emphasis by Nelson Mandela, SADC Chairman and
President of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The summit stressed that the inter-dependence among the SADC
member states could help guarantee a quicker and sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
The summit urged its group members to join hands for a
sub-regional integration.
</P>
<P>
The summit was satisfied with the economic development of the
region in the past year, saying that member states have generally
adopted pragmatic policies aimed at fostering financial
stability, private sector participation and market-let economy.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member group decided to take the Democratic Republic of
Congo and Seychelles to be their new members, boostering its
strength in mineral and tourism industries.
</P>
<P>
SADC is to hold its next annual summit in Mauritius, the
island country on Indian Ocean.

<HEADLINE> Canada to Reform Pension System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government is
mounting a major public-relations effort in a bid to radically
reform the country's public pension system this fall.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Paul Martin is expected to introduce
wide-ranging pension legislation within the first few weeks of the
new parliament, which will open on September 22.
</P>
<P>
The legislation package would overhaul the Canada/Quebec
Pension Plan according to an agreement and a timetable worked out
with the provinces.
</P>
<P>
It also includes a new Seniors Benefit to replace old-age
security and the guaranteed income supplement, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
As the centerpiece of the Liberal government's fall legislation
agenda, the planned bills would yield the most fundamental changes
to Canada's retirement-income system since the Canada Pension Plan
was introduced in 1966.
</P>
<P>
The changes would make seniors with family incomes of less than
40,000 dollars (28,000 USD) moderately better off, and cut the
current overall benefits to middle- and upper-income Canadians.
</P>
<P>
And the benefits would be based on family income rather than on
individual income.
</P>
<P>
The federal government expects that the new plan will reduce
the cost of seniors benefits by 10 percent by 2030 from what they
would have been otherwise.
</P>
<P>
The government is saying that the changes are necessary to put
the retirement system on a firmer footing before the big baby-boom
generation begins retiring in 2011.
</P>
<P>
By 2030, when the last boomers hit retirement age, there will
be an estimated 8.8 million Canadians over 65, compared with 3.7
million now.
</P>
<P>
The previous conservative Canadian government attempted to cut
pension benefits, but was forced by public anger to back off in
1985.
</P>
<P>
Critics argue that the new plan actually discourages savings
and will hurt future middle-class retirees.
</P>
<P>
"There are some misconceptions, and it is very important to
clear up the misconceptions and that is what the government is in
the process of doing," Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"It's simply a question of getting the facts right," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties are seizing upon the chance to launch
another round of attacks on the Liberal government.
</P>
<P>
The proposed system will undermine the willingness of Canadians
to save for their own old age because of the steep reduction in
benefits as incomes rise, the Reform Party argues.

<HEADLINE> Iran Unveils New Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today its
new foreign policy, highlighting "independence", "dialogue"
and "cooperation" with the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"We will maintain relations with any government that truly
respects our independence and refrains from interference in our
internal affairs," said Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi
while addressing foreign ambassadors and representatives of
international organizations based in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran does not seek domination or pursue expansionist
policies and rejects the same from others, adding that "one of
the most fundamental achievements of our revolution for which our
people sacrificed tremendously is Iran's independence."
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called on all the countries to closely cooperate and
participate in the search for solutions to international problems
in the world at the entrance of the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
He said Iran is prepared to participate, and would play a
positive and constructive role in the process.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi voiced urgent need for preventing tensions and
conflicts, calling for dialogue, understanding, tolerance and
observance of international laws and the U.N. Charter, encouraging
states to resolve their differences and conflicts through
negotiations and peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that instead of pointing finger at each other, we
should engage in dialogue." he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the international community to counter unilateral
economic sanctions which he called "indeed run against the will of
the international community," and should thereby be prevented from
spreading of this dangerous practice. He did not point his finger
at the United States.
</P>
<P>
Kharrazi called for wider economic cooperation with other
countries, saying Iran, situated in the heart of a vital
geo-strategic area of the world, is a secure and promising
economic and trading partner, with commitments and dedication to
regional and global cooperation, peace and security.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's IPPG Committee Makes Progress in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A Committee on Constitutional
Reforms in Kenya has made progress on the issue of minimum
reforms to be taken to facilitate free and fair elections during
the forthcoming General Elections.
</P>
<P>
George Anyona, Secretary of the committee set up last
Wednesday by the Inter-Parties Parliamentary Group (IPPG), was
addressing a press conference here this evening.
</P>
<P>
He said that the committee would hold consultations with
Kenyan head of state, religious leaders and others on the minimum
reforms of Kenya's constitution before the General Elections to
be held later this year.
</P>
<P>
The Co-Chairman of the committee Kiraitu Murungi pointed out
that a unanimous decision had been reached on a number of reforms
including new clauses to be introduced into the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The committee was in agreement that a definite date be set for
future general elections so that people could know before and get
prepared for the elections, he added.
</P>
<P>
Murungi noted that an overhaul of the drafted constitutional
review bill had been completed and amendments to that bill would
be introduced and presented to the plenary session to be held
tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
If adopted, he said, a new bill to amend the constitution of
Kenya would be drafted and subsequently be subjected to debate in
the seventh parliament.
</P>
<P>
Three technical committee were set up at the IPPG second
meeting held here last week with a mandate to make
recommendations including constitutional, legal and
administrative reforms,
</P>
<P>
More than 100 members of parliament from the ruling Kenya
African National Union and the Opposition held the first meeting
on August 28 at which the IPPG was formed to take up their
parliamentary roles to spearhead the reforms dialogue between the
ruling and opposition parties.

<HEADLINE> UN Chief Report on Peacekeeping, Peace-building </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Maintaining and
restoring international peace and security was a fundamental
purpose of the United Nations, said Secretary-General Kofi Annan
in his report published today.
</P>
<P>
Annan said that currently, approximately 22,500 soldiers and
civilian police were serving in 16 missions in countries around
the world. All help stablize potentially volatile situations, and
many involved extensive cooperation between the United States and
the regional organizations.
</P>
<P>
The UN chief said in the Balkans, the United Nations Mission in
Bosnia and Herzegovina and its International Police Task Force
worked closely with the NATO Stabilization Force to convert into
reality the undertakings made at Dayton, Ohio. The United Nations
Transitional Administration for Eastern Slavonia achieved
significant aims with the demilitarization of the local Serb
forces, and in facilitating the elections held in April 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said that the United Nations Preventive Deployment Force was
achieving its mandate in the former Yugoslav Republic of
Macedonia, and the United Nations Mission of Observers in Prevlaka
continued to monitor the situation in that area.
</P>
<P>
In Georgia, he said, the United Nations Observer Mission
cooperated with Commonwealth of Independent States peacekeeping
forces to enable parties to seek a political solution. It
supported the negotiation process that resulted in the general
peace agreement signed in Moscow in June 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said in Haiti, the United Nations was assisting in the
rebuilding if that country's police force, and working with the
Organization of American States in the field of human rights.
</P>
<P>
The chief said the United Nations Observer Mission in Liberia
was nearing the completion of its mandate, which had pursued in
conjunction with the economic Community of West African States, to
monitor a ceasefire and verify disarmament and demobilization.
Those steps paved the way for the elections and installation of a
new government in the summer of 1997.
</P>
<P>
He said so many post-cold-war conflicts had taken the form of
internal factional violence and civil strife that had significant
external repercussions.
</P>
<P>
He stressed peacekeeping in the sense of avoid a relapse into
armed conflict is a necessary but not sufficient condition for
establishing the foundations of an enduring and just peace.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out areas of UN peacekeeping activity should include
military security, civil law and order, human rights,refugees and
displaced persons, elections, local administration, involvement in
public utilities, health, education, finance, reconstruction and
general attempts to return society to some sense of normality.

<HEADLINE> Malawi Appeals for Urgent Food Aid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malawian President Bakili
Muluzi today appealed to other members of the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) for urgent food aid to his country.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi made this appeal at the 17th SADC summit being held in
Malawi's commercial capital Blantyre amid reports that his
country faces a shortfall of 288,000 tons of grain because of the
El Nino phenomenon, according to Zambia News Agency today.
</P>
<P>
The SADC holds a summit every year in a bid to coordinate its
action to strive for the integration of the regional economies.
</P>
<P>
"With this kind of food shortfall, Malawi will certainly need
assistance to meet the food needs of its people. In this regard,
I will welcome any assistance that is available among us," he
said at the opening of the annual summit.
</P>
<P>
The Malawian president explained that Malawi's latest crop
estimates indicate that food production has declined by 31
percent compared to the harvest in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Weather patterns in the region point to the re-emergence of
the El Nino phenomenon which was responsible for the drought in
Ethiopia that caused a serious famine in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Weather and agriculture officials predict that besides South
Africa and Zimbabwe, the strongest economies in the region, other
regional countries are likely to be devastated by an imminent
drought. Therefore, most SADC countries would have shortfalls of
grain this year.

<HEADLINE> Germany Expects Additional Tax Shortfall in 1997, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- German governments at federal,
state and municipal levels were facing a further 10 billion marks
(5.6 billion U.S. dollars) in tax shortfall this year in addition
to an earlier estimate of 18 billion (10 billion dollars), a
newspaper report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Berliner Zeitung newspaper, the federal
government in Bonn alone were expecting an additional shortfall in
tax revenues of five billion marks (2.8 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The report was later confirmed by budget experts in Bonn. But
they noted that the Bonn government had already taken
precautionary measures in order to ensure that Germany's budget
deficit would not be widened further.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry in Bonn, however, dismissed the newspaper
report as speculations.
</P>
<P>
A ministry spokesman said in a statement that it was still too
early to make realistic estimate about tax revenues at the moment.
The next official tax estimate is scheduled for November.
</P>
<P>
A widening tax shortfall would put additional burden on the
German government as it is struggling to meet the fiscal criteria
required for joining the planned single European currency, the
Euro.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to government projections, most experts expect that
Germany's budget deficit is likely to be slightly above the Euro
limit of three percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 1997.

JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's
Opposition National Party Executive Director Marthinus Van
Schalkwyk was elected party chief today to replace F. W. De
Klerk.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made to a crowd of cheering National
Party supporters after a meeting at a 105-member electoral
college.
</P>
<P>
Schalkwyk, 37, has become the party's eighth leader since its
inception in 1914. He is due to address a press conference later
today.
</P>
<P>
Schalkwyk said earlier that he favored a "coalition
government" for South Africa, and that former National Party
General Secretary Roelf Meyer was welcome to return to the party
-- under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
"Political parties must work together and I foresee that the
National Party will be part of a coalition government in 2004,"
Schalkwyk said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
The former ruling National Party withdrew from the government
of national unity last year due to its sharp political
differences with the African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk, who declared retirement on August 26, will make his
farewell address to parliament later today. His resignation as a
member of parliament is expected to come into effect this month.
</P>
<P>
De Klerk said his decision to quit the leadership and leave
active politics would make way for a new leader to take the party

<HEADLINE> Chinese PC Maker Enters Asia-Pacific Top Ten </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese personal computer
maker recently was named one of the top ten sellers in the
Asia-Pacific region in a survey on the region's PC market
conducted by Dataquest, a famous market surveyor.
</P>
<P>
The survey also shows that China has become the biggest PC
consumer in the region, taking up 23 percent of the total regional
sales, with Japan excluded.
</P>
<P>
Legend Computer, which ranked first in Chinese market sales,
was elevated from 13th to eighth place, the survey report
says. And it is the first Chinese PC vendor to enter the top ten
list.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Legend's market share in the Asia-Pacific
region in the first half of 1997 rose to 2.45 percent from 1.83
percent in 1996. Its 33.88 percent of increase beat other top ten
PC vendors.
</P>
<P>
The Legend computer remain the best seller the in home market
in the first half of this year, according to Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
Taking eighth place in Asia-Pacific PC sales is merely the
first step in Legend's development strategy, a spokesman of Legend
said.
</P>
<P>
Legend aims to enter the top five list of Asia-Pacific PC sales
while maintaining its leading status in the domestic market by the
year 2000, the spokesman said, adding that the annual PC
production and sales of the company is expected to reach one
million units by that time.
</P>
<P>
The market share of an Asia-Pacific top five PC seller is
estimated at five percent, the spokesman pointed out, and there is
still a big gap between that number and Legend's current standing.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the Chinese PC market recorded a rise of 39.1 percent,
in spite of a slowing global increase which is reflected in the
20.19 and 15.53 percent growth in the Asia-Pacific region and the world
respectively.

<HEADLINE> Gobert Denies Drug Use </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian 500cc world
motorcycle championship rider Anthony Gobert denied taking drugs
Tuesday and said he was upset about being sacked by Suzuki for a
posiest to an unspecified banned substance.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old said the test result, taken by the team and not
the sport's governing body, would be questioned and his family was
seeking legal advice because details of the results had not been
released.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the International Motorcycling Federation (FIM)
said Tuesday that the world body could impose a two-year ban for a
first offence involving certain banned substances.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman admitted not knowing what substance Suzuki's
tests had allegedly found.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued through Gobert's mother and manager Sue
Gobert on Tuesday said it had been claimed it was for marijuana
but the rider denied using it.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, Gobert said he was "absolutely devastated" by
the sacking and "bitterly disappointed" he was not told before it
was announced to the media.
</P>
<P>
"I have been tested a number of times, both by my team and the
FIM governing body this year and each result came back clear,"
Gobert said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Conglomerate's Affiliates Face Bankruptcy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Six affiliates of the ailing
Jinro Group, South Korea's 19th biggest conglomerate, faced
bankruptcy today after failing to honour bills returned to banks.
</P>
<P>
The affiliates are the group's liquor-making flagship Jinro
Ltd., Jinro Coor Brewery Co., Jinro General Foods Co., Jinro
Construction, Jinro International Co., and Jinro Mass Merchandise
Inc.
</P>
<P>
They were pronounced bankrupt after they failed to honour bills
worth 3.25 billion won (3.58 million U.S. dollars), which were
returned to nine banks.
</P>
<P>
The six affiliates filed applications for composition with
provincial district courts Monday to work out a repayment schedule
acceptable to creditors.
</P>
<P>
Jinro's liabilities will be frozen once its application for
court mediation is accepted.
</P>
<P>
But bank officials said that most of Jinro's 52 creditors,
including the main creditor Commercial Bank of Korea, will likely
agree with Jinro's request for composition, as they do not want to
see Jinro go bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The companies, however, can only operate with cash because
their current deposit account will be closed to block the issuance
of bills.
</P>
<P>
The Jinro Group, with debts of over 3 trillion won, was
described by its creditor banks as a beneficiary of the
anti-bankruptcy pact on April 28.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, Jinro implemented a self-rescue package worth
1.2 trillion won, including the disposal of real-estate holdings
and sharp curtailment in the number of affiliates and work force.
</P>
<P>
However, due to the ongoing slump in the domestic real estate
market, Jinro has succeeded in mobilizing only 216.8 billion won
so far, falling far short of the planned target.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Bomb Threats Hound Philippine Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine capital was
terrified today as many offices, including that of Manila
Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin, received bomb threats.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified man called the Archbishop's office this morning
and told office personnel that a bomb had been planted in that
office, local television reports said.
</P>
<P>
Later, the country's sugar center and central postal office
received similar bomb threats. Police were called to the three
places but no bomb was found.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Philippine Stock Exchange today beefed up its
security measures after receiving two bomb threats Monday.
</P>
<P>
These days, Manila has been gripped by fear after two separate
blasts killed six people and wounded 60 others in the capital area
last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
A shadowy military group later claimed responsibility for the
bombings and threatened with more offensives should opposition to
President Fidel Ramos' re-election plan persists.
</P>
<P>
The bombings prompted the opposition and the Roman Catholic
Church to accuse Ramos of creating instability by allowing
planting bombs in cities to provide an excuse for imposing martial
law.
</P>
<P>
Ramos bluntly rejected the accusations Monday, saying he had no
intention of proclaiming martial law and elections would proceed
as scheduled in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the explosions, the authorities put law-enforcement
forces in the capital city on high alert against any more
terrorist attacks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos and Sin met tonight for the third time in two
weeks in order to ease the tension surrounding the issue of
constitutional change.
</P>
<P>
Ramos is expected to persuade the influential archbishop to
call off the September 21 anti-charter-change protest rally, while
Sin is said to try to ask for a promise from Ramos to take a
clear-cut position against the charter change move.
</P>
<P>
There are no immediate reports about the outcome of the meeting
which was also attended by some leading opponents and proponents
of the charter change move.
</P>
<P>
Sin, who has been strongly opposed to changing the charter to
lift the term limit of Ramos, is planning to organize a massive
rally in central Manila on September 21 to protest the charter
change drive.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's Constitution, Ramos can only serve one
single six-year term, and must step down in June 1998 when his
term expires.

<P>
WASHINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post
</P>
<P>
-- As many as 400 people drowned before dawn on Monday when a
packed Haitian ferry tipped over as passengers crowded to one side
in a rush to get off. It was one of the worst maritime disasters
in 30 years.
</P>
<P>
-- NATO troops and hundreds of Bosnian Serbs were locked in a
tense confrontation in several Bosnian towns Monday when the
troops stopped 80 bus loads of Serbs heading for a political rally
in Banja Luka.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times
</P>
<P>
-- Suits have been filed by state and provincial governments in
Canada and the United States seeking redress from each other in a
dispute over salmon fishing. Fishermen and officials from the
province of British Columbia filed suit in Seattle, accusing the
United States of violating a 1985 treaty by overfishing in
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
-- The Clinton Administration approved exploratory oil drilling
on Federal land in Utah, where President Clinton last year erected
a national monument to prevent the rich wilderness from
industrial development.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal
</P>
<P>
-- The Justice Department is dropping charges against a Saudi
dissident suspected of a role in last year's bombing in Dhahran
that killed 19 U.S. servicemen. The department will seek to
extradite him to Saudi Arabia. The charges he faced were unrelated
to that bombing.
</P>
<P>
-- President Clinton is delaying a formal verdict on the 368.5
billion dollar tobacco settlement until at least next week, as
heightened anti-tobacco sentiment in Congress underscores the
fragility of the accord between the industry, states and
public-health groups.

<HEADLINE> FIFA: Inter Milan must Pay Extra Money for Ronaldo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Inter Milan will have to pay
Barcelona an extra dlrs 1.8 million for Brazilian football
superstar Ronaldo, the world soccer governing body FIFA said
Tuesday in Zurich, Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Named as FIFA's Player of the Year in January, Ronaldo was
already the world's most expensive soccer player. The decision
raises to about dlrs 28 million the amount paid Barcelona for the
release.
</P>
<P>
This is in addition to Inter Milan's signing bonus to Ronaldo
of dlrs 14 million and an annual salary of dlrs 3 million.
</P>
<P>
FIFA rejected the Italian club's appeal lion pesetas (about
dlrs 26 million) already given Barcelona for releasing Ronaldo
from his eight-year contract.
</P>
<P>
A three-member appeal panel ruled that part of the high sum
already paid by Inter for the 20-year-old forward was to be
regarded as a form of compensation, a statement from FIFA said.
</P>
<P>
The panel said its decision is final.
</P>
<P>
After transferring to Barcelona before last season, Ronaldo led
the Spanish league in scoring with 34 goals. England's Alan
Shearer, who moved from Blackburn Rovers to Newcastle for 15
million pounds (dlrs 25 million) last year but is now injured, was
considered to have been the most expensive transfer in the history
of the sport before Ronaldo's move.

<HEADLINE> China Records Stable Industrial Growth in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's industrial enterprises
above township-level generated an added value of 162.1 billion
yuan last month, an increase of 10.9 percent over the
same period of 1996, said a report released by the State Statistics
Bureau (SSB) today.
</P>
<P>
All the country's state-run enterprises registered an added
value of 93 billion yuan in August, up 8.4 percent over the
corresponding period of last year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Especially, the growth rate of the state-owned sector stood at 5.9
percent, which was 0.6 percentage points higher than the average
for the January-July period, the SSB report said.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the slowdown trend continued in China's
collectively-owned sector, of which the growth rate dropped to 8.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
Other economic sectors grew at a rate of 16.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the SSB sources, in August the sales rate for
industrial products exceeded the average in the first seven months
this year and hit 96.7 percent, up 0.2 percentage points over the
same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The country's energy output in August climbed to 104 million
tons of standard coal, up 3.2 percent compared with that in August
of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The increase in the output of major raw materials, including
pig iron, steel and non-ferrous metals, ranged from 7.5 percent to
19.6 percent, while the production of chemical products and
building materials was also accelerated a bit, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The sales for washing machines, freezers and household
air-conditioners increased by 20 percent in August. The
information products, such as program-controlled switching gear,
computers, PCs and integrated circuits, are on high market demand,
and generated an increase of more than 24 percent in production.
</P>
<P>
The SSB report said that a hopeful revival is now dawning on
China's industrial sector, which made profits of 73.7 billion yuan
in the first seven months of this year, up 33 percent on an annual
basis. The profits of state-owned enterprises reached 14.73
billion yuan, up 92.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted that the losses of industrial
enterprises is still a thorny nut far from being thoroughly
solved.

FREETOWN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Panic gripped the capital
Freetown Monday evening when over half a dozen heavy
anti-aircraft guns opened fire at a Nigerian air force jet which
streaked across the sky at high altitude.
</P>
<P>
The jet returned to the Nigerian contingent base at Sierra
Leonean grounds of State House and six other locations in the
west and east of the city.
</P>
<P>
Military Leader Major Johnny Paul Koroma was visiting victims
of the recent stray shells at the main hospital in the city when
the jet flew.
</P>
<P>
State House aides told Xinhua later in a telephone interview,
"the Head of State Views the development as another example of
gross violation of our airspace resulting in the apparent loss of
civilian lives."
</P>
<P>
The shootings caused hundreds of market women to abandon their
wares, overturning their goods such as salt and rice as they
dashed for cover.
</P>
<P>
Security has been strengthened after a Nigerian jet launched a
rocket attack on a Pakistani ship at the port here discharging
rice Saturday and Sunday.
</P>

there are even instances of people in their early twenties
suffering from the disease.
</P>
<P>
Coronary heart disease is going to surpass cancer as the major
health threat for Chinese. The number of deaths caused by the
disease is more than 30 per 100,000 in cities and nearly 20 per
100,000 in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Coronary heart disease used to be referred to as "the rich
man's disease" in China because only the rich people could afford
to eat rich food, but things clearly differ now. And, doctors warn
that people should become more aware of their weight and should
eat more reasonably.

<HEADLINE> Investigation on Diana's Death Moving Slowly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Investigation into the death of
Princess Diana is moving ahead slowly, while investigators are
inclined to believe that the crash of the Mercedes was caused by
overspeeding and alcohol consumption by the driver.
</P>
<P>
The daily le Figaro said today that the criminal brigade of the
French police force in charge of the investigation ruled out
several hypotheses, which includes mechanical failure of the
Mercedes S-280 and use of drugs in the car.
</P>
<P>
Police are also confident that two previous examinations made
to discover the amount of alcohol in the bloodstream of the car's
chauffeur, Henri Paul, were correct.
</P>
<P>
The two examinations revealed that the amount of alcohol in
Paul's bloodstream was at least three times higher than the legal
limit.
</P>
<P>
The result of the third blood/alcohol test on Paul will be
announced today. Police are not expecting any new surprises, le
Figaro quoted police sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Police said charges of negligence could be brought against the
Hotel Ritz, which is owned by the family of Dodi al Fayed, the
Egyptian millionaire who was also killed in the car crash, for
"endangering the life of another person" by allowing Paul to drive
the car.
</P>
<P>
Experts examining the car-wreck and the route of the vehicle
will determine in the coming weeks the cause for the abrupt
braking of the car in the Alma tunnel, which was made by the
driver some 16 meters from the site of the crash, as well as the
speed of the car at that time, which is estimated at 180
kilometers per hour (110 miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
Investigators said the body of Dodi al Fayed was autopsied and
toxicological tests made after being returned to England on August
31. But no test results were published before the body was buried.
</P>
<P>
The body of Diana was immediately transferred to the British
embassy after she died in hospital on August 31, and no autopsy
was performed in France because of the so-called "complications in
the diplomatic field."
</P>
<P>
Police say they believe the testimony of an FM radio reporter
who said his car was passed by Diana's car at the entry of Alma
tunnel. He said her car was traveling at a speed of around 160
kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour).
</P>
<P>
Investigators excluded testimony given by an unemployed Rouen
port worker, Francois Levi, who claimed that he saw
motorcycle-riding photographers passing the car in the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
They also excluded a theory that a car ahead of the Mercedes
was trying to slow it down to let photographers take pictures. The
only car caught by police in the tunnel was a Renault driven by
photographer Fabrice Chassery, who arrived at the scene minutes
after the crash.
</P>
<P>
Police said no testimony by rescue workers or doctors had
confirmed the rumors that photograpahers had touched or moved the
body of Diana after the crash took place.

<P>
LUXEMBOURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)'s
rural development policy should be as decentralized as possible so
member countries can find solutions to meet their individual

Franz Fischler, the EU commissioner responsible for agriculture

meeting of EU agriculture ministers held in Echternach,
Luxembourg, which closed Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the great diversity of rural areas in the Union, it
is natural that a policy for their development must be based on
the principle of subsidiarity," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has
reportedly proposed a reform of the whole gamut of its rural
development policy, which is being criticized for being too
complicated and inconsistent.
</P>
<P>
The EU is planning to let all its member states and regions
define their own rural development strategies in the future,

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Urged to Develop Packaging Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
been urged to develop the country's packaging industry to make it
competitive, the Philippine News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted a study from the Board of Investments as
saying the industry faces stiff competition from Korea, India and
other ASEAN countries like Thailand and Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The study showed the industry has been dependent on importation
of packaging products due to outmoded equipment and high cost of
imported machinery and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The value of imported packaging products increased to 103.63
million U.S. dollars in 1995 from 78.61 million dollars in 1994
and 57.36 million dollars in 1993, it showed.
</P>
<P>
High cost of money rendered packaging firms and end-users
unable to upgrade their equipment as often as competitor
countries, it said.
</P>
<P>
The industry also has been losing with its competitors due to
poor quality of packaging which is the result of market niching
and the pressure to engage in price competition.
</P>
<P>
Also, some of the government's policies primarily on tariff
duties have been affecting the industry.
</P>
<P>
To address these problems, the industry has to develop
environment-friendly packaging products like the waste paper-based
recyclable inner cushion packaging product project.
</P>
<P>
Local firms have started to adapt to trends which are seen to
dominate the world packaging market such as aseptic packaging,
retort pouches and bar coding, it said.

on August 19 in order to stabilize the rupiah against the U.S.
dollar.
</P>
<P>
The new action was a follow-up to the government reform package
announced on September 3 to relax the tight monetary policy in
stages.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah has fallen more than 10 percent in the past month
and nearly 23 percent since January this year following offshore
speculative attacks on the currency and a rush by local companies
to hedge their foreign borrowings.

<HEADLINE> World Coffee Output Estimated to Decline This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- This year's world coffee
production is estimated to decline due to the drought that hit
several coffee-producing nations, an official of the Indonesian
Coffee and Cacao Research Center said today.
</P>
<P>
This year, Brazil is estimated to produce only 25 million bags,
 down from its usual 29 million bags a year, and Colombia, only 10
million bags, down from its usual 18 million bags a year, said
Deputy Director of center Surip Mawardi in Surabaya, East Java,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"Even Indonesia, which usually produces 425,000 tons a year, is
expected to have a lower production," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mawardi said the decline in world production of coffee will
raise its price in the world market. At grower's level, the per kg
price of Robusta Coffee is 3,000 rupiah (about one U.S. dollar)
and Arabica Coffee from 6,000 to 7,000 rupiah (2 to 2.3 dollars),
he said, adding that coffee prices are expected to remain at this
level until the end of the year, after which they are expected to
stabilize.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, reports said coffee markets in London and New York
came back to a boil this week as the main feature on the
commodities markets, following the summer break, heated up by the
prospect of a low harvest in Indonesia, which is the world's third
largest coffee exporter.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: SADC Working Toward Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Countries in
southern Africa are working on economic integration through
tightened cooperations in the sub-region and beyond.
</P>
<P>
Economic integration has been the main theme during the
one-day summit of the Southern African Development Community
(SADC) held in Blantyre, southern Malawi Monday.
</P>
<P>
The communique was issued after the 17th summit of the
12-member group admitted the Democratic Republic of Congo and the
Seychelles into the regional body, expanding it to 14.
</P>
<P>
The summit had been fruitful and productive as it adopted two
declarations on gender equality and land-mines and two protocols
on trade and mining, which have combined to show to the world
SADC's courage and efforts for the region's integration for
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The SADC summit is to find ways to maintain a sustainable
development through tighter economic ties among the member
states.
</P>
<P>
The development of human resources, a topic that has drawn the
attention of the leaders at the SADC summit, is said to be the
key for future prosperity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Gertrude Mongella, chairperson of the United Nations Fourth
World Conference on Women, regarded the summit as an important
"milestone" on the way to democracy and development.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the region, which is rich in mineral resources,
decided in their protocol on mining to harmonize national and
regional policies, strategies and programs related to the
development and exploitation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
This would ensure a better tapping of the natural resources
through inter-dependence and integration with a view to enhancing
its competitiveness and increasing the region's share in world
mineral market.
</P>
<P>
SADC leaders also agreed to discuss the tariff reduction and
modalities for tariff structure reform in preparation for a free
trade zone targeted in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Ever since its founding in 1992, SADC has sought to transform
itself into a more dynamic organization that will lead the region
to greater cooperation and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
"Inter-dependence among neighbors and the pressures of a
globalized economy increasingly defined by regional blocs dictate
that we work together as a region," said South African President
Nelson Mandela, chairman of SADC.
</P>
<P>
A preference for democracy and the peaceful resolution of
disputes, commitment to the disciplined management of public
resources, policies designed to encourage the flourishing of
enterprises and far-reaching plans for construction have become
the norm across the region, Mandela noted.

<HEADLINE> Round-up: SADC Working Toward Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE, Malawi, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The region, with
abundant human and natural resources, the prevailing peace and
stability, has potential for growth with competitiveness,
according to Kaire Mbuende, Executive Secretary of SADC.
</P>
<P>
SADC is doing everything possible to improve its
competitiveness in line with dictates of the globalization
process, Mbuende said.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional organization will also help its members to
diversify into manufacturing for export rather than relying on
export of raw materials.
</P>
<P>
While stressing the importance of closer cooperation ties
among member states, SADC is also engaged in searching out ways
to coordinate with other economic and political organizations in
Africa and other international organizations, such as the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa, African Development Bank and
European Union.
</P>
<P>
SADC, which was set up in August 1992, was aimed at promoting
economic integration toward a fully developed common market.
</P>
<P>
The regional grouping has a total population of 150 million
and a combined Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of 170 billion U.S.
Dollars. All 12 SADC member states registered positive growth
rates last year, ranging from two to more than 10 percent. Seven
states recorded growth rates of five percent or higher.
</P>
<P>
Now with the Democratic Republic of Congo and the Seychelles
admitted to the group, and more with tentative interest in
application, SADC members, between them, will inject new blood
into regional development, especially in mining and tourism
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Malawian President Bakili Muluzi urged SADC members to pay
special attention to the improvement of the efficiency and
productivity of the small and medium scale enterprises, the
informal sectors and the small-holder agricultural sector, which
offer real prospects for gains in productivity.
</P>
<P>
The summit's Land-mine Declaration recalled the savagery and
human suffering unleashed on innocent civilians in the region,
where the largest number of explosive anti-personnel mines in the
world seemed to be scattering around, and called for a "land-mine
free" southern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Muluzi, host of the SADC summit said at the meeting that
countries of the group should join their efforts in putting an
end to the region's being used as a testing ground for economic
or social experiments originating from rich and distant
countries.
</P>
<P>
SADC countries should, Muluzi said, bear the burden of their
own cherished hope for integration and prosperity while they get
genuine help from the international communities.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Maintaining Close Cooperation With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Austin Hu, acting head of the
World Bank's China mission, told Xinhua today that "the World Bank
has built up a mature and close co-operative partnership with
China and such partnership will continue for a long time."
</P>
<P>
China is an important partner of the World Bank and it is ready
to develop its close co-operation with China further, he said.
</P>
<P>
The bank approved financial aid for 184 projects in China by
the end of June, involving nearly 27.97 billion US dollars,
including 9.2 billion US dollars in concessional loans from its
cheap loan arm, the International Development Association.
</P>
<P>
China rejoined the international financial institution in 1980
and now has bank-funded projects in almost all economic sectors,
but mostly in agriculture, poverty reduction, transportation,
energy, health, education, environmental protection, and
industrial development, according to Hu.
</P>
<P>
He commended China for its excellent work in Bank-aided
projects, saying that the success rate for project implementation
is more than 95 percent in China, well above the world average of
around 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is ready to support modernization in China,
which has been the Bank's largest client since 1993, he said,
noting that "we are confident about the future development of
China and we want to have role to play in China's growth process."
</P>
<P>
The bank is also interested in China's experience in economic
restructuring and development for possible use in other developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the roughly three billion US dollars in annual
lending in the years up to the year 2000, the World Bank will also
provide China with technical assistance, consultation, and
proposals for policy-making, Hu said.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do our part to help the Chinese economy to
intergrate with the rest of world faster and better," he said,
adding that he has been impressed with China's success in
controlling inflation and achieving an economic soft landing.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the World Bank's annual meeting in Hong Kong
indicates that the international financial institution is fully
confident in economic development in Hong Kong and inland China.

<HEADLINE> Race Debate Is Still on in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian Independent MP
Pauline Hanson said today she had no regrets about the
controversial maiden speech she delivered one year ago tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The speech, in which she warned Australia was in danger of
being swamped by Asians and called for an end to foreign
investment and a cut in immigration intake, sparked a bitter race
debate in Australia and surprised many Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued today, Hanson said she was proud of the
speech and all it had created, describing the past 12 months as a
year of jubilation and trauma.
</P>
<P>
"On September 10, 1996, I proceeded to deliver a speech that
many of my fellow Australians had been waiting a long time to hear
and yet my fellow colleagues cringed," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I would not change one word of it and would again deliver that
same speech with the same pride and determination as then," Hanson
said.
</P>
<P>
Although her speech was dismissed by Australian Immigration
Minister Philip Ruddock as appalling, racist and beyond contempt
later in the week, Hanson became the most reported and
talked-about Australian citizen in the country and some part of
Asia during the past year.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who refused to condemn her speech
last September by saying Hanson has the right to speak her mind,
finally said Hanson was wrong on May 8, 1997.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's attack, which was widely seen as belated,
came amid growing criticism of the government's handling of the
race debate and amid fear that negative images created by the
debate would hurt Australia's trade and other interest with
booming Asia.
</P>
<P>
Asia buys about 41 billion U.S. dollars worth of Australian
goods and services each year, around 60 percent of everything
Australia sells to the world.
</P>
<P>
Contrary to the prime minister's prediction that Hanson
phenomenon will be over in three months, both sides of Australian
politics have continued to attack Hanson's politics.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Trade Minister Tim Fischer told a
business breakfast in Beijing today that Hanson's views on Asian
immigration were damaging the tourism and education sectors.
</P>
<P>
Asian tourists and students bring hundreds of millions of U.S.
dollars to Australia each year, creating thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said the race debate would be causing
concern among families who were "committing to sending their young
sons and daughters to universities in Australia and wondering if
they'll be safe".
</P>
<P>
Hanson had her One Nation Party registered on March 26, 1997,
nearly three months after the prime minister predicted that plans
for Hanson's party would fail.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, there are no signs that Hanson phenomenon will be
over.

<P>
GUANGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South China's port city
of Guangzhou recently issued a new regulation on motor vehicle
emissions.
</P>
<P>
Guangzhou became the first province in China to require
emission control equipment for all motor vehicles.

Random inspections will be conducted and the licenses of
operators of vehicles failing to meet national emission control
standards will be temporarily suspended.
</P>

Guangzhou's compulsory initial emission control regulations
were introduced last year. Over 70 percent of the vehicles
stopped during random inspections have now passed emission tests, up
significantly from the 46 percent passing rate in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The city government also announced a decision to require all
vehicles to use unleaded gas, effective from October 1.

<HEADLINE> International Coordination Needed To Fight Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A multilateral coordinated
mechanism for combating the ever-growing international crime wave
should be set up as soon as possible, Chinese and foreign experts
attending the 19th International Course of Higher Specialization
for Police Forces have suggested.
</P>
<P>
The international seminar closed here today after a week of
discussions among approxiamtely 280 participants from 67 countries
and regions.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Entao, assistant minister of Public Security of China,
delivered a speech at the closing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
He said that each country should attach importance to the
current threat facing public security in the world, which mainly
includes some problems concerning organized crimes such as drug
trafficking, gun-related crime, white-collar crime and illegal
immigration.
</P>
<P>
Both Chinese and overseas Delegates reached a consensus during
the seminar that the trend of technological advances, grouping and
internationalization of crimes poses new challenges to police
work, and police departments in all countries should increase
contacts and learn from each other's successes to set up a
much-needed, coordinated and multilateral approach.
</P>
<P>
Since adopting the reform and opening-up policy in late 1970s,
China has formulated the strategy of comprehensive management of
public security, and ushered in a whole new set of theories and
tactics in the field of public security management, crime
prevention and combating crimes.

NANJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Jiangsu Province has
built up a port network in coastal areas and along the Yangtze
River, with 10 Grade 1 ports and two Grade 2 ports open to foreign
vessels.
</P>
<P>
They have business ties with 160 overseas ports and contribute
to the development of foreign and domestic trade. There are a
number of development zones with hi-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 104 deep berths capable of handling
10,000-ton and above vessels. In 1996, the ports handled 130
million tons of cargo, 25.41 million tons of which were exports,
up 34 percent and 66.1 percent from 1991, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu's container shipments began in 1981, when it handled
only 3,518 TEUs. By 1996, the figure was 475,000 TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The province is building coal, food and edible oil,
petrochemical, and containers ports. Two large coal ports have
been built, one in Lianyungang, and the other in the provincial
capital of Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
The Pukou Coal Port is the largest along the Yangtze River.

<HEADLINE> Panda Gives Birth to Twins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A giant panda living in a
research center here gave birth to twins this morning -- the
second set of panda twins to enter the world in the past 15 days.
</P>
<P>
The panda siblings weighed 130 grams and 125 grams. The elder,
born about 90 minutes before his brother, is the first of the
fourth-generation of pandas kept in a man-made environment.
</P>
<P>
The seven-year-old Yaya, a first-time mother, is one of the
first set of panda twins in the world to be raised successfully in
an artificial environment. Her grandmother, Meimei, has had 11
children, who make up the world's biggest panda family.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas have difficulty getting pregnant and their babies
often die young. A female giant panda gets pregnant only once a
year, and can give birth to only one to two babies per
pregnancy. She generally only has one baby from her first
pregnancy, according to experts.
</P>
<P>
The Chengdu Giant Panda Breeding and Research Center, covering
an area of 30-plus hectares in southwest China's Sichuan Province,
is the country's only professional center of the kind. It has a
simulated wild ecological environment for pandas.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda, regarded as a "living fossil," is the most
renowned endangered species. It is estimated that there are only
about 1,000 giant pandas living on earth, most of which live in
the mountains around southwest China's Sichuan Basin.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Junta Wants Peaceful Solution to Civil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The military government in
sierra Leone said today it will not allow its border in the
southeast to be used as a springboard to create any instability
to the new government in Liberia.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State for the East, Captain Eddie Kanneh said in
a press briefing in the capital here, "we want a peaceful
solution to the war with the Kamajors who are attacking us at
Zimmi (near the Liberian border) but they are headstrong."
</P>
<P>
"They should realize by now that they cannot defeat the
conventional and well trained sierra Leone army," Kanneh said.
</P>
<P>
The official who was on consultations with military
specialists in Freetown, blamed the clashes on the border between
government soldiers and the Kamajors or tribal men "on Nigerian
soldiers" in west African peace-keepers known as ECOMOG based at
the Mano River Bridge.
</P>
<P>
"They've given them (Kamajors) arms and ammunition and
training them," Kanneh claimed.
</P>
<P>
According to Kanneh, in a clash between government soldiers
and Kamajors last Sunday, 12 Kamajors were killed along with five
ULIMO-K fighters belonging to defeated Liberian presidential
candidate, Alhaji Kromah.
</P>
<P>
Kromah has previously denied any involvement with the Kamajors
in Sierra Leone although he is reportedly friendly with ousted
president Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Liberia radio reported today that President Charles
Taylor has ordered his security forces "to increase surveillance
on the (Sierra Leone-Liberian) border to halt any cross border
activities."
</P>
<P>
According to the radio, monitored in Freetown, over 100,000
refugees from Sierra Leone were moving toward the border hoping
to enter Liberia.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Liberia's Information Minister Joe Mulba as
saying, "we are anxious to restore peace in Sierra Leone."
</P>
<P>
"Liberia is calling on all sides in the conflict to return to
the peace table" and find a solution to the impasse, Mulba said.

"All 101 teachers to be awarded have had outstanding
achievements in teaching, reforms, and scientific research," said
Xi Guangping, a SEC official in charge of social sciences. Most
of them have received provincial, ministry, or university awards,
and 15 have special State Council stipends because of their
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Zhong Jiadong, a professor at Shanghai's Fudan University, was
praised for bringing Deng Xiaoping's theory into the
classroom. Zhang compiled the teaching materials to describe
China's reforms, opening up, and modernization drive and Deng's
personality.
</P>
<P>
The word 'reform' is a requirement for those who want to be
among the 101 winners. The SEC has started reforming the teaching
of ethics, both in content and in style in colleges and
universities.
</P>
<P>
It calls for teacher improvements. A Marxism-Leninism training
school of People's University will have the first group of
teachers in October. China's top universities will ask social
science deans to get further training there.
</P>
<P>
The 3.02 million college students in China have from four to
seven obligatory classes in Marxist theory and ethics during their
two to five years of schooling. Graduate students are also
required to take one or two political science courses.

<HEADLINE> China's Reaction to Panama's Inviting Taiwan to Canal Congress </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China has expressed regret
over Panama's decision to invite Taiwan authorities to Universal
Congress on the Panama Canal.
</P>
<P>
The Panamanian government has disregarded China's solemn
statements and admonitions, and has acted in violation of the UN
Charter and the UN resolution No. 2758, a Chinese Foreign Ministry
spokesman said in response to a question about the matter at a
press conference today.
</P>
<P>
It has in fact provided an opportunity for Taiwan authorities
to continue their attempts to split the motherland, and has
jeopardized China's sovereignty and interference in China's
domestic affairs, Shen Guofang said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that this decision by the Panamanian government has
had a negative effect, and that the leaders of the United Nations
and its relevant organs as well as leaders of most countries did
not participate in the conference.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the countries that strongly supports the just
struggle of the Panamanian people to resume sovereignty over the
Panama Canal, and that it supports the two resolutions adopted by
the UN on the world conferences on the issue, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government reiterates its readiness to develop
relations with all countries based on the Five Principles of
Peaceful Co-existence, he said, expressing the hope that Panama
will take concrete actions to respond positively to China's
efforts in the normalization of bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Shen went on to say that the leaders of the Taiwan authorities,
while saying that they are willing to improve relations across the
straits, continue their attempts to create "Two Chinas", or "One
China, One Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
These actions undermine the improvement of cross-straits
relations and the peaceful reunification process, the spokesman
said, expressing the hope that the Taiwan authorities will take
effective measures to halt such activities to split the
motherland.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine stock market
today bounced back sharply on declining domestic interest rates,
fading concerns over political instability and a recovering local
currency.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine Stock Exchange composite index (Phisix) surged
122.28 points or 5.8 percent, the biggest single-day gain in two
months, to 2228.85.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said a statement from President Fidel Ramos
Monday somehow appeased investors. Ramos said the 1998 elections
would be held as scheduled and he would not proclaim martial law.
</P>
<P>
Declining interest rates and a recovering Philippine peso also
contributed to today's rally, they said, adding that they doubted
the rally is sustainable.
</P>
<P>
All sub-indices ended on upward side, with the mining sector
and the commercial and industrial sector posting the biggest gains
to reach 3538.8 points (+178.8) and 3124.7 points (+152.2)
respectively.
</P>
<P>
All shares index rose 32.40 points or 4.7 percent to 711.39
points. Volume turnover was 4.7 billion shares, much higher than
Monday's 2.8 billion. Value turnover was heavy at 30.6 billion
pesos (956 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Advances outnumbered declines 127 to 12, while 36 of the 195
traded issues remained unchanged.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, the Phisix fell almost 2.8 percent in early trade,
but buying spurred by Ramos' statement nudged the index to 2106.58
points, only 2.64 points lower than Friday's close.

<HEADLINE>   Aid Coordination Committee Concerns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Local Aid Coordination
Committee For Palestine expressed here today its grave concern
over the Israeli closure on the Palestinian territories and
asked donor nations to speed up their aids to the Palestinian
people.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting here, representatives from the United Nations
Office of the Coordinator in the Occupied Territories, World
Bank's Resident Mission in the West Bank and Gaza, the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) and the donor nations also expressed
their condemnation of the terrorist attacks in Jerusalem on July
30 and September 4.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli delegation was not present at today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
While security issues concern all, the impact of closure and
withholding of revenue transfer (by Israel) are considered
counterproductive to security concerns. It undermines the key
cornerstone on which the donor community participate in the peace
process, the meeting said.
</P>
<P>
Donors are answerable to internal budgetary processes which
will question the continuing commitment of resources to a
development process damaged by closures, it said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said that Israeli government's withholding of
revenue transfer due to the PNA was not related to security.
</P>
<P>
Transfers are the basis for establishing financially sustainable
Palestinian institutions for self-governance. Without a stable
income and trade, the PNA can not provide for the welfare of its
people and to establish a sound economic and social platform for
Palestinian development is clearly in the interests of the entire
region, it said.
</P>
<P>
PNA representative told the meeting that almost 100 million
U.S. dollars in revenue transfer is now being withheld by Israel
and appealed to donors to provide 50 million U.S. dollars in
bridging finance.
</P>
<P>
The meeting urged the donor nations to provide more financial
aid to PNA.
</P>
<P>
Israel imposed total closures on Palestinian territories on
Thursday following the bombing blasts in Jerusalem. The previous
closure was imposed on July 30 for the same reason.

JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- a committee of five
cabinet ministers has been set up here to formulate a response to
the unpredicatable weather patterns expected in South Africa due
to the El Nino phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
Water Affairs Minister Kader Asmal said today the committee,
chaired by Provincial Affairs Minister Valli Moosa, was formed to
coordinate national disaster management.
</P>
<P>
It would draw together the recommendations of the respective
departments on El Nino and take them to the cabinet, Asmal said.
</P>
<P>
The committee also consists of Agriculture Minister Derek
Hanekom, Welfare Minister Geraldine Fraser-Moleketi and Defense
Minister Joe Modise.
</P>
<P>
El Nino was unpredictable in terms of when its effects might
be felt and so were the effects themselves, which could range
from floods to drought, Asmal said.
</P>
<P>
It was conservatively estimated that the 1982-1983 El Nino
weather patterns had cost South Africa a loss of 5.1 billion U.S.
Dollars.

<HEADLINE> 32 Killed in Tamil Rebel Attack on Chinese Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- At least 32, including five
civilians, were killed and many others injured while eight crew
members were missing this morning in a Tamil rebel attacked on a
Chinese vessel off Pulmoddai coast in Trincomalee District, Sri
Lanka, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes occurred when Tamil rebels staged an attack around
1:00 a.m. on the Panama-registered civil cargo ship "MV
Cordiality", owned by China Ocean Shipping Company, at anchor off
Pulmoddai, about 280 kilometers northeast to the capital of
Colombo.
</P>
<P>
31 Chinese crew members and 60 Sri Lankan workers were on board
the ship to load ilmenite sands when the ship was attacked.
</P>
<P>
The engine room of the ship caught fire after the Tamil rebels
fired several rounds of rocket-propelled grenades to the cargo,
which was severely damaged.
</P>
<P>
Government troops who escorted the ship engaged the rebels and
rescued 23 Chinese crew members, including five who jumped into
the sea to escape the attack. The other eight members were
missing.
</P>
<P>
Well-informed sources in Colombo said those missing could
probably be taken away by the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Five Sri Lankan workers were killed by the rebels and another
five were injured.
</P>
<P>
A military spokesman put the death toll of the attackers at 25.
He added that a large number of the rebels were wounded. The army
also suffered two death and four injuries.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lankan navy sent fast attack craft and boats to assist the
army during the fire exchange. At least four rebel boats were sunk
and another three damaged.
</P>
<P>
On July 8, the rebels hijacked a vessel of the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea hired by the Sri Lankan government to
transport goods to the Jaffna Peninsula when it was on way to
Colombo from the north.

<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 9 (Xinhua)-- Swedish Foreign Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen and the EU Commissioner for Foreign Relations Hans
van den Broek failed Monday to overcome their differences over the
process of EU expansion, local reports said today.
</P>
<P>
Hjelm-Wallen insisted that the European Union (EU) hold
negotiations on EU membership with all the countries wishing to
join EU.
</P>
<P>
He argued that the process of reform would be threatened in
those countries excluded from the first round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
However, Broek said that only six countries would be allowed to
attend the first round of negotiations: Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Slovenia and Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
He said that if negotiations were attended by countries that
were not prepared for entry into the EU, disappointment would be
rife among the people of those countries since they would see
little in the way of positive results.
</P>
<P>
Broek, who is here for a meeting of the Conservative and
Christian Democratic parties in the European Parliament as well as
a meeting with Hjelm-Wallen on EU's future expansion, suggested a
system under which the countries wishing to join the EU could be
bound more closely to the organization through special programs.

HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Asia's largest aircraft
engine testing center was launched in Hong Kong, with the
potential to become the region's technical troubleshooter, today's
South China Morning Post reported.
</P>
<P>
Some 600 people will be employed at the center of Hong Kong
Aero Engine Services Ltd. (Haesl), a joint venture between
Rolls-Royce and Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Co.
</P>
<P>
The plant will test and service Rolls-Royce engines used in the
fleets of Hong Kong flag carriers Cathay Pacific and Dragonair, as
well as the Chinese mainland's airlines, and contracts are being
negotiated around the world.
</P>
<P>
Haesl Director and General Manager Tom Begley said the plant
could become a regional facility, not only performing scheduled
overhauls, but also for trouble-shooting.
</P>
<P>
"This will be one of the leading engine overhaul centers in the
world and we will have the expertise to take that trouble-shooting
role or deal with teething problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will service engines here or send people to deal with
problems while the engine is still on the aircraft."
</P>
<P>
It is expected to take three or four years for the center,
which when completed will cover over 12,000 square meters, to
build up business until it can handle its maximum of 300 engines a
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Uganda's overall coffee
export earnings decreased by 6.1 percent, from 358.3 million U.S.
Dollars in 1995/1996 to 336.6 million in 1996/1997 due to low
world prices, Uganda Coffee Development Authority said.
</P>
<P>
In the past eleven months of 1996/1997 coffee season, the
total coffee export topped 4 million bags (60 kilos per bag),
witnessing a 6.36 percent increase from 3.7 million bags recorded
in the same period in 1995/1996 season, it said in a report
available today.
</P>
<P>
The decline of coffee export earnings of the country was
blamed on the estimated increased coffee yield of Brazil, the
main coffee exporter in the world.
</P>
<P>
The other reason causing the decline of the coffee export of
the country is the increased stocks in the United States, the
main consumer of coffee and the increased estimated coffee yield
of Colombia from 10.2 million bags to 10.6 million bags.
</P>
<P>
But the news of impact on coffee production caused by El Nino
improved to some extent the buying condition in the world market,
the report noted.
</P>
<P>
Coffee is a traditional cash crop in Uganda which is one of
the leading coffee exporters in Africa.

<HEADLINE> Santer Calls Delay in Euro Launch "Unimaginable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President
Jacques Santer has called for a punctual adoption of the single
European currency euro in 1999.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Deutschlandradio Berlin, he said a
delay in its launch was "unimaginable."
</P>
<P>
Santer sharply criticized the recent debates in Germany about a
possible delay of the euro.
</P>
<P>
"The German debate is not appropriate for the entire project of
the European Monetary Union," he said, adding that such a debate
would stir up fears and uncertainty about the fate of the euro.
</P>
<P>
He added that a delay in the launch of the euro needs a change
of the Maastricht Treaty, which would be "unimaginable."
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that German Finance Minister Theo
Waigel would make all efforts to meet the fiscal criteria required
for adopting the euro.
</P>
<P>
Santer also said the current performance by EU nations to meet
the euro convergence criteria had allowed him to be confident that
the euro would be introduced at the scheduled startup date of
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany has stirred up controversies in European capitals
recently when Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank,
said in a newspaper interview that a delay of the euro would not
be "a disaster."
</P>
<P>
Kurt Biedenkopf, premier of the German state of Saxony, made a
concrete call Monday for a five-year delay in the euro launch.
</P>
<P>
The debates came amid rising doubts over whether key EU
countries, including Germany and France, would be able to meet the
fiscal criteria this year to qualify for the euro.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht Treaty, countries wishing to join the euro
club are required, among other criteria, to keep their budget
deficit under three percent of GDP and overall national debt below
60 percent of GDP.
</P>
<P>
The first wave of countries to join the European Monetary Union
will be chosen in the spring of 1998, based on full economic data
of the EU member states in 1997.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people in
Germany climbed by 49,000 to a seasonally adjusted 4.456 million
in August, the Nuremberg-based Federal Labour Office reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The adjusted unemployment rate rose slightly from 11.5 percent
to 11.6 percent, while the non-adjusted unemployment rate remained
unchanged at 11.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure last month was 470,400 higher compared with the same
month last year, the office said.
</P>
<P>
Unemployment has been most severe in west Germany, with 3.044
million of the total 4.456 million being in the region.
</P>
<P>
The German Trade Unions Federation DGB said the figures
represent a sad post-war record for the month of August. It said a
three percent medium-term growth of economy was necessary to
reverse the trend in the job market.
</P>
<P>
Labour Office President Bernhard Jagoda said September would be
the key month to see if a turnabout would occur in the job market.
</P>
<P>
Normally, joblessness drops sharply in September, he said.

<HEADLINE> Party Congress Delegates Arrive in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Delegates attending the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC), which is
to open on September 12, began arriving in Beijing today at the
railway station and Capital Airport.
</P>
<P>
The new arrivals told Xinhua that they have high hopes for the
party congress. Wang Enmao, an 84-year-old revolutionary veteran
who has held the post of party secretary of the Xinjiang Uygur
Autonomous Region for a long time, is a special delegate directly
invited by the CPC Central Committee. This eye-witness to the
twists and turns of several decades of change says he hopes the
party congress can speed up development in the final years of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Memet, head of Xinjiang's Turpan Prefecture, said that
representing the 540,000 people of different ethnic groups and
20,000 party members in his autonomous region is a great and
glorious task. "At this turning point of the century, a critical
moment in the country's reform and opening-up drive, the congress
has a historic significance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Li Peishu of Guizhou province, southwest China, said that the
people expect China's current state policy to remain unchanged. As
a delegate, he firmly believes that the CPC's basic line is good
for China's development and cannot be changed.
</P>
<P>
A major item on the agenda is the choice of a new CPC central
committee. Hu Kehui, a Guizhou delegate, said that she will use
the right entrusted her by the Party Constitution to choose a new
central leading group "who can lead the country to the new
century."
</P>
<P>
Other delegates are concerned about the reform of large and
medium-sized state-owned enterprises. Liu Yiming, an industrial
worker from the Harbin Steam Turbine Co. Ltd. in the capital of
the northermost Heilongjiang province, held that the congress
could provide a more favorable environment for reforming and
developing state-owned firms.
</P>
<P>
Other delegates praise the achievements of the past five years,
following the 14th Party Congress, and expressed the hope that the
congress could help enterprise reforms.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Current dry season in Uganda
is predicted to end in mid-September, a senior official was
quoted as saying by a local paper today.
</P>
<P>
Gerald Sendaula, the minister of natural resources, told The
New Vision that the coming rain season, characterized by heavy
rains countrywide, will run till the end of this year or the
beginning of the next year.
</P>
<P>
A previous report from the board of meteorology said the
coming rain season will start at the beginning of this month.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has two dry seasons, one from late November to February
and the other is from June to July. But the previous dry season
was prolonged from late last November to March 25 this year.
</P>
<P>
The change in rainfall pattern is caused by El-Nino, the
surface warming of equatorial Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
Persistent drought in the east have aroused worry among
people. A report from Kapchorwa district in the region said some
officials in the district imposed a road toll on the businessmen
sending out food. The region will suffer from lack of enough
food, they warned.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Awaits Positive Response from India for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Secretary
Shamshad Ahmed said today that he would certainly wish to visit
India this month to resume the third round of Pakistan-India
foreign secretary-level talks.
</P>
<P>
"But it depends on India's response and its sincerity in
resolving outstanding issues between the two countries," Shamshad
told the official Associated Press of Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is ready to talk with India for positive outcome and
hopes that India will reciprocate in the same manner, said
Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
He said that Pakistan wants "to reverse the tide of hostilities
with India for the peace and socio-economic development of each
other".
</P>
<P>
He dispelled the impression that there was hesitation on the
part of Pakistan for resuming the talks, which was agreed upon at
the end of the second round of talks in Islamabad in June.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question, Shamshad confirmed that Pakistan had
received a set of dates for the talks from India, proposing the
talks in the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
"We are examining the dates and waiting for explanation," said
Shamshad, adding that Pakistan sought from India about the
commitment which was made at the end of the second round of talks.
</P>
<P>
There was understanding between the two countries that a
mechanism would be evolved for resolving the outstanding issues,
including the core issue of Kashmir, he said.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan desired peace in the region, and both Pakistan and
India should concentrate on the socio-economic development of
their people, said Shamshad.
</P>
<P>
Stressing Pakistan's keen desire for dialogue with India,
Shamshad said that it should be meaningful and constructive.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the Kashmir issue should be settled in
accordance with the wishes of the people of Kashmir and the
relevant resolutions of the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan and India resumed their foreign secretary-level talks
in March this year after a hiatus of more than three years. The
talks had broken down in January 1994 due to their differences
over the issue of Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
The two countries held their second round of foreign
secretary-level talks in Islamabad in June this year. At the end
of the talks the two sides agreed that the third round of talks
would be held in New Delhi this month.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Simplified Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUXEMBOURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official today urged the simplification of the EU agricultural
policy to overcome the contradictions and overlaps existing
between its agricultural schemes and programs.
</P>
<P>
The EU must correct the situation if it wants to get support
from farmers and the rest of the society for its common
agricultural policy (CAP), Franz Fischler, EU Commissioner for
Agriculture and Rural Development, said at a three-day informal
meeting of EU agriculture ministers which started Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The EU needed to encourage structural adjustment and multiple
function in agriculture in order to continue to provide a high
quality of life to its citizens, the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a continued CAP reform, which the EU started
in 1992, in order to make the EU's agriculture sector "fit for the
years to come."
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the CAP must not only be able to cope with
different market management problems, but also to meet the
expectations of society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"If the Union were to decide under these circumstances to leave
the present CAP in place, we would have to prepare ourselves to
live with a significant gap between internal and international
prices over the longer term," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that experts foresaw stasis on the EU's internal
markets but a long-term positive outlook on non-EU markets, adding
that the EU could count on the high but stable prices on most
world markets.
</P>
<P>
Farm incomes across the EU have grown on average at an annual
rate of 4.5 percent and farmers have adjusted to the new
conditions since the 1992 reform, according to the commissioner.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that there still remained considerable
income disparities between individual member states and regions.

HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Hongkong Land has announced
a 2.3-billion-HK-dollar (295 million U.S. dollars) redevelopment
scheme to replace an old block in Central, the Hong Kong Island,
with a state-of-the-art office tower, the local press reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Work on the building, provisionally renamed as 11 Chater Road,
is expected to start in October next year and be completed in
2003. Bank loans will be used to fund the project.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director Percy Weatherall told reporters that the time
is right for Hongkong Land to maximize the value of its oldest
property in Hong Kong. Concern is growing, analysts said, that the
35-year-old Swire House will lose tenants to more modern
developments with better facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The building will be a new flagship for the Hongkong Land core
portfolio," said Weatherall.
</P>
<P>
The new 30-story office tower, with the latest facilities, will
be able to accommodate the high specifications of multinational
banking and financial sector tenants, he said.
</P>
<P>
It will be constructed above a three-level podium and a
three-level basement. New pedestrian bridges will join the
building to other Hongkong Land properties in Central.
</P>
<P>
Hongkong Land, part of the British conglomerate Jardine, owns
some 40 percent of the office space in the business district,
including Swire House, Jardine House, Exchange Square, the Princes
Building and the Hong Kong Club Building.

<HEADLINE> Zairean criminals in S. Africa Wanted by DRC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG,September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) has cancelled all former Zairean diplomatic and
official passports and began a manhunt for military and civilian
"criminals" now living in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The provisional list released by the DRC embassy in Pretoria
includes the names of five generals and four colonels,as well as
11 civilians who formerly occupied high-ranking posts in the
Mobutu government, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
"The faithful criminals were now refugees in South Africa,"
the embassy said in a statement, adding it had suggested to all
foreign embassies based in South Africa not to grant visas to
anyone who held a passport of "Republic of Zaire".
</P>
<P>
The statement claimed that the criminals become refugees in
South Africa "with huge fortunes stolen from public treasury in
Zaire and with this money they are "initiating actions to create
civil war in the DRC".
</P>
<P>
During his official visit to South Africa last month, DRC
President Laurent Kabila appealed to President Nelson Mandela to
expel the generals living in Johannesburg and Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The generals being sought include Baramoto, Mobutu's Commander
of National Police who allegedly killed several politicians.
</P>
<P>
Civilian "criminals" include Ngbanda Atumba, former Special
Intelligence Adviser, allegedly responsible for the murder of
several kindnapped Congolese citizens. He is said to possess
millions of U.S.Dollars stolen from public coffers.
</P>
<P>
Mandela told Kabila last month that a special South African
working team has been established for the investigation.

<HEADLINE> S.African Vice-President to Visit Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South African Vice-President
Thambo Mbeki will pay a two-day working visit to Nigeria next
week, the Vanguard newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
During his visit from September 17 to 18, Mbeki is expected to
deliver a special message from President Nelson Mandela to
Nigerian Head of State Sani Abacha, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here were quoted as saying that Mbeki's
visit is part of the current diplomatic moves at thawing recent
frosty relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between the two leading African countries fell to an
all-time low in late 1995, when S. Africa led the campaign in the
Commonwealth that suspended Nigeria's membership for executing
Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Ministry Chief Tom Ikimi visited S. Africa
last week, during which he delivered a special message from
Abacha to President Mandela.
</P>
<P>
The visit helped seal a deal between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
S. Africa has reportedly agreed not to oppose Nigeria "in any
way" at the October Commonwealth Summit in Edinburgh, Scotland,
which will take the final decision on Nigeria's membership.
</P>
<P>
S. Africa also agreed to co-operate with Nigeria-led ECOWAS
(the Economic Community of West African States) in its effort to
restore the legitimate government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah
in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Threatened with Strike Notice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways, which saw its
pre-tax profit down by 31 percent to one billion Shillings (about
US$18.5 million) in the year ending on March 31, 1997, is now
facing a new strike notice issued by a trade union.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Allied Workers Union (TAWU) announced last
week it would launch a strike unless the airlines withdraws its
threat to sack 15 shop stewards who are active in the union, the
Kenya Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The TAWU issued a strike notice in July to seek improved
conditions of service for the unionizable staff of the national
carrier but then called it off after the Ministry of Labor
advised the two sides to seek out of court arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the company has made no formal response to the
fresh strike notice.
</P>
<P>
Net profit of the company fell from 1.4 billion Shillings
(approximately US$25.5 million) in 1995/96 to 851.6 million
Shillings (US$15 million) in the just-ended fiscal year, said the
firm's annual report for 1997.
</P>
<P>
The company attributes the profit decline to higher worldwide
fuel prices, the hefty pay increase and foreign exchange losses
caused by the strength of the Shilling.
</P>
<P>
Income from passenger tickets increased by 10 percent in the
year, while total income reached 10.7 billion Shillings (about
194 million US Dollars), 6.6 percent higher than in 1995/1996.
</P>
<P>
However, this increase is insufficient to compensate for the
company's rising costs, which grew 10.1 percent over the previous
year, the airlines said in the report.
</P>
<P>
Higher oil prices worldwide resulted in additional aviation
fuel costs of 250 million Shillings (about 4.5 million US
Dollars) and labor costs increased by 27 percent during the year.

JOHANNESBURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The South African

</P>
<P>
Sport facilities such as badminton courts and judo, boxing and
softball halls would be handed over to local communities early
next year.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Indonesia Successful in Reducing Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- International recognition of
Indonesia's success in reducing poverty made President Soeharto
the world's first head of state to receive a special citation from
the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) for the country's
extraordinary achievements in alleviating poverty.
</P>
<P>
In awarding the citation to Soeharto Monday here, UNDP
Administrator James Gustave Speth said: "The award is a
recognition of Soeharto's and Indonesia's outstanding
accomplishment and commitment to significant reduction and
continued eradication of poverty."
</P>
<P>
The success of Indonesia's poverty eradication drive is
regarded as one of the results of the country's first 25-year
long-term development plan which ended in 1994.
</P>
<P>
By applying the development trilogy -- high economic growth,
equal distribution of development and stability, the government
consistently used economic growth to contribute to poverty
reduction through the creation of jobs.
</P>
<P>
But the government at the same time also remained quite aware
that economic growth is not a panacea for poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
Due to a sustained growth of around seven percent a year for
the last three decades, Indonesia, one of the world's poorest
nations in the 1960s, successfully brought poverty down to 11
percent of its population from 60 percent in 1970.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the development drive also increased life expectancy
by almost 50 percent and per capita income from 50 U.S. dollars to
1,000 dollars, while it also cut the illiteracy rate by two
thirds.
</P>
<P>
Economic experts held that those were not easy tasks as
Indonesia has a large population, now around 200 million. And
almost 60 percent of the population live on Java Island which has
only seven percent of the land area in the country. The rest of
the population is scattered on dozens of large islands as well as
about 3,000 populated islands in the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
State Minister for National Development Planning Ginandjar
Kartasasmita said Monday at a regional workshop on comparative
experiences in poverty eradication that rapid economic growth has
improved Indonesia's capability to address poverty problems.
</P>
<P>
On the experience in poverty eradication, the minister said the
Indonesian government from the very beginning had put agriculture
on the first priority as some 80 percent of its population live in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
By building dams, providing roads and electricity, the rural
economy was opened up. And the first target achieved after several
years of hard work was rice self-sufficiency in 1984. In the
process, rural areas were transformed from economically dormant
into productive and vibrant parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
With the development of the rural economy, a substantial amount
of public investment has been directed to the improvement of the
education and health condition of the people. The first priority
was to achieve six-year universal primary education and the target
now is moving to nine-year universal education.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, Indonesia now has 170,000
primary schools, which accommodate around 30 million pupils.
</P>
<P>
Education is a driving force behind women's emancipation in
Indonesia. Community health services, eradication of communicable
diseases and improvement of nutritional standards of the people
are the basic components of health development.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 7,000 community health centers and 21,000
auxiliary centers scattered all over the country.
</P>
<P>
The containment of population is another element for the
economic development and poverty eradication. The government has
been able to reduce population growth from 2.4 percent per year in
the 1970s to 1.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government also emphasized job creation in its
development program. In the past 25 years, it created 42.5 million
new jobs.
</P>
<P>
The government held that poor people are poor because their
access to productive assets is limited, especially their access to
capital. So, the central and local governments have made joint
efforts to develop financial schemes to help poor people gain
access to capital, for instance, through the banking system to
create various schemes that provide small-scale credits.
</P>
<P>
All commercial banks operating in Indonesia have been requested
to provide at least 22 percent of their overall credit to
cooperatives and small-scale businesses. Various grass-roots
financial institutions were established to channel micro credit to
the people.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994 when the country entered the second long-term
development plan, the Indonesian government has taken many
measures to eradicate poverty including providing funds to poor
people living in the poorest villages through family welfare
saving program.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government has determined to eradicate poverty
in absolute terms during the second long-term development plan. By
the year 2005, the poverty level will have been reduced to less
than 3.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Have Second National Phone Carrier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will select its second
national telecommunications network carrier next month through
competitive bidding, the Punch newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Communications Minister Tajudeen Olanrewaju said that the idea has
been approved by the federal government and that the second carrier
would provide long distance and international services.
</P>
<P>
Hitherto such services have been monopolized by the Nigerian
Telecommunications (NITEL). Though some private companies have been
admitted into the sector, their businesses are restricted to certain
fields.
</P>
<P>
The minister disclosed that the internal process and in-house
procedures for the selection of the second carrier have been finished.
</P>
<P>
He added that the tender for bids would be advertised in both local
and foreign media to ensure openess in the selection.
</P>
<P>
In another development, a private firm, Motophone Nigeria Limited
has been authorized to provide VSAT (Very Small Aperture Terminal) Hub
and international service, breaking another monopoly of the NITEL.
</P>
<P>
Before this, a number of firms have been licensed to provide
domestic VSAT service.

<HEADLINE> Agricultural Mechanization Urged in Nigeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian agricultural mechanization
expert Joseph Sunday Adeoti has urged the country to establish its own
farm machine manufacturing industry, the Punch newspaper reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Adeoti made the call on Monday at the National Center for
Development for Agricultural Mechanization in Ilorin, Kwara State.
</P>
<P>
"Nigeria is blessed with an area of 98.3 million hectares, out of
which 72 percent is considered as suitable for agriculture, less than
30 percent is currently under-cultivated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Adeoti pointed out that Nigeria can attain appreciable level of
self-sufficiency in food production, if it strives to achieve "a
target of about 25 percent mechanization on farms in the next decade".
</P>
<P>
He estimated that the country would require at least 65 billion
Naira (about 79 million U.S. dollars) on agricultural machinery for
field operations in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment of effective local agricultural machinery
manufacturing industry is a prerequisite for viable agriculture
industry anywhere," he said.

<HEADLINE> EU Calls for Simplified Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
LUXEMBOURG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A European Union (EU)
official here today urged to simplify the EU's agricultural policy
in order to overcome the contradictions and overlaps existing
between its different agricultural schemes and programs.
</P>
<P>
The EU must rectify the situation if it wants to get support
from farmers and the rest of the society for its common agricultural
policy (CAP), Franz Fischler, EU commissioner for agriculture and
rural development, said at an informal meeting of EU agriculture
ministers here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The EU needed to encourage structural adjustment and multiple
function in agriculture in order to continue to provide a high
quality of life to its citizens, the commissioner told the
three-day meeting which started Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He also called for a continued CAP reform, which the EU started
in 1992, in order to make the EU's agriculture sector "fit for the
years to come".
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the CAP must not only be able to cope with
different market management problems, but also meet the expectations
of society as a whole.
</P>
<P>
"If the Union were to decide under these circumstances to leave
the present CAP in place, we would have to prepare ourselves to live
with a significant gap between internal and international prices
over the longer term," the commissioner said.
</P>
<P>
He explained that experts foresaw stasis on the EU's internal
markets but a long-term positive outlook on non-EU markets, adding
that the EU could count on the high but stable prices on most world
markets.

HARBIN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Beidahuang, in China's
Heilongjiang province, has become an important base of marketable
grain, with five billion kg in annual output of commodity grain.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 50 years, it has produced 95.8 billion kg of
grain and beans, of which 65.65 billion kg were sold to the
state. Its farms have netted the state 5.95 billion yuan in taxes
and profits.
</P>
<P>
The government-backed cultivation programs in an area known for
its wasteland and marshes started in 1947. But the first
large-scale cultivation started in the 1950s when General Wang
Zhen led 100,000 ex-soldiers in setting up state-owned farms.
</P>
<P>
In the past half century, 700,000 young people, including
140,000 ex-soldiers and 50,000 university grads, were settled in
Beidahuang, which means 'huge wasteland in the north'.
</P>
<P>
There are now 103 Heilongjiang General Agricultural Cultivation
Bureau farms, with nearly 2,000 support firms in the transport and
service sectors, and a population of 1.57 million, 635,000 of whom
are farm workers.
</P>
<P>
The farms have made a great effort at mechanization in the past
several decades, and now have 50,000 tractors, combines, diggers,
and trucks, and 24 airplanes for farm use.
</P>
<P>
A research and service system has been formed for cultivation,
with 17 research institutes, nine technology promotion centers,
and 103 technology promotion stations, with more than 100,000
agronomists and technicians.
</P>
<P>
There are 140 small towns taking shape on the former wasteland
and residents now receive TV shows and have good
telecommunications at home.
</P>
<P>
Nine-year compulsory education has also been adopted for local
schoolchildren.

<HEADLINE> Santer Says Euro Delay "Unimaginable" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- European Commission President Jacques
Santer has once again called for a punctual start of the planned
single European currency, the Euro, saying that a delay in its 1999
launch was "unimaginable", German media reported today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Deutschlandradio Berlin on Tuesday, Santer
voiced sharp criticism over recent debates in Germany about a possible
delay of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
"The German debate is not appropriate for the entire project of the
European Monetary Union," he said, adding that such a debate would
stir up fears and uncertainty about the future of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a delay in the launch of the Euro needs a change in the
EU Maastricht treaty, which was "unimaginable", Santer added.
</P>
<P>
He expressed confidence that German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
would make all efforts to meet the fiscal criteria required for
qualifying for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Santer also noted that the current performance by EU nations to
meet the Euro convergence criteria had allowed him to be confident
that the Euro would be introduced at the scheduled startup date of
January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Germany has stirred up controversies in European capitals recently
when Hans Tietmeyer, president of Germany's central bank, said in a
newspaper interview that a delay of the Euro would not be "a
disaster".
</P>
<P>
On top of that, Kurt Biedenkopf, premier of the German state of
Saxony, on Monday also made a concrete call for a five-year delay for
the Euro launch.
</P>
<P>
The debates came amid rising doubts over whether key countries in
the E.U., including Germany and France, would be able to meet the
fiscal criteria this year to qualify for the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Under the Maastricht treaty, countries wishing to join the Euro
club are required, among other things, to bring their budget deficit
to less than 3 percent and overall national debt to below 60
percent of the gross domestic product. The first wave of countries to
join the Monetary Union will be chosen in the spring of 1998, based on
EU states' full economic data in 1997.

to achieve the objective.
</P>

enhancing its ties with countries in other regions, while adhering
to the policy of maintaining good relations with neighboring
countries. He said that China hopes Romania will play a bigger
role in safeguarding the peace and stability in the region.
</P>
<P>
Romania is China's major cooperative partner in central and
east Europe, and the two countries have cooperated closely and
supported each other in international organizations, said Qian,
adding that the foreign ministries of the two nations have
maintained a highly beneficial cooperative relationship.
</P>
<P>
China is fully prepared to continue and strengthen
consultations and cooperation with Romania in the realm of

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Approves 1998 Budget Cuts Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli Cabinet today
approved a plan for the 1998 budget characterized by a wide range
of fund cuts proposed by the Ministry of Finance, the state-run
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The budget plan was approved by a 11-6 vote after more than 16
hours of a marathon debate Monday night, with one minister
abstaining. The cuts amounted to 2.3 billion shekels (about 660
million U.S. dollars) including 400 million shekels (114 million
dollars) from the military.
</P>
<P>
The budget proposed by Finance Minister Ya'acov Neeman totals
195 billion shekels (55 billion dollars). With those cuts, the
minister manages to meet the strategy of keeping the 1998 budget
deficit no higher than 2.4 percent of the gross domestic product
(GNP).
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made because tax revenues are lagging behind
earlier forecasts as a result of the dramatic slowdown of Israel's
economy, Finance Ministry officials said.
</P>
<P>
According to the plan, the defense budget was cut from 550
million shekels (142 million dollars) to 400 million shekels (114
million dollars). This means reduced Israeli army representatives
soldier's academic studies.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai had hoped to increase his
budget by some 10 million dollars to renew weapons and ammunition
supplies.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry' budget was also cut by 250 million
shekels (71 million dollars). However, the ministry was allowed to
decide where the cuts are made, and there will be obvious cuts in
the number of school hours.
</P>
<P>
The health service was deeply affected by the budget cuts. The
cuts plan gave greater financial independence to health funds,
which in turn will ask the public for additional funding.
</P>
<P>
Israel's rapid economic expansion over the past five years has
now slowed down, with the growth rate this year being projected at
only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu risks political danger in
slashing the budget, for a failure to have that budget passed by
the parliament will possibly bring down his government.

<HEADLINE> Chen Xitong Expelled From Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chen Xitong, former secretary
of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China
(CPC), was expelled from the Party for corruption, according to a
decision announced by the Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection of the CPC here today.
</P>
<P>
The decision to expel Chen was made by the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection on August 29.
</P>
<P>
Since Chen had offended China's Criminal Law in certain
aspects, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline Inspection also
suggested that the country's judicial organs step in and handle
the case in accordance with the law.
</P>
<P>
The procuratorial organs have already started legal proceedings
against Chen, who was also former member of the Political Bureau
of the CPC's Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
According to the decision of the Fifth Plenum of the 14th CPC
Central Committee, the CPC Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, along with other relevant departments, had earlier
made further investigation into Chen's corruption case.
</P>
<P>
It has since been established that Chen, taking advantage of
his position, had accepted and embezzled a large number of
valuable items; and had squandered a large amount of public fund
to support a corrupt and decadent life.
</P>
<P>
He had also abused his power to help his relatives and aides to
run businesses and seek illicit interests, and seriously neglected
his duty, being responsible to a grave extent for the law-breaking
and criminal activities of Wang Baosen, a former vice-mayor of
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The Central Commission for Discipline Inspection held that Chen
had seriously violated the Party's discipline and caused extremely
severe damage to the prestige of the Party and state, thus
completely discrediting himself as a communist.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the Constitution of the CPC and relevant
stipulations in the Penalty Regulations of the CPC (on a trial
basis), and with the approval of the Party Central Committee, the
Commission decided to expel Chen from the Party.

<HEADLINE> Economic Take-Off in Northwest China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region has reached a turning point in its
economic development with its improved infrastructure, thanks to
the country's strategy of developing western regions and their
natural resources.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang has 129 kinds of minerals and large reserves of 76 of
them. The central and regional governments have spent nearly 50
billion yuan on oilfields there, to enlarge its capability of
producing 17 million tons of crude oil annually.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Xinjiang produced 14.5 million tons of crude and more
than 31 billion yuan worth of petrochemical products that
accounted for 46 percent of the region's industrial output value.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese Railway Taxi </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- It's not easy to find a train
that stops for someone who is standing alongside the tracks waving
his or her hand as if he or she were flagging a taxi down.
</P>
<P>
But people in a remote part of China's Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region can do just that. The local railway
administration recently began this "railway taxi" on a 126-seat
train with three crewmen: an engineer, an attendant, and a
policeman.
</P>
<P>
"The train provides a lot of convenience," said one local
Mongolian woman named Gaowa. "In the past, it took a long time and
a lot of trouble just to go and see my parents," she said.
</P>
<P>
The idea of operating a passenger train that could be flagged
down on a 130 km-section of railway came from complaints by many
residents, mainly farmers and herdsmen, about the immense
inconvenience of travel in the area. It passes through 20 villages
and has eight regular stops as well.
</P>
<P>
Its began operation on July 5 and has carried over 9,000
passengers, bringing in nearly 70,000 yuan in revenues.
</P>
<P>
Local analysts say that this may not be a very popular move for
the railways as a whole, but that it shows that the railway
administration is sincere. Railways have long been regarded the
big brother of transport services, and the railway administration
has been paying great attention to improve its service in recent
years.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Fan Youqiong's happiness was
apparent as she stood in front of her family's new house, a
beautiful two-storey building with floor space of more than 100
square meters.
</P>
<P>
"I was short of money and simply prepared to refurbish our old
ramshackled home," Fan said.
</P>
<P>
The 42-year-old female farmer moved to her new home from
Yanbian County, Panzhihua City, in southwest China's Sichuan
Province. The Ertan Hydropower Station, the largest facility of
its kind to be completed this century, will lead to the inundation
of her home village so her family was one of 700-odd rural
households relocated to the Hongge Migrant Area.
</P>
<P>
Fan told journalists from major Beijing press units that "her
new home cost more than 60,000 yuan and was constructed with
government assistance of 40,000 yuan."
</P>
<P>
An official with the Panzhihua Migrant Management Office said
that large groups of people are leaving the area surrounding the
new power station area.
</P>
<P>
The central government approved the establishment of Panzhihua
City in the early 1960s. The lightly populated young city, with a
history of 30-odd years, will grow by 32,000 people being
relocated from the site of the Ertan Power Station.
</P>
<P>
The Yanbian County seat and 15 local towns and townships will
also be inundated. Local officials note that construction of the
station will affect 1,567 hectares of arable land, 1,600 hectares
of forests and 1.4 million sq m of housing.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate Suggests Big Drop in Tax Collection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Senate today
projected a reduction of eight billion pesos (250 million U.S.
dollars) in the government's tax collections, due to the revision
downward of the gross national product (GNP) growth rate target.
</P>
<P>
Ernesto Herrera, chairman of the Finance Committee, said before
the Senate that the substantial reduction in tax collection is the
result of the move by the National Economic and Development
Authority to revise downward the GNP growth target from seven
percent to only 5-5.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The authority revised its GNP growth target following a
slowdown in economic activity caused by rises in interest rates, a
20 percent plunge in the value of the Philippine peso and the
recent oil price increases.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the GNP growth rate target could adversely
affect the government's financial standing, Herrera said, because
"tax collections already fell 22.2 billion pesos (693.8 million
dollars) short in the first seven months."
</P>
<P>
From January to July, the Bureau of Internal Revenue collected
183.5 billion pesos (5.7 billion dollars), which is 9.5 billion
(296.9 million dollars) short of its target.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau of Customs also fell 12.6 billion pesos (393.8
million dollars) short of its 49.4 billion pesos (1.5 billion
dollars) target.
</P>
<P>
Herrera also said a drop in the volume of the country's imports
as a result of the depreciation of the peso could worsen the
government's fiscal position.

<HEADLINE> Service Industry Booming in Czech Republic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, September 8 (Xinhua) -- After six years of rapid
growth, service industry is becoming the major part of Czech
Republic's economy.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of the service industry in the country's gross
domestic product (GDP), soared 46 percent from 37.5 in 1990 to
53.9 last year, said a spokesman from the National Statistics
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The service industry is also the leader in employment. At
present, 2.3 million people, or 63.8 percent of the total
employment population, are working in the sector.
</P>
<P>
In the same period, values generated by industry and
agriculture in the GDP, which were 53.9 and 8.6 percent in 1990,
went down to 41.2 and 4.9 percent respectively last year.
</P>
<P>
The population employed in industry and agriculture kept on
dwindling in the past six years, with industrial workers
decreasing from 2.03 million to 1.62 million.
</P>
<P>
Various types of new service business are mushrooming in the
capital Prague and other areas. Many daily problems in life that
puzzled people in the past are now readily solved.
</P>
<P>
The booming is attributed to the government's efforts to
readjust the industrial structure in recent years. After 1990, the
government has introduced a series of investment and tax revenue
policies to support the development of the service industry.

<HEADLINE> Company Accused of Scandal to Present Objections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The chief magistrate's court
in Nairobi has allowed five suspects in the Goldenberg scandal
case to present their objections before September 11, the "Daily
Nation" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Chief Magistrate Uniter Kidullah was quoted as saying that she
would hear submissions from the five suspects from September 17.
</P>
<P>
The five suspects are businessman Kamlesh Pattni, former
Treasury Permanent Secretary Wilfred Koinanage, former Deputy
Governor of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) Eliphaz Riungu,
former CBK Chief Dealer Michael Wanjihia Onsmus and the
Pattni-owned Goldenberg International Ltd..
</P>
<P>
They were jointly charged in a 93-count indictment with
stealing 5.8 billion Kenyan Shillings (about 94 million U.S.
Dollars) belonging to the Kenyan government in a gold and diamond
export scandal.
</P>
<P>
The five suspects were released on bond in July following a
High Court ruling that 93 criminal charges against the five were
terminated.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government ordered that the suspects be charged
afresh and a 15-count indictment was presented in a Nairobi court
by Director of Public Prosecutions Bernard Chunga following the
withdrawal of previous charges.
</P>
<P>
The suspects represented by their lawers have denied all the
15 counts, saying the fresh indictment contained the same facts
and material that were successfully objected to.
</P>
<P>
The Goldenberg scandal case was reportedly cited as one of the
reasons why the International Monetary Fund (IMF) decided to
suspend a loan package to Kenya earlier this year.

<HEADLINE> CP Group Chairman Confident of Thai Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Dhanin Chearavanont, chairman
and chief executive officer of the Charoen Pokphand Group, said
Thailand's economic problems are not difficult to tackle.
</P>
<P>
Dhanin said the current crisis is not the worst Thailand has
ever experienced and that the country's fundamentals remain
healthy.
</P>
<P>
Besides, there are still a host of economic areas ripe for
development, the Bangkok Post today quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said if people do not lose confidence, the situation will
have returned to normal. A crisis of confidence is behind the
country's spiralling economic woes, he added.
</P>
<P>
Conceding that restoring public confidence is easier said than
done, he said that in the short term, the best thing politicians
can do to restore confidence is to stop quarrelling and work
together toward a common goal.
</P>
<P>
He said it was more difficult for a government to tackle
problems efficiently than a business because it was bound by a
bureaucratic system and sometimes unwieldy laws.
</P>
<P>
He said although the country's crisis is serious, it has not
affected the country's agricultural sector, which accounts for
about 60 percent of Thailand's gross product.
</P>
<P>
He believed that the weakening of the baht should soon lead to
stronger exports of agricultural products both in terms of value
and volume.
</P>
<P>
A weak baht should also effectively reduce imports,
particularly of luxury goods.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that Thailand move to open its skies to boost
tourism and bring in much-needed foreign exchange.
</P>
<P>
He said Thailand could also offer more incentives to foreign
investors, such as permitting them to own land and giving them
more privileges in the country.
</P>
<P>
The CP Group has been built in only 40 years from a small firm
selling animal feed and pesticide to one of the largest business
conglomerates in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Under the CP Group umbrella there are over 400 companies at
home and aboard, covering nine main sectors, such as
agro-business, animal feed, real estate, foreign trade, vehicles,
telecommunications and electronics.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Business Blasts GSP Cancellation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Garment
Manufacturers and Exporters Association has strongly protested the
government decision to cancel 6,910 allegedly irregular GSP
certificates and termed it as a wrong step, the local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore the government action," the association's
president, Mostafa Golam Quddus, said Monday after holding an
emergency meeting of the association's executive committee.
</P>
<P>
Following pressure from the European Commission (EC), the
government on Sunday canceled the certificates issued to 86
factories earlier for using the facility of the General System of
Preference (GSP) in exporting garments to the European market.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's garment industry, the biggest foreign-exchange
earner in this underdeveloped country, has been enjoying duty-free
or low-duty treatment under the GSP facility in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
Quddus said the government took a wrong decision on the GSP
unilaterally without consulting the trade bodies of the garment
sector and this would cause colossal losses to the country's
export earnings.
</P>
<P>
"It's now the responsibility of the government to bear all the
consequences of this action," he said, adding that the country
would suffer a serious image crisis in the international market.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, European importers of Bangladesh garments have
formed an association and is planning to claim about 100 million
dollars compensation from Dhaka after the cancellation of GSP
certificates.
</P>
<P>
Before canceling the certificates, the government should have
struck a deal with the EC so that such pressure does not come from
them in future, Quddus suggested.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has already canceled 386 GSP
certificates and is still under pressure to take action against
8,568 others.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Stamp Auction Creates Record Selling Price </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A large stamp auction held in
Shanghai last Sunday featured more than 1,000 stamps issued during
the Qing Dynasty, the Kuomintang ruling period and after the
founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
A "blue army postage stamp" sold for 385,000 yuan (46,000 US
dollars), the highest auction price on record.
</P>
<P>
Experts say the aforementioned rare stamp was one of three army
postage stamps issued by the Ministry of Posts and
Telecommunications in 1953.
</P>
<P>
The auction, held by the Shanghai International Commodities
Auction Corp. Ltd., attracted more than 1,000 stamp collectors
from both at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Some 60 percent of stamps on offer were sold for over 5.26
million yuan (about 640,000 U.S. dollars) during the 10-hour auction.
</P>
<P>
Experts note that stamps without floor prices proved to be the
best-selling items and accounted for some 12 percent of total
sales.

<HEADLINE> President's Visit Promote Sino-Romanian Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng said
today that the current visit by Romanian President Emil
Constantinescu will elevate Sino-Romanian relations to a new level.
</P>
<P>
Li met with Constantinescu today and noted that the Chinese
government attaches great importance to relations with Romania.
</P>
<P>
He added that China respects the independence, sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Romania, the choice of the Romanian
people on their development path, and the domestic and foreign
policies of the Romanian government formulated according to the
country's national conditions.
</P>
<P>
Li told Constantinescu that China is willing to join Romania in
an effort to further their friendly relations and cooperation on
the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said the purpose of his visit is to enhance
direct dialogue and contacts between the leaders of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said the friendly relations between the two countries are
strong and beyond ideological differences. Constantinescu added
that any term of the Romanian government will continue to
strengthen relations.
</P>
<P>
The Romanian President said his country needs to exchange views
with China when forming its overall foreign policy strategy, and
stressed that his current visit is important for not only
enhancing bilateral relations, but also for strengthening
cooperation in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Li said that China is willing to expand economic ties with
Romania in line with the principle of equality and mutual
benefit. He said he hopes Romanian products would be more
competitive on the Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
Major Romanian and Chinese companies should expand contacts and
gain a better awareness of economic changes and the trade
environments in the two countries, said Li, adding that both
governments should encourage multiple forms of direct cooperation
between enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Constantinescu said that Romania and China should strengthen
their relationship based on mutual trust and extend greater
efforts to promote economic and trade ties.
</P>
<P>
Both Li and Constantinescu expressed confidence in the further
development of economic and trade relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Li briefed Constantinescu on China's economic development and
China's efforts in deepening reform and opening wider to the
outside world. He said China and Romania can learn from each other
in this regard.

<HEADLINE> Deng's Theory to Guide China Into 21st Century (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 9 (Xinhua) -- "The forthcoming 15th National
Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) will undoubtedly
uphold the banner of Deng Xiaoping's theory on building socialism
with Chinese characteristics and propel China's socialist cause
towards the 21st century," according to Wan Guoquan, vice-chairman
of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
"Simply stated, we will continue economic restructuring and
pursue accelerated development," said Wan in an excited expression
of confidence concerning the forthcoming 15th CPC National
Congress scheduled to open on September 12th.
</P>
<P>
China's achievements in reform and opening over the past few
decades serve as a strong testament to the rationality and
feasibility of the theory, said Wan.
</P>
<P>
One month ago, Wan, who also serves as vice-chairman of the
Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction
Association (CDNCA), attended a special symposium the CPC Central
Committee held to solicit opinions on a draft of the work report
to be presented during the 15th CPC congress. Representatives from
all eight non-communist parties in China and non-party personages
attended the symposium.
</P>
<P>
According to Wan, "As normal, General Secretary Jiang Zemin of
the CPC Central Committee focused his total attention on matters
at hand. The event featured a series of heart-to-heart
discussions, and we reserved little in frank exchanges of
opinions."
</P>
<P>
The multiparty cooperation and political consultation system
under the leadership of the CPC is the basic political system in
China. "I've joined in many effective and productive
consultations," said Wan.

Wan noted that the system's major advantage lies in its
potential to unite as many people as possible to advance the
nation's socialist cause.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking from personal experience, I believe the system will
remain magically effective in promoting the country's continued
economic development," said Wan, who has maintained close contacts
with three generations of CPC leadership over the past half
century, In addition, Wan's democratic party has consistently
maintained friendly cooperative relationship with the CPC.
</P>
<P>
Wan's father was a famous Kuomintang general during the War of
Resistance Against Japan. Wan himself joined the CDNCA in 1950 and
was appointed as its vice-chairman in 1984.
</P>
<P>
Wan responded to a question concerning why major policies
seldom arouse dissident opinions when published by pointing to the
fact that all policies are subject to heated discussions and
careful revisions prior to publication.
</P>
<P>
According to Wan, "Chinese democracy is in no way empty."
</P>
<P>
Wan, who also serves as president of the China Council for the
Promotion of Peaceful Reunification, called for political
negotiations between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits in order
to pave way for the reunification of the motherland in the new
century.
</P>
<P>
Wan was quoted as saying that the "One Country, Two Systems"
principle, which proved practical in China's successful resumption
of sovereignty over Hong Kong, is fully applicable to the issue of
Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Journalists Join Anti-Poverty Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Lu Deming, a journalist from
the provincial television broadcasting station in Yunnan, a
backward area populated by ethnic minorities in the southwestern
part of China, often visits poor villages to report about
conditions there.
</P>
<P>
And villagers welcome him. In the words of one farmer: "Your
visit has brought us care from the government and the Party."
</P>
<P>
Lu believes that, as a journalist, he should do something
more. There are journalists like him who have found a new way to
help poverty-stricken people and who are participating in
poverty-eradication efforts by writing stories that describe the
reality of life in poor areas to make people on the outside more
aware.
</P>
<P>
This year, more than 100 correspondents from various news media
in Yunnan have been sent to poor villages, where they have filed
more than 1,000 stories. Early this year, the China Journalists
Association called for media to join the anti-poverty campaign.
</P>
<P>
Local journalists have been once criticized by some people for
their coverage of richer areas and the lack of reports on poorer
places. So, recently, Chinese papers have provided special columns
on the poverty-elimination campaign. The response across the
country has been good, and readers and members of audiences have
written to newspapers and radio and TV stations expressing their
concern.
</P>
<P>
A provincial government official in charge of Yunnan's news
media told Xinhua that the media really can have an effect. Yunnan
TV recently had a charity program that got 2.9 million yuan in
donations from industry and media. The money will be used to build
primary schools for the Hope Project, a nationwide program to help
children from poor families.

<HEADLINE> Regional Workshop on Climate Held in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A five-day regional forum on a
consolidated climate forecast for the coming rainy season opened
Monday in Kadoma, central Zimbabwe, against the background of El
Nino which is building up in the pacific ocean, reported the
Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The forum which brought together more than 50 scientists,
researchers and meteorologists from the southern African region
aims to provide guidance in social-economic decision making and
management activities to governments in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries
represented at the forum will design a criteria to promote high
standards in the development of forecast methodologies and the
evolution of new techniques and approaches.
</P>
<P>
Marufu Zinyowera, Director of the Department of Meteorological
Services in Zimbabwe said at the opening ceremony that the forum
is designed to "further strengthen the regional capacity to
produce, distribute and utilize climate forecast information in
climate-sensitive sectors for the social and economic benefit of
the region."
</P>
<P>
"The forum will also resolve gaps in training and technical
capacity, facilitate research cooperation and data exchange and
promote on-going dialogue between forecast users and producers,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the director noted, El Nino was expected to cause
only five percent of the drought in southern Africa, while in
Zimbabwe the phenomemon was said to be responsible for 32 percent
of the droughts.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's Transport and Energy Deputy Minister Zenso Nsimbi
urged researchers and meteorologists in the region to come up
with concrete actions designed to improve the capabilities and
provide credible seasonal forecasts.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Astronomers Find Way To Predict Earthquakes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese astronomers are using
their instruments to predict earthquakes in a network from Beijing
to Yunnan province in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Beijing, capital of the nation, needs to be protected from
earthquake damage and Yunnan is one of the most frequently hit
parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
The instruments are used to measure changes in the earth's
rotation, which Chinese astronomers connected to earthquakes by
studying one that hit Tangshan, a middle-sized city about 200 km
from Beijing, 20 years ago, killing hundreds of thousands of
people.
</P>
<P>
Scientists found that when a strong earthquake was going to
hit, the earth's rotational data is different from that in other
parts of the world. This difference can occur several weeks or
months before the earthquake hits, and it returns to normal not
long after the earthquake hits.
</P>
<P>
The difference is the result of the distance of the instrument
from the epicenter and is related to the magnitude of the
earthquake.
</P>
<P>
The instrument uses a plumb line and changes in its angle are
used for the results. Scientists found that unusual changes in the
plumb line before an earthquake hit an area.
</P>
<P>
The preliminary work came from a research project of the
Beijing, Yunnan, Shanghai observatories and the Yunnan Seismology
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The Yunnan Observatory has provided the local government with
accurate earthquake information six times in recent years. The
Beijing and Shaanxi observatories have been doing the research
work in cooperation with the United States and Russia
respectively, and an effort is being made to set up networks in
areas frequently hit by earthquakes.

JINAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- People living in Qufu, the home
of Confucius, will host a festival later this month to honor the
2,548th birth anniversary of the great master.
</P>
<P>
The festive activities, to be held between September 26 and

</P>
<P>
Confucius, one of the most famous philosophers in ancient
China, spread his doctrines to both political figures and ordinary
citizens, calling on them to love each other and adhere to secular
rules. Confucianism remains popular in many Asian countries and
regions even today.
</P>
<P>
During China's chaotic Culture Revolution (1966-76), Confucius
was criticized as the promoter of decadent culture.
</P>
<P>
Many descendents of Confucius, including a number who live
overseas, will return to Qufu to pay homage to the master during
the festival which is part of a national tourism program.

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Narrow Trade Gap With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Seoul's widening trade gap with Washington, if left uncurbed,
would seriously threaten the nation's current account balance this
year, said officials of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry, South Korea's exports to the
U.S. in the first seven months of this year declined 6.6 percent
to 12.1 billion from a year earlier, while imports fell only 2.6
percent to 18.7 billion, causing the trade gap to widen to 6.6
billion.
</P>
<P>
The deficit in two-way trade with Washington accounted for 67
percent of the country's total trade shortfall of 9.86 billion
U.S. dollars during the cited period.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the widening trade deficit to South
Korea's weak competitiveness of export goods against that of their
Japanese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, South Korean export interest in the U.S. market have
noticeably cooled off in recent years because of the dwindling
numbers of U.S. branches and their staff members dispatched by
South Korean trading companies, officials said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has asked the trading representatives to redouble
U.S. marketing efforts and to develop new export markets of
government procurement and electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
So, the ministry plans to collect information on U.S.
administration's purchasing plans and their buying agencies on
behalf of local exporters.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean trade officials will also call on their U.S.
counterparts to ensure greater accesses to the U.S. procurement
market for South Korean companies in view of rectifying the heavy
trade imbalance in favor of Washington, when they meet in an
inaugural meeting of South Korea-U.S. business cooperation
committee next month, according to the ministry.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's exports to the U.S. had risen by 10 percent
annually until mid-1980s, thanks to such favorable environmental
factors as low interest rates, weakening dollar against the yen
and low oil prices.
</P>
<P>
The export gains rate slowed to 4.5 percent on the annual
average between 1990 and 1995 before marking a yearly drop of 10.2
percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, imports from the U.S. has shown annual
increase of over 10 percent since the 1990s, widening the trade
deficit from 1 billion dollars in 1994 to 6.3 billion dollars in
1995 and to 11.6 billion dollars last year, which represented 56
percent of its total trade gap, the ministry figures indicated.

XINING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Heiquan Reservoir, the
largest water control project of northwest China's Qinghai
Province, has successfully blocked the Beichuan River, a tributary
of the Huangshui River.
</P>
<P>
The reservoir is located in the upper reaches of Beichuan River
in the Hui-Tu Autonomous County, Datong, Qinghai Province. The
multifunctional water control project will improve irrigation, the
urban water supply, flood control, power generation and
environmental protection in the county.
</P>
<P>
The project will require the construction of a reservoir dam
some 123.5 meters in height, spillways, water diversion tunnels
and tunnels for irrigation and power generation, as well as three
generator rooms and urban water supply facilities.
</P>
<P>
The water control project was approved by the State Council in
December of 1995. Construction commenced in September 1996 and the
project will be completed in four and a half years at a cost of
526 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Project Director Ma Yuanbiao said completion of the reservoir
will improve the use ratio of water resources in the Huangshui
River Valley, expand irrigation coverage and provide Xining, the
capital of Qinghai, with 135 million tons of water annually for
industrial and private use.

<HEADLINE> Industry Shows Uptrend Signs in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- India's industry is showing
signs of an upward trend in 1997-98 fiscal year(April 1,
1997-March 31,1998).
</P>
<P>
"It emerges from the study that the cyclical components of
certain leading indicators of industrial activities like non-food
bank credit, all-India financial institutions' approvals, primary
capital market activity and non-oil imports (in terms of U.S.
dollars) are showing a gradual upward movement on a month-to-month
basis," said the latest study released by Industrial Credit and
Investment Corporation of India (ICICI).
</P>
<P>
This coupled with a low level of interest rates signal a future
uptrend in industrial activities. A steeper growth is forecast in
total deposits and money supply in the coming months and it also
suggests that there will not be any constraints on the supply of
loanable funds to the industry. This would help revive industrial
performance. The study said that the industrial output would show
an uptrend from June, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Other factors which underpin the potential for improved
industrial performance during 1997-98 are a good agricultural crop
in 1996-97 and the prospects for another favorable one in 1997-98
providing stimulus to rural demand, corporate and intermediate
goods production during April-may this year, the study further
said.

DAR ES SALAAM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Another batch of
refugees, numbering 551, from the Democratic Republic of Congo
have left Tanzania's port of Kigoma for Congo's Uvira port on
Lake Tanganyika.
</P>
<P>
The refugees who had been lived in Lugufu and Nyarugushu camps
in Kigoma Region went home on Monday on a voluntary repatriation
operantion, according to a news dispatch from Kigoma.
</P>
<P>
About 12,000 Congolese refugees have already been registered
for voluntary repatriation and about 5,000 others are being
registered for the same purpose, said Osmand douglas, the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) Logistic Officer
in Kigoma sub-office, after the refugees left Kigoma.
</P>
<P>
Last Monday, about 600 Congolese refugees returned home from
Tanzania. Upon their arrival, Uvira district Commissioner Bashire
Kusebana told them to forget their refugee category and recognize
themselves as pure Congolese.
</P>
<P>
Congo (K) has called on its refugees hosted in Tanzania to
return home and join fellow citizens in re-building the nation.
</P>
<P>
Congolese Foreign Minister Bizima Karaha said in Dar es Salaam
on September 5, "We have made arrangements between the government
of Congo, Tanzania and the United Nations High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) for the refugees to be repatriated home on
voluntary basis."
</P>
<P>
He said, "We do not want antagonism. The country can only be
run by congolese and not anybody elso. So for those who fear that
the government will take them to task after returning home should
be rest assured that they will be safe."

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, an industrial
city in southwest China, has witnessed significant declines in
acid rain due to lower levels of sulfur dioxide in the air.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Chongqing Environmental Protection
Bureau show that levels of acid rain have dropped from 90 percent
to 60 percent of total rainfall, with the sulfur dioxide content
in the air falling to 0.28 milligrams per cubic meter, a drop of
30 percent as compared with that five years ago.
</P>
<P>
Experts attribute the phenomenon to the strict control of waste
gases discharged from factories, the use of clean fuel such as
coal gas, natural gas, and more rainfall during spring season.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing, a city known for its heavy fog, is often enveloped
in a dense "atmosphere cover."
</P>
<P>
Dust control projects were launched in densely populated areas
and other downtown district and the local government banned the
use of coal in the city's 4,000 restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has also installed additional sulfur removal
facilities in factories using coal and oil. Technical upgrades of
boilers in a number of factories have also reduced levels of
polluting gases
</P>
<P>
The city, one of China's four municipalities directly under the
Central Government, has been also amongst China's first group of 13
major cities reporting air quality levels.

<HEADLINE> Period Shortened for Thai Exporters to Hold Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai exporters have been
requested to shorten the period during which they can hold their
foreign exchange income from 180 days to 120 days.
</P>
<P>
Within 15 days, exporters must sell U.S. dollars to banks or
change the money and deposit it in non-resident baht accounts,
according to an announcement of the central bank of Thailand on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The steps are aimed at improving dollar supply, curbing
speculation on the foreign exchange market and easing the cash
shortage affecting some banks and finance companies, said Bank of
Thailand Governor Chayawat Wibulswasdi.
</P>
<P>
He said the measures would improve the demand and supply
balance in the market for dollars, adding that the 120-day limit
is appropriate for exporters as 70 percent of them are paid within
three weeks of shipment.
</P>
<P>
Depositors must show that they have obligations to meet within
90 days in order to deposit dollar income in non-resident
foreign-currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
Thai people who want to buy dollars for their overseas trips
will now be required to show their passports and travel tickets.
</P>
<P>
Chayawat said that since the baht's floatation on July 2, the
number of non-resident baht accounts has increased from 2,600 to
3,600, mostly for speculation on the strengthening dollar.
</P>
<P>
The baht recovered to about 36 against the U.S. dollar late
Monday, as compared with a record low of 38.4 last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The local currency has depreciated more than 40 percent since
its floatation on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates on the central bank's bond repurchase market
remained high at 24 percent on Monday as the central bank tried to
curb speculation on the strengthening dollar.

<HEADLINE> Dhaka Provides Loan for Crisis-Ridden Food Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh Bank, the central
bank, has decided to extend credit support to salvage the
country's crisis-ridden frozen food sector following the European
Union's ban on seafood from Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources said the bank is to provide 4 million taka
(about 90,000 U.S. dollars) to each of the entrepreneurs to
upgrade their processing units in keeping with EU standard
regulations.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed the ban on import of frozen foods from
Bangladesh on July 30 this year, alleging that they do not comply
with EU rules and regulations concerning quality control.
</P>
<P>
However, Bangladesh was given until the coming November to
improve its product quality.
</P>
<P>
Under the fresh loan program, some 160 million taka (about 3.6
million dollars) will be disbursed among 40 entrepreneurs to
renovate their units to meet the EU Hazard Analysis Critical
Central Point (HACCP) requirements.
</P>
<P>
Although loans amounting to 5.33 billion taka (about 121
million dollars) remain outstanding with various financial
institutions by the sector, the central bank decided to extend the
credit in view of the sector's contribution to the country's total
export performance.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh exported frozen foods worth 320.73 million dollars
in the 1996-97 fiscal year, accounting for 7 percent of the
country's total export earnings.

<HEADLINE> Tung Says Hong Kong's Political Structure Normal, Effective </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's political
structure is functioning "very normally and very effectively"
since China resumed the exercise of sovereignty over the region in
July, Tung Chee Hwa, chief executive of China's Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR), said here today.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who is on a four-day visit to the U.S., will
explain to the U.S. "why we are so confident as we go forward in
the months and years ahead." It is his first visit to the United
States since taking office in July.
</P>
<P>
"I'm also here to enhance the very strong economic and trade
relationship between Hong Kong and the United States," Tung said
at a dinner hosted by Chinese Ambassador to the U.S. Li Daoyu.
</P>
<P>
"Although my visit would be a very short one ... but I look
forward to a fruitful visit," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"Our economy continues to expand, the life style which we are
very accustomed to has been maintained," he told some 600 guests
at the Chinese Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Also speaking at the dinner, Li Daoyu said, "The past two
months and eight days have seen the HKSAR maintain social
stability and enhance economic vitality."
</P>
<P>
"This fully testifies that China's basic principles of 'one
country, two systems' ... work well in Hong Kong," Li added.
</P>
<P>
"This also shows forcefully that the government of HKSAR, under
the capable leadership of its first Chief Executive Mr. Tung Chee
Hwa, has achieved important success in administering Hong Kong,"
Li said.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Tung is expected to meet U.S. President Bill
Clinton, congressmen, businessmen and think-tank figures.
</P>
<P>
"We hope, during the visit, to explain to our friends in America
how Hong Kong can best serve America's business interests in
the months and years ahead," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive, who had spent his life in the U.S. for
nine and a half years, is expected to deliver a major address at
the U.S. Chamber of Commerce International Forum Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tung had a brief meeting with U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe
Talbott.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after the reception at the Chinese
Embassy, Tung said Albright, Talbott and himself had a "very
useful and constructive discussion."

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investors Confident in Sri Lanka's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A strong surge of foreign
investment in Sri Lanka in 1996 shows investors are confident in
the nation's economic environment, the latest statistics from the
Board of Investment (BOI) revealed.
</P>
<P>
The BOI has approved 345 projects valued at 457 billion rupees
(about 7.75 billion U.S. dollars) in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment components of these projects stood at 432
billion rupees (7.33 billion U.S. dollars), accounting for 95
percent of the total investment value, compared with local
investment of 25 billion rupees (425 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The massive rise in the value of total estimated investment
from 35 billion rupees (598 million dollars) in 1995 is attributed
to the sizable investment of three petroleum processing plants
approved last year.
</P>
<P>
The foreign investment components of these projects represented
a 238 percent rise over the previous year of 1995.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the BOI said investors who have established
manufacturing bases in Sri Lanka have demonstrated their
confidence in the country's economic environment by both expanding
and diversifying their operations.
</P>
<P>
He added that the overall performance of BOI enterprises in the
spheres of investment, export earnings and job creation underline
their contribution to the country's export-oriented industrial
strategy.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996 there were a total of 11,130 BOI approved
enterprises in commercial operation.
</P>
<P>
The value of annual export earnings grew from 6.4 billion
rupees (108 million dollars) in 1986 to 133 billion rupees (2.26
billion dollars) in 1996, accounting for 58 percent of Sri Lanka's
total export earnings for that year.
</P>
<P>
The number of workers employed in these projects has also risen
from 123,359 in 1990 to 271,179 in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Curb Expenses in Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- An all-party committee has
been formed to curb the lavish expenses within the Parliament,
Nepali Lower House Speaker Ram Chandra Poudel said.
</P>
<P>
In response to growing concerns over irregularities in the
Parliament, Poudel announced Monday in the Lower House that
meeting between party representatives are continuing to find out
ways and means to bring the expenses to a minimum, local press
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Former finance minister Ram Sharan Mahat claimed that the food
and beverage bills for the Prime Minister's Office within the
parliament premises reached 53,000 rupees (about 930 U.S.
dollars), while the Parliament has paid 5.8 million rupees (about
101,700 dollars) to its cafeteria for supplying products for
lawmakers attending various parliamentary meetings.
</P>
<P>
Mahat, a MP from the main opposition the Nepali Congress,
further alleged that 22 cabinet members of the present government
are taking dual benefits and salaries as ministers and MPs.
</P>
<P>
Besides, bottled drinking water is excessively used in the
Parliament, local press reports claimed.
</P>
<P>
Last month, some MPs were alleged of presenting false medical
and expense bills and extracting large sums from the Parliament
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Lower House Finance Committee had
directed the Parliament cafeteria to stop supplying bottled water
for the lawmakers to curb costs charged to the Parliament
Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
In the wake of heavy public criticism about what is widely
called as "pajero culture," the Communist Party of Nepal (United
Marxist-Leninist, CPN-UML) has decided to instruct its MPs not to
import any new vehicles under the privilege that exempts the
import duties, and return such vehicles to the government.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 percent MPs have imported expensive vehicles
duty-free, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
The former government led by Sher Bahadur Deuba gave such a
privilege to the MPs, which has come under heavy criticism from
the public.

<HEADLINE> Big Companies in Race for Order From Indian Airlines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Several big global companies
such as Allied Signal, Rockwell Collions and Airbus are in a race
in a stiff competition to bag the huge order of airborne collision
avoidance system (ACAS) from the Indian Airlines, highly placed
sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Airlines has over 50 aircraft and it's ACAS order
would be the biggest in the country. According to rough estimates,
it has to spend over 350 million rupees (9.86 million U.S.
dollars) for fitting it's entire fleet with ACAS equipment. For
installing both mode 's' transponder and ACAS, Indian Airlines
might have to spend 117.5 million rupees (3.31 million dollars)
per aircraft.
</P>
<P>
The France-based aircraft manufacturer Airbus Industrie has
also shown interest in the deal. This is in view of the fact that
40 aircraft in the Indian Airlines fleet are the products of the
Airbus Industrie. Airbus is reportedly felt to be in a better
position to do the necessary retrofitting since it knows the
a300/a320 design better than others.
</P>
<P>
It is known in many parts of the world that the Indian Airlines
Board has directed the company to go in for speedy installation of
ACAS or traffic alert and collision avoidance system (TCAS).

<HEADLINE> President Ramos, Cardinal to Meet on Charter Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel
Ramos and the influential Manila Archbishop Jaime Cardinal Sin
will meet again tonight at dinner on the burning issue of
constitutional change, the local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is a fresh effort to repair relations between the
president and the archbishop and thwart a September 21 protest
rally against charter change to be organized by the Roman Catholic
Church, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Tonight's dinner at the archbishop's residence will mark the
third meeting in the past few days between the president and
Cardinal Sin, since they exchanged potshots over the charter
change issue.
</P>
<P>
Also attending the meeting will be former President Corazon
Aquino, a strong opponent of the charter change, and several
cabinet members who are known charter change advocates.
</P>
<P>
Sin was quoted as saying the dinner meeting will be held behind
closed doors, with the high-profile "visitors" expected to have a
lively exchange of views.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear what items will be on the agenda of today's
dinner but Sin hinted that it will center on the issue of charter
change.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes after priests and other charter change
critics mounted the first day of their protracted protest noise
barrage last night.
</P>
<P>
Motorists and residents in parts of Manila honked their horns
and banged pots and pans while church bells were rung across the
capital city, as part of the run-up activities to the September
rally.
</P>
<P>
During their last two encounters early this month, Ramos
appealed to Sin to call off the planned protest rally but he was
rebuffed by the prelate.
</P>
<P>
With accusations and speculations mounting that Ramos kept his
options open for a second term, the president Monday assured the
nation in a broadcast statement yesterday that he will not seek to
scrap the 1998 polls and impose martial law.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, who must step down in June 1998 as provided for by the
constitution when his one single six-year term expires, also made
it clear that he is "against term extension."

<P>
LIMA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Vicunas are on the verge of
extinction due to uncontrolled illegal hunting in the southern
Andes zone of Peru.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Department of Arequipa said that in southern
Peru, local farmers have been asked to kill vicunas by furtive
hunters working for organized traders who traffick vicuna wool in
the black market.
</P>
<P>
President of the Nature Protection Organization, Mauricio de
Romana, said the situation had caused a 20 percent reduction of
vicunas in the zone.
</P>
<P>
A vicuna count carried out in 1994 by the Ministry of
Agriculture showed there were 2,079 vicunas in Arequipa, but now
about 400 have been killed to misuse their wool and skin.
</P>
<P>
Romana said the need to implement strict surveillance in the
areas to protect the animal was urgent.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Tibet Autonomous Region in
southwest China has made substantial progress in its tax reform
and as a result, its tax system is now on par with the nation's,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The changes have responded to the new economic situation in
Tibet, so as to reinforce the autonomous region's economic power
and its financial self-sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
The local tax income topped 380 million yuan in 1996, compared
with 140 million in 1992, with annual growth of over 20
percent. The figure is expected to further increase to 450 million
yuan this year.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Tibet's tax system was formed in the
1950s and 1960s, and was different from the national system.
</P>
<P>
Since the reforms began in 1993, a number of new taxable
categories were added and some outdated ones dropped.

<HEADLINE> Large Eastern Han Tomb Unearthed in Henan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Pottery figures, silver
rings, bronzeware, ancient coins and grain have been unearthed
from a large tomb dating back to the Eastern Han Dynasty (25-220)
in Puyang city in Central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The pottery, with red designs on black paint, were shaped like
animals, stoves and other utensils, seemingly a miniature
representation of the world in which the tomb's occupants lived.
</P>
<P>
Historical records have shown that people in the Eastern Han
Dynasty paid utmost attention to burial rites.
</P>
<P>
Chinese archaeologists say that the tomb, with a passageway
leading to six burial rooms, is the one of the most complex
Eastern Han tomb ever found in the city since 1979.
</P>
<P>
Experts believed that the find will contribute to the study of
art, agriculture, burial systems and living conditions of people
living in the area some 1,700 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Fossil Reserve To Trace Human Evolutionary History (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A huge fossil reserve dating
back 540 million years has been discovered in southwest China's
Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
and Chinese scientists say the
site will be turned into a research base for studying the earth's
early living organisms.
</P>
<P>
The fossil reserve is in Gedong village, Taijiang County, more
than 200 km from the provincial capital Guiyang. It was
discovered by researchers of the Industrial University of
Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
"The Taijiang fossil reserve contains more than 38 species and
sub-species of organisms. Most of them are worms," said Prof. Zhao
Yuanlong from the Industrial University of Guizhou.
</P>
<P>
Sixty meters above the Taijiang fossil reserve is the Kaili
fossil reserve, which was discovered in 1982, and covers more than
70 species of organisms, including Medusiform-fossils,
echinodelmas, and worms, Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
The Kaili reserve is the third-largest of its kind in the
world, only behind the two in Burgess, Canada, and Chengjiang,
in southwest China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
About 570 million years ago, at the beginning of the Cambrian
period, most multi-cell organisms made a sudden appearance on
earth.

<P>
Modern day scientists are studying the fossils to determine why
the organisms' evolution got a forceful momentum at the early
period of the Cambrian period, and also why living things on earth
developed so slowly during the first five-Sixth period of the
earth's history.
</P>
<P>
The fossil reserves of Chengjiang, Taijiang, and Kaili, which
all date back to the early Cambrian period will provide valuable
data for scientists researching the early evolutionary path of
living organisms on earth.
</P>
<P>
The Wengan fossil reserve, located in the Wengan County,
Guizhou Province, is another important site with similar research
value.
</P>
<P>
From the findings at the Wengan fossil reserve, Chinese
scientists have discovered that life on earth had sexual distinctions
as early as about 600 million years ago.
</P>
<P>
The fossil reserves discovered in Guizhou, together with those
in Yunnan, constitute the a most important research base in the
world for studies on the earth's primeval living things.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, scientists from a dozen of countries,
including Britain, Canada, Germany and the United States have made
research trips to these reserves.

<HEADLINE> Export of Chinese Furniture Grows Rapidly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- An increasing amount of
Chinese furniture is entering the international market.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the furniture has been exported to 25
countries and regions, earning 870 million US dollars of foreign
exchange annually.
</P>
<P>
Jia Qingwen, director of the Chinese Association of Furniture
Making, said monday during a press conference for the
International Furniture Exhibition to be held here, that Chinese
furniture has entered European and American markets in addition to
those in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
He added that the US has become China's biggest importer,
buying more than 500 million dollars worth of furniture every year.
</P>
<P>
Jia said that the Chinese furniture industry has a bright
future: it has entered a new period of development, he said, since
introducing a large number of technology and equipment from
overseas in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The country has nearly 30,000 furniture-making factories, with
an annual output value of more than 70 billion yuan (about 8.75
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
China has the world's largest furniture market. Authorities
estimate that the domestic demand for furniture will increase at
an annual rate of 10 percent in the next decade. In the rural
areas, the rate will reach 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
The four-day international furniture exhibition, starting from
September 10, is the country's largest of the kind. More than 400
renowned manufacturers from 18 countries and regions will take
part, sources say.

<HEADLINE> Baby Found with Translocated Internal Organs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Doctors at a military hospital
here have reported the case of a newborn girl whose internal
organs are on the reverse sides of her body cavity.
</P>
<P>
On September 2, doctors at the hospital in this capital of East
China's Shandong province examined a baby girl using color Doppler
ultrasonic equipment, and discovered that the baby's heart and
spleen were on the right side of her chest, and her liver,
gallbladder and pancreas were on the left.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say translocated internal organs are rare, and to have
all five main internal organs displaced is even more so.
</P>
<P>
They explain that the malformation occurs during the period in
which a fertilized egg is developing into an embryo, and the
baby's organs are undergoing a complicated rotation process to
reach their normal locations.
</P>
<P>
If the rotation is stopped for any reason, the displacement of
the developed organs occurs.
</P>
<P>
The military hospital has sent the girl to the local social
welfare house and decided to provide her with long-term health
care.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Rupiah Strengthens as Stock Prices Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's currency, the
rupiah, strengthened against the U.S. dollar Monday and stock
prices increased 1 percent following broad recovery in the region,
dealers and brokers here said today.
</P>
<P>
They said confidence had gradually returned to currency and
stock markets after a new reform package was announced last week.
</P>
<P>
Spot rupiah, which opened at 2,920/2,930 against the U.S.
dollar, weakened to the 2,960 level in morning trading but then
strengthened in the afternoon to close at 2,905/2,915.
</P>
<P>
The Jakarta Stock Exchange Composite Index, the main share
price gauge on the exchange, crossed the 600-point level to close
at 600.311 points, up 6.199 points from last Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
Stockbrokers said the rise in share prices over the past few
days was boosted by the government's reform package, especially
the interest rate cut and scrapping of the limit of 49 percent to
foreign portfolio ownership.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government on September 3 revealed a 10-point
plan that covered imports and exports, banking and capital
markets, taxes and budget spending cuts.
</P>
<P>
As a follow-up step, the central bank on September 4 cut its
benchmark Bank Indonesia Certificate (SBI) interest rates by 3
percent.
</P>
<P>
Since then, share prices on the stock exchange have risen more
than 20 percent and the rupiah remained stable.
</P>
<P>
Analysts held that the government should further decrease
interest rates and ease the tight monetary policy to push the
recovery of the capital market.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the currency crisis in Southeast Asian
countries, the rupiah has fallen nearly 23 percent since January
this year.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Agronomy has contributed
greatly to increased crop yields in China, an example of the
impact of scientific developments, according to the State Science
and Technology Commission.
</P>
<P>
Mianyang City in southwest China's Sichuan Province has become
the country's second largest electronics center after seven years
of work. Industrial output in the city increased 35 percent
annually, more than the average of relatively developed eastern
parts of China.
</P>
<P>
This is attributed to the use of science in economic
development, contributing about 45 percent of the city's economic
growth.
</P>
<P>
In Shanghai, China's leading industrial city, new materials,
optical fiber, micro-electronic products, and computer science
have attracted more than 50,000 scientists to the hi-tech
development field.
</P>
<P>
Scientists are also involved in communications, iron and steel
and automobiles. In the first six months of this year, the output
value of the six pillar industries accounted for over 50 percent
of the city's total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
The central government's policy is one of seeking sustainable
social and economic development by relying on science and
education, and of 30,000 science developments during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan period (1991-1995), 25,000 have been used in
industrial production.

The country's technology transfer contracts were worth 30
billion yuan (3.65 billion US dollars) in the past few years. And
although the market economy has solved quite a number problems,
key science discoveries in agriculture, energy, communications,
space, and other hi-tech fields are important to the government.
</P>
<P>
China has a nine-year compulsory education program that cost
over 10 billion yuan in government funds. It is in place in half
of China, and from 1990 to 1996, about four million people learned
to read and write each year, and 440 million adults received
further training.
</P>
<P>
To rejuvenate the country with science and technology,
personnel and investment are the two most important things. So, to
attract Chinese experts and scholars from abroad, a number of
hi-tech ventures like the Founders' Group and Legend have
established research centers abroad and some preferential
conditions have been developed.
</P>
<P>
In June of this year, the Qinghua Higher Research Center was

<P>
STOCKHOLM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Norway recently discovered a
large natural gas reserve of 300 billion cubic meters in the
Norwegian Sea, which would be the second largest gas field in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The gas field, called Orm en Lange, lies under
1,000-meter-deep waters in the central part of the Norwegian
Sea. The Norwegian government and several oil-tapping companies
will jointly extract the gas.
</P>
<P>
Before the discovery of the Orm en Lange gas field, Norway had
announced the discovery of a smaller natural gas reserve in the
Norwegian Sea in January.
</P>
<P>
The already-discovered largest gas field in Norway is Troll,
with the reserves of 1.3 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
So far, the total gas reserves discovered by Norway in the
North Sea, the Norwegian Sea and the continental shelf of the
Barents Sea stand at 3.3 trillion cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
Norway exported 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas to other
European countries in 1996. The export in 2000 is estimated at 70
billion cubic meters.

VIENNA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Heizn Fischer, president of the
National Council of Austria, said here today that the reform and
opening-up policy initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng
Xiaoping has led the country to the right direction of development.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said that he believed the forthcoming 15th Congress of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) will reaffirm the policy and
decide to continue its implementation.
</P>
<P>
The policy is not only contributing to China's rapid economic
development but is also conducive to safeguarding world peace, he
said in an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Fischer has visited China several times since 1974. Leading a
Austrian parliamentary delegation, Fischer paid his latest visit
in April this year and held talks with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Recalling his talks with Jiang, Fischer said that the CPC
Congress was one of the topics in their talks.

"In my personal view, it will be an important party congress
at which China's reform and opening-up policy will be reaffirmed
and continue to be implemented," he said.
</P>
<P>
"After the Congress, China will continue to march on the
charted path toward the future with full confidence," he said.

for a positive development in the next century," he said, adding
that the people's living standards will be further improved.
</P>

MOSCOW, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister
Yevgeny Primakov met today with his French counterpart, Hubert
Vedrine, and the two discussed bilateral relations, Bosnia and the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said there are no major differences between the two
countries affecting their ties as they share the same views on
many international issues.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine arrived here Sunday for a two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the Bosnian situation, the Russian foreign minister
said Moscow does not agree with carrying out the Dayton peace
accord by eliminating or splitting the Bosnian Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
Both sides expressed hope that all sides involved contribute to
the success of the coming local elections scheduled for this month
in the Serb Republic.
</P>
<P>
On Middle East, Primakov said his country will support any
position promoting the peace process put forward by any country.
</P>
<P>
Primakov said Russia is strongly against any form of terrorism,
but opposes the view that the peace process can only be started
when terrorism is rooted out.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said France hopes the United States, Germany, Russia,
the European Union and other countries will join in efforts for a
political resolution of the Middle East issue.
</P>
<P>
The two also exchanged views on preparations for French

NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

<HEADLINE> Ukrainian Models Staggering on Catwalk of Market Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Too many Ukrainian models vying
for limited catwalks have made themselves unbelievably cheap. A
beautiful girl rarely earns more than 150 U.S. dollars a month and
an average one often has to wait three to four months between jobs.
</P>
<P>
Many girls do not even get the chance to participate in mass
shows during their modeling careers, explains Halyna Logvinova,
manager of L-Models agency.
</P>
<P>
"People entering the profession here aren't doing it for money
but for popularity and image," he said.
</P>
<P>
By the beginning of this year, nearly 20 modeling agencies had
sprung up in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev, which is the national
hub of the popular industry, since the country gained independence
in 1991. An agency normally has a stable of 20-30 models, but
keeps another 80-200 young women on file.
</P>
<P>
Every agency has a school of its own. While more than 600 girls
graduate from these schools a year, only 20 fashion shows are held
annually in Kiev each requiring only 10 models.
</P>
<P>
The industry is suffering from over supply and inadequate
demand. The models who participated in the Lapidus collection show
earlier this year received only 10-20 hryvnas (5.5 to 11 dollars)
each.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine's economic problems have a direct impact on the
modeling industry. Large western companies enter the Ukrainian
market with their own ready-made photos and videos. They seldom
require the services of local models.
</P>
<P>
Ukrainian companies, on the other hand, either have no money
for advertising or are doing well in the shadow sector that
requires no advertising.
</P>
<P>
In order to survive, modeling agencies have expanded their
services. Models have to acquire general abilities, such as
working at exhibition booths, promoting merchandise at company
presentations and even dancing at nightclubs.
</P>
<P>
The best pay usually comes from working at trade shows and
exhibitions, where large numbers of girls are needed and clients
are not as demanding. The average rate for this type of work is
100 dollars for five days.
</P>
<P>
Currently, modeling agencies earn most of their profits from
running schools. Kiev schools charge 130 dollars on average for a
six-week modeling course. Groups of 15-20 girls are trained at a
time, though only about three of the hopefuls have any real chance
to get a job.
</P>
<P>
Professional models receive about five dollars an hour to teach
a variety of subjects such as photography, make-up, posture,
walking and etiquette.
</P>
<P>
Another source of income is exporting models for either
permanent or long-term assignments. Slavic fashion models are
becoming popular in the West, but this business often
backfires.
</P>
<P>
Once a girl gets a foothold in a host country, she often casts
the Ukrainian company behind her back.
</P>
<P>
"We seem to be a victim of the beauties who are working
abroad," complains Iryna Pavlova, director of the Dinamo Star
Agency. The agency regularly exports two girls to western
countries a year.
</P>
<P>
Pavlova predicts that the Ukrainian modeling industry will not
have a real chance to take off unless the country's overall
economic conditions improve.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Sees Rising Labor Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand saw 10,881 labor
dispute cases during the first eight months of this year, a record
over the past 17 years, the Thai Central Labor Court said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the cases brought to the court were related to laid-off
workers' demand for compensation from their employers who closed
their businesses due to the economic slump, and suits by financial
institutions against their employees for granting excessive loans
to clients, the court said.
</P>
<P>
The cases brought to the court during the eight months involved
a total of 2.48 billion baht (about 70 million U.S. dollars),
according to the court.
</P>
<P>
The court also said it received 10,327 cases during the same
period of last year.

<P>
CANBERRA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Australian newspapers published today:
</P>
<P>
The Australian:
</P>
<P>
-- The right of about 500,000 British subjects to have a say in
whether Australia becomes a republic faces a challenge in the High
Court. Preparations for the challenge were revealed yesterday as
Prime Minister John Howard's government said it was impossible to
exclude the British subjects from the vote for next year's
constitutional convention.
</P>
<P>
The Sydney Morning Herald
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Howard yesterday criticized "faddish"
educational theories after a new study revealed that nearly half
of all Australians aged 15 to 74, or 6.2 million people, have poor
or very poor literacy skills.
</P>
<P>
The Age
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Howard yesterday defended the British royal
family after criticism of their reaction to Princess Diana's
death, adding the family had been put in a difficult situation and
the public was always likely to be disappointed.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Financial Review
</P>
<P>
-- Daiwa Securities, the Japanese stockbroker chosen by the
Australian federal government to lead-manage the float of 7.3
billion U.S. dollar Telstra shares in Asia is in danger of being
banned from selling shares in Japan because of its involvement in
a corruption scandal. Australia plans to sell 7.3 billion U.S.
dollar shares of Australia's telecommunications giant, Telstra, or
one-third of the total, and retain the remaining two-thirds.

<HEADLINE> Crew to Restart Mir Computer After Repair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The crew of Russia's Mir space
station will try to restart the main computer on board today,
ground control said.
</P>
<P>
The computer failed Monday, hitting energy supplies aboard the
craft, but the crew fixed a faulty part in the computer, a
spokesman with Mission Control said.
</P>
<P>
They were likely to try to restart the computer after a radio
exchange with ground control at around 0500 GMT.
</P>
<P>
Mir collided with a cargo ship on June 25. Since then,
cosmonauts have had to handle one trouble after another on the
11-year-old station.
</P>
<P>
In July, one of the crew unplugged the main computer by
mistake, sending Mir spinning uncontrolled for about a day. In
August, a computer section crashed during a re-docking operation
with similar results.

<HEADLINE> German Soccer Players Share Victory With Egyptian Orphans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Children at an Egyptian
orphanage had a special treat today when they caressed gifts and
shared laughter with teenage footballers from Germany.
</P>
<P>
In a move to bolster the flagging sportsmanship, the German
Under-17 national delegation took a day off to visit the SOS
Children's Village in Nasr City near Cairo.
</P>
<P>
An hour-and-half visit culminated in a lighthearted soccer
match in the village playground between the children and the
German players.
</P>
<P>
The children were overwhelmed with joy as the match resulted in
a shock 2-0 "victory" for the disadvantaged Egyptian children.
</P>
<P>
German coach Bernad Stober said that his boys would do better
against the real Egyptian team in their final group A match in
Cairo on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The German team, which has beaten Chile and Thailand in group
matches, has become the first of 16 teams to take a quarter-final
berth.
</P>
<P>
The Germans' visit followed a similar one by the Austrian
delegation to a SOS Children's Village near the Mediterranean port
of Alexandria last week.
</P>
<P>
Both visits were arranged within the framework of a project
called FIFA For SOS Children's Villages, by which the world soccer
ruling body and the football family give help to SOS villages in
128 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The German players and officials clearly enjoyed the visit to
the village as much as the children, who sang and danced for the
visitors and showed them around two of the houses where they live
with their adopted families.
</P>
<P>
The young players gave the children German T-shirts and
pennants while FIFA Director of Communications, Keith Cooper,
distributed gifts including sports shoes, sportswear, footballs
and bags.
</P>
<P>
In its latest move to rekindle the declining spirit of
sportsmanship, FIFA has designated September 20-21 as the first
World Fair Play Days.
</P>
<P>
The second of the Fair Play Days will coincide with the final
match of the 7th FIFA Under-17 World Championship planned for
Egypt on September 4-21.
</P>
<P>
Cooper told Xinhua that FIFA's nearly 200 member associations
will stage a variety of activities to attract attention on fair
play during the two days of September, the busiest month for the
sport all over the world.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, "fair play team" from the Under-17 Worlds will
receive a 10,000-Swiss-Franc award and can donate it to Egypt's
SOS Children's Villages, FIFA-funded program established in
Austria 15 years ago, Cooper said.
</P>
<P>
Cooper criticized a rising tendency among professional players
to seek fame and fortune while neglecting moral integrity.
</P>
<P>
"Teams now prefer to win cups and medals and consider fair play
only secondary. It is more difficult to encourage media to
support the principle of fair play," he said.

<HEADLINE> German Spikers Beat Russians in Group Preliminaries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A timely yellow booking and
scores of solid blocking paid Germany fabulous dividend as it got
the better of Russia in a group preliminary match at the European
men's volleyball championship on Monday.
</P>
<P>
It took the Germans more than three hours to win a five-set
thriller from the Russians who created a major upset on Sunday by
blanking world league titlists Italy in the group A actions at
Bois-le-Duc.
</P>
<P>
With two sets in hand, the Germans seemed to become another
team by dropping the ensuing two sets.
</P>
<P>
With the Russians leading 10-6 in the tie-breaking fifth set,
the Germans finally found their form again and blocked the Russian
smashes only to turn the table around at last, winning their
third-round outing 15-9, 15-10, 6-15, 4-15, 16-14.
</P>
<P>
A yellow-card booking from the chair umpire awarded the Germans
a critical point after a 14-all tie with serving rights in hand
while a super one-man block returned the ball onto the right side
of the sideline at back court for the match winner.
</P>
<P>
The Russians also got a free point from a booking on the part
of the Germans earlier in the match.
</P>
<P>
In the day's other matches, Italy defeated Slovakia three sets
to one in group A while France blanked Bulgaria 3-0 and Ukraine
whitewashed Finland, both in group B at Eindhoven.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Secretary of State Jane Dee
Hull has been sworn in as the new governor of Arizona of the
United States less than a week after former Governor Fife
Symington was convicted of seven federal fraud charges.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was on hand to
administer the oath, The United Press International reported.
</P>
<P>
Hull was elected to the state House of Representatives in 1979
and became the first woman speaker of the House 10 years later.
</P>
<P>
Hull became governor after Symington's resignation took effect
last Friday following his conviction on six felony counts of
providing false personal financial statements to lenders to get
loans and financing for his real estate projects, and one count of
wire fraud in connection with a series of pension funds.
</P>
<P>
Symington's felony convictions required his ouster from office,
though he could have remained in office until he is sentenced on
November 10. Symington could face prison time and hefty fines.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Canada Post and
its largest union broke down today, setting the stage for a
possible strike in the near future.
</P>
<P>
Canada Post said it had been prepared to make a new offer
today, but the union decided to pull out of the process.
</P>
<P>
"This is unacceptable behavior," Canada Post said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
The 45,000-member union said it walked away from today's talks
after seeing no signing of a good offer from the Crown
corporation.
</P>
<P>
The union now is free to apply to Canada's federal minister of
labour for a legal mandate to strike.
</P>
<P>
If taking such a step, the union would be in a strike position
by the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
The talks between Canada Post and the Union started in April.
The two sides have been unable to strike a deal due to job
security and wages differences.
</P>
<P>
Canada Post is a major postal service in Canada, delivering
about 11 billion pieces of mail every year.

Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien, TMC President Hiroshi
Okuda and other dignitaries attended the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"This investment underlines our commitment to Canada, its
economy and the people of this community," Okuda said.
</P>
<P>
"If the expanded facility is as successful as the original
investment, we will be very pleased," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Cambridge expansion, along with other Toyota investments
across North America, is part of Toyota's long-term commitment to
transfer manufacturing capacity to the location of sales.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, Toyota's North America production capacity will grow
to over one million vehicles from 700,000 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
When the full project is complete in 1998, Toyota's total
investment in its Cambridge operations will reach 2.2 billion
Canadian dollars (1.6 billion USD), TMC said.

The AFV, converting oil to natural gas, propane, ethanol and
methanol, has attracted many more new users from local
governments, utilities and companies motivated to be "greener",
the company said in a press release from its headquarters in
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
Ford, boasting of capturing 95 percent of AFV market share in
the United States, said it will continue to produce the industry's

<HEADLINE> Anti-Nuclear Groups Call for Delay for Cassini Launch </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Anti-nuclear activists and
some scientists, engineers and public health officials today urged
U.S. President Bill Clinton to delay the launch of NASA's
plutonium-powered Cassini probe to Saturn.
</P>
<P>
They pointed out that the 33 kilograms of plutonium that
Cassini is to carry could pose a potentially lethal risk to humans
if the spacecraft blows up or re-enters Earth's atmosphere after
launch.
</P>
<P>
At a news conference with other Cassini opponents, physicist
Michio Kaku of the City University of New York said that NASA
estimated that Cassini plutonium leak could possibly lead to 2,300
cancers, but it did not take into account winds that could blow
radioactive plutonium over a wide area, increasing the cancer risk
for a much larger group of people.
</P>
<P>
Cassini is scheduled to blast off from Cape Canaveral October 6
but is likely to be delayed by a launch-pad slip-up that damaged
part of the spacecraft in August.
</P>
<P>
It was scheduled to fly by Venus twice, then fly by Earth and
Jupiter before arriving at Saturn in July 2004 for a four-year
study of the ringed planet.
</P>
<P>
The craft will be taken aloft by a Titan IV rocket, which NASA
acknowledged has a historical failure rate of one in 20. However,
NASA said the chances of a Titan IV launch accident releasing
plutonium were about one in 1,400.
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear group urged Clinton to postpone Cassini and to
authorize a new design for the mission so that it could use a new
solar power source developed by the European Space Agency.
</P>
<P>
Joining the Cassini opponents were also Alan Kohn, a retired
NASA official who handled emergency preparedness for staff at
Kennedy Space Center for two previous space missions carrying
plutonium power packs.
</P>
<P>
"Please help us to stop this criminal insanity, or else figure
out how we can provide permanent fallout shelters for all living
beings on the planet," Kohn said in a statement at the new
conference.
</P>
<P>
However, NASA said in a statement that the plutonium used to
power the craft is a heat-resistant ceramic form of plutonium
dioxide, which reduces the chance of it vaporizing either in a
fire or in the event it re-entered the Earth's atmosphere.

<HEADLINE> US Consumer Credit Increases 6.4 Percent in July </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Consumer debt outstanding
in the U.S. grew at a 6.4 percent annual rate to a seasonally
adjusted 1.225 trillion dollars in July, the U.S. Federal Reserve
(Fed) reported today.
</P>
<P>
That was the biggest advance since April and well above the
slow increases at rates of 0.8 percent in June and 2.7 percent in
May.
</P>
<P>
The report showed that American consumers resumed borrowing in
July, tapping their credit cards and securing auto loans after
taking a rest in the Spring and early Summer.
</P>
<P>
Much of the July credit advance came in the revolving loan
category, which is mostly credit cards. It rose at a 12.5 percent
annual rate to a seasonally adjusted 521.9 billion dollars, the
fastest pace in five months.
</P>
<P>
Auto loans outstanding were up at a 10.9 percent rate to 398.9
billion dollars after increasing at a 5.6 percent rate in June,
the speediest in three months.
</P>
<P>
However, other kinds of consumer debt shrank at a 9.7 percent
annual rate to 304.3 billion dollars after contracting at a 9.8
percent rate in June. This category includes loans for mobile
homes, education, boats and vacations.
</P>
<P>
The report doesn't include home mortgages or home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the gain of consumer debt is a sign that
U.S. economy will accelerate in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
Economists also have nervously watched consumer credit levels
as increasing numbers of Americans -- more than a million a year
-- declare bankruptcy.

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Arrests of Militants "Positive Step" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- the United States on Monday
called the arrest of 35 suspected militants by the Palestinian
Authority "a positive step" on the eve of Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright's visit to the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We think any step in the direction of an active, relentless
effort to dismantle the security infrastructure (of the militant
groups) in the territories under the Palestinian Authority control
is a positive step in the right direction," State Department
spokesman James Foley said.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday pledged to fight
terrorism and his security forces arrested 35 suspected militants
after last week's triple suicide bombing at a Jerusalem market,
killing 7 people and injuring more than 150.
</P>
<P>
Albright will start her trip to the Middle East on Tuesday
with an attempt to revive the peace process in the region, which
has in effect gone nowhere since March when Israel decided to
build Jewish housing units in Arab East Jerusalem.

<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- One prison guard was killed and
another shocked when a prison van was ambushed in Canada's second
largest city of Montreal today.
</P>
<P>
Two men ambushed the van and fired several shots through its
windshield at a railway crossing, reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The guards' vehicle was heading to pick up prisoners at a
detention centre when the ambush happened.
</P>
<P>
There were no prisoners in the vehicle at the time, police
said.
</P>
<P>
The suspects fled in a stolen van, which they later set on
fire. Two weapons were found in the burned-out hulk.
</P>
<P>
Police said the act might be the work of local biker gangs.
</P>
<P>
The attack could be an attempt to intimidate authorities who
have tried recently to crack down on the gangs, police said.
</P>
<P>
Today's attack is the second on prison guards in the past three
months. One woman guard was shot and killed in her car in June.

<HEADLINE> U.S.,DPRK Officials to Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The State Department
announced on Monday that negotiators from the United States and
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) will meet on
Wednesday in Beijing to discuss the future of four-party peace
talks on the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Foley told reporters that
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Charles Kartman, who will fly
to Beijing on Tuesday, will hold talks there with DPRK Vice
Foreign Minister Kim Gye-gwan.
</P>
<P>
Tension have risen between the United States and DPRK since
Washington announced to give asylum to defected DPRK Ambassador
Chang Sung-Gil and his brother Chang Sung-ho, also a diplomat,
last month.
</P>
<P>
Pyongyang has ever since suspended talks with Washington on
missile sales. And questions on possibility of the four-party
peace talks have also been raised because of the U.S. move of
granting the asylum.
</P>
<P>
Foley,however, said he saw "no indication of any change of
plans" on the DPRK part in relation to the four-party talks and
said Washington hopes Pyongyang will be present when the
four-party talks resume in a week or so.
</P>
<P>
The four-party talks include the Democratic People's Republic
of Korea, South Korea, the United States and China. The four
nations held the first preparatory session in New York last month
and agreed then to reconvene on September 15 to pursue a mutually
agreeable agenda for substantive negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Canada's Real Estate in Solid Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian commercial real
estate is in a solid recovery this year thanks to an improving
economy.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, vacancy rates are falling and rents are
rising, even in the long-suffering Toronto market, a report said
today.
</P>
<P>
Three factors are behind the resurrection -- a pickup in
economic activity that has increased demand for office, retail and
industrial space; a lack of new construction and low interest
rates.
</P>
<P>
"To say we're experiencing a boom now would be a big
stretch...What we are experiencing now is a very solid recovery,"
said a real estate analyst.
</P>
<P>
The vacancy rate in downtown Toronto was down to 11 percent at
midyear from 13 percent at the end of 1996 and 18 percent a few
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Vancouver's downtown vacancy rate is the country's lowest at
five percent, with Calgary next at 7.3 percent, according real
estate brokerage Royal Lepage Ltd.
</P>
<P>
"If the current idyllic conditions continue, then I see a
considerable additional upside," the analyst added.

<HEADLINE> SADC Summit Ends Keynoting Closer Ties for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BLANTYRE (MALAWI), September 8 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) ended their one-day
summit meeting here today, with an eye for tighter ties among the
member countries for a final integration.
</P>
<P>
A communique issued at the end of the summit said that the
SADC summit has passed protocols in mining, education and
training, which called for joint efforts in tapping the huge
potential in the fields.
</P>
<P>
The development of the human resources was regarded by leaders
at the summit as a key for future development.
</P>
<P>
The summit discussed, among other issues, the gender equality
and the raising of the productivity in the region.
</P>
<P>
Gender equality is said by Nelson Mandela, SADC Chairman and
President of South Africa, as part of their efforts for full
democracy and development.
</P>
<P>
The sub-regional leaders agreed that they should ensure that
appropriate institutional mechanism is put in place to stir the
region for future prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the work to further consolidate their already
achieved democracy and good governance, as claimed by Bakili
Muluzi, President of Malawi, countries of the group need to
improve their science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The development of infrastructure and access to markets were
also urged as critical by the Malawian leader.
</P>
<P>
The group should join hands to put an end to being used as a
testing ground for economic or social experiment which originate
from rich but distant countries, Muluzi said at the summit.
</P>
<P>
SADC also needs "genuine outside partners", Muluzi said,
adding that members of the group should realize that the burden
of whatever they seek to achieve, falls squarely on their own
shoulders.
</P>
<P>
Economic success of SADC countries, the host country leader
said, depends on the meaningful cooperation and integration and
their total solidarity.
</P>
<P>
The summit also stressed political stability and peace in the
region and other parts of African continent.
</P>
<P>
SADC leaders said in the communique after the meeting that
security situation in the Great Lakes region, particularly in
Burundi, is still worrying, noting that efforts should be
encouraged to bring the military authorities to the political
negotiation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The regional group which decided to take Congo (K) and
Seychelles as its new members to add to its 12 members at this
summit will hold its next summit in Mauritius next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Drops Charges against Saudi Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
on Monday dropped criminal charges against a Saudi suspect who was
said to have been linked to the 1996 Khobar Tower truck bombing in
Saudi Arabia, killing 19 American servicemen.
</P>
<P>
Hani al-Sayegh, was brought to the United States from Canada
earlier this year under an agreement in which he would plead
guilty to lesser charges of plotting an aborted anti-American
attack in the Middle East, and help U.S. investigators make a
probe into the truck bombing.
</P>
<P>
In turn, he would not be extradited to Saudi Arabia, his home
country.
</P>
<P>
But al-Sayegh has not provide the requisite evidence, and the
Justice Department said "it is necessary that this prosecution be
withdrawn."The Justice Department said Saudi authorities have
advised the United States that they plan to seek al-Sayegh's
extradition in connection with the Khobar Towers truck bombing.
</P>
<P>
If Saudi autorities meet the requirements for extradition, then
"the United States would respond appropriatedly" to the request,
the Justice Department said, adding that it would pursue
immigration proceedings to remove al-Sayegh from the country.
